<li>Delete: Wikipedia is not GameFAQs (again), and it is not a place for how-to guides (explicitly). The merge/redirect is the only hope of preserving the content whatsoever, and I'm against that for the very reasons cited by the "keep" voters: our articles are not how-to, either, and merging a how-to section to an existing article is a way of confusing the new users, who will see that and think that it's a great idea to write articles with how to achieve cheat codes, etc. That's not encyclopedic and not Wikipedian. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:53, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Please, folks, offer a rationale for your votes and not acronymns. In this case, the musician is not famous/notable for anything except his work with the band; therefore, there should be no article on him until he, as a person, is a name mentioned as often as his band's.

<li>Comment: &#160;:-) Sure. I don't have a problem with a referential "vote," so long as the reference is clear, but I can understand the frustration some people feel with "nn nor" in a nomination or virtually bare nominations and "per nom" in the rationale. Although I vote "delete" most of the time (because most nominated articles deserve to be here), I do think of the new users who need to find out what's happening to their work. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:42, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Seems to be swinging to "Delete", which I don't have much problem with. I note with amusement though, that every page about some minor fictional character in any obscure video game made that appeals to 12 year olds is kept while a technologist, organizer and presenter is deleted.

<li>If enough people are willing to support the endeavor, I'll go find them and start putting them up for deletion. It just seemed like it would be a very uphill battle. Also, technologist, organizer, and presenter is a set of terms that could be used to describe tens of thousands of people (for example, many graduate students, professors, postdocs, etc)&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanet13_ca5f.html" title="User:Janet13">Janet13</a> 00:27, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hu, I share your apparent puzzlement. If Janet13 wants to start nominating gamecruft, I will be right in there voting delete. As far as I'm concerned the encyclopaedic content of most of these games is that they are a game played on $console, released in $year and selling $sales copies. Ditto most fiction articles. But I am well aware that this is against if not consensus then at least trend, which appears to be creeping trivialism. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:29, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> It‚Äôs a shame that a number of good Wikipedia editors have to waste their time on nonsense like this.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's interesting but not suprising that you chose to simply write this off as vanity and a, "puppetfest", rather then actually stating some valid issues with the entry. I'm actually suprised this wasn't accused of a, "puppetfest", sooner but you can't ignore some of the points being made about the entry, and the pointing out that some of the the comments against the entry weren't made, "in good faith". Policies are in place for a reason and this should be taken seriously.Ognit Ice 18:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC) <small>No edits from this user prior to <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a> 2005</small></li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Growing up as a poor Jewish child in downtown Philadelphia, I hope that this entry is not deleted. This entry has made me come to realize that the Mike Lorek Fan Club is probably one of the best and most noteworthy clubs in The United States. I feel it should stay on here to help other people discover this wonderful organization that tries to help so many underprivileged Jewish children. <small><small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.166.172.57 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.166.172.57_ff6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.166.172.57">contribs</a>).</small></small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> What kind of hypocrite would come on here and say someone has too much time on there hands for creating an article when there on here criticizing it? It's ludicrous to say that someone has a limited social life when 1)You don't know them and 2)Your ONLINE bashing someone. Take a look in the mirror before you criticize someone. Does it make you feel better about yourself for bashing a legitimate organization that has its own .com and domain name? This organization has built a strong reputation over the years and has been nothing but benficial to its community. If you think it makes you some kind of a hero to come on here and try and clean up what you deem crap, it doesn't. If you want to "clean up" the internet, theres plenty of pointless weblogs and pornography sites you can waste your time picking on. To quote Bob Dylan, "don‚Äôt criticize what you can‚Äôt understand." This page does not break any of the rules, and atleast there not hypocritically criticizing people for using, "The Free Encyclopedia that anyone can edit".<a href="mailto:IcePro88@yahoo.com" class="external text" title="mailto:IcePro88@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">IcePro88</a> <small><small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.255.30.84 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.255.30.84_7444.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.255.30.84">contribs</a>).</small></small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> I suppose I should take time out of my busy social life to support a fine local establishment that is under the unfair criticism of some misinformed blokes that should do a little research before they start casting judgments. This local establishment has helped our community time and again. For instance, they hold an annual car show that is always entertaining and brings the community together. Who cares if they decide to poke fun at their mascot's bizarre talents and have a little humour to lighten things up? They're a great bunch of guys who are a local asset and if that's not "notable" enough to be part of this database, I don't know what is... maybe whoever reviews this stuff should concentrate on some of the more questionable entries and let this genuine cause alone?<a href="mailto:chrsmitty@yahoo.com" class="external text" title="mailto:chrsmitty@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">ChrisMyth</a>--207.255.30.84 03:54, 30 November 2005 (UTC) <small>Second vote from this IP address.</small></p>

<b>Keep</b> To know that such a great organization is under fire like this really shows me what this world is coming to. We allow pornography on the internet but the Mike Lorek Fan Club should be banned from all knowledge databases? This is a sad and shameful thing to see. I personally know that the Mike Lorek Fan Club takes care of those around them and tries to bring POSITIVE influences to the area with annual car shows in Sidman, PA, participating in annual events such as the Easter Seals Softball Tournament held in Roxbury, and assisting in the Le Dance Academy's Yearly performance in Windber, PA. They support the local Forest Hills football team by making an appearance at the community Pep Rally and going to the games. They support the local diners with their weekly "Wing Nite" night held all over the area. How could anyone wish for such an organization to be removed from recognition on Wikipedia? This organization is a breath of fresh air to the community, local- and internet-wise and anyone who wants to see this database removed obviously prefers gloom and downtroddenness over positive and upbeat knowledge and activities!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why are you people always trying to take away the freedom of speech in this country and the freedom of assembly? The MLFC is a perfectly legitimate organization determined to place emphasis on our fundamental freedoms while not subjecting anyone to forms of degradation nor using any forms of elicit discrimination. The group is a highly respectable organization in the community of Johnstown, and it is determined to florish and help create a utopian society. Without groups like the MLFC, our society will reach a cataclysmic low in morale and become socially impotent. Would you like to cause the demise of society? If so, then vote yes to delete this.

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't understand what all the fuss is about? It sounds like this fanclub is a legimitate regional organization working towards a positive goal. I also believe that the process of deletion is being handeled innappropatly. The policy of vanity articles states:</p>
<p><i>The user who created the article is most often a new, or newer user. If there is nothing particularly offensive about the page, please be kind to the newbie. Suggestion: before beginning any deletion procedures on a vanity article, it is sometimes found that by simply politely informing the creator of the article that this appears to be a vanity article, and by pointing him or her to this page first, that the author him or her self will sometimes easily agree to the deletion him or herself, thus saving much waste of time and energy on the parts of all concerned parties.During any debates regarding vanity article that are listed at articles for deletion, disparaging comments may fly about the subject of the article/author (often presumed to be the same person) and the author's motives. These may border on personal attacks, and may discourage the article's creator from future contributions. Remember to please always assume good faith.</i></p>
<p><i>Usually, vanity articles are not recreated after being deleted. It is believed that the majority of vanity article creators forget about their vanity articles and do not revisit at all; this is evident in that they rarely defend the article during the deletion debate.</i></p>
<p>All I found were imflamatory comments directed at the members of this orginization and critizing their personal lives. I strongly believe that these comments cannot simply be taken "in good faith." This organization has a legitimate reason to be on the wikipedia. Don't judge them by your own standards. --128.118.51.117 16:03, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> As the Vice-President of the Mike Lorek Fan Club (MLFC), I am sickened that people want to take the MLFC out of Wikipedia. Obviously, we are in the end times. The people of this world that want to take away the good (MLFC) and relish in darkness are trying to get their way. The MLFC has been not only a spark of light in the Johnstown, PA community, but it has been a true inferno. We are like Bat Man, we help out when you least expect it. We don't need thank you's or cash donations---we just like to see people smile. If we were able to put a smile on one Jewish kid's face, then I know that we've done our job! We don't discriminate against any gender, race or creed----we are out to help the people of this great world. We have raised money to help people find homes, jobs, food and clothing by the money that we raised w/ the softball tournament that we were in over the summer of 2005. We are not a bunch of immature people that are out to have a good time. We are a UNIT that is out to make the world smile, one face at a time. ---Harrison vote <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 136.183.156.248 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_136.183.156.248_0ac6.html" title="Special:Contributions/136.183.156.248">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This article has bugged me for a long time. A lot of it's so called clich√©s only appear in one TV show, movie etc. and are very badly worded. Whilst cleanup seems like an easier way to approach it, I only see the list continuing to be unruly, so I recommend its <b>deletion</b>.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneyboo_eb5f.html" title="User:Barneyboo">Barneyboo</a> 04:20, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rewrite</b>. Although this walks a fine line between POV and original research, I don't think this article is unsaveable. But it needs considerable work.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - What I meant by it being unruly, though, is that even with cleanup, it's fundamental flaws will still be there, even if it is a tenth of the size.

<li><b>Delete</b>: Many different ways it fails the list criteria. For one, it is inherently POV to call something a "cliche." For another, "on screen" means, to me, movies, but, for the article authors, television. Third, there is no way to be comprehensive here, and there is no "notable cliches" that can be appealed to (i.e. with other poorly conceived lists, people will say, "Well, obviously, it's not supposed to be a List of <i>all</i> American directors, just the notable ones," but that can't be said, here). By the criteria for lists, this one fails. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To me, "on screen" means both movies and television. The only difference is a technical detail in the viewing apparatus. Television shows have much in common with movies, much more than with, for example, theatre plays or books. Is there a really important distinction between movies and television or do you just harken back to the pre-TV days? ‚Äî <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 20:10, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Turnstep that it should be kept and cleaned up because of the large amount of edits (547) by different users. Many list movies which they come from, and some are so obvious they dont need verification - "Car chases will usually involve...Passing through a narrow alleyway stacked high with empty cardboard boxes...The pursuer will crash through something being carried across the street, usually a pane of glass or a fruit cart" or how about "There is always a big red button that is not supposed to be pressed." - countless movies <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a> 13:48, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was Delete. I count 11 delete/merge, 4 keeps. Based on the raw count, I could have been convinced to go either way. After all, three minor acting credits and a poorly selling book is three credits and one book more than I have to my name! Still, the article itself reads so much like a gossip column, I don't think it's worth keeping. One could make the argument that we aim to be a superset of every encyclopedia that has ever been published, and thus the IMDB article should mean it's good enough for us, but I think it would be a hard sell to convince me that IMDB is an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 14:22, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know I worked to make this page normal, but this isn't a very notable person.

I don't think she's quite notable and the Aniston Vs. Dow conflict can be briefly summarized on Aniston's page.

<li><b>keep</b>: Disclaimer, I started this article.
<ul>
<li>When I started the article I did link to <a href="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxtheres.html" class="external text" title="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxtheres.html" rel="nofollow">one of my sources</a>, which, unfortunately, subsequent editors seem to have removed. So, the article is not really "based on speculation" as nominator asserts.</li>
<li>Can someone please explain what possible advantage a merge offers?</li>
<li>There are four articles that link to this article. Three of those article <b>already</b> link to PT Barnum. Readers who read those articles, and decide they want to know about Barnum can follow those links. Readers who want to know about the famous phrase, can follow that link.</li>
<li>The phrase is famous, whoever first coined it, famous enough it is part of our cultural short-hand. As such it merits an article of its own. The phrase nets over 50,000 google hits.</li>
<li>If this material, which I consider important, is merged into the PT Barnum article, someone can come along, and make the decision to delete it, without realizing that will damage the value of other articles. If it is left in article of its own, future nominators can check to see if other articles link to it. I will suggest to CLW that this should be part of their checklist if they make future {afd} nominations. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:25, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Possibly the strongest argument as to why the phrase merits an article of its own, rather than a redirection to PT Barnum, is the frequency with which the phrase is used, without explanation, or reference to Barnum. Here are a handful of examples:</li>

May I just take a moment to clarify: when I said that the fact of Geo Swan's having created another Firesign-related article was an unworthy thought, I meant exactly that. His edit history makes it abundantly clear that he is <i>not</i> a single-issue wonder, but an editor with a wide history of interesting added content.

<li>Freak of Nature, thanks for offering your explanation. I don't know what "sub-sorting" is. But, it seems to me that your concern about new users being turned off, when they click on the Random Page link, merely reveals a flaw in the implementation of the Random Page code -- one that could be fixed with a sensibility filter that didn't show pages that fell below a certain threshold of edits or sentences. WRT new users please consider the comment I posted to Dalbury's vote below, where I suggest thought experiment. If you are going to base your vote based on new users I think you have to consider the frustration and inconvenience a merge poses for readers who go to the page because they want to know the background of the phrase, and, instead, are taken to a completely different page, a biography, or someone they may never heard of. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 11:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The fact that the phrase is often used without attribution is pretty irrelevant. "To be or not to be" is often used without attribution, but it still belongs to Shakespeare.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The merge votes, I think, are a little rediculous in this case.

<ul>
<li>That is a strawman argument. No one is suggesting that every misattributed quote merits an article of its own. The phrase merits an article because it is widely used, and has long ago entered our cultural shorthand. Most instances of its use don't explain its meaning, or attribute it to Barnum. The wikipedia should have an article devoted to the phrase to help out those unfamiliar with the phrase, or those for whom English is not their native language. Merging to Barnum is a disservice to those who want to use the wikipedia to find out the phrase's background. Here is a thought experiment. Go to one of the articles that links to this one. Pretend you have never heard of Barnum. Now pretend you clicked on the link, because you were interested in the phrase, and you got taken not to an article about the phrase, but to some guy from the 19th Century named Barnum. Let me suggest that, if you were a new user, your first reaction would be, <b>"This wikipedia is not as useful as people claim. WTF would it take me to a biography of this 19th Century guy, when I told it I wanted to know more about that phrase?"</b> -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 11:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect to Barnum. Do we really need articles for <i>every</i> famous quote? Sorry for my language now, I am just making a point: The quote "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_you.html" title="Fuck you">Fuck you</a>" is a much more used quote than the Barnum quote, but it isn't an article of itself, but redirected and a part of the article "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>". By the way, the Barnum quote should be listed as "trivia" in the Barnum article since it is uncertain whether he said it.

<li><b>comment</b> - I want to address those of you who identify yourselves as <b>"mergists"</b>. I understand that some of you feel an aesthetic affinity to merging. I get aesthetic affinities too. I get aesthetic affinities for doing things certain ways, or making things look in certain ways. But, what I have to acknowledge, is that those aesthetic affinities sometimes screw me up.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It seems like most people who want to merge this article into PT Barnum are prompted by an aesthetic sense. The merge feels right to them, because all merge suggestions feel right to them.</dd>
<dd>Some instances of making things look right really are incredibly useful and important. An instance of that here on the wikipedia would be we the see also and external references sections. There is a project to go through all the articles and regularize their usage. Making all our external references appear as regular as possible, makes it easy to find the particular parts we want. With instances like this, once we get used to putting things in a regular format, we internalize that format, so we can recognize it at a glance, and can recognize when it is not in that format, at a glance. And our aesthetic sense kicks in, so we feel dissatisfied when <i><b>it just doesn't look right.</b></i></dd>
<dd>But that aesthetic sense can really betray us too, lead us into bad decisions. There are certain kinds of tasks where I am tempted to use my favourite tools. I want to write a script, make use of some regular expressions, to automatically select some stuff, and make transformations. I think I am good at it. I estimate it won't take very long, and I will feel an aesthetic satisfaction doing the task that I wouldn't feel if I made each change by hand. But it turns out I made some typos, or didn't fully appreciate the special cases, and I have to write several drafts. I find myself reluctant to admit when my aesthetic sense betrayed me -- when brute force manual editing would have saved time and prevented errors.</dd>
<dd>We have to be disciplined about how we allow ourselves to exercise our aesthetic sense. We have to recognize that even the best aesthetic rule, which</dd>
<dd>Merging can break things. It will break things in this particular instance. Three of the four articles that link to this article <b>already</b> link to PT Barnum, right in the same sentence or a neighbouring sentence. So, redirecting this phrase to PT Barnum breaks those articles, by putting a second, deceptive link to PT Barnum near the real link to PT Barnum.</dd>
<dd>That sucks. Its broken. Let me suggest this merge is a misapplication of your aesthetic sense. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 12:20, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Geo, here is how I see it: people will go to the Barnum article and expect to find reference to this comment, due to widespread popular (mis?)attribution. Note that the references are not actually conclusive on that score. Therefore, the Barnum article has to mention this phrase, even if only to say he never said it. It would make sense to cover it twice if (a) there was a substantial likelihood of people entering this phrase as a search term (which I don't think there is, and anyway the search would find the Barnum article), or (b) there was substantial additional encyclopaedic content, which I don't see: beyond Barnum-specific discussion (which again ionvolves redundancy as it has to establish the background of the quarrel, which is properly done in the Barnum article), there isn't much to say. It's an aphorism, people use it. This is not a dictionary of aphorisms. If there is a list of aphorisms it would probably be listed (as it is in my dictionary of aphorisms) as widely but probably erroneously attributed to Barnum. You've seen what Bartleby has to say: <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=colQuotations&amp;query=there%27s+a+sucker+born+every+minute&amp;x=14&amp;y=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=colQuotations&amp;query=there%27s+a+sucker+born+every+minute&amp;x=14&amp;y=10" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. So, I support a merge for maintainability, avoiding duplication, and ease of use because I can't see what other <i>encyclopaedic</i> relevance it might have, this not being a dictionary of aphorisms and all. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In July 2005, it was discussed on Talk:Politics of South Park that the article comprised solely editors' own analyses of the political stance of <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>, presented as though they were Wikipedia's own opinions, and was thus both biased and original research (an issue that had been raised a month before on <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Park_Republican_eea2.html" title="Talk:South Park Republican">Talk:South Park Republican</a>). Sources and attribution were requested then. The article has sported neutrality and accuracy dispute tags in the months since, and during that time not a single source has been cited in the article to indicate that this is not original research, and no attempt has been made to attribute the opinions on the politics of the show to the people who actually hold them, or even indicate that anyone other than the editors themselves who are writing the article hold those opinions. (On <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Park_Republican_eea2.html" title="Talk:South Park Republican">Talk:South Park Republican</a>, an editor <i>refused outright</i> to cite xyr source.) The evidence of the edit history and talk pages is thus that there is no scope for this article to be anything other than non-neutral and original research. We are here to create an encyclopaedia that condenses and summarizes existing knowledge that has already been peer reviewed and published, not to collaborate on creating from scratch a political treatise about a television show. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:05, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. So what is being argued here? Are you saying that this subject is inherently NPOV/OR, or that what is posted now is such? I do not see why a perfectly satisfactory article can not be created discussing the politics of South Park. This is a program many people watch, and more have heard of.

<li>The only satisfactory edit as things stand is to delete the article. You assert that a "perfectly satisfactory article can be created". This implies that you know of sources on this subject that can be used to create such an article. So <i>cite them</i>. Merely claiming that this isn't original research and can be rendered neutral, without actually demonstrating that it isn't original research and providing sources to work from, won't cut the mustard any longer. Sources have been requested for <i>five months</i>, and not only have editors not provided them, they have even <i>refused</i> to provide them, one stating that xyr contributions are the "product of some research I had been doing". It is now crunch time. The currently unsubstantiated assertion that this isn't original research now has to be backed up with something concrete within the next few days. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:15, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No. <i>Things that humans want to know about</i> is not the same as <i>things that humans do know about</i>.

However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.'

Collaboratively creating an analysis of the political stance of a television show, where <i>no such analysis exists outside of Wikipedia</i> is original research, plainly and simply. You have the opportunity to provide evidence that such an analysis exists, which is the <i>only</i> way that you can demonstrate that this is not original research. Merely arguing as you are that that we should include original research in our encyclopaedia isn't persuasive. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>

<li>Yes it is. It misses the pretty obvious point that while references might make an article better, an article with no references is better than no article at all. This is also part of wiki policy.

<li>The article doesn't contain facts, it contains <i>conclusions</i>. For example, it states that episode 502 is "Against censorship on TV". This is a conclusion, drawn from watching the television show and inferring a political stance indirectly from the plot and dialogue, <i>not</i> a verifiable fact about the television show. It is an opinion about the television show. It isn't attributed to the person who holds that opinion, and no source for it is provided. There's no evidence that it is anything but a conclusion drawn directly by the Wikipedia editor who first published here. The <i>whole article</i> is like this. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:41, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know you have a point Uncle G, but I do not support an absolutist reliance on references. It becomes an instrument for censorship rather than accuracy. There is a distinction between drawing novel conclusions and stating common conclusions which would be drawn by the average(informed) man had he been (in this case) watching the programs. The latter is not OR by any normal definition, and is not so under the explicit exclusion clause in wiki policy. Nor does the absence of a reference prove something is OR. The logical premis can only be that the presence of a reference proves that it is not.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 20:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have <i>no idea</i> what the "common conclusions" are "which would be drawn by the average(informed) man had he been (in this case) watching the programs". There are no sources to tell us. You cannot prove that what is in the article <i>are</i> those conclusions, or even that most people won't in fact come to entirely different conclusions.
<p>If you don't support relying upon references, then you won't be comfortable here at Wikipedia. <i>That is what we do here.</i> I can highly recommend adopting the stance of always insisting upon there being references and good sourcing, though. The articles that you create won't ever come to AFD in the first place (I speak from experience.), and you can even rescue the odd article from deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kindness_29c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kindness">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Osmotrophy_c1f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Osmotrophy">there</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Theomatics_9b58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Theomatics">yon</a>, too. ‚ò∫ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:52, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, you miss the point. Every editor of wiki is one of those average informed men. If you are arguing that editors are unable to make choices about what is common sense to include, then there will be no encyclopedia at all. You make my point for me too, that references are not being used as a tool for improving quality, but for settling arguments about deletion and non-deletion. Wiki has been criticized as lacking an editorial POV. The real problem is not having a POV but making it clear where and how this applies. Wiki insistence on removing POV is its main tool for controlling editors. This may be necessary, (or not) but it also reduces the quality of certain kinds of article. Any kind of article which relies upon an opinion, in fact (politics, biography, economics, literature...). It is also against the spirit of wiki, that anyone can contribute. This may become wikis greatest problem if it continues. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 18:47, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>- if this is a list of entertainers who happen to be roughly Christian by religion, I'd say strong delete. But a list of people in 'Christian entertainment', or entertainers who have used their celebrity status to promote their faith would seem to have some validity.

<li>Can I ask why you think plagiarised? I'm sorry about the 'please format' but I'm new here (don't bite the newbies...?). Azushi
<ul>
<li>Because a google search revealed similar phrases to many of the sentences in the article, but no exact matches; thus suggesting that someone used them as sources and changed a few words around. It also looks very suspiciously like a term paper. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 23:47, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course there were similar phrases! The topic is utterliy central to the philosophy of mind. I'm sure there a thousand articles called the same thing using very similar phrases <i>because that's the philosophical terminology</i>. I don't recognise your "Google approach" to identifying plagiarism; I could write you another "term paper" on how flawed a strategy <i>that</i> is. If it needs re-writing, then re-write it as you see fit (preferable to deletion, as stated by Wiki guidelines). I was simply plugging a gaping hole, as I saw it, namely that the problem of interaction had no entry on Wikipedia. I found this incredible - and this is certainly better than nothing.</li>

<p>This article describes a publisher called Microcosm Publishing in Portland, OR. All the references I find (e.g. on Amazon) are to a company of the same name based in the UK. The article says this is an independent publisher and distributor of zine, books, pamphlets, 1" buttons etc. Some Google hits to support this, but that does not make them notable. The pass the first test for vanity, in that the first words in the article were a weblink to their site (removed). I can't see a lot to suggest that the zines themselves are notable. The article concludes with an invitation ot their 10th Anniversary Party (I will contact them, obviously they will be happy send me complimentary first classs tickets from London Heathrow so I can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">validate</a> this).

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Due to their style of distribution, it will be difficult to find Microcosm on any internet merchants. Their material is mainly distributed through radical bookstores (such as Paper Matches or the Wooden Shoe) or infoshops in North America. Most of these have little or no web presence. However, materials from Microcosm Publishing (with which I am uninvolved) are fairly ubiquitous in such places. All the same, it is something of an advert. Makhnono! 02:56, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>(sorry didnt check what NN band was) but ' most' music was released locally, not all of it. Also see RDF (radical dance faction) much of their music was also released locally, but it doesnt stop them being an immensely important band of our time.

don't delete</p>
<p>being a portuguese person, i actually find it quite factual the information displayed on this article, it is all true, these chungas, dreads, mitras, are the most pathetic thing on the face of this earth, their style, the way they talk, lowest class people, its true it might be offencive towards them, but in general anyone in portugal who is not one of these can admit that they are pathetic [edit]</p>
<p>I Agree...</p>
<p>Being a current resident of Portugal, I must say that I completely agree with the above message. The chungas that crawl the streets over here are pathetic creatures, and if any of them get angry and hurt by this article my day will be just a little bit brighter. But anyway, there is a very small chance of that happening since chungas are not educated and therefore cannot speak english, and they definitely do not have acess to the internet as not even their lives are worth as much as a decent computer. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.84.22.152 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.84.22.152_a319.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.84.22.152">contribs</a>).</small> <small>and that includes both of the above paragraphs, despite the attempt to make it look like two comments.</small></p>

<hr />
<p>Hello, I do not believe this article should be deleted. This article is genuine. The term "basofe" is analogous to the term "chav" that became slang in the U.K. Just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav</a> is a valid article this one should be too.

<p>I don't agree this article should be deleted, as it is genuine about a word that's currently used in the Portuguese Slang, to describe this kind of 'new-age' groups. Maybe clean up, but certainly not deleted. --84.90.132.174 22:20, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

The subject is only notable for the one event that is documented in that article, so any content about her is most appropriate there.

<li>No, I'm stating that it has been through AfD before, it was deemed notable enough to keep then, and but for the actions of a few idiots it remains so. I base my judgements in AfD on deciding whether a <i>topic</i> is worth keeping, not necessarily the <i>content</i>. The Game is real. I'm not an avid player, but I'm smart enough to know that memes (which The Game is, essentially) propogate very rapidly through blogs. Of course it's going to turn up in lots of non-notable blogs; that doesn't make it non-notable of itself. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 23:40, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

If you would like information on the game "to stay online to share it's fun to the world," then I recommend you register for free web hosting and create a website somewhere. In my opinion, it's much easier than going through the trouble you and your friends went through today. No one will argue with you. Do you think that this website provides free webhosting? No, it doesn't. Content here, of course, has to follow the rules here. Consider this, if you had a website and then one day a group of people deface pages and add pages and insert inappropriate information on it, how would you feel, what would you do?

<li><b>keep</b>- What harm is this page causing to you who do not wish to learn about the walking game?

In my opinion, your votes are not in good faith, and I am asking you to either stop this nonsense, or start presenting valid reasons. -- <b><a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury"><font color="navy">Dalbury</font></a><sup><font color="green">(<a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>)</font></sup></b> 19:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The reason people buy encyclopedia's and subscribe to internet databases is to get information that they wouldn't be able to get simply searching in yahoo or google. Plus getting information from an encyclopedia is more accurate then reading someones weblog that comes up in a search engine. If someone hears something about, "The Walking Game", and wants more information, I see no reason why they shouldn't be able to look it up in Wikipedia.Ognit Ice 21:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> They also expect that the information was verified. There's been no verification this game exists.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have seen this game being played in Scarborough, a locale within Toronto. It is clearly not very well-known, but I expect it to gain popularity. There are plenty of other games, activities, etc. that are played widely, but have never been mentioned in essay, article, TV broadcast, etc. And mostly, it has a very neat fringe appeal. So while the case for the game's veracity is hard to make, the opposing argument is equally difficult to posit. I say let it ride out. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShagmaestro_d684.html" title="User:Shagmaestro">Stephen Job</a> 17:55, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I live in Dallas and many of my freinds and my older brother's freinds play this game. I wasn't even sure what it was called but sure enough it is called the Walking Game. This game is real and this page is great for learning about it. I'm sure if you let this page stay the writers could get more facts and more sources, please don't delete it! 216.185.84.246 19:57, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was pleasantly surprised to hear about this game being on Wikipedia when a friend stumbled across it. An article on the game was published in our school newspaper last month, which is when I originally learned about it. This game does seem to be gaining popularity and the article seems to me to be legitimate. The "Helsinki incident", mentioned in the article, was also mentioned in my school newspaper's report. I'll see if I can get a scan of it to help verify the article. Essentially this is one of those games that flies completely under the radar. I expect that pretty soon we could see some reports on the game on more mainstream media. Watch for it on your local news sometime soon. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.221.81.98.html" title="User:216.221.81.98">216.221.81.98</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.221.81.98.html" title="User talk:216.221.81.98">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.221.81.98_ea2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.221.81.98">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>All but the first sentence of the article is about a <i>specific</i> thread in a <i>specific</i> forum. Is this the topic of the article, or is it about very long threads in internet forums in general?

The reference quoted by <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> defines the term as a global 'index' thread, which neither describes the thread in the Led Zep forum, nor the concept of very long threads.

<li><b>Abstain</b> Having come to Wikipedia specifically to find out about the band Kaiser Chiefs I would have been ill served by this item's deletion. So if this item is deleted please make sure the information is available elsewhere, and is obviously navigable from the main Kaiser Chiefs page. Whether this means integrating individual band members into the main page is open to question; I believe that is short-sighted and would lead to people adding trivia about individual members to a <i>page about the band</i> (in which case the page is no longer about a band, rather individuals). Which does not make sense and is moderately annoying. For example I would not like to look at a Guns and Roses page, and find information about Axel Rose's contemporary life or his history outside of his major influences. Which is the kind of behaviour that would be encouraged by integration of trivia into a band page. If the information is not directly related to the band (for instance the colour of the players underwear, or high-school mathematics teacher, or in-growing toe-nails) it should not be on a band page, rather a page about the individual whom is a member of said band. I should add that <b>notable</b> is so relative in its English usage that I can barely bring myself to talk or interact with the kind of people that use it so frequently on Wikipedia. I would end up taking stomach medication.</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> - yes, the page is sparse, but his band the Kaiser Chiefs are big enough (as in Proper Top Ten Mega Hit Stars in the UK) and the others have pages as well. Plus, it isn't worth deleting all the members, they just need thier pages developing. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerks_d7b8.html" title="User:Perks">Perks</a> 21:12, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
