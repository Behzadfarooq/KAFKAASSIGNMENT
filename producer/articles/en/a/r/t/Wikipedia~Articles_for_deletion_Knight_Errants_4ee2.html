<p><i>Google hits:</i> 252 using "Jester Dormitory"</p>

<p>Wow.

<dd>Thanks for the suggestion, someone has nominated that for deletion too (though I personally voted to merge some of it with the University article). Any other similar articles you can point out will be appreciated (by me at least). I'm sure there are plenty. This, however, is irrelevent to the plight of "Knights Errant". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:08, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Google hits</b></p>
<p>"Knights Errant blog" gets almost 5000 hits on Google. Before dismissing Knights Errant, the Wiki folks should know the entire association of the bloggers is due to the buzz created in the chess world for the de la Maza approach to chess improvement. -Jadoube --72.16.15.120 22:17, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear here, "knights errant blog" gets 0 hits on goggle when you use the quotes. without the quotes it gets close to 5000, but by no means are most of those associated with your little group. More accurate is a search for <i>"knights errant" blog chess</i>, which gets us down to less than 200. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:28, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Non notable chess club.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight-errant.html" title="Knight-errant">Knight-errant</a> - it's a valid alt spelling (despite the caps), and there's nothing to be lost by redirecting. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 03:21, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I believe this may be an easy misconception of a legit spelling, I believe it is still wrong (even discounting the caps). The plural of knight errant should be knights errant. Nevertheless, a <b>redirect</b> (no merge) is fine with me, as it's a minor error that could be made. Would hopefully discourage recreation too. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 03:51, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The title should be changed to Knights Errant.

<li>Jadoube is correct: we (the group of blogges) are the Knights Errant, and if the correct search term is entered in Google the results are significantly different.

<li>Delete and recreate: Wikipedia is not a school noticeboard nor Everything2.

<li>With all due respect to Geogre, the Knights Errant is not a local club but a worldwide phenomenon in the chess blogosphere -- with bloggers from the US, The Netherlands, Australia, India, Romania, Belgium, etc. They have all come together around a "revolutionary" approach to chess improvement.

<li>A few comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Someone above said the Knights are "using us as some sort of promo ad". I have no idea where they got this idea from. We are not promoting <i>anything</i>. The Knights Errant are a friendly group of bloggers who are all trying to get better in chess by following a certain chess training program (mentioned in the entry). Look at the blogs in my sidebar (<a href="http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://chessconfessions.blogspot.com</a>): we are a bunch of schlumps trying to get better at chess. Nothing more.</p>
<p>2. As for how "important" we are as a group in the blogosphere, this is the key point. Ask anybody in the chess blogosphere about the "Knights Errant" and they will know who we are. The question is whether anything from the chess blogosphere is worthy of inclusion. This is a fair question. I would propose it is at least as important as, oh say, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Branch_Pecatonica_River" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Branch_Pecatonica_River" rel="nofollow">East Branch Pecatonica River</a> in Wisconsin. Let the Knights Errant entry stay up for a while and then see how many more hits they get than the more obscure entries.</p>
<p>3. When I started learning chess, and was trying the Knight's chess improvement program (without actually knowing about them), it would have been <i>great</i> for me if this had come up at Wikipedia. I searched the web for terms that would have come up, but they didn't come up in Google back then. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.16.225.228 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.16.225.228_1e0b.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.16.225.228">contribs</a>) 23:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>I fully support keeping the two entries. I view their entries not as advertisements or promotion, but as a bit of information that interested parties may not find elsewhere on the internet without a difficult search. I too wish that this had been here, as it would have made my start as a blogger easier.
