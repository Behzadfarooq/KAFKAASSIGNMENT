<p>I'm sorry, but we cannot have an article in an encyclopedia which is a) unsourced, and b) claims that Bob Dylan, David Bowie, the Beatles, Jay-Z, The Byrds, George Harrison, Black Sabbath, Dizzy Gillespie (Dizzy fricking Gillespie!) and countless others had songs featuring cowbells.</p>
<p>There are two references in the entire article that verifies two songs. The rest is taken from "The Cowbell Project" (I'm assuming, since that's the only external link, which itself is just some crazy fanatics home page, and cites no sources).</p>
<p>I know people are fond of their internet memes, and that's fine. You can have your articles on Star Wars kids and Numa Numas and whatever. That's ok, I don't have any problem with them at all. But honestly, can you call yourself a good wikipedian if you want an article in an encylopedia that claims that Jimi Hendrix used cowbells.</p>

<li><b>Delete, or significantly pare down to what is sourced</b>. - I could see how this list could possibly be useful if it were properly sourced, as any list of songs featuring any particular instument could in theory be useful. However, "The cowbell project" doesn't look like it can be considered a reliable source. They have a place to submit songs to add to their list that looks like anybody could add, verified or not. I can see that being an external link but not a source. As of right now there are 2 songs that have a source which I haven't checked to see if they are reliable or not. Assuming they are, that would leave this entire article with 2 songs reliably sourced, which would make this article useless. If someone wants to find a reliable source for each song on here though I would welcome it and would reconsider my vote. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 04:07, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ponderable: How many of these songs actually feature jamblocks instead of cowbells? Or some other similar sounding instrument? - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 02:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Maintain</b> I don't know the proper format for this... so I'm just following the lead here. I have been a long-time wikipedia reader (and active promoter!) and have to say that I have referenced this article twice. Unfortunately, this time it looks like it's marked for deletion. The reason I referenced it was because I was listening to Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name" and you can definitely hear the cowbell between times 0:10-0:20 of the song (and possibly more later) and I wanted to see if it REALLY is cowbell! Sure there may be ONE reference, but honestly... how many idiots do you need 'to change a lightbulb?'--metaphorically speaking. I like how everyone is saying that certain songs definitely DON'T have cowbell... but how many people actually loaded up their playlist and listened for it? And BTW <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't exclude lists... it doesn't even mention lists. Why? Because that would exclude lists of former presidents, nobel prize winners, etc. etc. Point made. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.250.246.160 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.250.246.160.html" title="User talk:24.250.246.160">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.250.246.160_44e5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.250.246.160">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no encyclopaedic topic "songs featuring cowbells"; the definition of "featuring" is arbitrary (how many cowbell beats in the drum tabs before it counts as featuring?); no reliable sources for this information have been identified after two previous AfDs, making "keep and source" a null vote on the basis that previous attempts to keep and source have resulted in keeping and <i>not</i> sourcing; the likelihood of verifiable sources existing for most of these are slim anyway since the listener can't tell the difference betwen a sampole and a real cowbell, and full scores are rarely published these days, so any song in the last couple of decades is goign to amount to original research pretty much by definition. I'm sure there are other problems as well, but those are the major ones that I see here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:00, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>Still Delete</s> Content sourcing issues normally don't apply in AFD, except in this case there is no physical way that the article could ever hope to be properly sourced. Is that a cowbell I hear or a jamblock? Is it a sample? Is it someone banging on a roadie's head? If you look at the written logs that come out of a recording session, about all you ever see are: "Track 1: Guitar 1 Track 2: Guitar Fills Track 3: Percussion Track 4: Bass... etc.". They don't keep records of whether or not a cowbell was used. Also, if you really get right down to it, this article isn't so much a real scholarly work as it is an attempt to keep a meme alive. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 21:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article is definitely not scholarly; it's part of what I think of as the more playful side of WP. It is, however, a list that establishes a notable connection between the referenced items. It would be notable in a very small way, but for the SNL sketch generating a little more interest in the previously overlooked cowbell. Sure, it's a little crufty, but you only have to read the talk page and the comments in the various deletion discussions to see that it generates interest and discussion. Your point about the difficulty of sourcing the article is well taken. However, I could see Rolling Stone asking Mick Jagger if that was really a cowbell in Brown Sugar. Alternately, the article could disclaim that the songs contain cowbell or a cowbell-like instrument and use the songs as the source - as we might use a book as a source for a quoted phrase.-<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 22:11, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
