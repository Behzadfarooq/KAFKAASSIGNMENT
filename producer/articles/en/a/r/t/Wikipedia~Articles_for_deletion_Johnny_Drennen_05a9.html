<p>Just some random guy in A-ball who happened to hit a homerun off of Roger Clemens during a rehab start. Mr. Clemens has been pitching a long time, and there is no one else on wikipedia just because he gave up a homer to him. Also, to those who might argue that there is something significant about an A level player getting a homerun off of a sure Hall of Famer, it is worth noting that even the best of pitchers give up many homeruns in their careers and even the worst hitters in baseball hit homeruns off of the best pitchers sometimes (after all, pitchers hit homeruns occasionally). Not only will this guy not be remembered in ten years even in baseball circles unless he adds a few more accolades to his resume, he will not be remembered in ten months. Was prodded, but the tag was removed. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 14:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. An incredibly deceptive nom, that ignores that Mr. Drennen was a first round draft pick at 18 by the Indians and will most likely get callled up. In his short time in the minors, the man homered off Clemens (in his first return to the major leagues), probably the greatest pitcher who ever lived. Drennen's hit made national news, with every major paper commenting. This is no random guy and no random story. I wonder to what extent the nom understands the dynamics of the story. I object to the false projection ten years down the road, at which point Drennan is entirely likely to have made his mark in the majors.

<dd>There is no real argument for deletion. A first-round draft pick, a pro-baseball player, who smokes a living legend, qualifies for inclusion at every level.

<dd>I do admit that this article fits into a strange nether region that defies categorization in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and leads to reasonable arguements on both sides for keeping based on an interpretation of that guideline alone. Vis-á-vis athletes, the guideline indicates that professioal athletes should be allowed in, and minor leaguers are certainly paid for their efforts, but other categories in Bio such as top athletes in non-professional sports and top athletes in college sports imply that the level of selectivity is slightly different. Baseball is unique among the major American sports in that there is an extended farm system that develops talent rather than teams just relying on high schools and colleges to develop players for them. WP:BIO goes on to discuss how first team squad members (not a baseball concept I know) that have not appeared for the first team <i>may</i> merit an entry, and this implies that lower level team members do not. By analogy, minor leaguers are the equivalent of the reserve team, and therefore WP:BIO strongly implies they don't belong. I acknowledge that the policy can be interpreted either way and that mine own is merely an opinion on how it should be read and only consensus can dictate how each case will be handled. I hope you can acknowledge the same about your views.</dd>

<dd>That long-winded explanation deals only with why minor leaguers in general do not belong and does not answer your question relating to this specific person. According to my interpretation above, this person would have to have done something highly unusual or special to merit inclusion. Being a sandwhich round draft pick (not quite a number one) is not enough in my eyes because his value is not yet known. If he goes on to be a Major League regular, then he will certainly merit an article, but he may flop and be forgotten like many picks (even #1 picks) before him. That leaves the homerun, which is the main (probably only) reason this article was written as is readily apparent by the content of the article, which focuses nearly exclusively on this event. A home run is just not too important an event in the grand scheme of things, many thousands having been hit in baseball history from its inception. Sure, there have been notable homerun feats like Reggie Jackson in 1978, Bill Mazeroski in 1960, Joe Cater in 1993, and even Bo Jackson in 1989, but this particular home run did not reach those lofty heights of importance, and none of those players have an article solely because they hit those homeruns. Roger Clemens has given up 347 home runs in his major league career alone, and this was just one more. While he may be the best pitcher of all time, that does not make him immune to homeruns. Even the best pitcher may give up a home run to the worst hitter on any given day, whether through luck, skill, or a temporary lapse in judgment. Any player could have hit a homerun off Clemens that day, it just so happens Drennen was the guy to do it. It does not make him special or notable. As for the press coverage, this speaks more to the hype surrounding Clemens than to any special achievement on Drennen's part. Any major sporting event is going to be covered by every news agency on the planet, and day in and day out the plays of certain players will be discussed. A third-string catcher on a last place Major League team who allows a passed ball that costs his team a win will be featured in media outlets across the country (particularly if it is a New York team), but if the game was not important to the team's overall performance that year, the incident will quickly be forgotten and the article on that player will not mention the incident regardless of how much media coverage was generated. The same situation exists here. While I believe your interpretation of WP:BIO is valid (even though I do not agree with it), I have yet to see you explain what makes this homerun special, or any more noteworthy than the 347+ other homeruns Clemens has given up in his career.</dd>

<dd>Thanks very much. That was a very good answer. There is little I think that I need to say now that I haven't already said. As you surmised, my reading of WP:BIO is that all pro athletes qualify for inclusion. Therefore, I would be inclined to keep the Drennen article regardless. I also don't see any reason why we wouldn't want articles on all the top draft picks- meaning well beyond the top ten. That's the kind of information I would hope a major on-line reference work could provide. The fact that the Clemens minor-league game was greatly hyped, televised nationally and covered by newspapers coast-to-coast (NY Times, USA Today etc <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/astros/2006-06-06-clemens-return_x.htm?csp=34" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/astros/2006-06-06-clemens-return_x.htm?csp=34" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>,<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16FF3E550C748CDDAF0894DE404482" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16FF3E550C748CDDAF0894DE404482" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - with Drennen's homer drawing extensive commentary and feature articles the next day <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/06/8baseblurbs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/06/8baseblurbs.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060607&amp;content_id=1493339&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle" class="external autonumber" title="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060607&amp;content_id=1493339&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>,<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2473587" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2473587" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>- makes the Drennen article especially interesting.

<li>Actually, this guy wasn't first round, he was a "sandwich round" pick. With 30 teams, there are 30 players in the first round. Looks like twelve of the 30 have articles, but only two after the top ten picks, and one of those two, Hansen, actually played in the majors.

<li>Just as soon as he's out of the reserves and plays for the first team (i.e. just one game in major league will do), then he'll meet WP:BIO for sportspeople rather than your idiosyncratic interpretation of it. If he does something else notable, non-baseball, that meets WP:BIO, then that too will do. But he hasn't yet established his notability either through baseball or any other field. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:37, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All I'm saying is, at the moment, my reading of the wording of WP:BIO, rather than anything idiosyncratic, shows that he meets it in at least two variables. If your vote isn't contingent on WP:BIO after all, then it'd be different story. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:38, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do you plan on letting us know which variables, or is this another of your faith-based votes? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 03:27, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Easy: "portspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league" and "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." I certainly don't have to point these out to you, as you claim to not need a lecture above. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:17, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
