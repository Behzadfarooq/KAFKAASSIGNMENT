I strongly disagree with your above statement. The purpose of this article isn't to claim that it's racist to criticize Islam. It is a fact that Arabs &amp; Muslims are stereotyped.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While the general decision to split up stereotyping content into various "Stereotypes of..." articles may or may not have been a good one, once the general decision was made, lots of individual "Stereotypes of..." articles follow, and it makes no sense to try to rehash the general decision by picking a few off individually and leaving the rest. The article could stand improvement, but the existence of stereotypes is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> from common knowledge. That said, it's questionable whether "Arabs and Muslims" should be combined, since the latter is a much larger group than the former. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 01:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Rename</b> This article can be saved, but first it has to be seperated. As Shirahadasha points out, it makes no sense to combine "Arabs" and "Muslims" as not all Arabs are Muslim (Druze, Christian, Athiests, Agnostics, etc) and non-Arab Muslims probably outnumber Arab Muslims. Ironicly, the title of the article reflects a stereotype.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 03:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Although true that "not all Arabs are Muslim" or vice versa, the common stereotype (at least in the United States) is that they are. Although I am not opposed to seeing the separated, I don't think either one could be mentioned without noting the other. As the article currently stands, it is in fact more about stereotypes against Arabs than Muslims, so perhaps "and Muslims" should be dropped from the title. Also, I think "in the American media", "in Western popular culture" or something similar should be added to the title of this (and the other similar articles) as this is the actual focus of the article (the article does not, for instance, include stereotypes of Arabs among Israelis, among Africans, etc.).

<li><b>Comment</b> - The grouping of peoples &amp; their stereotypes is very complex, and I see no obvious best way to organize these articles. I just wanted to mention that the possibly related page <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_South_Asians_0ae5.html" title="Stereotypes of South Asians">Stereotypes of South Asians</a> also exists, split off from the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a> page. The current article used to be called <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Near_Easterners_Arabs_9db0.html" title="Stereotypes of Near Easterners/Arabs">Stereotypes of Near Easterners/Arabs</a> because that's what the mother page's heading was called, but was renamed to the current title as per its <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStereotypes_of_Arabs_and_Muslims_bfb8.html" title="Talk:Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims">discussion page</a>. Stereotyping is a complex issue first because there are so many layers of identity with regards to nationality and religion which each have their own stereotypes that may or may not overlap, and second because stereotypes are often created &amp; perpetuated by ignorant people who mistakenly lump different identities together or substitute one for another. I agree that a discussion regarding how best to organize these articles is definitely in order, although my first priority is to save this article from deletion. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 04:00, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> As this is a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: <i>Synthesis of published material serving to advance a position</i>. It is possible to make a similar article for every ethnic or religious group because for every group one will find something that will support their position. This article seems to select a few authors and films to make a statement. This càomment may be striked when it can be proven that there exist a substantial academic literature about this subject, rather than selecting a few authors to advance an opinion. Also it seems to be a good idea to differ between Muslims and Arabs, and between American and Western European societies. As many muslims and Arabs live in Western Europe, it is possible that e.g. films show a less stereotypical image, see for instance <a href="../../../g/e/g/Gegen_die_Wand_b86a.html" title="Gegen die Wand">Gegen die Wand</a>, which can hardly be claimed to be stereotypical. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 13:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

There may well be substantial overlap between the two subjects, and many items may warrant discussion on both pages, but they ought to be distinct. I suspect there already is a reasonable body of literature on the subject of these stereotypes to draw on.

<li>I do not think the issue is one of airing stereotypes. The article presents a well-sourced summary of published works regarding the existence and character of these stereotypes. It contains no attack statements and all but one statements are sourced (the sole unsourced sentence has been tagged with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} and does not present a stereotype). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please note that the "every delete" you note amounts to a grand total of two. I sincerely hope the threshold for passion has not dropped so low for that would be a boring world indeed. In the first case, I was curious as to how the article title may be perceived as racist. In the second case, I commented regarding your unclear (at least to me) reason for deleting. If you wish to clarify it, I would like to understand your position. If you do not, that is your prerogative. In any case, my passion or lack thereof is irrelevant to this AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I believe that you misunderstand the article; it isn't saying that all Muslims <i>are</i> terrorists etc. It's saying that the above <i>misconception</i> &amp; related confusion of identities exists in the form of stereotypes. However, I agree that the organization of the article is messy now; I think if clearer headings are used (we can give stereotypes of Muslims and stereotypes of Arabs separate subheadings &amp; define each identity) and a paragraph explicitly explaining how the stereotypes of each group are associated or how identities are mistaken by those stereotyping, the points made above about Arab vs. Muslim identity can be successfully addressed. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 04:40, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippebeaudette_89c4.html" title="User:Philippebeaudette">Philippe Beaudette</a> has I think misunderstood the article: it's not, so far as I can tell, aimed at perpetuating stereotypes, whether offensive or otherwise ( a couple of stereotypes that are not mentioned in the article are the rather positive ones that "Arab men are particularly able to (ahem) please women, both physically and otherwise", and that "Arab men make stern, but loving and devoted fathers" ). Rather, the aim of the article is to document the stereotypes, and provide a balanced view of them. I'd like to eliminate the smell of OR from the article, and it will of course need to be monitored carefully for balance and to ensure an NPOV tone, but that should not be beyond our collective wit.
