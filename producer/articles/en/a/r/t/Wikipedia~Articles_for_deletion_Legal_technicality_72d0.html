<li><b>Delete</b> - This article does nothing productive, and has virtually no potential to be an informative article in the future. The term "legal technicality" is either:
<ul>
<li>(1) meaningless in that if it were written from a NPOV it would encompass the whole of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurisprudence.html" title="Jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> in every country on the planet; or</li>
<li>(2) it becomes, at it presently is, inherently POV in the sense that well-reasoned and time-tested legal principles are seen as unnecessary complexities that normal folks shouldn't need to be bothered with when they may need to be in court for some reason, or alternately</li>
<li>(3) the article as titled is inherently a POV that the exercise of a person's legally permitted rights in a court of law are mere excuses for guilty people to get off scot-free. ....<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 01:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with the article, which seems perfectly informative to me in describing precisely what a legal technicality <i>is</i>. IMHO, the nomination strays more into POV than does the article. Regardless of the nom's opinion, there <i>are</i> many legal principles, however time tested or well reasoned, which are viewed as "technicalities" by people all the way up to the White House. There's a strong revisionist streak on Wikipedia, I recognize, but there's a difference between how we <i>want</i> the public to perceive things and how they actually do, and a valid encyclopedia should reflect the latter more than the former. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 02:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re: " there are many legal principles, however time tested or well reasoned, which are viewed as "technicalities" by people all the way up to the White House." Note carefully the use of the words "viewed as 'technicalities'" in this statement just made here. Are you actually asserting that the article should be kept, but if it is kept it should be brought in line with the fact that anyone who disagrees with another party's use of the procedural law to stop them from doing what they want in court, they almost universally call it "based on a technicality"??...<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 03:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am asserting that the article should be kept. I agree that aside from anything else, people <i>do</i> blame many legal results they don't like on "technicalities," and that mentioning the syndrome would suit the article just fine. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 04:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Paragraph 1:"The term legal technicality refers to the technical niceties and exactitudes of legal procedure, which is divided into criminal procedure and civil procedure.

<dd>"technical niceties"? what on earth is that as a definition? "Fish describing water" what on earth does that mean? Where is the source for a statement such as "rarely used by lawyers" and where is the source for "unless they are trying to explain legal procedure to lay clients"?</dd>

<dd>(1)Say an old business associate takes you (or a friend or relative of yours) to court claiming that in 1956 a contract was broken and you owe them money for it. You assert the procedural defenses of <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laches.html" title="Laches">laches</a> and expiration of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a>, and the judge dismisses the case. The old business associate now goes to the press and says “it was dismissed on a legal technicality.” Are you convinced that the assertion of procedural defenses in this case are “legal technicalities”?</dd>
<dd>(2)Say you are arrested, hauled off to jail, not permitted a phone call, and not informed of what the charges are against you. Finally you get to court two years later and tell your story through your court appointed attorney who just met you, and are fortunate enough to have a ‘’competent’’ attorney who, with evidence and argument, persuades the judge that your version of events is factually correct. Note that all your arguments here are “procedural defenses”. The judge releases you. Have you gotten off on “legal technicalities”? ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 04:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note the use of the words “seemingly contrary to justice” as they are very telling of what is meant when people use the words “legal technicality” in public discourse. What the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicality.html" title="Legal technicality">Legal technicality</a> is saying is, in effect, that when people don’t agree with the outcome, they derisively refer to the cause of the “unjust” outcome as “based on a legal technicality” or “because of a legal technicality”. Meanwhile, the opposing party goes to the press and says “Thank God justice was done.” ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 04:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Metropolitan90, thanks for the link! I should interrupt the comment/analysis of content to report that the U.S. Supreme Court's use of the informal phrase "legal technicalities" over the last century (13 times minus two duplicates and one quote from a newspaper = 10 times) are as follows. All of them are used in a non-definitional way to refer to the idea of merely "complexities or technical aspects of the law"... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 05:14, 23 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(1) “The function of counsel as a guide through complex <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> long has been recognized by this Court.” (U.S. v. Ash, 1973)</li>
<li>(2) ”Furthermore, during the federal habeas corpus hearing Davis showed his awareness of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.”(footnote in Davis v. North Carolina, 1966)</li>
<li>(3) ”If recovery were denied in this case, the railroads, by the simple expedient of doing each other's work, could tie their employees up in <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> over the proper railroad to sue for injuries and perhaps remove from coverage of the Act a significant area of railroad activity.”(Shenker v. Baltimore and Ohio R.Co., 1963)</li>
<li>(4) “Admiralty practice, which has served as the origin of much of our modern federal procedure, should not be tied to the mast of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> it has been the forerunner in eliminating from other federal practices." British Transport Comm'n v. United States, 354 U.S. 129, 139 .” (CONTINENTAL GRAIN CO. v. BARGE FBL-585, 1960)</li>
<li>(5) Redundant quote:“Admiralty practice, which has served as the origin of much of our modern federal procedure, should not be tied to the mast of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> it has been the forerunner in eliminating from other federal practices." (British Transport Comm'n v. United States, 1957).</li>
<li>(6) “When the Congress deliberates over this problem, as it often has, it does not worry about the passing of title or other <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (KERN-LIMERICK, INC. ET AL. v. SCURLOCK, 1954)</li>
<li>(7) “by substituting practical, business conceptions for the previous hairsplitting <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> encrusted upon the 'found'-'present'-'carrying-on-business' sequence, the Court yielded to and made effective Congress' remedial purpose.” (UNITED STATES V. NATIONAL CITY LINES, 1948)</li>
<li>(8) Redundant quote: “Thus, by substituting practical, business conceptions for the previous hairsplitting <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> encrusted upon the 'found'- 'present'-' carrying-on-business' sequence, the Court yielded to and made effective Congress' remedial purpose. (U.S. V. SCOPHONY CORP. OF AMERICA, 1948)</li>
<li>(9) “<a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">Legal technicalities</a> doubtless afford justification for our pretense of ignoring plain facts before us, facts upon which a man's very life or liberty conceivably could depend.” (CARTER v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF ILLINOIS, 1946)</li>
<li>(10) “We shall assume that the statement, 'judicial instance and interpretative procedure ... even go out to find, every possible technicalit of the law to protect the defendant ... and nullify prosecution,' refers to the quashing of the rape indictments as well as other condemned steps. The comment of the last two paragraphs evidently includes these dismissals as so-called <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (PENNEKAMP v. STATE OF FLA., 1946)</li>
<li>(11) “Yet if <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> rather than practical considerations are to decide that question it should be noted that the defendants were payee-indorsers of the checks.” (KANN v. U.S., 1944)</li>
<li>(12) “After the making of the consent decree and the deposit of the money in court, the situation of this case was substantially that of an interpleader suit after the making of a decree for interpleader and the dismissal of the stakeholder from the cause, with the issue as between the conflicting claimants limited by stipulation to the determination of the amount 'justly due' from the one to the other. That question, of course, was and is to be decided according to the equities of the claimants as between themselves, without regard to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a>.” (MCGOWAN v. PARISH, 1915)</li>
<li>(13) “In the News, published the evening of March 19, there was an editorial reviewing the local proceedings, which concluded: 'All of this delay is aggravating to the community. The people of Chattanooga believe that Johnson is guilty, and that he ought to suffer the penalty of the law as speedily as possible. If by <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicality.html" title="Legal technicality">legal technicality</a> the case is prolonged and the culprit finally escapes, there will be no use to plead with a mob here if another such crime is committed. Such delays are largely responsible for mob violence all over the country.'”(U.S. v. SHIPP, 1909)</li>

<dd>The last use is the kicker here, as it is a quote from a newspaper. All these uses of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_technicalities.html" title="Legal technicalities">legal technicalities</a> by the Supreme Court refer to only one thing, which is in <i>informal</i> reference to "technicalities of the law” or “anything in the law that is highly technical” including substantive law, procedural law--everything technical. That is properly the subject of the article on <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>, and not the subject of a separate article on legal technicalities I would think. ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 05:14, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> – the article can (and should) be improved, but I see no grounds for deletion. The quotations provided by <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> show several good examples of the term clearly being used as commonly understood, and not just "anything in the law that is highly technical". --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:31, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. An article 'not being good' is no grounds for deleting it - only if it does not have the <i>potential</i> to become good is it deletable in my opinion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Considering the point of view of a young person who encountered the phrase "legal technicality" for the first time, an explaination would be valuable. Should it be found in an encyclopedia or a dictionary? An encyclopedia offers the possiblity of fairly extended discussion of illustrative cases, so there is good reason to include the term in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:47, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
