<dd>An article about a non-noatable cat is not an unreasonable thing to have listed as {{db-bio}}. I relisted the article for speedy, but typed out {{db|non-notable story about somebody's cat}}. This takes more time, however, and just prolongs a process. The article will obviously end up being deleted, but on AfD it will require lots more effort that would be better spent elsewhere. Storys about cats are still somewhat like bios. Even you voted delete!<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup> 02:20, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</em></dd>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> under A7 if covered by guidelines, delete as vanity otherwise and change the guidelines allowing us to delete pets, housing and other items associated with non-notable people to be speedy deleted unless they are notable in their own right. If a person is not-notable, it would be difficult to argue that their cat is notable. The claim is that a game is being written about the moggy but this game has not been completed, let alone sold. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:13, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not, and should not be a speedy candidate, because it makes a claim of notability: Being part of "project mooka". OK, not a very convincing claim at the moment but a claim. A cat can be notable if it's the subject of a notable project, and for all we know project mooka will become one. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "Project Mooka" isn't well attested; the Sourceforge link on the page is invalid. As such, the claim of notability is spurious, and it becomes a candidate for speedy deletion. (I put the speedy tag back on). <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:44, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, author is "trying" to put the cat in a game. Cat itself is unremarkable and not different from a cartload of other cats. On top of that the project is "expected to make this idea a reality". There's thousends of projects that start and never get finished. Delete until such a time the project which is its assertion of notability actually exists (and is verifiable).

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> we used to say things like "What if someone wrote an article about their cat?" when debating notability as a deletion criterion. Well, I guess it finally happened. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:24, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We are debating if the article should be deleted now or in five days from now <i>because someone asserted that that cat is the protagonist in a video game for which no one has proof that it even exists exists</i>. Stop the insanity! <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 20:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We are debating whether the article should be deleted with or without the community getting a chance to see it first. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:43, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For <i>this</i> article I see a consensus for a speedy delete. Actually this entry is a poor test case to discuss where CSD:A7 should stop, it's so obvious that the article ought to go away. (Contestants on reality TV shows tend to be kept, but should an entry on an <i>otherwise unknown person on a planned reality TV show</i> be sent to AfD instead of getting speedily deleted? I think not.) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 22:24, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We never keep anything based on potential future achievements. Otherwise, we'd be keeping articles on babies because they might win an Oscar or Nobel Prize someday. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if a baby was the unique focus of a progam designed to produce a future Nobel Prize winner, it would still be a speedy candidate? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:22, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are lots of those programs going on already. They're called overachieving parents. Seriously, this isn't <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laika.html" title="Laika">Laika</a> we're talking about here. This is some dude who kinda-sorta thinks it might be cool to make a game about his cat, but hasn't bothered to put up the Sourceforge page yet (or anything else, either, since Mooka Mookason gets 0 Google hits). Let's look at this piece-by-piece for a moment: Most games are notable, but not every one. Many game characters are notable, many are not. People/creaures on whom game characters are based are rarely notable (even <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Segali_d8aa.html" title="Mario Segali">Mario Segali</a> is barely a stub). But none of that even applies here because the game hasn't even been created yet, nor even started by the looks of things. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:07, 22 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're saying that we shouldn't have the chance to double check. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:15, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, there's nothing to check or double-check. The linked-to Sourceforge site doesn't exist, and Google shows zero results. Neither does Yahoo or AllTheWeb. I suppose that one could go to the library and look up Mooka Mookason in the card catalog, the Reader's Guide To Periodical Literature and the Encyclopaedia Brittanica too, but since I'm not in an absurdist mood today I'll skip that step and assume there's nothing about Mooka in there either. If any of this were in the least bit disputable, I'd agree with you. Currently I read 9 "speedy" votes and 7 "delete" votes, with nary a "keep" vote in site, even from yourself. A strong consensus already exists to delete, and further voting would be no more than an exercise in beaurocracy. In fact, come to think of it, WP policy actually discourages voting on AfDs if "consensus you agree with has already been formed". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>LOL I wrote that part, the reason I haven't said "delete" is because there is already a consensus to do so. We don't need any more votes, but also we don't need to rewrite the speedy policy just because this article happens to be about a real cat not a fictional one. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:46, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The absurdity of the situation isn't about real vs. fictional, but animal vs. human. I've written <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beautiful_Joe_6ee2.html" title="Beautiful Joe">an article about a dog</a>, so I know something in this area. If this article were about a human, it would be an easy uncontested speedy. Since it's a cat, it doesn't strictly fit the letter of the speedy criteria, but many feel it does fit the spirit, which is why there are more Speedy votes than Delete votes. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:04, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If articles which claim notability are speedy deleted without scrutiny, the system is broken. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...which leads us back to my original statement, that claims of notability can't be based on potential future achievements. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 02:12, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
