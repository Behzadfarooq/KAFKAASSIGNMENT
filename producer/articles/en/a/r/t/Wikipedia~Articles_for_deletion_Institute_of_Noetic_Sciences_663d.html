<dd>Parapsychology is considered a pseudoscience and is basically a dead field, I mean only one person has ever been given a PhD in the subject.

<dd>Thanks for your <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> about parapsychology, I have already mentioned that the field is affiliated with the AAAS, which proves it is not a pseudoscience. I would like to see proof to back up your 'opinion'. We all know that the word 'pseudoscience' is used by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological_skeptics.html" title="Pathological skeptics">pathological skeptics</a>, but this does not make it a fact. Most scientists with an interest in psi gain their PhD's in the wider field of psychology, which can include parapsychology. <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> arguments like mentioning Dean Radin lost his job demeans this whole debate.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and improve. It needs some balancing critical viewpoints in the article as it currently exists, but "this organization espouses pseudoscience" isn't a valid reason to delete the article.

If I have broken any policies it was unintentional. As far as I am aware a meatpuppet is a user account created by a member of the public (a non-user) for the purposes of voting, informing other users the article is up for deletion is not meatpuppetry. As far as links, I do not feel I need to spend any more time on this debate as it is clear from the 26 or so wikilinks to the page and the connection to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Radin_6479.html" title="Dean Radin">Dean Radin</a> that the article fulfils inclusion standards. As user ripley mentioned pseudoscience is not grounds for deletion, so your initial reasons for nominating it are in fact dubious. I will not be commenting further as I have other areas to deal with, and I am confident that whatever other users decide will be the right decision. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 23:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read what a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a> is, the policy you quoted refers to meatpuppets not users invited to post. Wikipedia policy is <i>"A hard and fast rule does not exist with regard to selectively notifying certain editors who have or are thought to have a predetermined point of view on their talk pages in order to influence a vote."</i>. The policy goes on: <i>"The Arbitration Committee has ruled that "[t]he occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice."</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Canvassing#Campaigning" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Canvassing#Campaigning" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>Therefore posting to a project and two users seems to be well within policy.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above. There are plenty of third-party sources available. And, even though I'm confident the article will be kept anyway, I think Solar is getting a raw deal here. He didn't say, "Vote to keep"; he said, "Add a vote". Isn't it reasonable to inform a Wikipedia project that an article within their scope of interest is up for deletion? I would think they'd be the best people to judge notability. (And the project members <i>do</i> have the ability to think for themselves, you know. They very well could have voted delete if they thought it was warranted.) <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 18:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I don't think posting a message on the project page is "attracting users with known views and bias." There are a wide variety of opinions represented at the project page - some are inclusionists, some are deletionists, some believe in paranormal phenomena, some are skeptics, etc. But, whatever, I'm not going to make an issue out of this... <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 19:47, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The two people notified were both people who had previously contributed to the article and the article fell into the scope of the one project notified. I can't see how that qualifies as meatpuppetry.

The reality is that my three posts do not constitute a violation of policy as shown in the section I quoted. "<i>The Arbitration Committee has ruled that "[t]he occasional light use of cross-posting to talk pages is part of Wikipedia's common practice.</i>" I think <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> is a bit confused over the definition of <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppetry.html" title="Meatpuppetry">meatpuppetry</a>, as <a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> points out, posting on a project page and on two user pages does not qualify as meatpuppetry. Wikipedia policy also points out that light use of cross-posting is part of common practice, for example there is a debate on whether to delete <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological_skepticism.html" title="Pathological skepticism">Pathological skepticism</a> presently taking place and I happened to notice that a user from that debate posted a notice on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Rational_Skepticism_4cea.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Rational Skepticism">Project Rational Skepticism</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Rational_Skepticism#Of_possible_interest" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Rational_Skepticism#Of_possible_interest" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, without incident. I also note that the two users trying to make it seem that I have somehow broken policy are in fact often in email correspondence and have a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> interest in the outcome of this debate, so are far from neutral in the matter. This kind of behaviour towards someone acting perfectly normally within Wikipedia standards seems to me to be little more than a transparent attempt to invalidate the opinions of others in favour of an anti-parapsychology stance. This kind of behaviour undermines the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> policy and the fairness and fundamental principles of Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 10:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The canvassing issue is controversial and you'll get different opinions about whether it's "votestacking" or "informing." The key in all cases, though, is whether or not the canvassing has become a campaign so wide-reaching that it's skewed a vote against what the average Wikipedian would believe, in other words, has become disruptive. Which this clearly has not. — <a href="../../../e/2E/_/User%7EE._Ripley_4fc7.html" title="User:E. Ripley">ripley</a>\<sup><a href="../../../e/2E/_/User_talk%7EE._Ripley_36b7.html" title="User talk:E.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have some interest in the field of pseudoscience, and I think the nominator's characterization of this outfit as "questionable" is extremely charitable. It's organized crackpottery. Nevertheless, it's one of the more notable crackpot organizations. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 10:09, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Some may feel it is pseudoscience, and I myself expect it is, but it claims 35,000 members, has been around 33 years, and publishes a journal.
