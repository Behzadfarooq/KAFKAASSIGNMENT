<li><b>Strong keep</b> nominator doesn't understand UK universities. This is not a 'student group' but the statutory organisation that includes every student in this very large university.

<li><b>Keep</b> as Doc says, student unions are important institutions within the universities; under the <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_Act_1994_3045.html" title="Education Act 1994">Education Act 1994</a> they are responsible for the representation of the interests of all students within the University, without prejudice to their affiliation (so in the case of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nottingham_cfa7.html" title="University of Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a> we're talking about a statutory organisation providing representation to in excess of 30,000 people). I agree that the article at present is poor and includes a lot of vanity material, and the List of Executive Officers of the University of Nottingham Students' Union is excessive, but the student union is a very important part of UK student life. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 02:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> - For those who are insisting that, as per Geni's note immediately above, "student's unions are inherently notable", please refer to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">this link</a>, which explains what is considered notable here on Wikipedia. If I am reading this correctly, a student union is actually <i>not</i> inherently notable - it is simply a student union. If a student union is notable at all, notability needs to be demonstrated here as per the standards - and in this case we're not seeing notability being demonstrated. Please also note that, per my replacement of the removed afdanons template, this is not a tally vote, this is a concensus, and this requires a good argument. My&#160;!vote as such remains "delete". --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 04:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Stop being so extremely patronising</b>. The people that are arguing UK Student Unions are inherently notable include experienced Wikipedians and administrators. You are simply wrong about policy. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a guideline - and a contravention one. My argument that this is inherently notable may not satisfy you, but there is no MUST about what I need to do to hold or express this opinion in the debate. You are entitled to your opinion, I to mine. You may think my argument is weak - I actually think your is lousy - but that's by and by. I've also removed the anon's template, since I see no anons or single purpose accounts present. You seem to be assuming that because people don't share your view of notability they must be clueless newbies. Wrong. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 04:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
