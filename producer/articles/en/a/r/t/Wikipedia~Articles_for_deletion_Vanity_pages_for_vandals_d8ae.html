That WoW <i>enjoys</i> this page can be seen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress%2FWilly_on_Wheels&amp;diff=14261421&amp;oldid=14261033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVandalism_in_progress%2FWilly_on_Wheels&amp;diff=14261421&amp;oldid=14261033" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> As stated on Wikipedia talk:Long term abuse/Wikipedia is Communism#This page, the original reason why these pages were created was to decrease the load on VIP. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 10:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no questions about the page being set up for all the right reasons. However, I don't think there is any need to chronicle all the vandalism done by these users, and I certainly don't think there is any need for the long lists of sockpuppets that they have used. A <i>brief</i> description of their activities under the long term alerts section will suffice. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 10:54, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Neutral</b></s> I too have come to realize that these pages do little to manage the vandals. I made the page (WiC) simply because it was clogging up the long ternm alerts page.There have been times when one of the vandals struck repeatedly that this page was useful but I suppose short term alerts could serve that roll as well. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 11:20, 27 May 2005 (UTC) I switch to <b>weak keep</b> after reading the below. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b>egue</a> 19:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These pages are in fact sections of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_in_progress_Long_term_alerts_6278.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress/Long term alerts">Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress/Long term alerts</a> which were split off because they were getting too big. They are meant to help watching for new vandalism of the same kind, not as trophies. And if the vandal starts targetting them, it serves as a useful canary. --<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 13:20, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. People who devote their time to vandal-patrolling have kept a painstaking record of this sort of thing in order to prevent it reoccurring (which in this case has been effective). It's rather offensive to see such work brushed aside as vanity or excess. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 13:23, May 27, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is <i>not</i> an attempt to brush aside the work of vandal hunters. The point of listing these for deletion is to eliminate pages which I feel are giving too much attention to a vandal. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 13:46, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I think a better way to keep track of these vandals is with a template, like that it already put on WiC. The template should be listed with the long term alert, and applied to new pages, it can also be used to find the already banned socks. These tropy pages aren't really necessary if such a system was in place. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 14:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Refactor</b>. Willy on Wheels, Ass Pus/Pelican Shit/Bugger, and {{{SITENAME}}} is Communism (whom several have suspected to be all one single individual) are recurring pests. But what is equally tedious to deal with are the "There's a new vandal! HE MUST BE DEALT WITH!" screaming alerts that come up on the talk pages of the various projects' main pages, VIP pages, and sysop user pages. These pages, here and on other WikiMedia projects, are not just trophies. They are ways of informing well-meaning editors that this is <i>not</i> some massive immediate emergency that requires spamming of talk pages, but a regular, long-term, simmering, problem, that will be dealt with <i>this</i> time as it was dealt with the <i>last</i> umpteen times. (They have also been ways of editors venting their frustrations at the perceived inabilities or unwillingnesses of developers to deal with these problems.) Recording the modus operandi of this(these) vandal(s) is important, so that well-meaning editors can recognize <i>more of the same old vandalism from the same person</i> when they see it. I think that information about these vandals should be merged, however. {{{SITENAME}}} is Communism has appeared on Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and Wikinews to my knowledge. Willy on Wheels and Ass Pus has(have) appeared even on <i>non</i>-WikiMedia wikis, such as SwarmWiki. In many cases, an attack on one wiki is almost immediately followed by attacks on others <i>using the same user name</i>. There's <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Vandalism_reports" class="extiw" title="m:Vandalism_reports">an area on Meta</a> that is specifically devoted to cross-project vandalism. It should be employed to greater extent for this(these) vandal(s). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 2005 May 27 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this is valuable information for vandal hunters. Unfortunately, they're always going to have some attention. Let's make it easier to track them down and ignore them as much as possible. Besides, it provides a central point to share info on them and stops info on them from spreading too much. (I'm not against an alternative for keeping info on these vandals, but such a system should be in place before deleting this info.) <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 20:30, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm not sure they're honestly of much use to vandal hunters, but they're good faith efforts at being useful, and if some people feel they are being useful by all means let's keep them.</li>
