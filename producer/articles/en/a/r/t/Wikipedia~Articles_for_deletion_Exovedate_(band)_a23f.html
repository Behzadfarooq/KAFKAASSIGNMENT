<p>This is a vanity addition, of a non notable band.</p>
<p>If you Google; Exovedate Daneka Lisa Smith, (the band and their vocalist, as Exovedate is also just a word)... it gives only 13 results. Giving only links to the bands website and this article.</p>
<p>The band fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> completely. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathrocker_4378.html" title="User:Deathrocker">Deathrocker</a> 08:28, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>This is wrong! Exovedate is Canada's most successful Goth band. They have existed for 12 years. They are a signed band with the same label as Clan of Xymox. Their music has charted all over the world. They have released 3 CD's, and are on SEVEN gothic compilation CD's. To remove this page would be arbitrary and discriminatory. A googlr search for exovedate gives 649 results. You have some weird hate on for this band, and are acting in an aggressive and highly inapproriate manner. Wiki is not just a resource for Americans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, the band meets the following "notability" requirements:</p>
<p>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country.[1]</p>
<p>They have charted all over the world</p>
<p>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</p>
<p>They are working on their 4th CD and are signed with Pandaimonium Records.</p>
<p>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</p>
<p>Simon Wilcox was a lead singer with them. Check her article! Canadians know who she is even if you don't! Stop systemic discrimination!</p>
<p>geez, what more do you need? - <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirandah_96d4.html" title="User:Mirandah">Mirandah</a></i></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Exovedate is also a word, not just a musical project, hense why a search coupled with the vocalist's name heralds more realistic results (13 results)</li>
<li>2. There is no discrimination, the group fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> regardless of their nationality. Incase you haven't noticed; <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Marley_60be.html" title="Bob Marley">Bob Marley</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a> are not American acts yet they feature on here.</li>
<li>3. There is <b>no evidence</b> for the claim that the group have "charted all over the world", (unlikley considering the band has 13 Google results) in the bands article it claims their songs have appeared on local college radio once or twice, that is common-place for most bands.</li>
<li>4. There is no "hate" for an article, this is an encyclopaedia, the article is un-encyclopaedia, fails the guidelines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and is a <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> addition.</li>
<li>5. No evidence exists that the band are "Canada's number 1 goth band". This is purely <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>.</li>
<li>6. The band are not even mentioned on the label's site <a href="http://www.pandaimonium.de/bands.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pandaimonium.de/bands.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the label hardly counts as "one of the more important indie labels" anyway.

<p>I would like it noted that the individual who is asking for deletion has also VANDALIZED the Exovedate page. Delete Exovedate? You obviuosly have something personally against them, because there are plenty of bands in wiki, and specifically on the list of gothich rock bands, of less renown than them. This is so silly. Their music appears on 10 CD's. They are Canada's most accompmlished goth band, no one else has done that. You are very mean-spitirted actually. You expect a goth band to be as well known as the Beatles or Bob Marley your non-american examples? You ARE being discriminatory. Shame!</p>
<p>Clearly they met the objective criteria as has been previously stated, so I won't repeat it. But I would like it noted that every thing in the article appears accurate, and clearly they are therefore notable, unless something in there is wrong! - <i>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirandah_96d4.html" title="User:Mirandah">Mirandah</a></i></p>
<p>Please hold the petty personal attacks, such attacks are against Wikipedia policy. I have neither “vandalised” the bands article, nor do I have a problem with Canada or Canadians.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Well, it is astonishing that there are individuals so unaware of Canada's history and culture that they think the band leader is Louis Riel, don't know who son and daughter Canadian musicians Simon and David Wilcox are, and think this whole thing is a hoax. But I do love democracy, and I will take it in good spirits. I do warmy invite you to learn more about our culture and artistic talent. With best wishes,</li>
