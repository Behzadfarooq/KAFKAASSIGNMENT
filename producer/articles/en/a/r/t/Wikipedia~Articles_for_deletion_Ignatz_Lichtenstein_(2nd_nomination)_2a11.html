<li>Izak, please note that among the many reliable sources now discovered is the 1929 Hungarian Jewish Encyclopedia, and as such, it is (I hope) no longer possible for you to dismiss all the reliable sources as an elaborate conspiracy of Christian prosletysers. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 10:55, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kendrick7: Hungarian <a href="../../../g/o/u/Goulash.html" title="Goulash">goulash</a> is probably more authentic. People are missing the point entirely. There was and is absolutely <i>nothing</i> notable about Ignatz/Isaac either as a Jew or as a Christian. Note: Real rabbis with more achievements get deleted on Wikipedia simply because they are not notable, even if they have given speeches that were published. That Ignatz/Isaac allegedly wrote a few pamphlets and is quoted in missionary works and what the Messianic Jews are doing with him is an outright hoax because there is neither any meaning nor any impact of the tale about this totally insignificant "rabbi" from a Hungarian village having done what he allegedly did. Sure, those out to missionize the Jews may have thought they "struck gold" by grasping at this pathetic straw just as today's missionaries think they have uncovered some great "hero" here, worthy of a Wikipedia piece, when all they are holding onto is <a href="../../../f/o/o/Fools_gold.html" title="Fools gold">fools gold</a> - a true hoax. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Even if he's a hoax, he's a notable hoax, per <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Mikey_3d2e.html" title="Little Mikey">Little Mikey</a>. Further, I think it's difficult to argue Lichtenstein's non notable if he's cited as a notable founding father by today's Messianic Jews. Wikipedia comfortably accommodates many fictional characters of note... not to mention all the Biblical characters than non believers also consider to be fictional. The hoax issue is therefore a non starter. Notability is the key and if he's cited in key documentation used today by Messianic Jews I'd argue he's clearly notable. Sorry IZAK. I'm gritting my teeth and strengthening my keep vote above. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 09:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Dweller: And you can add the "non believers" as subscribing to the further fiction that <i>they</i> are <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolved</a> from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baboon.html" title="Baboon">baboon</a>-like <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neanderthal.html" title="Neanderthal">Neanderthals</a>. Lots of fictions up in the air today it seems, take your pick... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi Dweller: You seem to be mish-mashing a number of unrelated subjects. Ignatz/Isaac was not a "founding father" of <i>anything</i>, he died many years before the Messianic Jews and the Jews for Jesus movements were concocted by various <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical.html" title="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> churches in the USA. (BTW, The Catholics don't get involved in attempts at creating disguied versions of Christianity, they have enough confidence in their brand name.) And you are not clear, are you saying that you may even agree with me and that the entire story may be hype that is ultimately fiction? And are you implying that Lichtenstein is worthy of article based on a distorted "reciprocity" of "if you respect my hoaxes then I will respect yours" what kind of logic and basis for an encyclopedia is that? The Messianics (who are Christians) will grasp at any straw to further their self-appointed mission of converting the Jews and will stop at nothing, including accepting stories that they know nothing about, in order to buttress their mssionizing which is doomed to fail because it is based on half-truths (beginning with the biggest one, that they insist on calling themselves "Judaism" when they are in actuality Christianity.) But I guess, we will just have to allow this to play itself out over time... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 02:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't understand your point(s?). Evolution is notable and therefore has an article. Messianic Jews' claims about Lichtenstein make him notable, I'm afraid. It's not about respect or hoaxes, it's about notability. If a substantial group of people suddenly claimed that my aunt was important for some trumped up reason, even if they were wrong, she'd be notable and encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../d/w/e/User%7EDweller_2ebf.html" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> 11:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dweller: I was responding to your point that: "the Biblical characters that non believers also consider to be fictional" which is a pretty wild thing to throw into this discussion about a supposedly religious figure, since both Judaism and Christianity agree that the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> is 100% true, (and they obviously disagree about the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> because if they agreed to the New Testament as being true then there would not be Judaism, and if they agreed that the New Testament was false there would not be Christianity.) And I was merely adding an abvious rejoinder that if you throw in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> about "Biblical characters" perhaps being "fictional" then the counter-argument that evolutionists believe that they come from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baboon.html" title="Baboon">baboons</a> is an equally fantastic fiction and hoax for those who do not buy into mythological and known-to-be fraudulent unscientific evolutionary "theories" -- as Abraham Lincoln said "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time." What is so hard about grasping that? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> contemporary authors with more publications have been deleted as non-notable. Publishing stuff doesn't make you notable.

Among the reliable sources about him that were mentioned in the prior AFD and the Deletion Review is the <i>1929 Zsido Lexikon</i>, a Jewish Encyclopedia written in Hungarian. Other reliable sources about him exist, so he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the relevant standard. As an encyclopedia, it is arguably more important to cover historical figures than contemporary figures - and certainly articles on them are less often subject to spam concerns, so there are reasons for deleting contemporary figures that don't apply to historical figures. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
