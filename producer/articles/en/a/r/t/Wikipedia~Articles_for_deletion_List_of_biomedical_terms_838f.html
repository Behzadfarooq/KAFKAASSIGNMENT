<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</p>
<p>The cited article is just a placeholder for 27 long articles containing nothing but lists of terms:</p>

</ul>
<p>all of which I'm proposing for <b>deletion</b>. I only put the {{subst:vfd}} tag on the first one, because doing it 27 more times was too painful (and seemed rather pointless).</p>
<p>This is a huge list of terms imported from a thesaurus found on an NIH web site. They appear to be keywords culled from research grant applications. The problems are several. The vast majority don't link to anywhere. Many of the concepts have corresponding articles, but not under those exact names. It appears that the source is updated <i>weekly</i>, which means this list is out of date almost immediately. This is a mindless import of data, with no added encyclopedic value. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_biomedical_terms_002e.html" title="Talk:List of biomedical terms">Talk:List of biomedical terms</a> for more info.</p>
<p>This was on VfD recently in a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_biomedical_topics%2C_A_to_E_a9c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of biomedical topics, A to E">slightly different form</a>, and was voted to keep, but it appears to have been largely by default with little or no discussion and almost no voter input. I think it's worth another round, if only to build a strong consensus one way or the other.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> all. I originally split these into the separate pages (original sizes were huge) but realised that they were worthless as I proceeded through the job. As i said on the talk page for these lists, many of the topics in these lists are red links since they are not articles or stubs and never will be. Unless someone is willing to manually fix the links to the appropriate pages these lists will never be a useful indexing aid. For example the topic antisense nucleic acid should be a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisense_mRNA_f965.html" title="Antisense mRNA">Antisense mRNA</a>. We certainly do not want another antisense page yet these lists are almost invitations to start a new article. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 5 July 2005 02:47 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But are they missing articles? I think this is the main problem with this list. Do we want these articles? Why invite people to create articles that will eventually become merged or redirected? Why don't we focus on the important gaps. There are already wanted articles lists in wikipedia.

<dd>I think that would be a mistake. I just took a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles_25fe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles</a>. It says (in big friendly letters), <b>The main goal of this project is to ensure that Wikipedia has a corresponding article for every article in every other general purpose encyclopedia available</b>. That may be a laudable goal, but wholesale importation of this list isn't going to advance it. This isn't a list of somebody else's encyclopedia articles, it's a list of keywords from a database of research grants. It's not even clear that they came from a controlled vocabulary, such as <a href="../../../m/e/s/MeSH_c072.html" title="MeSH">MeSH</a>. What if somebody created List of every professional athelete who ever played in any sport? What about List of every license plate number ever issued in the US? Would those be worthy of becomming List of missing encyclopedia articles? <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 5 July 2005 14:41 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You know what - you're right, and I should have done more research first. We should certainly be looking out for a medical encyclopedia, and looking to match its coverage, but this list isn't it. It's more than just keywords, if you look at <a href="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/Thesaurus/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/Thesaurus/index.htm" rel="nofollow">CRISP</a>, but it is only a thesaurus, a controlled vocabulary. There are a huge number of terms in there that we <i>should</i> have articles for, but probably at least an equal number that we shouldn't, and there's no way (without specific knowledge of the topics, which I don't have) to tell which is which. Changing my vote to <b>delete</b>, unless anyone more knowledgeable wants to take it on. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">My Talk</a> July 5, 2005 15:29 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> for more reasons than I can count. I have faith that Wikipedia will soundly tackle the universe of necessary articles on biomedical terms without these eternal redlink monstrosities. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> July 6, 2005 04:31 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addendum, I just went through "G" and deleted entries for: garlic, grain, gravity, great ape, green tea, Greece, Greek, grief, ground water, ground hog, and ground squirrel. These are simply <i>not</i> biomedical terms. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 23:05, July 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can't do that! 'Garlic' and 'green tea' have well know medicinal properties. The 'greeks' have healthy food and 'grief' can be stressful leading to real medical issues. Not sure about great apes, are they model systems for medical research? OK I hope it's obvious I'm being sarcastic, ground hog, and ground squirrel for real?????? Let's just get rid of it. It is a worthless list. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 00:06, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No vote, but if this is deleted, add the red links to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:Requested articles</a> first. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> July 9, 2005 01:44 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I mentioned this above but here it is again. They should definitely not be requested articles. Why invite people to create articles that will eventually become merged or redirected? Why don't we focus on the important gaps? There are already many requested article lists in wikipedia with some very important topics that need to be started. The difference is that those articles have been requested for a reason. This is just a random list. Most of them are not missing articles. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> 22:35, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>This should not be deleated. It does provide a great way of redirection of definitions not found elsewhere.</p>
