<li><del><b>Keep</b></del> - I noticed some of the edits yesterday, appears to be a relatively new user (first edit 18 May 2005, quite a few since then) who may be unfamiliar with policy. Very cooperative and open to becoming better informed of policy. (I'm not the one to inform, perhaps someone with more knowledge can help?) The page was created in 2003 by an ip from austrailia, so I don't believe he made it himself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He seems notable. As far as Mgm's comment, it appears that an article on Scherer existed for over a year an half and was done by someone other than Scherer (judging by the content). If Scherer himself then expands it with acceptable content, that seems not only acceptable but desireable.

<li><b>Userfy</b> <u>or Delete</u>. The entire article has been typed by Karl Scherer except one single paragraph (the bit about the Turing machine). I believe we need to hold a firm line against self-promotion. Also note that the books are <b>self-published</b>, and the article has links to where you can buy them from <b>his site</b>. I can't remember ever seeing such a blatant attempt to use Wikipedia for financial gain. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) Mr. Scherer has edited from at least 5 IPs that I have found so far, so there is no way to know that he isn't the sole contributor to the article. Regardless, the total notability claims are, building a Turing machine (unverifiable), having a handful of articles published in a 'math puzzles' magazine, and self-publishing content in a variety of media; even combined that doesn't seem that notable, especially to waive the 'no self-promotion' policy. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 17:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>N.b. there is a formal policy, and many precedents, against an article being recreated in any namespace (including User space) in the event of a successful formal VfD.

<li>No it can't. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. I have seen no evidence whatsoever that the Turing Machine claim is valid, I have seen no evidence whatsoever that any other claim is valid. And for the subject of the article to be the provider of its content is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. I seriously doubt that <b>anyone</b> who is not Karl Scherer or a close associate/friend of his, would <b>ever</b> produce any of the information in this article, unless they had read this one first.

<li><b>Delete</b>. He doesn't appear to be notable as a mathematician, or recreational mathematician. 4 articles in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics, 1 in the American Math Monthly: that's fairly typical for a postdoc / assistant professor trying to get a tenure-track position. 4 books is somewhat impressive, if they were successful. Were they? <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">dbenbenn</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/e/User_talk%7EDbenbenn_8e6c.html" title="User talk:Dbenbenn">talk</a> 28 June 2005 23:54 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This has been on VfD since 21st, i.e. over the 5 day standard period. The current state of votes by my reckoning is 1 Abstain, 5 Keep, 12 Delete. Making a clear 2/3 majority for delete. Is there any reason this is still on VfD? <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 29 June 2005 21:23 (UTC)
