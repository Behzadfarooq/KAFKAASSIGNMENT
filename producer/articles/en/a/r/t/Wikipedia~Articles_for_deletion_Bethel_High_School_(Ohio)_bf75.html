<p>Not notable high school. Jeez, people at least make an effort to make it notable if you must have an article about your school! <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 15:19, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. My position after long consideration is that high schools (of any substantial size) should be considered <i>per se</i> notable to end the endless debates. These articles are also a good gateway for future contributors. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:02, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Every school is notable to its ex-scholars. There have been bouts of debate about schools pages before. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Appleyard_20bf.html" title="User:Anthony Appleyard">Anthony Appleyard</a> 17:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hence my reference to ending the "endless debates." <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 17:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Newyrokbrad, you could end the endless debates by taking the opposite position as well: every school is non notable unless notability is verifiably demonstrated. This would be equally clear, and would bring schools in line with all other subjects, instead of making an arbitrary exception. As for being a good gateway for future contributors; they are also a good gateway for vandals and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violations (with comments on individual teachers and co-students). Taking such a principal position as yours only helps in antagonizing those people who feel that schools should not get a special treatment. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Whatever. We need a policy (I know one is being batted out) and a way to implement it. There are over a hundred similar stub articles for Ohio alone, and it probably run into the thousands for the nation, to say nothing of the rest of the world. In my opinion, a secondary school should either be notable of itself, or else should be subject to speedy deletion if no notability (famous alumni, notable nationally for its sports program, famous or infamous incident took place there) is shown.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 13:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This school's recent basketball state championship makes it notable. I vote to keep the article. Not sure why some users in here are quick to nominate for deletion. EagleFan 15:13, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Six years ago? EagleFan, I realize you have an interest in this, since your user contributions reflect that you do almost nothing but create and edit articles about high schools and lists of high schools, but is a six year old championship (and how many champions does Ohio have in a year, how many groups are there?) enough?--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 15:21, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>See my point. Wehwalt, like several others, is on a mission to delete pages rather than add content. That will work against Wikipedia's long-term development into the premier encylopedia in the world. EagleFan 15:41, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh come on, EagleFan, I have nominated perhaps 20 articles for deletion. I have contributed to dozens of times that many articles. Let's not engage in invective.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 00:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to encourage everyone here to "assume good faith". It seems to me that we all want Wikipedia to be the best it can be, but we interpret this in different ways and have different talents at the service of the project. Let's try to "play well with others". <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 20:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> a summary into the <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipp_City%2C_Ohio_7d9f.html" title="Tipp City, Ohio">Tipp City, Ohio</a> article. If not then keep. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 20:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. This article was created as a Stub on 1/26/07 and should be given a chance to gain some traction. Seems like a "Stub" article ought to at least be given a few months before being nominated randomly by another user. EagleFan 20:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> I understood the policy on stubs was to keep them if it appeared possible for them to become an article. I think that unlikely, --almost no stub for HS ever develops content. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:02, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, with particular reference to <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>'s comment. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 20:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Newyorkbrad and my belief that secondary schools and above are inherently notable, or notable enough to be included within Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Yamaguchi先生</a> 07:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
