<dd><b>Comment</b> - It is not my first day as a user here! I have had the user ID for sometime. I don't know how to check, when I signed up, but I'm sure you do. So check. This is my first time submitting an article. I am working on the article, thanks for asking. I thank the user who constructivly pointed me in the right direction on how to fix the article. If he is logging with the same IP fraudentally then delete it. If the author of Xplicit doesn't want to take the time to correct his own article then delete it. All I am saying is that when someone is new here and just getting used to your rules then offer him a a bit of kindness. Instead of the elitest attitude that I was offered.

<li><b>Merging with another Article</b>. I understand the concerns raised. Perhaps this would be better suited as an addition to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_examination.html" title="Bar examination">Bar examination</a> Article? Though it is primarily a list, failing the bar exam is certainly a subject for consideration when discussing the bar examination. While I don't want to see the article removed, I'd like to see the information added to another thread. Which thread, I leave to the administration. Hoops80 00:36, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, this information is much better suited to individual biographies. Secondly, this list is fairly useless on its own, as it doesn't differentiate by state - failing the California bar is different than failing the South Dakota bar - they're two totally different exams. If this was a list of, say, notable people who had failed the California bar, that would be a good addition to show how difficult that exam is. This list, however, provides no useful context, and as such, merging it with the bar examination article is rather pointless, as it cannot be used to prove points of any single state's bar exam as it is currently written. -- <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiegoTehMexican_cad6.html" title="User:DiegoTehMexican">DiegoTehMexican</a> 00:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> useful. Also, when someone complains that an editor has notified others about the debate I am immediately suspicious of why the complainer doesn't want a more inclusive debate.

Not all subjects have info boards, however, and unless the editor who <b>has been</b> notified complains, I see no reason for others to do so: the fact that someone tracked down the other person's edits is further indicatiion of the weakness of the tracker's position. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I believe that you are referring to me. Firstly, detecting canvass is not an uncommon procedure and it's essential to ensure that there is no interference in consensus building. Then, if I complain about canvass that's because I think it is something to be promptly frown upon, not because I want to stall incoming opposition to my stance on a discussion (in fact, in at least one occasion I have reported canvass carried by users that shared my view). The canvass situation that occurred here was more like a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wp%7Espam.html#Friendly_notice" title="Wp:spam">friendly notice</a> which can be accepted if performed in a very limited number. In fact, user Clevelander contacted me and expressed that there was no intention to canvass, for which I assumed good faith and retreated the canvass acusation as you can see above. Your argument about posting on info boards is unrelated. Advertising AfD's on info boards is acceptable, for such procedure is prone to attract both supporters and opponents. Now, when you select specific users and coax them to participate, then that's canvassing and I will always have a firm stand against it. Last but not least, you should have assumed <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> as well before attacking me for ensuring that a clean discussion may take place here.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 17:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I dispute your premise that exclusion of people interested makes the consensus or discussion "clean". A spam-blast of everybody is uncalled-for, selected notices to people who may not have been paying attention is fine. You can call it canvassing, but as you know, these discussions are not votes, so if the "canvassee" only contributes a "keep" or "delete" it won't carry much weight. However, some canvasees can put forward an argument missed by other editors or put an argument in a more cohesive and pithy way. And why would that be wrong? Consensus shouldn't be sought to the exclusion of editors' opinions. I have had friendly messages removed from my talk page by editors who think that such removal is warranted. I assume good faith, but recognize that you are just doing what you're doing because of the weakness of your position. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> General comment concerning the above keep's. Most of you want the article kept provided it's sourced properly. The problem is that it can never be sourced properly as there have never been any Armenian rebellions in the Ottoman Empire.

This was clearly not the case with Bulgarians, Greeks or Serbs who had easy access to European powers.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 19:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>At risk of not assuming good faith here, I unfortunately have to note that most <i>keep</i> votes are from people of Turkish origin and almost every <i>delete</i> vote from someone of Armenian origin. As I also stated above, it is difficult to find independent sources for stuff like this. I based my keep vote and subsequent rewrite largely on this Armenian source: <a href="http://www.armenianhistory.info/western.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.armenianhistory.info/western.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which also states that <i>The 20s and the 30s of the 19th century were marked by a series of revolts of the non-Turkish peoples throughout the Ottoman Empire. ...

I haven't read it, but if the Turks are supporting it and the Armenians not, then there must be something going on here that I don't understand. Normally, I'd think it the other way around, (e.g., with the Irish example, the english would be annoyed, and the Irish proud), especially with words like "Armenian genocide" which usually offend the Turks.

<li><b>Weak Delete or keep with a rename</b> This RFD is problematic, because it seems as a borderline cases at first (but which isen't) and for this reason is more open to results which might be influenced by bias from both sides. One of the problems I believe is that for some the term rebellion has negative conotations, it does not necessarly have such negative conotation (see for example what led to the American war for independence). I do believe the potential of such an article, but the title is problematic and does not respect the majority position to term those incidents, each of the reported rebellions from the Ottoman Empire have found echo in the west as a massacre of Armenians, one of those pre 1870's was what was termed the Tigris massacre in 1867. So in this cases, we need to find a more encyclopedic title for such an article, which I believe has real potentials. Then why so my 'weak delete'? Well, because there isen't much valuable content as of now in that article(properly sourced that is), and the title is difficult to handle, as in the majority of the cases if not all that term is the minority position, since those incidences are more properly termed 'Armenian massacres,' and the direction this article could take would be FORK if worked as is. Thosefor, I don't see a loss of deleting an article which neither right now has the content neither the title to be kept. And without those two there is not justification to keep. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. What is the meaning of "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Israel (disambiguation)">Israel</a>" in the title? Ancient Israel, the northern kingdom (i.e. Samaria), modern Israel? The article seems to imply that it is biblical Israel, though it ends with a rather general statement about modern Judaism.</dd>
<dd>2. It never establishes whether the term <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste system</a> should be applied to biblical Israel. What sense of the term "caste" is valid here? Is this an anachronistic term introduced by western scholars based on their view of Indian culture?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>,It's my church and it's notable to me! wikipedia is an encyclopedia so you should be able to look all things up. The AOL dictionary describes an encyclopedia as "a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject." It says all branches of knowledge. is an individual church that much of a problem? I think not. this article is a way to show people what the story is on this church. Numerous times i drive past churches and want to know more, like wow thats a nice looking church, when was it built or Melkite? whats that?

There have been several articles like when the church's greek school met with the mayor and when the church had a greek food booth at Woburn's holiday festival.

<li><b>Response comment</b> Thus far we haven't been forced to codify anything about houses of worship. Very few churches are notable. Structures may be architecturally notable as a building. Congregations may be notable for their impact or influence. The best evidence of such notability in either case is that independent reliable sources (not the congregation, the diocese, the denomination, etc...) have chosen to write material about them.</li>
<li>The "all X are notable" is rejected for most subjects X - countries, nobel prize winners, and heads of state are the sorts of things where it is accepted; either because the subject indicates that someone else has determined notability (nobel prize winners) or because of their worldwide importance (countries, heads of state). My test for the "all X are notable" argument is "are we an incomplete encyclopedia because we lack an article on the least important X ever to have existed that could still be documented from reliable sources". For local items like schools and churches, we aren't incomplete because we lack an article on a school or church that existed for a few years in a now ghost town that was around for a few years during a mining boom or was open in a temporary refugee camp. We can be a complete encyclopedia, even one that is not paper, while not having articles on lots and lots of schools or churches. Go look at another encyclopedia and see how many schools/churches they cover. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Yea, but in other encyclopedias the readers don't get to choose whats in it. Some random people make the choices and whos to say they're right. The reason you have so many articles up for deletion is because the readers finally have a choice to add articles, yet others are trying to take out these individuals' hard work because THEY don't like it. It's up to actual readers of the encyclopedia, not its editors who probably don't even use it like normal people.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please don't take offense, I am not "trying to be destructive." I have not (and can not) delete your articles. I just have listed it here to see what other editors think about their inclusion into an encyclopedia, and the consensus will decide what to do.

The lists had no context to indicate that they were anything more. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 22:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, if you read the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatting</a> page it would provide more context but I dont believe Mladifilozof originally provided the link, so i take your point.</dd>
<dd>My point was that although as you say we can now debate the page(s) here and reach consensus, if you read the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for deletion</a> page it does suggest in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#Before_nominating_an_AfD" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#Before_nominating_an_AfD" rel="nofollow">Before nominating an AfD</a> section such steps as the following:</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Squats all have an element of protest, some more so than others, and in the context of those protests as well as of government failures to provide affordable housing, can be the subjecty of encyclopedic articles. This list is useful because the redlinks represent potential new encyclopedic articles, or perhaps redirects to articles dealing with broader protests in the United Kingdom. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 02:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Personally, I would fully support an article titled "Squatting in the UK" which delves into the history and social import of such protests, with a list at the end of the article. I don't see the utility of simply a list of places where people squat -- there's no context and no assertion of notability. I mean how would one even know what squatting is? <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 03:02, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In my opinion, there is no need for a "Squatting in the UK" page until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting#Squatting_in_the_United_Kingdom" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting#Squatting_in_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">section</a> in the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatting</a> page gets big enough for it to deserve its own entry. I think you have missed the context here Leuko and I can only hope you did do some research before making this AfD and then broadening it. If we <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> the new pages are branching off from <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">Squatting</a> as I mentioned in my keep vote below ... therefore I think these pages do not need to be deleted but rather if there are issues with the individual lists, then they should be discussed on the lists' respective talk pages. <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 22:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came here becuase i saw Squats in The Netherlands has been put up for deletion, which is a bit strange since it is a perfectly acceptable list of notable squats, being slowly added to over time, with stub pages being added as blue links. It shoots off from the list of notable squats on the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">Squatting</a> page and that seems entirely reasonable. So keep that page.</dd>
<dd>Keep Squats in Spain too, indeed keep all Squats in X pages if they branch off from the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">Squatting</a> page, under my reasoning above.</dd>
<dd>Now for the UK i dont think that Squats in UK and Social centers in the United Kingdom are the same thing at all. Often social centres are squatted but not always for example the London Action Resource Centre is a legally owned space, Emmas want to (and mayeb now did) to buy a building etc etc. I think a list of social centres would be useful, and should be linked to from the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatting</a> page. I think for now a list of UK squats should remain on that page until such a time as the list gets big enough to deserve its own page. AND while yer at it, keep to 'the United Kingdom'not 'UK' and 'social centre' not 'social center'!!<a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMujinga_2c8b.html" title="User:Mujinga">Mujinga</a> 21:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> There's a very good reason the list contains red links. It's a list of shopping malls - only so many malls are notable. Do you really want someone to come through and write an article about every mall? "XYZ is a shopping mall located in City, Maryland. It has this store and this store and this store and this store. It has a parking lot. It has this and this and this and this in the food court." I understand that sometimes lists can help to point out notable entries needing to be created, but I don't see that this list has chosen an appropriate topic for which to do so.

<li>As an exercise in testing the preceding claims that this is original research and impossible to construct in a verifiable manner, I've attacked the list of clichés in music#Lyrics section with the merciless sword of verifiability, and discovered that it <i>is</i> possible to construct a list of verifiable lyrical clichés. All of the items now in the list have citations to people identifying the clichés in question. The cited sources are not simply song reviewers saying "song X contains cliché Y", as <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> suggests above, but are people specifically identifying a lyrical cliché in its own right, independent of any specific songs.
<p>Given that it is evidently possible to construct that section in a verifiable manner, without performing any primary research (e.g. reading and analysing song lyrics directly), it seems likely that it is possible to do the same for the other sections. (If it isn't, then we can simply erase them.) The problems with this article don't require an administrator to hit a delete button. They require ordinary editors to exercise the same merciless sword of verifiability across the rest of the article that I've exercised over one section, and to insist upon sources for any future additions, to stop editors from adding their own personal notions of clichés to the article. Administrators aren't required for that. Even editors without accounts can do that. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>delete</b>, (swayed from a swift and firm <i>kill with fire</i> by UncleG), although the article is conceivably fully sourcable, the subject is simply too huge to make a meaningful list. Each genre and period of music has its own cliches. What would be a cliche in a madrigal might be seen as an innovation in a rap song. Ok, I admit that I added the 16th century thing a while ago, because I ran into it in a source. I think a more specific list might make sense and be encyclopedic, but the scope of this list is simply too huge. It applies to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>, rap, 14th century madrigals, 16th century madrigals, 13th century Chinese folk music, gamelan music, trance music, minimalist music, etc. Just check out <a href="../../../m/u/s/Category%7EMusic_genres_bfbc.html" title="Category:Music genres">Category:Music genres</a>, which is far from complete. I just think this list's purported scope is far too broad to be at all meaningful, apart from it's current issues with "truth" and actually being verified. This page has already been through AfD, I already wrote on the talk page that another AfD was sure to follow. Almost no editors followed that with actually fixing the article. I think this has been given it's chance, and should now be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 23:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unless it can be completely stripped of original research and unsourced claims. What genres are being referred to could also do with more clarification - an article titled "List of clichés in music" is an incredibly large scope, but clearly things like "baby" refer specifically to modern pop music. Also there is a POV issue - cliche does not just mean it is common, but implies overused. So what, long songs shouldn't be last anymore? Many things listed here are characteristics of various genres, which should be mentioned on the relevant article, but are not cliches. And I do love being told how "Long songs with few lyrics" often contain few lyrics and long instrumentals, wow, thanks for that. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 01:44, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Very legitimate topic. I have a BS in Songwriting. Pop music is full of cliches, from artist behavior to marketing concepts to rhymes in lyrics. The exposure of cliches serves as a driver for originality, but also shows the value in using cliches.

Going through google hits on "Tiffany Teen" just results in a lot of spam and porn sites, nothing consider <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. In fact, a reliable source for a biography should <i>at minimum</i> have the girl's real name. Considering the most reliable thing I could find is one blog with the name( and a bunch of dead links) suggests that reliable source will be close to immpossible to find. No reliable sources mean there's no way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the information. —<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 02:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Three things. One, the search engine test page you refer to explicitly states this: "The simple Google test by number of hits is not applicable to people or titles within a number of internet-based businesses, notably (but by no means restricted to) pornography." So your Google and Alexia ratings are invalid. Second, Andrew Lenahan wasn't the person who put Mistress Yvette up for AFD, <b>I</b> was, and I'm far from an anti-porn crusader (hint: take a look at the participants list for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Porn_stars_4b1f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Porn stars">Wikipedia:WikiProject Porn stars</a>). Thirdly, as someone said elsewhere on Wikipedia, "We are trying to make Wikipedia a reputable encyclopedia, not an exciting editorial", which brings us right back to the question of whether these people deserve mention in Wikipedia, which is why we have AFD procedures. <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabercil_a2ff.html" title="User:Tabercil">Tabercil</a> 23:47, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Porn in a different animal than any other aspect of the entertainment industry. According to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> magazine, Americans alone spend from $6 billion to $10 billion on porn <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2005/11/03/ipod-porn-digital-cx_pk_1104iporn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.forbes.com/2005/11/03/ipod-porn-digital-cx_pk_1104iporn.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. With these kind of numbers, there's a conspicuously lack of mainstream media coverage on specific porn personalities, despite the gigantic popularity of porn. How many people openly admit to consuming porn? I think most will agree that it's not as many that admit to seeing <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_Prairie_Home_Companion_%28film%29_56f8.html" title="A Prairie Home Companion (film)">A Prairie Home Companion</a>, which grossed just over $20 million.

Even though a google search for "Tiffany Teen" will bring up over 1.4 million hits, Entertainment Tonight won't be profiling her. Just because the "typical" media outlets don't write about her, doesn't at all mean she's invisible or nn. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 01:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability isn't the direct issue here; it is verifiability. Notability (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) isn't a criteria on which to delete but a gauge to determine whether the subject's notability is high enough that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> exist (so that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> &amp; <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> aren't violated).

<li>I agree. It's just with this genre, a "reliable source" is hard to come by as most mainstream journalistic outlets generally don't report on specific personalities. That's why my vote included a "weak". In porn, we just can't always verify notability even if notability exists. I'll look for proper articles, but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed that I'll find any. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 05:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You must understand, though, that as an encyclopedia our scope is limited to what can be verified by reliable sources. If you're pretty sure she's popular but can't find sources saying so (because people won't admit it, according to your logic), then sorry but that's not good enough. The same argument could be used to insert all sorts of ludicrous stuff into Wikipedia: "I'm pretty sure lots of people secretly keep unicorns as pets, but I can't find any sources because nobody's willing to admit it." etc. Hopefully you understand why we strongly demand reliable sources. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:40, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>According to <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> one qualifying criteria is: "Performer has been the subject of a noteworthy news piece or controversy, whether through adult film industry news or (preferably) in "mainstream" news outlets." The paragraph about Tiffany Teen in the mainstream <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_News_072a.html" title="Wired News">Wired News</a> reference seems to be such a news piece. That article is even cited in the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_child_modeling.html" title="Internet child modeling">Internet child modeling</a> and so far nobody there has contested that article as unreliable.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 20:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Take note of the wording: "Performer has been the <b>subject of</b> a noteworthy news piece". Not <b>mentioned in</b>. There's a big difference between the two, and Tiffany is <b>NOT</b> the subject of that Wired article. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a> 22:02, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have the qualifier "primary" to "subject of" the news piece. It was already established that the reference to Tiffany Teen is brief. The primary subject is internet teen porn and it cites the Tiffany Teen subject as a controversial example. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 22:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I had a look at the Wired article. While it would be a great reference for a general article about sites of this type, it only mentions Tiffany once (bizarrely, the one fact about her it does verify, about a $75 video, isn't in Tiffany's article!). The facts that are in the Tiffany article are absolutely not backed up by this reference. If we cut the article down to what is verifiable based on the Wired mention, the article would be about 8 words long. You can see why more coverage than that is needed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 23:08, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is true that the Wired article does not verify a majority of this article (as commented below). It does verify that this subject is controversial and was worth a citation in the Wired article. I won't value it any more than for what it is. I do agree that if this article stays (I doubt it by these votes), as strictly verifiable by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidlines, it should probably be no more than a couple of sentences. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 23:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree wholeheartedly. However, I would also say that an article which can only ever have one or two sentences worth of verifiable information is a prime example of an article which should not be part of an encyclopedia... or, at the very least, is a topic better covered in a another article rather than its own. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did. And if you read further, it says "The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">provide references</a>. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." The point I am trying to make is that if nobody can be arsed to add links to the article, then it needs to be deleted. It is <i>not</i> enough that it is theoretically possible to find sources for the article. --<span style="border:3px solid #00f;font-weight:bold;background-color:#c00;"><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk"><span style="color:#fff;">RoninBK</span></a><sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk"><span style="background-color:#00f;color:#fff;">T</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk"><span style="background-color:#00f;color:#fff;">C</span></a><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_Esperanza_3389.html" title="User:Roninbk/Esperanza"><span style="background-color:#090;color:#fff;">E</span></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Roninbk" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Roninbk" rel="nofollow"><span style="background-color:#00f;color:#fff;">#</span></a></span></sub></span> 01:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>And my point is that if an article is reasonably encyclopedic (which ofcourse is worth a discussion by itself), you should give editors some time to add sources. You cannot force sources onto an article by listing it at AfD. AfD is meant for deletion, not for asking for sources (there are tags for that). This article has been around only since the 6th of october and deserves some time to develop before it is listed here. Such a quick deletion after it was created might be suitable for really bad articles, but not if the main concern is the lack of sources. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>Let's take a step back here. The main concern over this article was that someone thought it was spam. It was taken here because of an edit war. This is why the article needs to be sourced, to prove it's not spam. And by the way, thank you for adding the links you found.

<li>You are quite right that we got a bit carried away. But the article ended up here because of one editor, who originally tagged it for speedy deletion and who did show quite some bad faith when others not agreed to the speedy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ODIS&amp;diff=79843267&amp;oldid=79826166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ODIS&amp;diff=79843267&amp;oldid=79826166" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> and to the prod <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ODIS&amp;diff=80341139&amp;oldid=80277777" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ODIS&amp;diff=80341139&amp;oldid=80277777" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. Note that removing these tags is specifically <i>allowed</i> by policy. But then again, you are right any article should be referenced properly.

<li><b>Keep</b> The real problem is that there isn't that much information about the season yet, but given that the series has been renewed for a 19th season, and you can check any number of press articles about that, so Crystal ball arguments are pretty weak, since it is so likely the article will just have to be recreated later.

<dd>Well, if Fox hadn't said they were renewing till the 19th Season as part of the press release for the 18th and the movie, I might agree with you, but since they did, I see this serving as a useful placeholder.

Delete as unencylopedic, <i>unless</i> some sources are added.

<li><b>Question</b> Thank You Freshgavin for being helpful. I am trying to fix this, but to be deleted with no reason and no suggestions is very frustrating! I will ad footnotes. My Formatting is off. I admit it. I don't know what you mean by there is "no attempt to establish a context" Also what is "A stub with links to discogs? There is no copyright violation. How could there be? Is there some better manner to discus this? This site is very difficult to navigate, and use. Just to post an article you need to learn a book. The reason I thought it was a homophobic thing is because NalinWiki has 3 complaints against him for being homophobic, and I could get no constructive critismn.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, after discounting the&#160;!votes from non-established Wikipedians.

<p>It doesn't seem notable and there's always been a lack of sources. Looks to be from original research and unverifiable research, too. The one news source indicates that there should be an AOL4FREE article, but not an article on "AOHack programs" in general. Maybe AOL4FREE should just be a note in the <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a> article and nothing more? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 12:15, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> AOL4FREE was a program that became famouse due to Nicholas Ryan being prosecuted. The others, and there were 100s, didn't achieve the notoriety but were used even more. However, to ignore the fact that these programs existed and were a major part of the America Online community in the mid 90s would be wrong. These programs were the first mass distributors of pirated software and mp3s and is often recognized as the precursor to massive online peer to peer file transfer systems such as Napster and Bittorrent. By the way, my searches lead me to several websites with lists of the programs. Just because you guys aren't looking past page 2 on your google search doesn't mean you should delete it. My suggestion is this, in the program list, the unverified programs should be removed but I can find plenty of references to about 20% of the programs in there. Also, if you guys are search "AOhack programs", you are searching wrong. 68.196.250.47 05:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> There are several references you can get that these programs were valid and a significant part of AOL for a number of years. The previous poster was right. You can't serach "AOHack Programs" and expect to get results from google. There are way too many wikipedia mirrors that drown out the term now. AOHack Programs is just a generic term. Some people called them AOL Proggies, AOL Progz, AOLHacks, AOHell Clones, etc... There were a million names so a generic serach or one name, specifically the title of the wikipedia article itself will naturally not yield any results. There are legitimate lists of programs that were popular that still exist. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/fl/bda/passw.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.angelfire.com/fl/bda/passw.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ma/peterton/prog.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ma/peterton/prog.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. On top of that, these programs faded out nearly 10 years ago and the detailed information on them is not widely available. There were literally hundreds of programs and I do think that the "list" of programs needs to be cut down. The scene was described here <a href="http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/historyofaolwarez.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/historyofaolwarez.htm" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> and programs were reviewed here [<a href="http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/aolprogs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rajuabju.com/warezirc/aolprogs.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>] There is an old copy of a newsletter that reviewed many of the popular programs.<a href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/apoc2k/hacktext/aonewz.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://packetstormsecurity.org/apoc2k/hacktext/aonewz.txt" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. And, that was just with 2 minutes of searching. There is a lot of info out there but you have to know how to find it. Part of the problem is that to have good search results, you need to have atleast a significant amount of knowledge of these programs, the AOL warez scene, and the state of AOL at the time. I'm assuming most of you who simply find "wikipedia mirrors" don't. That's no reason to delete it. I agree that this article has a lot of unverified information but that doesn't mean the rest of the article is non notable and should be deleted. I noticed a trend in the history of people adding single programs which were most likely the programmers themselves adding their program to the list. I suggest the program section be cleaned up and only notable and/or referencable programs be allowed on the list. I suggest the non-notables be added individually with a requirement to reference it. That way, we don't get someone cutting and pasting an entire list of 100s of programs into the article. Also, the private room list needs to be cutdown as well. As far as I know and can find, the only rooms that should be in the list were "Warez", "Freewarez", and "MacWarez". The fact of the matter is, these programs were very popular, used by millions of people at the time, and they were significant part of the history of AOL security flaws, warez developement, file transfer, and led to the prosecution of a few people which made national headlines. This article needs cleaning up not deleting. Please keep it. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECoumarin_255c.html" title="User:Coumarin">Coumarin</a> 17:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> There's no reason to delete it. Just remove the unverifiable stuff. There's been more than enough links provided. Read them. Google search statistics mean nothing. TheArizona5 21:57, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>, but <b>split</b> the AOL4Free program into its own article. 24.55.106.132 01:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I disagree with doing this. AOL4Free wasn't close to any of the more popular programs in popularity. It wasn't used nearly as frequently as the others. It gained recognition from the media due to the legal ramifications. That doesn't make the others non-notable as they were used by more people.BenihanaLee 21:45, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Here's your reason Cyberskull: Per WP:V, "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." It also fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> on 'a subject needs to be of sufficient importance that there are multiple reliable secondary sources, independent of the subject, on which we can base a verifiably neutral article without straying into original research.'<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>And I assert WP:V is a cleanup criterion first, and a deletion criterion next, only to be applied when there's absolutely no question there's no reliable sources out there and even the program itself was written and documented by an unreliable madman. Barring damning proof to the contrary, the project itself qualifies as a source for the program's features. My sources, below, say FCE Ultra has demonstrable notability. Therefore, the whole thing doesn't preclude a stub that says basic information about the program. Because if you're unwilling to consider the subject a reliable source for <i>certain kinds</i> of assertions, you're in <i>gobloads</i> of hot water with <i>bazillions</i> of articles. In that case, we might as well wipe the Wikipedia database and start rebuilding it with a brave new policy "every character must have a source, or else". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Okay, wires-crossitude is apparent, so let's all calm down. My apologies for everyone involved, it's been rough lately.

<ul>
<li>Even though this seems to have settled a bit, I wanted to interject a something that might be enlightening to those who are sitting on the sidelines. (It's a bit of an expansion of what wwwwolf is getting at below, too.) There are two different measures that care about sources: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Interestingly, they treat sources in different, but overlapping ways. When notability is caring about sources, it wants multiple, non-trivial, independent sources. This is different from verifiability's requirements, which are they they are reliable and support the assertion in question. What's interesting is that a source that satisfies V can be one that doesn't satisfy NN (say, if it's reliable but trivial), and one that satisfies NN can be one that doesn't satisfy V (say, if it's major, independent, there are more than one, but it's contains nothing useful to the encyclopedia).
<p>In this case, sources are irrelevant to notability because of the "included in a major distribution such as Debian" clause of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Thus, the fact that the website of FCE Ultra is not independent isn't an issue, since only NN cares about independence in this way. (Aside, V cares about independence, but for reasons unrelated to this discussion.) What results is a situation where a source can be both "bad" and "good" in an AfD, depending on what outstanding issues need to be satisfied. Specifically, a source can be useless to establish notability, but can be relevant to establish verifiability. It can be the case that no independent, multiple, non-trivial sources exist on a subject but the subject passes some other notability criteria, at which point these otherwise "inadequate" sources actually are enough to prevent an article's deletion on grounds of "unverifiability", because they make the subject verifiable.</p>
<p>I hope this has been interesting (and accurate? let me know otherwise), despite it being a long tangent. I've tripped over this subtle difference myself in the past. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 22:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Debian popcon, which is an external source <i>specifically</i> listed as an example of a tool for gauging package popularity in WP:SOFTWARE, <i>confirms</i> this. Therefore, notability per WP:SOFTWARE is not in question, <i>and</i> it's confirmed by an independent source. So what <i>exactly</i> is the problem with this? Inclusion in Debian and its apparent popularity there is <i>solely</i> enough to mark the software as notable enough in my opinion. You don't <i>need</i> anything else.

<li>I posted this article as a first-time contributor to wikipedia, and I have been trying to edit it to address some of the objections raised. It is not in any way advertising. There is no product. I think the subject should be included in wikipedia because health advocacy is a growing field in health care and something that is important for people (consumers, patients, families, professionals etc.) to know about. This is not original research. I just put together existing information about health advocacy to explain it to readers. I hope this submission will be reviewed again. (yesterday's unsigned posting not intentional) Mhurst 13:36, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suspect that the opinions that this was original research were based solely upon the title and the presence of the signature. Both were easily fixed. This appears, to me, to be an encyclopaedia article on the subject of health advocacy that cites 17 sources. There are things wrong with it, such as its poor introduction that doesn't use summary style, its myopic focus upon the United States, and its lack of sourcing for an entire section, but fixing them doesn't require an administrator to use administrator tools. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>What troubles me is that it seems to be trying to justify the existence of a non-notable field/service, in order to generate free exposure/publicity/whatever.

<li>The reason for this article is to gather and condence the facts around this regulator topology because it's very interesting from a technical point of view and it has also a certain aura as something "super". There are a couple of commercial products and also a couple of DIY products which we can call "semi-commercial" or "hobby level". My contribution will be to point to the difference between a conventional regulator and this "super" regulator. What I had in mind was to draw a couple pictures with only necessary elements, only for pedagogical purposes. Those who want a very detailed description may read the articles by Mr. Walt Jung. Notice that Walt Jung has written about the regulator and also made together with Mr. Jan Didden a printed circuit board which neither of them sell. Audio Xpress sells this particualr pcb but remember that the article is 10 years old and the pcb is not very adopted to pratical usage. From the discussion over at www.diyaudio.com much info has been gathered but who have the energy to read all that. I admit that I sell a pcb once in a while but the main purpose here is to gathering knowledge. I don't think either that I would sudeenly sell thousands of boards. This will never happen. I don't mind to merge the article to voltage regulators but I plan to write much more. The 709 schematic is an example of a super regulator from the "stone age" sort of speaking and this serves as a background. I think also that a couple of photos of super regulators would be appropiate. I have take photos of a dozen different types and before publication I will the people behind those if it's OK to publish them.</li>

<li>How come? A few brilliant keystrokes and you'll get something extra in performance. I'll admit that this isn't basic knowledge exactly, more like expert knowledge but since many people have or will be hearing about this regulator type I think an article is pretty good. I don't know if you know electronics but this regulator is a factor of 1000 better in many parameters!</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I think in some ways Ottawa is comparible to New York--if not in size--given that it is Canada's national seat of government. That being said, it's city council seat, not a mayorship. She is mentioned in google news, but they are very brief mentions that tell you little more than that she exists. Fails WP:BIO as the press coverage must be <i>significant</i>, I think the G11 and A7 cases are difficult to make. I think it asserts why she is important (in a very POVish kind of way) and I'm not sure how I feel about G11 for candidates.

<p><b>Consideration for not deleting of this article</b>. Christine has been a significant civic contributor in Ottawa and will continue to be an active community individual after the election. The charities she has worked with are all registered charities that do good work for the people of Ottawa. You should know that currently there are a number of candidates running in this election posted on Wikipedia who, like Christine, are candidates running for elected office for the first time, but are not ungoing any sort of similar consideration for deletion. Her civic awards and recognition are significant and well documented in press coverage. Please take this into consideration. Grahame5 13:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)grahame5</p>

There has been some publication on the idea since, some two dozen articles on the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Sixth+Party+System&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=Sixth+Party+System&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">Sixth Party System</a> (scholar.google).

(The other four Systems all lasted about thirty years.) None of these appear to support the idea that he Sixth Party System has already come into existence, <b>and</b> has been replaced by a Seventh, as the article claims. Aldrich's article is a fringe variation on a relatively minor idea.

<li>Septentrionalis, would you be comfortable with removing this article from the template (or perhaps retitling it to reflect it's exclusion from Key's book), and boldly noting that it is not one of his original five? To me, this other scholarship makes the SPS not original research, though one might argue that it's poor research.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should certainly be removed from the template. The present article is worse than poor research; it is asserting one opinion, from one paper, in Wikipedia's voice. Scholar.google.com shows twenty-three articles that use the term with various dates for its beginning; at least two of them mention the SPS to assert that it does not exist. There is no consensus on any other claim on the SPS either; I think all that can be said is presently in <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Party_System_844b.html" title="Fifth Party System">Fifth Party System</a>, which see. Wikipedia does not exist to abstract every academic paper in a separate article. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:00, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What if we heavily revised the article to reflect that this is one logical progression from Key's ideas, but that it has been rejected by scholars and is only referred to as a null idea?--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 10:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is still in error on two points: Aldrich's is clearly not the only proposal of an SPS, and it has not been rejected as much as ignored. (There also appears to be a British series of numbered Party Systems, which has a handful of papers.) If I see a rewrite, I will react to it (please notify my talkpage); but why is a null idea notable? Why have an article on it? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>After a couple of days, I agree with you in part, that a totally null idea mentioned by a few scholars isn't notable enough. However, Aldrich and Niemi (from the summary, which is all I can see), is making an argument for a sixth party system, although it lacks a party realignment.

We can argue perhaps about the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventh_Party_System_7c6d.html" title="Seventh Party System">Seventh Party System</a>, but all the above arguments regarding the Sixth are null when considering the sheer number of years since the Fifth. The original author of this system initiated it during the Fifth Party System. It would be entirely perposterous to persume that it (this system) suddenly ended with its initial authorship. That (that it was created by its author during the Fifth), would be the primary argument why it has not progressed past it. Is it reasonable to persume that when all the historical party systems lasted ~ 30 years, the Fifth is gowing strong at 73 years old? I strongly propose not.

If a description of American politics in "Systems" was moderately popular 60 years ago, and is very obscure now, then it is reasonable to have an article describing that old theory (the first five systems), and to delete an article describing later additions (sixth and seventh). Seventh is already deleted, and I see no reason in your "strong keep" why the sixth shouldn't go either. This is not about claiming that the fifth is continuing or has stopped or never existed at all, this is just noticing that further systems (sixth, seventh, eigth, ...) are hardly discussed and even then no agreement is reached on them. They are no viable, common scientific theories but the ideas of a very few scientists which do not get any attention and consequently have no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: Your comments are what reeks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as your only argument is that it has <i>less</i> scholars referring to the Sixth system than the Fifth system. And as I have demonstrated, that is because a) it is newer b) it came into existance after the initial author established the series. No one denies that the Sixth has scholars backing it. And as mentioned by others (above, and in the Seventh Afd) some scholars already have us in the Seventh Party System, let alone the Sixth. And logically you cannot argue with these scholars, given the time frame involved, and the series ~ 30 year per system. <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyqazqaz_8af8.html" title="User:Qwertyqazqaz">Qwertyqazqaz</a> 16:15, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is actually no consensus of a "party system" enumeration beyond the third one (see Poole &amp; Rosenthal quote below). The subdivision of the third, Democratic/Republican era into fourth, fifth, etc., systems is speculative and the higher the number, the less support it gets. The idea that the subdivision must follow a thirty year pattern is complete hogwash and unsupported by sources, as are most of the keep votes here. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:13, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The third, the Democratic/Republican system, was organized by the late 1850s and continues today, although we will frequently refer to this system as having perturbed into a three-party system (northern Democrats, southern Democrats, Republicans) by civil-rights issues that arose in the mid-twentieth century."

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. &amp; previous comment--except to note that publication hasn't been "pushed back". According to the article, the publisher <i>just purchased the rights two months ago</i>, and it typically takes 6 months to a year (if not longer) for a book to go from manuscript to publication. And it sometimes happens that publication rights are purchased but not exercised, so this novel might not ever make it to print. This is a book that doesn't exist--not even, as far as I can tell, as an item on the publisher's list of forthcoming titles. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShelfSkewed_60bf.html" title="User:ShelfSkewed"><font style="background:LightSalmon"><b>ShelfSkewed</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7EShelfSkewed_da15.html" title="User talk:ShelfSkewed">[Talk]</a> 18:05, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>DO NOT DELETE</s></b> (duplicate vote) This article is completely verifiable. Pan Macmillan is a major publisher. The comment herein stating that the novel's release has been delayed is unfounded and false. I confirmed with the publisher that the release date has not and will not be delayed. In fact there are indications that he novel's release will in fact be accelerated. All of the factual information on the author was aquired via an interview with said author and may be confirmed by contacting him directly via the posted website links. The comments above rely heavily on unfounded opinions and do not constitute valid support for deletion. The creation of catagories is meant to facilitate finding information useful to those researching this author. As a new contributor there has not been time to contribute information to other areas. Wikipedia is an incomplete informational source if it is not including information on all authors published or soon to be published by a major publisher. This is not a vanity novelist that is self published by a vanity press. The attacks upon this article sound in personal attacks, by individuals apparently uncomfortable with the subject matter of the novel itself. Rather than making the effort to research their assertions they have chosen to engage in speculation that disregards the factual support behind the infomation posted. If their assertions are based in fact then provide the factual support for the claims made. Deletion of this article on the basis of the arguments made by the other posts in this forum would constitute a viloation of Wikipedia's deletion policy and could perhaps appear to be discriminatory in nature.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>. I don’t understand these arguments. Wikipedia allows people to write about themselves or projects they have a strong personal involvement, as long as the article maintains a neutral point of view and verifiable. The focus of the arguments should be on neutrality and verifiability. On the neutrality, it is not too difficult to judge. If anyone thinks something is not neutral, point the portion out. On the verifiability, I don’t know how anyone can really verify where a person is born, who are their parents, …, unless you are the government. Regarding this specific case, the writer or his publicist claimed that “Macmillan Publishers bought Darkest Days in August of 2006.” So Wikipedia can verify with Macmillan whether they bought Stanley Gallon’s Darkest Days. Notability is not a requirement for Wikipedia articles. No one should be penalized for lack of notability.

There are many people on Wikipedia that are not “well known”. That’s the purpose of Wikipedia, to provide information that people may not know. Being signed by a major publisher is notable enough, it means the book will be published and it is irrelevant whether the book is on the market today or will be a few months from now.

<li><b>Reply</b> Considering that you only registered on Wikipedia several hours ago, you tire very easily. The issue before all other issues is Notability. Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:Not">not an indiscrimate collection of information</a>. Other websites are, Wikipedia is not. There are literally thousands of websites where this content is welcome. MySpace comes to mind. There is no reason that it <i>has</i> to be on Wikipedia. Even if the book is published, it <i>still</i> may not meet notability standards. The fact that a large publisher is publishing it is not enough. It also has to be a success and make a notable mark on the public consciousness. Quibbling that it absolutely positively will be published isn't the point.

<li><b>WOW</b>!!! Step away for a while and look what happens. As the writer of this article I am a bit shocked at this debate going on over this. Let me just clarify some things here, based on what I've read so far. I am not a publicist, I'm not the author of the novel, nor did the author pay me to write this article about him. I'm just a guy who found out about this novel called Darkest Days. I thought it had a fascinating premise.<br />
I noticed there were just bits and pieces of information on this writer when I did a search on him, so I figured I'd do a little research of my own and post something, you know, see what happens. Why would I do that you ask? I am trying to get into journalism, this author turned out to be very accessible, (I'm guessing because he's new) and I asked him some questions. He told me about why he started writing and I put together this simple little thing you all see posted here. I had no idea this site only posted articles about bestselling authors.<br />
So why this book? Tell me, when was the last time that a dystopian thriller type novel was published in recent history? Exactly, hard to name even one. I thought this was a pretty significant development in the publishing industry. It demonstrates a societal shift, a change in global perceptions (I say that because I learned through my reserch that the publisher is making a huge global push on this novel. By the way, notice I did not mention that in the article.) I tried hard to make certain I did not write anything slanted or that sounded too enthusiastic on my part, because I wanted to be as neutral as possible.<br />
Before reading these posts I had no idea what a "sockpuppet" was (Other than what kids make in elementary school), as I'm gussing most people don't. Whether or not this article stays posted is not that important. I am not one to argue if I posted something contrary to Wikipedia policy. My personal belief is that I did not do that. I think there is enough verifiable information in the article to let it stand.<br />
I was a bit surprised to see that someone did not feel it was a notable accomplishment to be published. I've tried writing a novel and submitting it, over and over and over, to no avail. It turns out there are tens of millions of people in the same boat all over the US, and who knows how many in the world. Out of all those people only a couple hundred thousand ever see their books in print. I believe that qualifies as notable.<br />
But I digress. If this is such a big deal to people I'd be willing to pull the article. I'm not here to promote anyone. I'm not here for personal gain, and I was planning to submit more articles in the future on topics I believe should be here. The author himself suggested I wait to post my article until his book came out, but I didn't think that mattered.<br />
So there it is for all of you who think there's some big conspiracy of sockpuppets running around trying to exploit wikipedia. If there is, I'm walking bare handed and barefoot. Have fun with the debate and remember, life isn't supposed to be so complicated. Take it easy folks, Stanley Gallon will be in here soon enough, if not now then later.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Excuse Me? Now you are making personal attacks on me? Wow. This is truly amazing. I can see now why the other people posting are expressing frustration with this website. this entire forum is a joke. It is clear that whoever you are, Richfife, you have an personal agenda about this article. For the life of me I can't figure it out. I have not argued repeatedly about notability issues. I am not taking a moral highground. I am simply explaining why I wrote this article. It is utterly disgusting how you have demonstrated a pattern of insults and personal attacks in this forum toward anybody who disagrees with you. You should be ashamed of yourself. You take this far too personally and have clearly strayed from the facts of any discussion here. I have provided background information on the process through which this article came to be and all you have done is insult and show nothing but contempt for me and the other people who have posted here. You make unfounded arguments and assumptions that are unsupported. Every opinion expressed that you disagree with, you have written off as "sockpuppetry" and now you are trying to slander me and my intentions. You are a bully who likes kicking people when they are down. You apparently seem to enjoy denegrating other people. If you are representative of wikipedia then you are a violation of what I read somewhere that Wikipwedia is a comunity based in mutual respect.

<dd>Comments shouldn't be deleted during an AfD. Richfife didn't call you names he simply pointed out where you have willfully violated procedures and attempted to censor criticism. You, however, called him a <i>bully who likes kicking people when they are down</i> and that he seems <i>to enjoy denegrating other people</i>. This is highly uncivil behavior. Please refrain from continuing in that fashion. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have no idea what you are talking about, and yes I did say that richiefife is a bully because that is exactly what a person who calls people names and provides no evidence to support the name calling. That is simply stating a fact. You are choosing to catagorize it as something else because the truth doesn't suit your agenda. Stating that someone is trying to "grab the moral highground" is a value judgement and an opinion, which again Richifife has chosen not to back up. It is a condescending and insulting remark that smacks of passive agression. Again when he removes his insulting and derrogatory comment I will remove my response to it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>To Richfife</b>: I have no way to know whether it is your real name or not. Anyway. Wikipedia's notability guidelines are too vague, subject to too much arbitrary value judgment. Wikipedia does allow people to write about themselves and their projects. Neutrality and verifiability are the 2 most important criteria, other tests exist to prove these 2 criteria. It should allow more content to come in, if it wants to build its viewer base. I don't think the article owner should take off the article. Richfife and IrishGuy do not own Wikipedia - it is .org, not .com. I think a lot of people will be interested in the subject matter of the book, because a lot of people, like myself, are tired of today's politics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel the book is censored here.

<li>In case you do not understand: A sock puppet is an additional OnlineIdentity used by someone who already has another OnlineIdentity for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way. The term originates with the metaphor of carrying on a conversation with oneself using a puppet in each hand.</li>

<dd>The use of heavily loaded words like "magically" shows your emotional involvement in something that should not be such a big deal to you. The evidence you speak of does not support your claim at all. What it does support, judging from the statements made, however, is that people view your personal attacks as insulting to the spirit of the Wikipedia community. Your lack of proof that sockpuppetry is even occuring is disturbing. Also everyone who has posted anything here that disagrees with you, you called sock puppets. What you are essentially saying is:<br />
If you have never edited or posted in Wikipedia before, then don't bother. your opinion doesn't count, it does not matter, and you are nothing but a sockpuppet.<br />
These are the same idiotic arguments that conned this nation into a war, has allowed unbriddled corruption to abound, and has contributed to the degradation of society. The fact that people are expressing their opinions should not be discouraged by you or anyone else. Nor should those individuals be labled, branded, insulted, or called names, because you disagree with them. And by the way the evidence of your name calling in this forum, post, bulletain (or what ever it is called) is proof of your unsupported name calling. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

Your use of passive agressive attacks is not helping you convince anyone that you are justified in expressing your contempt for those who disagree with you. No one is standing on a soapbox, but you are clearly trying to undermine criticism by putting lables on it. When I refer to the accusations of sockpuppetry I am collectively refering to you and Richiefife together seeing as your tag team method of richiefife making the insult and your defense of his insults. That makes you complicit in his attacks. Now, if you are infact not complicit in his activity then you should post something here telling him to refrain his constant references to sockpuppetry "without a shred of evidence" to support it as unhelpful in this discussion.

<dd>Yes, to claim that Richfife and I are the same person is an accusation devoid of merit. I didn't say it was a personal attack, I stated clearly that it was an <i>accusation</i>. Richfife and I aren't here all day, nor are we taking turns. But if that is evidence of something, please look through the page history and note how many times you and Edwin Roik post within a minute or two of each other. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 22:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing to reply to. That isn't an argument. What you <i>feel</i> is wholly irrelevant. There are policies about inclusion in Wikipedia. Your inability to get a book published and admiration for those who have isn't a Wikipedia policy. There is no book. It hasn't been published yet. Therefore, this person isn't notable. At all. If his book does get published and if it does sell a notable amount of copies garnering multiple reviews from independent sources...at that point he may be worthy of inclusion. Until then, your personal feelings about him and his manuscript are completely irrelevant. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 22:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Irishguy, as for your post about cabals: Perhaps a course in remedial reading is in order. I CLEARLY disavowed any reference to a cabal. Those are your words not mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>As For what I have to say on this matter let me repeat it for your benefit. Perhaps this time Richiefife will refrain from passing valuejudgements and you will avoid defending them:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>WOW</b>!!! Step away for a while and look what happens. As the writer of this article I am a bit shocked at this debate going on over this. Let me just clarify some things here, based on what I've read so far. I am not a publicist, I'm not the author of the novel, nor did the author pay me to write this article about him. I'm just a guy who found out about this novel called Darkest Days. I thought it had a fascinating premise.<br />
I noticed there were just bits and pieces of information on this writer when I did a search on him, so I figured I'd do a little research of my own and post something, you know, see what happens. Why would I do that you ask? I am trying to get into journalism, this author turned out to be very accessible, (I'm guessing because he's new) and I asked him some questions. He told me about why he started writing and I put together this simple little thing you all see posted here. I had no idea this site only posted articles about bestselling authors.<br />
So why this book? Tell me, when was the last time that a dystopian thriller type novel was published in recent history? Exactly, hard to name even one. I thought this was a pretty significant development in the publishing industry. It demonstrates a societal shift, a change in global perceptions (I say that because I learned through my reserch that the publisher is making a huge global push on this novel. By the way, notice I did not mention that in the article.) I tried hard to make certain I did not write anything slanted or that sounded too enthusiastic on my part, because I wanted to be as neutral as possible.<br />
Before reading these posts I had no idea what a "sockpuppet" was (Other than what kids make in elementary school), as I'm gussing most people don't. Whether or not this article stays posted is not that important. I am not one to argue if I posted something contrary to Wikipedia policy. My personal belief is that I did not do that. I think there is enough verifiable information in the article to let it stand.<br />
I was a bit surprised to see that someone did not feel it was a notable accomplishment to be published. I've tried writing a novel and submitting it, over and over and over, to no avail. It turns out there are tens of millions of people in the same boat all over the US, and who knows how many in the world. Out of all those people only a couple hundred thousand ever see their books in print. I believe that qualifies as notable.<br />
But I digress. If this is such a big deal to people I'd be willing to pull the article. I'm not here to promote anyone. I'm not here for personal gain, and I was planning to submit more articles in the future on topics I believe should be here. The author himself suggested I wait to post my article until his book came out, but I didn't think that mattered.<br />
So there it is for all of you who think there's some big conspiracy of sockpuppets running around trying to exploit wikipedia. If there is, I'm walking bare handed and barefoot. Have fun with the debate and remember, life isn't supposed to be so complicated. Take it easy folks, Stanley Gallon will be in here soon enough, if not now then later.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Edwin Roik (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwin_Roik_872d.html" title="User talk:Edwin Roik">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Edwin_Roik_ec44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Edwin Roik">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>Constantly repeating yourself doesn't give your comments any more weight. When you claim that everyone who opposed you has a political agenda and they are working in conjunction against you...that <i>is</i> a cabal. It is irrelevant that you didn't use that exact term.

<li><b>WOW</b>!!! Step away for a while and look what happens. As the writer of this article I am a bit shocked at this debate going on over this. Let me just clarify some things here, based on what I've read so far. I am not a publicist, I'm not the author of the novel, nor did the author pay me to write this article about him. I'm just a guy who found out about this novel called Darkest Days. I thought it had a fascinating premise.<br />
I noticed there were just bits and pieces of information on this writer when I did a search on him, so I figured I'd do a little research of my own and post something, you know, see what happens. Why would I do that you ask? I am trying to get into journalism, this author turned out to be very accessible, (I'm guessing because he's new) and I asked him some questions. He told me about why he started writing and I put together this simple little thing you all see posted here. I had no idea this site only posted articles about bestselling authors.<br />
So why this book? Tell me, when was the last time that a dystopian thriller type novel was published in recent history? Exactly, hard to name even one. I thought this was a pretty significant development in the publishing industry. It demonstrates a societal shift, a change in global perceptions (I say that because I learned through my reserch that the publisher is making a huge global push on this novel. By the way, notice I did not mention that in the article.) I tried hard to make certain I did not write anything slanted or that sounded too enthusiastic on my part, because I wanted to be as neutral as possible.<br />
Before reading these posts I had no idea what a "sockpuppet" was (Other than what kids make in elementary school), as I'm gussing most people don't. Whether or not this article stays posted is not that important. I am not one to argue if I posted something contrary to Wikipedia policy. My personal belief is that I did not do that. I think there is enough verifiable information in the article to let it stand.<br />
I was a bit surprised to see that someone did not feel it was a notable accomplishment to be published. I've tried writing a novel and submitting it, over and over and over, to no avail. It turns out there are tens of millions of people in the same boat all over the US, and who knows how many in the world. Out of all those people only a couple hundred thousand ever see their books in print. I believe that qualifies as notable.<br />
But I digress. If this is such a big deal to people I'd be willing to pull the article. I'm not here to promote anyone. I'm not here for personal gain, and I was planning to submit more articles in the future on topics I believe should be here. The author himself suggested I wait to post my article until his book came out, but I didn't think that mattered.<br />
So there it is for all of you who think there's some big conspiracy of sockpuppets running around trying to exploit wikipedia. If there is, I'm walking bare handed and barefoot. Have fun with the debate and remember, life isn't supposed to be so complicated. Take it easy folks, Stanley Gallon will be in here soon enough, if not now then later.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article states no solid claims of fame, besides of a book that isn't published yet, and even that is a bit questionable until it's actually out. Lack of sourcing and a little bit essay-like and advertisatory tone doesn't help. And I find this behaviour, if one can call it that, of some editors in this debate somewhat unconstructive. Oh, as an amateur writer I know how stating good, deep, philosophical points can take <i>a lot</i> of words, but in this particular medium of deletion debates, conciseness and sticking to the facts counts in particular. =) --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 23:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is this really notable? A guy who commited suicide who happens to be a games player?

The broader issue of MMOGs and addiction, the video-game industry's demonisation by some quarters and backlash from quarters such as <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child%27s_Play_%28charity%29_f4ba.html" title="Child's Play (charity)">Child's Play (charity)</a> and other parts of the videogaming world are all things which receive a lot of press, this is just one piece of the puzzle. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:47, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it is notable, it is because of the coverage that the story got. If I remember correctly, his mother was on 60 Minutes accusing the game of causing the death. Perhaps it could be merged with the article for <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_addiction.html" title="Game addiction">Game addiction</a> since anyone interested in this case would undoubtably be interested in it because of the addiction allegations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_156.56.137.90_6cec.html" title="Special:Contributions/156.56.137.90">156.56.137.90</a> (talk) 16:47, 9 October 2006 .</small>

<li>It's exactly because of that coverage that this can and should have a seperate article.

Funnily enough, RS is not amongst the games mentioned in the article for being played by someone who has died, yet it is 'infamously addicting' (notice there's no cite for that). Until it has been merged, had the POV/OR knocked out of it, has been cited etc. etc., that article is the last place something which can be cited should be merged with. The main article (when it eventually happens) can be wikilinked from Shawn Woolley's article, but when there are so many cites for this individual case there seems no reason to merge it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 17:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article makes great claims for his youth: <i>has been working with art since his early childhood. Starting out as a musician at age 8</i>. These do not seem to be verifiable. Its claims about what he did since then are more muted: <i>Drausio lives and works in Paris(France), where he continues his career as a freelancer, developing websites, graphics, videos, as well as interactive projects &amp; installations.</i> It's always good to be reminded where Paris is, but the rest is very humdrum. The only reference given is <a href="http://www.drausiohaddad.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.drausiohaddad.com/" rel="nofollow">his site</a>, a nightmare of browser-sniffing, etc. that for my particular browser shows no more than <a href="http://www.drausiohaddad.com/images/port_espicification.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.drausiohaddad.com/images/port_espicification.jpg" rel="nofollow">this advert for software I don't want</a>.

<li>There are a bunch of graphic designers with their own bio on wikipedia that also does not meet the notability. I dont see anything wrong with this article. I will scan some articles that were posted in GQ magazine and the newyorktimes talking about this artist and some of his art. Its true that his website is not up to date, but there is nothing to do with his bio.

<li>Alright alright people... if it's not called a 'subdivert' and it's not called a 'micro divert' (as some people have told me)... then what the heck is it called?
<p>Granted this is a redirect but one that serves a more specific purpose to the general public with it being in keeping with the expected 'www' and easy to remember...

<li>Night Gyr removed my See Talk Page and replaced it with Citation needed.....BUT: I did the citation as a "See Talk page" because the citation is in print form and the links on the talk page link to a scanned version on Flickr.

<li><b>Comment</b> I considered the tour info as well, but I questioned whether you can call playing in two nearby states a "tour." If a San Diego band plays in LA and Phoenix, most people wouldn't call it touring, but rather "playing regionally." Update: I see now that they also "toured" eastern Canada. Again, I guess it's a gray area of what defines a "tour." <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 20:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It happened in September! There's no way a national revision of university honor codes has even come close to occurring yet.

<dd>You do have a point, so do you have any thoughts? Because you can't just include every emulator ever made, as many of these pages seem to be for advertising or vanity reasons and have no notability at all. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, so a line needs to be drawn. All the ones I've tagged are ones I feel fail to make any claims, and no reliable sources are turned up when searching the net. As for it being the tip of the iceberg, maybe a few of use should look specifically at Emulators as part of the CVG project? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 21:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm holding off on releasing my thoughts till they've had time to develop a little bit, and maybe till I've had a chance to see what other people think. I do know I don't agree with using the typical Wikipedia buzzwords to support a deletion, but that's not specific to this discussion, but rather an opposition to the practice of reducing a thought to a policy. Too much in the way of a mindless hidebound bureacracy for me. That, however, is really another matter. In this specific case though, I don't think we should nominate anything till more of a discussion happens, no matter how trivial an article might be. That way, we don't have to worry about what might slip through the cracks between proposal and consensus. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Would it help you to know that there are emulation sites that describe iNes? And other such emulators? Check <a href="http://www.zophar.net/nes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zophar.net/nes.html" rel="nofollow">[60]</a> or <a href="http://emulation.victoly.com/nintendo/" class="external autonumber" title="http://emulation.victoly.com/nintendo/" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> Sure, they're not the New York Times, but how often do you think the Times writes about console emulators?

<dd>Three lines of text and a link to the official site?

<dl>
<dd>Eh, remove the questionable parts if you want, I was thinking about how to do that myself. Or how to find information to verify/dispute the claims. Those are clean-up problems though, not necessarily deletion issues. Personally, I think given that the author of iNes has produced several emulators, it might be more worthwhile to see if he's notable enough on his own to make him the article and instead redirect iNes and the rest to a page about him. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to question those sources though. All they do are prove that this exists, rather than if they are worth making a note of. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 22:27, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I doubt the argument is that it exists, which serves to differ an article like this, which is about something tangible, from say something that is more theoretical and inherently argumentative, like say, Racism in Star Wars(I hope that article doesn't really exist, mind you). For ones like this one, I see a need to clean-up, for the other, I see a need to prove first. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:43, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But just existing shouldn't be enough to warrant a wikipedia article. For the same resons you can't have an article about a living person just because they are alive, you shouldn't have an article on an emulator that's (by the searching I did) completely unremarkable just because it was made. The only way I see is if the Author proves to be notable, and following what you propose in that case. But other than that, I really see no reasonable justification for keeping this article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 22:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, proving notability is often a problem with things that are under the radar of the mainstream media. Me, I think if a search for NES emulators turns up with something, it's enough to stay. Still, I'd probably prefer one single article on NES emulators rather than a dozen)or more) seperate ones. It'd save a lot of trouble. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

We don't need to wait for a resolution on the issue of appropriate notability for emulators, because this article should be deleted no matter what the outcome of any discussion.

<ul>
<li>What problems with verifiability do you have? A source is certainly referencable in discussing itself, and anybody who wants to see that can check the FCEUXD zip file. I'd say check their website, but that seems to have died. However, the released files are themselves still available. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:43, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Once again I say: Availability is not notability. Just because it exists doesn't mean it deserves an article. I exist, where's my article? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 08:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notability and Verifiability are two different things. I responded to the one here. To the other, as I said previously, I'm still thinking on that. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Taken from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> 'a subject needs to be of <b>sufficient importance</b> that there are multiple reliable secondary sources, independent of the subject, on which we can base a <b>verifiably</b> neutral article'.

<ul>
<li>What's the difficulty in making a neutral article on an emulator? All you need to do is not say "Emulator X is better than Emulator Y" or similar such statements. Just stick to the basics which you can verify, and not worry about more details. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem there is that we end with numerous articles consisting of the only 3-4 lines of information available on the emulator. I feel that would do more harm than good to Wiki in the long run <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Worried that one day the Wiki servers will collapse under the weight of a multitude of tiny articles? &#160;:) Actually, I'm inclined to say that FCEUXD is less in need of an article and should properly be merged under FCE Ultra. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>LOL, not at all! It just looks bad.

<li>WTF? So you stop the forest fire by reverting me, back to your version? How is that helpful? ATM we have this debate (which incidently I don't care about too much) happening over two fora. We could quite possibly get two differing results and thus a real forest fire. Opening this during a DRV is NOT AT ALL helpful. You should either have waited for ther DRV to finish - or closed it and see if anyone objected. There is now a high probability that someone will question the legitimacy of this AfD (as I do) and it itself will be sent to DrV. I'm no stickler for process - but let's keep discussions in one place. I'll not feed this fire by reverting you (as you did me), but I invite someone (else) to close one of these discussions immediately.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 21:42, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The claims to notability are unsourced with reliable sources, and therefore don't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Citing <i>New Times</i> as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> is laughable, especially for a Phoenix native. <i>I've</i> been mentioned in the <i>New Times</i> for nothing much, and the story misquoted the other interviewee, too. The <i>New Times</i> is not a good measure of anything, and it's certainly not reliable. That and a blog and a student-written college paper (and it's an <i>interview</i> where they mention <i>themselves</i> offhandedly that they went on a tour): none of these are reliable. And after reading the article, <i>I still don't know if they're even signed to a label</i>. They're not even on allmusic. Nothing here meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and Parsssseltongue's been spamming this AfD to boot. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:31, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It would be spamming if I went to a bunch of editors and said "PLEASE COME VOTE KEEP ON THIS AFD!" As I mentioned above (does anyone on Wikipedia actually bother to READ anything or anymore, or do they just work off assumptions?), I alerted editors to the article and the AfD to get their opinion, I didn't try to sway it one way or another. You claim to be a Phoenix native, one that has been in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a> even, so you should know who AJJ is. And it doesn't matter that they're on a label or not, that is not the end-all be-all of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. What too many editors on here are clearly missing is that other <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria has been met, as noted in the article and on the talk pages, with reliable verifiable sources (whether Dmcdevit has a grudge against them or not). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dmcdevit does not have a grudge, but actually his opinion is based on sound reasoning. But thanks anyway for your insinuations. (Oh, and I "claim to be a Phoenix native". Nice.)

Sorry, but this is completely different situation - I haven't heard of them, their biggest gig was supporting Flogging Molly, hardly a huge band in themselves, there doesn't seem to be anything supporting a national or international tour (individual shows in different states IMO don't really count), nothing non-trivial, and they don't have CDs for sale on Amazon or anywhere in my country. 172 hits on Google, 126 listeners on last.fm, they don't seem to pass WP:MUSIC, so this is nn and probably vanity - albiet a well written vanity page. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 12:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did state probable vanity - I didn't say it /was/ vanity. I checked the talk page. Specifically, I don't think they've done a full national tour, I wouldn't describe the competition as major, I don't think the articles are in major publications and the band doesn't establish a new notable style for a city (well, one that's /itself/ established enough to itself be notable and varifiable). -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 18:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>1) You created the article. 2) You posted comments on the talk claiming it meets WP:MUSIC, but no one else agreed. 3) The only sources that meet WP:V are local papers.

<li>I'm not sure about Arbustoo, but I am. Four barely qualifies as "multiple", the mentions tend to be trivial (a gig listing in a local newspaper) and I'm not convinced of the reputability of something using using the domain "ecollegetimes" as notable. They aren't MTV, put it that way. The whole thing goes against the spirit of WP:MUSIC. The fact that the article was written "with WP:MUSIC in mind" makes me stroke my chin and wonder if WP:MUSIC is a little too broad, and if people want to scrape the barrel they could get any local band's articles kept. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 13:38, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have seen the hordes of non-notable bands whose members put up a page and get speedily deleted. This is not one of those bands. There seems to be a prejudice against this band, whether for where they hail from or what kind of music they do. You've gone as far as to pick apart the reliability of the coverage, when there should be no question about the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Republic_46b7.html" title="Arizona Republic">Arizona Republic</a> or <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a> (or <a href="../../../h/e/a/HeartattaCk_5399.html" title="HeartattaCk">HeartattaCk</a>, for that matter, though an overzealous deletionist is now trying to get even THAT article deleted). Yes, I created the article.

<li>I'd like to point out that you pointed me to this article, along with a bunch of other people who voted "keep" on AFD. I hadn't heard of them before you messaged me. I'm not biased against them at all, I'm thousands of miles away. Independently, I've decided that based on all the criteria claimed, they aren't notable, and yes, that includes the small mentions in local newspapers and even smaller websites/music magazines, and even the nowhere-near-a-full-tour. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 19:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Answering Badlydrawnjeff, yes I am claiming those as trival. I'm in favor of keeping a notable band, but these articles are not convincing of anything other than a local band. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 18:51, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's kind of misleading. I mean, every band is from SOMEWHERE, every band is a "local band" in some town. It's not like AJJ hasn't toured. And give <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> another read - a band who is prominent in their hometown is still under consideration for notability. I think the problem now is some editors in this AfD are horribly misjudging the reliability of the sources, and I'm not sure what that stems from except a failure to recognize anything from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> as notable because it's not <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">L.A.</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 19:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd argue they aren't even prominant in their home town. Seriously, you've given references to articles in local newspapers, all of which are minor mentions that list several bands, or articles in other publications whose notability is stretched. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 19:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a> is just a very short mention in an article, it's trivial. AZNightBuzz is a very short mention in a blog, so I wouldn't call that non-trivial. The eCollegeTimes is a longer article, but I can't establish notability of the site (there's only 50 unique hits on Google). StatePress seems more like it, but is still an article in a local University newspaper. As for Heartattack, I'm unsure of its notability or contents, but even if we count that, it doesn't count as "multiple", and even those articles that do count are still marginal at best. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 21:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. As for reliable sources, I really don't see one. The ASU article is expressly out per WP:MUSIC: "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." The AZ Night Buzz is a blog. And the College Times? Definitely not something I would consider reliable. The article in the Phoenix New Times is not displaying for me, so I am unable to judge the content of the article itself, but the publication as a whole is a local paper for a large city, but it is still not a far reaching paper, leaving its value rather limited as well. Even if these articles were considered to be reliable sources, the next question is, would this band meet WP:MUSIC? They have not gone on a national tour. They have toured a portion of the U.S. They don't have two or more albums on a major label, no major music competition, no major award, they aren't getting radio time, and they don't have any independently notable members. As for "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city...", I see nothing to support that argument, even with the sources given. So with or without the sources given, I believe this band does not meet WP:MUSIC and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelnuneb_b3c1.html" title="User:Maelnuneb">Maelnuneb</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelnuneb_aa13.html" title="User talk:Maelnuneb">Talk</a>) 16:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment/note to closing admin</b> - I don't see a real consensus here. I would ask that we default to keep, for the time being, and allow the article to expand. While there is some disagreement about the notability of the sources, I feel a convincing case has been made for this band meeting parts of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.
