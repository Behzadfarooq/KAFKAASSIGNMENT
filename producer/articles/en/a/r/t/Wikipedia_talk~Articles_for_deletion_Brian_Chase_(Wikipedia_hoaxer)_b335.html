<dd>Incidentally I'm on IE6. The page doesn't crop to 32kb - I can get the "edit" page fine, but when I try to submit it, it times out.

<p>What it is apparent that he wanted was publicity. Look at the press he has received and even generated himself. Along with the attempts by both him and other reporters to discredit the project.

<p>Primarily my listing this article as an article for deletion was because this page specifically falls under <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a></p>
<pre>
7. News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project 
Wikinews does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that 
are currently in the news, and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate 
new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples. 
</pre>
<p>News articles should posted on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> not on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. Current events qualify as news even if they involve the Wikipedia. This controversy was majorly overblown as the publisher in question could have simply edited the article removing the vandalism and the matter would have been instantly resolved. Instead he used it as a tool to generate publicity for himself and to attempt to discredit the Wikipedia..</p>
<p>Then you have the following from the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion policy</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article</li>
<li>Is not suitable for Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>While this achieved a minor notoriety the discovery of this person is best included as a section on the overall controversy page. Not as it's own page.</p>
<p>So it is a valid listing on AfD and I hope this may change a few people's opinions on the subject.

<dd>I don't think you can use that as the justification for not counting the votes. Someone who voted just "Keep" or even "Keep, it's a part of our history" could really have been motivated by "He messed with Wikipedia he deserves his infamy" and the like. Likewise, the people who made such comments could've been joking, but really had a legit reason. Unless you can tell the real motivations of all the voters I don't think you just ignore some because of the ones they expressed… —<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> <span class="usertalk">(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary"><span title="Ae hI: ja" class="IPA">ɑe hɪː jɐ</span></a>)</span> 13:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
