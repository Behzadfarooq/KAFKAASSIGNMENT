<li><b>Comment</b>. "If she changes her mind I'll change my vote", "if Angela wants it gone", "not fair to keep it if she doesn't want it". Not fair to Wikipedia to use that kind of argument. Article has steadily moved towards meeting our standards, incidentally. An argument on notability could be made, but I don't vote on those. I certainly wouldn't do anything <i>solely</i> on what Angela wanted, though; I hope you all mean "if Angela doesn't want it throw it away, because it's not notable enough to begin with", not "we delete personal articles of Foundation members if they want us to".

<li>This has many signs of a prank. The article was originally created by a probable sockpuppet from the same IP as a known vandal. The subject is self-referential to Wikipedia. It was created on April Fool's Day. The article has since been cleaned up but we would not keep a random business person of the same stature from some other corporation. Angela has taught me a lot and been a wonderful influence. One of the things she taught me is that we have standards for a reason. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:17, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As written, the article is not encyclopedic, and despite Angela's many contributions to Wikipedia she thus far does not have the sort of public presence that would justify even a comprehensive and well-written article. Being a board member of a foundation with assets in the hundreds of thousands of dollars does not in and of itself rise to the level of public presence that would justify an article. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:51, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I think this VFD brings up a larger question about wikipedia then just this article.

But how much should the fact that Angela herself wants it deleted account for? Ie. how much respect for an article subjects wishes should wikipedia have? Is there some policy on this?

<ul>
<li>(Comments): [1] I think we need to establish consistent rules here. Have a look at the Category:Wikipedians with article "Wikipedians with article" category (linked at the bottom of this page) and think for yourselves how many of the names WE, let alone the public, would recognize. There's an article (self-promotional, in my opinion) on <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonja_Elen_Kisa_8914.html" title="Sonja Elen Kisa">Sonja Elen Kisa</a>. Who's she? If she's here, why not Angela? At least Angela has a public presence outside of Wikipedia (i.e., on CNN and the BBC). [2] I really like Angela as a person, and in normal circumstances would comply with her wishes. To do so this time, however, would create a precedent which would not, in my view, be helpful. If Angela can ask for her bio to be nuked, why not Queen Elizabeth, George W. Bush, or Osama bin Laden? (I'm not saying these individuals would make any such request, I'm just making a point). The credibility of Wikipedia would be seriously undermined if we had people asking for their biographies, or for information they do not want published, to be deleted. If we're going to take a stand against articles being deleted at the whim of their subject, let's not make any exception, not even for someone who considers herself "non-notable." (Please don't take this personally, Angela. This is only a matter of principle). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 22:25, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
