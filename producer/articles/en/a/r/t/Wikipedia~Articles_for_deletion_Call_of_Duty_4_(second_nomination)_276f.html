<p>The result was <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting notable content is asking for recreation. This is not a case of <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. There are 234,000 hits for <i>Call of Duty 4</i>. People are talking about it; reliable sources are covering it ... ergo, it is notable. The article is well within its rights to cover the speculation provided it doesnt stray into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 13:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What reliable sources? A Google search brings up forum posts containing speculation. There is no official statement from the developers at <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.callofduty.com/" rel="nofollow">the official site</a>, nor does the site even have a section for COD4. There is no notable content, nothing about the game has been released. As per standard procedure, delete the article to prevent misinformation and remake the article when actual information has been released. The nomination is for <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>, not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Articles should not be written based on speculation alone. If nothing about the game has been released, then speculation is obviously a violation of <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 13:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as crystal-balling. Any sub-stub containing "not much is known" when referring to the subject is self-explanatory. There's no need for contributors to play journalist and sniff around the rumour-mills, as soon as there's anything concrete available on the game, the publicity will be as subtle as a curvy bunnygirl bursting from an oversized birthday cake. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 19:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete (for now) as unreferenced speculation</b></s> Although I'm sure there is speculation on internet forums and blogs about this game, what the article needs is <i>published</i> articles from reliable sources (which blogs and internet forums aren't). Delete this article as unreferenced speculation unless it is ammended to include reliable, published references talking about the game in a non-trivial way. If no such sources currently exist, then hold off recreating the article until more official info is available.<a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Done. Please bear in mind that I have no care for this subject, so I am sure someone more interested can find more sources and expand the article given time.

<li>Thanks. I struck out my Delete recommendation and will instead recommend <b>Keep pending stub expansion</b>. I'm pretty sure the franchise is well known enough that it will probably generate a fair amount of press in the near term, so I'll give it some benefit of the doubt that the stub will be expanded slowly over time. I think it would also help if some of the additional information about the game from the published articles can be added in the meantime, so the stub isn't just a couple of sentences. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>The sources don't seem enough. The GameSpot is a good source, but doesn't establish any notable content and only hints at the existence of the game in development. The CODHQ source is better, but again it only confirms the game's existence and reveals no information at all. The Neowin article, on the other hand, is not a reliable source: it's a forum post based on an unknown leak. Even though the existence of the game <i>in development</i> is now unquestionable, there is still nothing about the game itself to warrant an article. There's no need to jump the gun here; wait for an official announcement in published sources before creating the article. If we keep the article with what scraps of information we have now, it's going to be a speculation magnet. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 03:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, it probably will exist, based on the sources provided. However, the game is not yet notable as the sources are trivial. "It exists" and "it will exist" are enough to add a game to the <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> database, but are not enough to add it to Wikipedia. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 19:30, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b> There is minimal harm in having a truthful and referenced stub article for an upcoming game. The article clearly will be able to grow when the game nears release. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 06:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> It is too early to say anything. This article should be re-created when Infinity Ward makes an announcement regarding the game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.83.118.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.83.118.187_ccc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.83.118.187">contribs</a>) 23:48, 18 February 2007.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess the question is whether or not we should have a stub article about a game that we have confirmed sources for to indicate it is in fact under development, but about which we have very little other info. There are two ways to look at it, from what I can tell. We could say "since we know the game is actually under development, and is part of a large enough franchise that it will certainly eventually have more information down the road, we can keep this article around as a stub for that information as it becomes available." The flip side would be "since the only information we have is that the game is under development, it would be best to temporarily delete the article and maybe redirect to an appropriate related article until more information is available. Otherwise we'll end up with a stub article that could become a frequent site for unreferenced rumors in the coming year."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Personally I'd lean toward keeping the stub since I'm sure the article will eventually be viable. But I can definitely understand the desire to delete until more info is available, so it's not an easy call. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
