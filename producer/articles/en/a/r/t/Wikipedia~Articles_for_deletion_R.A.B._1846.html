<dd>Well judging by the size of the article and the amount of contributors I'd say it has been expanded. The initials refer to a character that is apparently notable. There is speculation and debate in other articles (<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balrog.html" title="Balrog">Balrog</a> for example) but when it is supported by citations and sources from the author I think it's allowable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 00:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Is there any good reason not to <b>merge and redirect</b>? Or at least merge? I think the article as it stands is decent, and as a section in the HBP book article might be good. Yes, the HBP article is getting long, but I think coverage of one of the book's most crucial mysteries is the sort of thing we do for more "classic" literature. I don't see why it would be inappropriate here. Let's preserve this reasonably well-written content, even though it is clearly not a free-standing article. <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 07:51, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has been improved, but this only shows that it needs to go away. There's very little in there and little hope of expansion unless we go back to lots of speculation.

<li><b>Merge</b> -- R.A.B. by itself can mean manythings and nothing in particular from an encyclopeadia point of vue.

<li><b>Keep, possibly merge</b> R.A.B. is likely to become a well-known and much-debated mystery figure as we wait for the seventh book, and so there should be a reference about him/her, however basic or seemingly trivial the information within the article may be. What's more, this is a definitive character whose identity will eventually be revealed, and when that happens, the R.A.B. article can then be merged appropriately. <a href="../../../s/o/v/User%7ESoVerySpiffy_5bb3.html" title="User:SoVerySpiffy">SoVerySpiffy</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/v/User_talk%7ESoVerySpiffy_fe8d.html" title="User talk:SoVerySpiffy">Talk</a> 07:06, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I rather think the inverse of that is true. Until there is enough content for an article it should be merged (it is already mentioned in no fewer then 4 other articles with essentially all the information here).

<li>I find it hard to imagine a way that book 7 could make this article grow beyone confirmation of the name of the charicter in question. If it is very significat to the plot then the content belong in the pag on book 7. If it is not that significant then it adds perhaps 2 sentences to this article. This is at best a <i>partial</i> sub-plot of a book that is unpublished. A book that already has a large number of articles where this information belongs.
