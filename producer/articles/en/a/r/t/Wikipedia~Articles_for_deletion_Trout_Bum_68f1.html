<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). It is a bit difficult to count the votes here, because the creator first wanted it kept, then said "might as well delete it". One person has called for a redirect, but I don't know where such a list might be. One called for moving this to Wiktionary, something which I think is entirely unworkable. Regarding whether or not this phrase is a neologism, I note that the term has very many <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Trout+Bum%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Trout+Bum%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a> from a variety of websites. My count sets this at something around 6d-3k, and with a debate like this I am not comfortable calling anything else than a no consensus result. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:09, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created it. Angr has been pretty persistent in trying to get it deleted but it really is a notable entry and it does not qualify as a neologism (new concept). I am a professional flyfishing writer and I put this up here because it really is a definitive term in flyfishing. To be a "trout bum" is to be one totally dedicated to the sport. Since Gierach's book debuted the term has entered the entire flyfishing lexicon. The Trout Bum Tournament is even sponsored by Fly Rod and Reel magazine (not the outfit I write for). Googling "trout bum" returns 68,000 hits. The fact that Angr is not aware of the term doesn't mean it isn't viable - this merely speaks to his personal ignorance of it; a problem which would be remedied were it to be included.

<dd>Is there ever a point at which I can know that the entry has been kept or has been deleted? This is such an arbitrary place - almost everything I've done today has been deleted by someone, which tells me either I don't understand the politics of this thing or there is a group out here more willing than me to be vocal. I host a strong website dedicated to improving beginning flyfishers' abilities completely free of charge and I meant to add some content here, but I am beginning to believe it is not worth the effort. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachMatthews_93ca.html" title="User:ZachMatthews">ZachMatthews</a> 21:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fly fishing terms are probably off the average wikipedian's radar, but 50,000 google hits seems to show that it's reasonably notable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Regarding the question of notability - I read the wiki definition (thanks Thatcher). It seems to me that the line of notability is crossed when a term eclipses the "narrow" understanding of a target group and begins to be known by a mass audience. Flyfishermen are definitionally a rather large target group, with industry numbers projecting around 2,000,000 flyfishers in the US alone. However, if the test is to be whether the term has exceeded the bounds of the field, please look at local news sites: <a href="http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867" class="external free" title="http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867" rel="nofollow">http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867</a> (Google '"trout bum" news), or even large sporting outfits like ESPN: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead" class="external free" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead</a>. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachMatthews_93ca.html" title="User:ZachMatthews">ZachMatthews</a> 22:28, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's a neologism but non-notable? From <i>The Seattle Times</i>, Febuary 7, 2006, Pg. D9, "Having a trout bum around is kind of like having a Labrador retriever around the house, if you don't get them outside regularly, they get squirrelly and start to stink. I needed to air it out. Randal Sumner was on the phone saying the magic words, "Super secret fly, lots of big fish, let's go."

<dd>So ~10 hits per year? That sounds not notable to me.

<p><b>Comment</b>. I have fished from Maine to California and never heard this neologism nor I have seen the magazine mentioned in the the link sold anywhere. I don't doubt it exists just that it's not notable enough for an encyclopedia.--71.31.40.206 02:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
