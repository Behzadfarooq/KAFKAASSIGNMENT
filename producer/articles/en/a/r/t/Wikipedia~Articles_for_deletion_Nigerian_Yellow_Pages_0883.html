<dd>That is very pitiful of a remark from RoberG. How can you assume that the same person posted the two comment just becos they have same IP adrress.

TylerOH: it's useful for people outside Nigeria. Afriwedd: will deprive many needing this important information. 196.3.61.3: Keep because it's been mentioned in a newspaper. Nominator's reply to all the comments so far: (<i>sigh</i>) please <i>read the nomination</i>, and stop distracting us from the issue. It is not in dispute that Nigerian Yellow Pages is a Nigerian commercial business directory with an internet presence. What is required in this debate is verifiable evidence that the company is notable according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">Wikipedia guidelines</a>. Wikipedia is not a directory, an <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> tool, or an internet guide (I quote from <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a></i>: <i>Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website [or company] offers, but should describe the site [or company] in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance</i>). The debate so far has convinced me more than ever that my original nomination was correct. In fact, on further investigation, I think it nearly qualifies for {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">db-spam</a>}} and CSD G11. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 08:44, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hi! I've been with Wikipedia for over a year now and contribute primarily to Nigeria-related articles (also occasional XfD discussions). I normally feel very strongly about keeping Nigeria-related articles that show up here, mostly because we really do suffer from a lack of them. However, I think that this article should be <b>deleted</b> for several reasons, not the least of which is that <a href="http://www.nigerianyellowpages.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nigerianyellowpages.com/" rel="nofollow">this site has been axed by its host and no longer exists</a>. Beyond that, the site itself (not the Wikipedia article) has always been very spammy and not particularly useful. If people want to write more articles about Nigeria, that's wonderful, but this isn't a good place to start. We have very few <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nollywood.html" title="Nollywood">Nollywood</a>-related articles, Nigerian popular music is brutally underrepresented, and our articles on Nigerian politicians are frequently out of date and no longer accurate. But I can't see what this or any article on nigerianyellowpages.com (or even <a href="http://yellowpages.com.ng/" class="external text" title="http://yellowpages.com.ng/" rel="nofollow">yellowpages.com.ng</a> which isn't a lot better) could possible add to the encyclopedia that would be of value. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 16:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hello, I cannot see the site being axe. I can sense some Wikipedian being a competitor to NigerianYellowPages.com especially the last commentator mentioning a competiting yellowpages called <a href="http://yellowpages.com.ng" class="external free" title="http://yellowpages.com.ng" rel="nofollow">http://yellowpages.com.ng</a> . This now gives me a clue to what people type here.....you guys all the very best. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.146.0.12 (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.146.0.12.html" title="User talk:134.146.0.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.146.0.12_747e.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.146.0.12">contribs</a>) 2006-10-12 8:39 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>I actually expected Ergot to confirm some comment regarding online content of Nigerian newspapers and whether the cites references are truly news event since he has been writing on Nigerian article, he should have provided some insight rather than offering a competiting yellow pages site.....something is hidden here. truly Afriwedd 08:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Afriwedd, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. If people are looking for a hidden agenda, they might equally imagine that some people who have contributed to this discussion have a commercial interest in keeping the Wikipedia article as an additional free high-profile web presence for the company, and for <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> purposes. Of course, I couldn't possibly believe such a thing myself: I am merely pointing out to you where your argument of "something hidden", taken to its logical conclusion, leads. Let's assume that no-one has an axe to grind. My reading of Ergot's argument is that he disinterestedly believes the company is not notable, and that the article adds nothing to Wikipedia. I say to you again, <i>please</i> read the nomination: the problem with the article is <i>not</i> that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, the problem is that it is not verifiably <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 11:13, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. The site does seem to be back up today, although yesterday the URL only returned a "this site has been suspended" notice. I just wanted to mention that by no means was I trying to promote yellowpages.com.ng. I said that nigerianyellowpages.com was a spammy site and that yellowpages.com.ng wasn't a lot better. If anything, I attacked yellowpages.com.ng rather than attempting to promote it. I don't think we need articles on either of them. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 14:01, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Our attention has been drawn to this debate, and would like to clarifies as follows:
<dl>
<dd>First, we feel priviledge that someone has written an article about us and several others have been updating same with information about our service and company.</dd>
<dd>We appreciate those who were steadfast in defending an article about us, and also appreciate the other side of this story. This actually help to establish fast but we only decided to comment based on what could negatively impact on our company which we would like to correct at this forum.</dd>
<dd>RobertG comment that "these are newspaper cuttings". We will please implore you to do your investigation and correct same in this forum after establishing that these are news event of which were published by the newspapers extract and cited by someone in the aforesaid article.</dd>
<dd>We also want to mention that we appreciate competition thus would encourage anyone (like the person with yellowpages.com.ng) to freely mention them, and would encourage free and unbiased comments.</dd>
<dd>While it is our desire to publish material about us, we would not want a sitation where such remarks and comments impact on us negatively.</dd>
<dd>We wish you all to enjoy your contributions to Wikipedia and make it an avenue for all to benefit from. NigerianYellowPages 12:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC) Email: ads@NigerianYellowPages.com Web: www.NigerianYellowPages.com</dd>
<dd>(Apologies, this may not be well formatted, due to the fact that we are not familair with Wikipedia)
<dl>
<dd>To be clear, I have absolutely no reason to doubt that the newspaper cuttings quoted are genuine, and I am sorry if I have given any other impression. I reiterate a point that I have made here frequently: there is no doubt that Nigerian Yellow Pages is a Nigerian company offering a business directory of considerable utility, with an internet presence. If the thoughtful and balanced comment above is anything to go by, the company is clearly a good one to do business with. I wish the company every success. I am purely asking the Wikipedia community whether the subject of the article meets the notability criteria, which are clearly laid out at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.</dd>
<dd>I would be distressed if this discussion reflected badly on your business. That is the very last thing I want. Since you have raised this as a concern, I propose that this discussion be blanked shortly after the debate is over (which will be in about a week's time). I will do so myself if no-one objects. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 15:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Great contribution from NigerianYellowPages. I also wish your company the very best. I need to draw attention of all to the comment made by someone from IP address - 196.3.61.3 - i.e. <i>The article on Europages was and have never been nominated for deletion</i>. No one seem to make any comment on this reference. Does that same article meet same criteria, that it has not been nominated for deletion? Just a thought after reading all the trends. TylerOH 16:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I looked at the article and I agree with you: I nominated it for deletion as you suggested. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 16:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I thought the article on Europages was nominated for deletion, and that was removed, and Nigerian Yellow Pages still suggested for deletion. I've raised this before, that we do not have a balanced judgement here.....since I've been using Wikipedia, Europages has never been up for deletion, only when someone raised the issue, then people thought of it for deletion. Again...numbers of people who are here day-in day-out with their comments, never mentioned of Europages as not in line with Wikipedia policy, but bent on making several comments on Nigerian Yellow Pages. I've been condemed for my remark before now.....and my very reason of not becoming a member...becos I do not like unbiased comments. With or without this article, someone already suggested we westerners will not be deprived of information we need, but I can assume we can get it from Europages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.146.0.12 (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.146.0.12.html" title="User talk:134.146.0.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.146.0.12_747e.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.146.0.12">contribs</a>) 15 October 2006 17:16 (UTC)</small>

<dd>Firstly, Europages <i>is</i> going through the AfD process, the same as this one. And, bless you, deletion of the Wikipedia article would not deprive westerners of any information, because there is no information in the article that is not on Nigerian Yellow Pages! Are you confusing "Wikipedia" with "the internet"? --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 09:01, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Abeg my pardon RobertG. If Europages is going through same, why do the deletion sign appeared on NigerianYellowPages and not on Europages anymore? We need balanced judgment here. I could be wrong though, but I remember seeing the deletion sign on Europages but not anymore, and I can hear RoberG mentioning that <b>Europages is going through the AfD process</b>, what is the meaning of this comment?

<li><b>Comment.</b> Most of these newspapers have websites with online archives. I don't have time to go through all the refs right now, but I did pull up the first one, which is given as "ThisDay Newspaper, Page 26. November 3, 2005". <a href="http://www.thisdayonline.com/news.php?archive=2005-11-03" class="external text" title="http://www.thisdayonline.com/news.php?archive=2005-11-03" rel="nofollow">Here is ThisDay from November 3, 2005</a>. I didn't read all the articles, but NigerianYellowPages is certainly not mentioned in any of the headlines, nor do any of the articles have headlines that suggest that they might be about this website. I doubt that any coverage therein would be nontrivial, but I would appreciate it if someone with more time than I have could take a look. Additionally, that "AboutUs.org featured site" link is pointing at someone's wiki, which would almost certainly not be considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 14:35, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Aboutus featuring NigerianYellowPages.com among the many millions of site could have been a good credit and recognition of the work done by this company. At least, NigerianYellowPages.com do not owned or control the decision for its site to be featured. What interest me to comment is what I found on the wiki site at <a href="http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com" class="external free" title="http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com</a> i.e <b>The place to go if you're looking for a business in Nigeria.</b></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b>There is considerable evidence that is should be kept. Someone in this trend mentioned being a Nigerian, and that he saw the newspapers articles. I need to ask where Egot comes from if he is knowledgable about Nigeria society itself. I can also confirm that not all article in a day (eidtion) newspaper are made available on the web. The major headlines are posted, and that very newspaper has hundreds of other articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.62.6.162 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.62.6.162.html" title="User talk:86.62.6.162">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.62.6.162_fcbf.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.62.6.162">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Reply.</b>It is a pity such words came from you. How on earth would someone see a yellow pages with considerable innovation and progress as irrelevant. If it is irrelevant, how come Celtel that just came into the country recognised the need to put their link on its website so that all Nigerians can have access to business directory at their finger tips? How again would <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yell.html" title="Yell">Yell</a> UK put lots of resources achieving same for UK and the world. It is becoming so clear how your argument is.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article definitely qualifies, in my opinion. With my short time on wikipedia, I've seen lots of articles with only references to books e.tc whose presence are not web-based. e.g <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. If those references are doubted, people would have commented on them, same with Nigerian Yellow Pages - becos many Nigerians themselves would have raise a comment. Only Egot who is familiar with Nigeria articles, but making a reference to another competitor without any need for it - which makes someone thought of him being the competitor itself. Let us not be biased in making judgement. TylerOH 16:21, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
