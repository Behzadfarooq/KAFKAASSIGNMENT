<p>Non-notable acronym. Less than 2000 Google hits, most of which are not instances of this acronym. Many seem to be a word in a foreign langauge (or in some cases it could just be gibberish). Many others are actually binary content from PDF files and the like. Actual occurrences of the acronym are extremely fleeting and I had a time trying to find one. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 00:59, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Sooner if you help" has a certain significance among collaborative developers (of Linux, for example) as the answer to the oft-heard question "When will it [the software] be done/released?"

<li>I don't see how an abbreviation for something as simple as <i>with respect to</i> could have a history or be encyclopedic, even if it came out of mathematics.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The issue isn't whether she merits the attention she's gotten (I agree she doesn't). For an objective encyclopedia, the issue is that she has in fact gotten the attention, and hence become notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't understand why people are voting to keep this article. National attention is given to non-consequential things all the time which are not article worthy. She is not an important enough figure to warrant having an encyclopedia article.

<li><b>Strong Delete.</b> This sort of trivial nonsense does not belong on Wikipedia. This story is a giant blob of nothing in a sea of nothingness. Hundreds of civilians are killed in the Middle East and Central Asia along with kidnappings of various people &amp; etc and this nonsense story with no merit or value is what most American households are worried about. This soul-sucking culture-eating demon of anti-thought should be eradicated before it threatens to infect us all with an inane sense of seeking the milquetoast epitome of vicarious passionately confused maleficence and socially destructive fantasies of banality and violence born of boredom and neglect. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 23:30, 14 May 2005 (UTC) Naturally, I understand how the argument goes that <i>because</i> she received such massive media attention she should receive an article, and, though I do hold many reservations about that line of reasoning in this particular instance, I would tend to agree with the idea. However, the length of the current article seems far too long to be justifiable given the importance of the subject-matter. I feel that I must revise my previously expressed sentiments on the matter and suggest that, even though I personally despise pretty much everything surrounding this whole issue, it should have its own article so long as it is short. I don't see why a picture is necessary in the article. In any event, my personal sentiments are still that it should be deleted entirely, but, in the interests of the necessarily-principled foundations of Wikipedia, I will not contend with those who would seek to include it on the basis of a certain notoriety. Again, I would like to express how I feel that the relevancy and importance of the subject-matter is not nearly great enough to justify the current length and depth of the article. --<a href="../../../x/a/l/User%7EXaliqen_c3d2.html" title="User:Xaliqen">Xaliqen</a> 00:17, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As a television free Canadian I don't get the relevance of this story and the article itself does nothing to clarify it. A woman ran away, she's got some issues. Hmm, sure glad I know that. As a few people mentioned this might have some value as part of a media circus article or somesuch but I hardly think it's weighty enough to merit a seperate heading of it's own. There's just nothing novel, interesting or memorable about this story. Does anyone seriously think that in 6 months (let alone 10 years) kids will be digging through Wikipedia for information on Jennifer Wilbanks for history reports? This is typical short term media frenzy crap. Of course maybe somebody can rewrite the article to illustrate the relevance and I'll change my mind. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabriel_40ce.html" title="User:Gabriel">Gabe</a> 07:22, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Right - I made an article about myself since I discovered I had been listed as a 'notable anarchist', which I could make something of a case for actually, especially compared to some of the others who are listed here - my article on nonwestern anarchisms was translated into Turkish and Russian and published all over the world, and I have been active and writing for over a decade in the anarchist community - so anyway are you saying I should not have done so?

<li>Although the tone of what is currently written may not be encyclopedic yet, with revision it can be made more so.

<ul>
<li>My vote is mostly based on the legitimacy of the title and subject matter. I do agree that the content needs some major revision to more accurately (and unbiasedly) reflect the nature and importance of the organization. But the comments so far have talked more about the legitimacy of the organization as an academic entity and less about the content actually inside. As I said before the organization is a legal entity with real membership that has recieved significant press and warrants an article if someone is willing to write it. My vote remains. nathanpbell 17:58, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

There are dozens of such groups at virtually every college and university in the English-speaking world, or tens of thousands of groups in total. WP precedent has been that such a group gets an article only if substantial notability (beyond campus) is demonstrated. There's no indication that the AAHS <i>(one hammock!)</i> has garnered as much attention even locally as other groups on that campus. Apparently the members spend so much time in hammocks (or sharing the group's one) that they never learn how to properly <i>define</i> 'encyclopedic'. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:46, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

In light of my new understanding of Wikipedia I anticipate allowing a third perspective the opportunity to write about this movement and to resubmit it in the near future as the movement becomes more notable for you're liking.

<p>Meelor is claiming, in effect, the ability to read minds. She possesses the godlike ability to devine the motivations of other contributors. That is quite a trick!</p>
<p>More importantly, this PAC is one of many such groups that should have their own individual pages on Wikipedia. Afterall Wikipedia is not a reflection of what she might want to talk about but about what anyone who uses Wikipedia might want information about. This is not a newspaper. This is an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Meelar, unless evidence of much more notability is shown. There were hundred of PACs active in the last election cycle. By either media attention or amount donated, this one is among the least significant, and had no known effect. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:50, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I doubt that there are "tens of thousands" of PACs -- Barno's estimate seems more credible -- but, either way, there are enough that we'll probably never have a complete list. Nevertheless, it's a noteworthy topic, and any coverage we can get is a plus. Knowing a PAC's size (budget) and roster of supported candidates is worthwhile. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 19:04, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It seems reasonable that such PACs come up in the news and people may come here as part of their search for information. Would like to see more about the comparative notability with other more well-known PACs (or does someone need to come up with a political BEEFSTEW meter?) <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 20:52, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Problem: Suppose a reader sees a news reference to a particular PAC and wants to know more about it. This particular reader, used to consulting Wikipedia (and we want readers like that, right?), comes here and finds no article. Is that because the PAC failed the BEEFSTEWish test? or because no one's written an article? I think that, if the PAC is small, that's still information worth conveying. Furthermore, even fairly small donations have occasionally been the basis for notable political scandals, when a candidate is accused of receiving money from someone disreputable. Therefore, information about a PAC is worthwhile even if it's a small PAC. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 22:31, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hopefully, said user would be savvy enough to head on over to <a href="http://opensecrets.org" class="external text" title="http://opensecrets.org" rel="nofollow">opensecrets.org</a> to learn about said PAC. If not, said user would hopefully end up at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_action_committee.html" title="Political action committee">Political action committee</a>, where opensecrets is linked (though not nearly prominently enough, and not by name, either!) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 22:38, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it were up to me, I would keep all articles on PACs which have received even a small amount of coverage in the media. Most of them never attain this level. See <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_Test_of_Political_Significance_b0c9.html" title="User:Meelar/Test of Political Significance">User:Meelar/Test of Political Significance</a> for my personal criteria. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 23:59, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> is right. This is just another PAC. There are millions around the world, nearly all of whom haven't an entry in this encyclopedia. What I would like to ask is how this specific one is exceptional; this was not proven in the article.</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b>, since people may be researching, say, party funding in the last US election and the effect of the Christian Right on politics. While this is a relatively minor PAC, it still could be useful. The use of the word "controversial" strikes me as biased, although looking at the views of the three politicians in question, I can understand how they would cause controversy.</li>

The article attempts to document a irrational hatred of Americans based on "the belief that all or most Americans are stupid, fat, bad, racist, or generally inferior" and labels it with a special term "Ameriphobia". This explanation for anti-American prejudice has some merit, but it's already discussed in existing articles. Creating a separate article for this idea and giving it a talk-show-style name has no purpose but to further somebody's political agenda. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 17:49, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm confused by your comment. If it's a common term, why shouldn't Wikipedia document it, even though its usage is POV? If it's common, how is documenting it using Wikipedia as a soapbox? (Actually, though, it's not common. So <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a>, which it doesn't seem to be any different in usage from.) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">Nickptar</a> 22:51, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Certainly the word deserves documentation. But that doesn't mean giving the word its own article. Since Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>, we don't have articles for every single widely-used word. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 23:21, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is nonsense but there was a real Sun Ripened Warm Tomato Party that stood candidates in the first Australian Capital Territory elections in 1989. Its preferences went to elect Residents Rally candidates to the Assembly. As a result of the lax party registration laws that allowed this party and other similar parties to stand candidates, the electoral legislation in the ACT was changed to provide that parties must have 100 members and a constitution before they could register.

Note that Open Secrets has chosen to include information about it, something that it has not done for thousands of other. Wikipedia is an on-line encyclopedia. If anything it can have more information than Open Secrets. Some of the anxiety expressed here is that this article ventures in tabu territory by talking about ethnic lobbies in American politics.

<p>Non-notable. I have been looking on the net for the past day or so for any information on this character or not, and the closest I can find is a character of a similar name, from an entirely different creator (Pandaman, from the anime <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Piece_aa17.html" title="One Piece">One Piece</a></i>). The <a href="http://yogi072003.tripod.com/officialpandamansite/" class="external text" title="http://yogi072003.tripod.com/officialpandamansite/" rel="nofollow">Official Panda~man site</a> (the information is found on) doesn't seem to have been touched lately, and only has 300-odd hits on the counter. Lastly, Tripod (the hosting service for the website) indicates that the site <a href="http://yogi072003.tripod.com/" class="external text" title="http://yogi072003.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">may have been abandoned</a> shortly after creation.

<li>The problem is, the "Official Site" is a subsite on a Tripod account (see link one above). The main portion of this account is listed with the standard Tripod blurb for abandoned accounts (see link two above). Granted, there's no dates or time indicators on the pages, but an active site would have a lot more information and updated data. Furthermore, if this comic is critical to the creator's business/fame/welfare/etc., I would think that it would rate a lot higher than a subsection on a free ISP; not to knock Tripod or the kind, but in a day and age when most substandard webcomics have their own domains and URLs, something that reputedly saw publication at one time should not only have a mention somewhere else on the web as well, but should have its own domain and URL, IMHO.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 12:36, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>A strange one, this - I found it via the random page link. As far as I can tell no-one called David Conway has anything to do with John Conway's game of life. The page was anonymously created on April 1, has not been edited since, and has no links to it. However, there may well be useful material in this article, so I recommend <b>merge</b> what material is useful into <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Conway_b935.html" title="John Conway">John Conway</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life_013a.html" title="Conway's Game of Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> and then <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 20:16, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page was previously listed on VfD. The prior consensus reached was Redirect without Merge to <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDojo_0c78.html" title="McDojo">McDojo</a>.

<li>So far I've seen no solid justification for merging it with McDojo, especially considering they're completely different terms. Bullshido is a term that encompasses McDojos, fraud, questionable practices, poor standards, and other garbage in the martial arts. It sounds like sour grapes to me, go go passive-aggressive wikipedia editors! <b>Keep</b> --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 18:28, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've heard the term at many different martial arts clubs and it is prevalent throughout related internet groups Jekyll 18:46, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Bullshido is a valid and established (in certain circles) term that is separate in definition from 'McDojo', thus a redirect, with or without merge, would not be appropriate here. I think the mere fact that there's so much discussion around this article is an indication that the article is, in fact, relevant and interesting. Thus, removing it would be a disservice to the community. If some of you are not happy with the content of the article, then a dicussion of how these complaint can be addressed is the way to proceed, not this. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefurman_2705.html" title="User:Thefurman">thefurman</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Bullshido is a website with 5,000+ members. The word "Bullshido" is used by many martial artists as a descriptive term for ineffective or fraudulent martial arts training and instructors ("That's Bullshido!", "He's a Bullshido artist." etc.) . It's becoming part of the martial arts vocabulary and is used even by people who don't frequent the primary website. This entry should stay. --Katanahamon 19:04, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - These are terms with different meanings, it would definitely be beneficial for the online community to be able to view the seperate meanings for these two different words. - --Jso234 01:25, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - An instructor can teach bullshido. He can't teach McDojo. You can train at a McDojo. You can't train at a bullshido. The only thing these terms have in common is that they both describe serious (but separate) problems in the martial arts community.

<li><b>Keep</b> - "McDojo" is a recognized term among people who haven't even heard of the Bullshido website.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The usage and meaning of "McDojo" does not pertain to the phrase "Bullshido" in manner or form.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Bullshido &lt;&gt; McDojo. Bullshido is applied to anything that is purported to be effective when it can be refuted in demonstration. No-touch knockouts are a example of this. A McDojo is a place wherein Bullshido could be but is not necessarily taught. A McDojo is usually shown to have it's front window lined with trophies and to churn out black belts like a burger chain churns out combo meals.</li>

<li><b>Redirect without Merge</b> In light of the ridiculous sock-puppetry on this deletion vote, I am changing my vote to redirect without merge. I prefer <b>delete</b> over keep. I thought this article had some value, but the admin closing this vote should note that every person voting between Phrost and myself has fewer than 5 edits. Most have only one or two. User:Shuma-Gorath appears to have none. All of the unsigned votes that I could see (I didn't actually go through each one, I don't have that kind of time) were by anon IPs, and under policy should be automatically discounted. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 15:14, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, you're changing your vote not based on your opinion, but simply because your feelings were hurt over new members voting?

<ul>
<li>No, I'm changing it because they appear to be accounts created specifically to subvert the VfD process. When I say "one or two edits", I don't mean they appear to have edited articles and then stumbled on this one singular vote for deletion...their only edits are on this page and this page alone. That smacks of blatant sock-puppetry, and using sock puppets to subvert VfD is against policy.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 15:25, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, but what does that have to do with the worth of the arcticle? That's what all of this is about, remember? This is an ENCYCLOPEDIA, not a venue to play out political confrontations. If you think the article has merrit and should stay, than that is how you should vote if you want to remain true to the mission of this project. Otherwise, you're acting out on emotion or some silly sense of revenge. Now, onto "sock puppets". Am I a sock puppet? I've never participated in the wikipedia process up until this point. In fact, I only made my account to vote here, since this is the first time I am faced with something I feel strongly enough about to bother. Should my vote not count? Are some members more equal than others? Why do you feel the need to insult me and others like me? It seems that you really need to sit down, forget about your emotions, and think through your position. As it is right now, it's in conflict with itself. You can't claim the moral high road and accuse others of subverting the wikipedia process while voting to delete an article that you yourself consider worthwhile over a petty grudge. Sorry. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefurman_2705.html" title="User:Thefurman">Thefurman</a> 15:44, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want my reasoning behind my vote, it is actually a logical extension of my sock-puppet argument. I've found that sock puppets tend to show up when there is an attempt to subvert NPOV. The NPOV problem with this article has been mentioned by previous voters, specifically <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a>. I was not persuaded at the time - I didn't believe that the article was POV. I have rethought that position and am now under the impression that (1) it is and (2) there is not sufficient content to modify that. Therefore, with regards to my vote, it stands. With regards to "some members more equal"...sockpuppets are all different faces of one member, and while that member is equal, his/her attempt to vote twice (or three times, or four times...) by using sockpuppets is actually an attempt to be "more than equal." If you aren't a sockpuppet, then I'm sorry...this is nothing personal. Nevertheless, even you must admit that it is very suspicious.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 16:14, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going to bow out of this discussion as I see no point in it continuing. You're not litening to me. That is ok. You don't have to. Hopefully, you will soon cool down and rethink all of this with a clearer head. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefurman_2705.html" title="User:Thefurman">Thefurman</a> 16:49, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I'm not a sock puppet. I was an anonymous user but felt compelled to register to defend this article. The concept of "Bullshido" is different from "McDojo". A TKD Franchise where you have eight year old Black Belts running around is a McDojo. They may teach legitimate fighting techniques that could actually work if applied and trained correctly, but elect instead to sell belts and ranks to make people happy. Bullshido are those techniques that are pure garbage. One touch knockouts, Chi power, slow moving defense against attackers, no-contact sparring, etc. The words are different. I've been studing martial arts for over 20 years now and hadn't heard the term being used either until a year or so ago. However that's strictly a function of how long the term has actually been around. This article should stay. -- Katanahamon 17:40, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not a sockpuppet either. How about caring more about the integrity of the definitions and less about some misguided ferver to discredit actual live people who care to express their opinion. Even if you had a million edits your opinion would not be more valid than ours. Elitism has no place in this type of forum. Like many facets of the internet, this particular idea (Wikipedia) was created in part to escape/circumvent the very thing you are doing here. OH, and by the way, I tried to email you but you aren't accepting emails through your Wikipedia login. That's your right, but it is kind-of cheesy to be able to argue then retreat behind annonymity. --Chronomorte 21:34, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

I have browsed Wikipedia a few times and never registered pretty much because I dont have much to add to many items here... The reason for keeping Bullshido is because its a valid term in its own right, it is different in meaning from Mcdojo so shouldnt be merged with it.

<li>This is hilarious. An outpouring of support for the article gets dismissed simply because the individuals involved aren't going around cramming their views down other people's throats. The opinions of people who have been recently introduced to Wikipedia aren't as important as those who spend copious amounts of their free time interjecting themselves into subjects on which they have absolutely no expertise. I especially love how some of the votes for deletion, which are BLATANTLY biased, are being presented by people who have absolutely no connection to the martial arts and no perspective on the relevance of Bullshido within this community. It would be as asinine as me editing the NASCAR article, or voting on deletion of a related subject. This is precicely why people have legitimate gripes with how Wiki operates. It doesn't take any expertise, just an overinflated sense of self-importance, a healthy dose of passive aggression, and a dash of hubris. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhrost_6b8d.html" title="User:Phrost">Phrost</a> 02:35, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ad for IRC channel for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouverites</a>.

<li>It's not an ad for a channel. It is a demonstration of a different way of running a channel with a very diff philosophy behind it's beginnings and how it works. The profanity is a result of the freedom allowed in the channel and was inserted in the topic as a warning to the sensitive viewers. It needs more content but I do not feel deltion is the solution! <b>Keep</b> --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSimkin_9ae9.html" title="User:TheSimkin">TheSimkin</a> 20:29, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is not an ad; it is a piece on a place. Places can be on the internet, in the mind, in the world, etc. An ad is trying to convince people of the fitness of something for some purpose. Exactly what purpose is being put forward for Vancouver-Free? Vancouver-Free is a part of our heritage as Canadians, so if this is an international project, I'd worry about potentially racist exclusions. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.84.212.100_f9a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.84.212.100">24.84.212.100</a>.

<li>The point is that this IRC channel must become well-known as an embodiment of freedom, a Canadian cultural icon, or whatnot before it merits a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlatypeanArchcow_1412.html" title="User:PlatypeanArchcow">PlatypeanArchcow</a> 22:58, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who called whom a racist? There was the idea that perhaps this is a piece of Canadiana and therefore is subject to different standards for cultural appropriateness. If Wikipedia is something that's supposed to galvanize American culture and make it appear as though there are no alternatives, that is of course valid. Vancouver-Free is the embodiment of freedom, and so there may be cultural problems accepting what it is... <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.84.212.100_f9a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.84.212.100">24.84.212.100</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> RE: "We don't have aritcles on every non-notable IRC Channel out there". I do not beleive it's fair to dismiss an article based on the fact that other articles like it do not exist. The question is weather this article has any merit. I think as an example of a random group of people discussing ideas without restrictions the channel and the wikipedia page should be saved. At very least, this article is brand new and should be given some time (a few weeks) to grow and expand. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSimkin_9ae9.html" title="User:TheSimkin">TheSimkin</a> 21:29, 2005 May 11 (UTC)

<li>Please register your misgivings elsewhere. If a lot of people <i>who have edited on Wikipedia for a while</i> think this article is not worth keeping then it will be deleted. I understand your frustration at having your cherished work removed, but Wikipedia cannot have an article on every IRC channel out there. IRC channels become noteworthy when Osama hangs out there, it is cited extensively in newspapers or is the vehicle of celebrity adultery. Until then, you cannot insist on Wikipedia keeping this article. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:42, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I thought this was the location for posting misgivings regarding having a page deleted? I do not insist or want to force anyone to keep this page. I just feel that it's content is useful and relative (and will be more so if given time to grow). I disagree strongly that a channel becomes important because someone famous is in the channel. It is a place of open discussion of ideas. This is why it is important and deserves a place on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSimkin_9ae9.html" title="User:TheSimkin">TheSimkin</a> 21:57, 2005 May 11 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, this is where you vote. It's the numbers that count, unless someone votes for a reason and you can prove with evidence that this reason is incorrect. Wikipedia has certain rules for notability. Even if Brad Pitt were to use vancouver-free, this would not make the channel notable unless a major scandal brewed on there. On <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a> you will find some examples of what are reasons for inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:10, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Influencial to what Level? In this case it has been influencial if in nothing else it has made #vancouver clean up there act and be less facist.

I must say that many articles i have read on Wikipedia have not met the critia you guys are asking for. Nor do I think that Brad Pitt is important in any way. According to Wikipedia policy wikipedia is NOT a democracy. So i'm not sure why the few hundred bites this articles would take up must be deleted when some people think it contains useful info, other than you guys don't think it's worthy. I realize the page is going to be deleted now. But I am going to save it make changes to it and do it better and then post it again at a later time. I don't think this is in violation of any of the rules or policies of wikipedia. I'd also like to point out that as an advertising tool this would be extremly week. And there is no reason at all that i would want to use wikipedia to advertise anything. What I did want to do was have it so when someone asks what is #vancouver-free about we could post a link to the vancouver-free home page and to the wikipedia site. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSimkin_9ae9.html" title="User:TheSimkin">TheSimkin</a> 00:23, 2005 May 13 (UTC)

<p>Bike derbies, as described in this entry, are increasing in popularity among the cycling crowd and it was (according to a bunch of bloggers, links available upon request&#160;;) a big hit at this year's Fruita Fat Tire Festival. Anyway, I thought the topic was interesting enough to do some research and write this thing and I still think it's worth having here.</p>

<p>This article is not specific to the game Starfleet Universe (SFU) despite its title. It is not even about individual ships but is about ship classes.

<dd>Excuse me? If you're going to resort to <i>ad hominem</i> at least get your facts right. Even if you consider my opposition to this article "vandalism", this page is the only one I've touched (besides the process of listing it on VFD). Try addressing the matter at hand or do not participate. I listed this page because the subject is non-notable and one of, unfortunately, countless individuals who commit heinous crimes against defenseless and innocent individuals. Rather than glamourizing these monsters by treating them like celebrities, they should be forgotten unless the circumstances are such that they merit a lengthy description (i.e. if the victim(s) are famous). 67.172.27.22 22:38, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'<i>Keep</i> -- first of all, you ought to sign your name to enter a vfd. Second, while I agree that this guy sucks and I resent having to hear about him for the next three months, the fact it that he could turn into another <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_circus.html" title="Media circus">media circus</a> like the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runaway_Bride_3cbe.html" title="Runaway Bride">Runaway Bride</a>, in which case he is encyclopedic.

<dd>Okay, I'll sign it. But at least the runaway bride was notable. The fact that a large manhunt was conducted beforehand makes the fact that she simply took a bus across the country such a big story. If she had taken the bus and then called her fiance to tell him before anybody had a chance to put up any missing posters, nobody in the world would know or care why she did it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise, this guy is a common criminal. For a couple of days, Zion, IL was on alert because they thought a predator was on the loose -- turns out it's the father of the victim. Not the first time nor the last time a scumbag will kill his daughter, and his story is of no particular significance compared to any of America's other killers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, I oppose the way killers are made out to be celebrities. I want this article deleted now so that people don't continue to pour their time and effort into making a huge, detailed encyclopedia article telling the life story of a guy that doesn't deserve even a millisecond of any of our attentions.</dd>
