<li>Okay. Every non-religious song could be listed here. And how are we supposed to find out what song some 100-student middle school in Arkansas played six years ago.

<ul>
<li>I doubt that every non-religious song could be listed here. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s <i>We All Stand Together</i> seems unlikely to have ever been played at a dance, for example, it being in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_signature.html" title="Time signature">triple time</a>. <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Trent_D%27Arby_94ef.html" title="Terence Trent D'Arby">Terence Trent D'Arby</a>'s <i>As Yet Untitled</i> doesn't even have a beat. Furthermore: What makes you think that this article <i>requires</i> you to find out what a 100-student middle school in Arkansas played six years ago? The only requirement, given the page as it stands, is that one be able to verify whether the song is played <i>at dances</i>, <i>not</i> whether it was played at a specific dance. There are plenty of references to pick from that make such verification exceedingly easy. Google Web turns up hundreds of lists of songs played at dances that one can use for verification. Here are just three:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.acustomdj.com/Song-list-directory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.acustomdj.com/Song-list-directory.html" rel="nofollow">songs played at wedding dances</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com/guide/song_list.htm#SONGS" class="external text" title="http://www.salsanewyork.com/guide/song_list.htm#SONGS" rel="nofollow">Salsa dance songs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.missiondance.com/songlist.html" class="external text" title="http://www.missiondance.com/songlist.html" rel="nofollow">Mission Dance song list</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If, as it appears to be, your objection here is that the contents of such a list would be unverifiable because it would be impossible to verify that a song listed <i>was</i> in fact played at dances, your objection is highly flawed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:42, 2005 Jun 19 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary so far:
<ul>
<li><i>List could contain every song ever recorded.</i> — False. We've already turned up several songs, possibly <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthem.html" title="Anthem">whole</a> <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lament.html" title="Lament">classes of</a> <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">songs</a>, that have been recorded but that wouldn't be on the list.</li>
<li><i>Every non-religious song could be listed here.</i> — False. Even some non-religious songs aren't songs played at dances. I've provided some examples of those, too.</li>
<li>We'd have to <i>find out what some 100-student middle school in Arkansas played six years ago.</i> — False. We only need to find out whether a song is played <i>at dances</i>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Okay, you're right. All I'm saying is that while many lists on wikipedia cannot have all their items listed, this is the epitome of that. Also, as I said in my original comment, this is useless. Who would ever want to know if a song was played at a dance. I thought about that for a few minutes, and the only time I could think of was someone coordinating a dance. In light of your argument, I changed my vote from <i>strong delete</i> to just <i>delete</i>.

</ul>
<p>Oh, and the Arkansas thing. What I meant was that there might be a song played at a dance that was played at no other dances.

<li><b>Delete</b> - <i>would</i> extend to infinity to include every possible song, including religious ones because "dances" do not have to mean only school dances and the like.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like to vote delete on gut feeling, but I can't find good, solid criteria on which to base it. That's not to say this list doesn't have serious problems, as others pointed out. Are lists we find on the web credible references? Can we ever verify a given song was <i>not</i> played at a dance, in other words, is this list <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> at all? If they are references, should we mention them in the list or can we leave it to the reader? As others have pointed out, is there any <i>point</i> to listing every song played at some dance somewhere? Is that knowledge? Any song can be played at a dance, what does it matter? You could be interested in popular music or dance music or even popular dance music, but a list of songs <i>played</i> at dances? What's dance music, anyway? Should we include <a href="../../../g/a/v/Gavotte.html" title="Gavotte">gavottes</a>? No? Contemporary music only? What's that, then? Come to think of it, what's a "dance", actually? And what qualifies as a "dance" internationally? <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 21:02, 2005 Jun 21 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think what we have here is someone who vastly underestimated the potential size of the list. What it comes down to is that it's a pretty meaningless and overly broad category. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 02:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
