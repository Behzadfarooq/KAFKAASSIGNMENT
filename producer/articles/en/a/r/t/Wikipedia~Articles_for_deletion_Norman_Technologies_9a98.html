<li><b>Comment</b>: "unique" Google hits are a fallacy, and have no bearing on the importance of a given topic. Under no circumstances will any imaginable topic, no matter how notable, return in excess of 1000 "unique" hits. The article topic is still a <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">non-notable corporation</a> though. — <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_9077.html" title="User:Adrian"><font color="#000000">A</font></a></b><font color="#646060">drian</font> <b><a href="../../../a/d/r/User_talk%7EAdrian_59cc.html" title="User talk:Adrian"><font color="#000000">L</font></a></b><font color="#646060">amo</font> <b><font color="#F660AB">··</font></b> 09:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> My understanding is that "unique hits" are filtered from the first 1000. In a case like this, where the total is 793, the unique hits are accurate.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> because it's obvious that too few Delete-advocates even read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> when they cite it as a reason for deletion. So, let me copy it here, so you don't have to click the link and read it:</li>
</ul>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets <b>any one</b> of the following criteria: 1. The company or corporation has been the subject of <b>multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself</b>. This criterion <i><b>excludes</b></i>: o Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. o Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories. This criterion <i><b>includes</b></i> published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</p>
<p>Now, with that being said, if you look at the article Norman Technologies, you will see that the Charlotte Business Journal has written about Norman Technologies on two different occasions. You will also see that the company is unique in two different ways -- it's the ONLY American I.T. consultancy engaged solely in international financial transaction initiatives; and it is the ONLY non-bank representative on an important committee of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Chamber_of_Commerce_3c55.html" title="International Chamber of Commerce">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, which is an organization that has been around since 1919. If you intend to delete perfectly acceptable articles such as this, then where is the action on articles such as: <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intrada.html" title="Intrada">Intrada</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Coney_I-Lander_e8c5.html" title="Coney I-Lander">Coney I-Lander</a>, Force Fed Records, and Kiessling, to cite just a few? Remember, the "Wikipedia exists to bring knowledge to everyone". So, ask yourself, Delete-advocates, why are you going after this particular article with such vigor? Is it because you know more about restaurants and record labels than you know about international transaction software (which is responsible for processing billions of dollars of trade every day)? I guess it's not notable if you don't understand it. -- <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 13:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comments</b> (1) Many companies are featured in a local business section or paper. Articles from non-local sources would have more weight. (2) Unique is not the same thing as notable. Is a company your size that works in international trade somehow more notable than one of the same size that works domestically? Sorry, don't see it. (3) There are a lot of articles here that don't belong. Doesn't justify keeping others. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> I don't see that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> says that newspaper articles must be "non-local". Maybe you should propose a re-write of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, rather than invent new criteria of your own design on an AfD page. -- <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 14:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> There's also the question of "multiple" and "non-trivial".

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not yet prepared to weigh in on the discussion, but it should be observed that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is only a guideline, such that it doesn't necessarily command the consensus of the community and in any event is not dispositive relative to any AfD and should not be adduced as categorically controlling. Whilst essays, guidelines, and policies that represent the deliberative consensus of the community writ large exist, every editor uses, of course, his/her own judgment—at least to some extent—in interpreting <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a>, especially <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and pronouncing as to the encyclopedic nature of a given subject, in order, inter al., that such pronouncements might be synthesized toward a propitious encyclopedic outcome. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "only a guideline" argument doesn't hold water. Several of our notability "guidelines" have seen steady and almost universal use for years, now. They all, in one form or another, embody the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a>. A few years ago, this discussion would have had editors giving their <i>personal opinions</i> of how "famous" or "well-known" or "important" the company is, or centring the discussion around the author of the article. Now, as a direct consequence of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, you'll notice that editors have gone looking for books, news articles, and the like (i.e. <i>sources</i>), and are basing their rationales upon the extent and nature of those sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I employ <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> in evaluating AfDs, but many do not, and there is surely no compulsion that they do so. Remember, there are some who think notability ought not to be a consideration in any AfD discussion (with which propisition I disagree quite strongly), and we do not summarily discount their participation here. The role of AfD is to synthesize the views of many editors apropos of the encyclopedic nature of a given subject, such that the criteria used by editors might be conflated toward the production of a consensus, irrespective of guidelines that reflect the views of most editors. I find <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and its progeny to follow directly from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, such that the former ought, IMHO, to be tagged as <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">policy</a>, in order that some frequently-repeated AfD discussions should be avoided, but in the absence of such tagging, it's not reasonable to dismiss cursorily any argument that relies on an uncommon interpretation of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or on criteria wholly different from those of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Really, and why is that? First, the company is not notable (that they paid money to someone to write an article for them to improve their exposure simply means that they paid money to someone to write an article for them), it certainly does not reflect on their notability. Also, as noted in the nom, the article reads like an advert. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 14:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - One reason the article reads like an advert is that its "importance" was questioned. In order to communicate the importance of a company, one often looks to superlatives such as "the biggest", or "the only". Personally, I thought that the fact the company lists among its clients such notable institutions as Barclays, BB&amp;T, PNC Bank, SunTrust, and Wachovia, would serve as enough indication that the company is important. Would each of these gigantic banks be comfortable working with an unimportant, non-notable vendor? Seems coincidental or lucky for Norman Technologies, if that were the case. Either that, or they lied on their website about their client roster. Take a look at the first few paragraphs of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Microsystems_c3ed.html" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>. Doesn't read like an advertisement, because you "assume" that you know Sun to be notable and not needing to defend its importance. On the other hand, read the first six sentences of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>. It very much reads like an advertisement. Just so we understand, is it okay for an article to read like an advertisement only if it is a delicious drink that many Wikipedians enjoy, but that articles about drab businesses in the information and financial transaction software implementation category may not read as an advert? -- <a href="../../../m/y/w/User%7EMyWikiBiz_056a.html" title="User:MyWikiBiz">MyWikiBiz</a> 19:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Someone explain to me clearly how deleting this article is a net benefit to humanity. It's a good little synopsis of an IT firm, and it explains two interesting things about them, particularly their representation to the international chamber of commerce. I honestly don't care if it *is* advertising in some vague twisted sense. It's extremely likely that some day someone will want to know more something about this company before they do business with them, and they're going to look for that information on the web. And guess what, if this article survives, Wikipedia will actually be able to inform them! Fancy that, Wikipedia informing someone who needs factual, unbiased information! If there are "thousands of IT consulting companies this size or bigger", please write articles about them - "thousands" out of 1.3 million articles is hardly excessive.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is a strange interpretation of the WP mission. By definition, advertising and self-promotion (eg, autobiography, and this is essentially corporate autobiography) fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Articles which are sponsored by self-interested parties do positive harm to the mission of an encyclopedia. That's why it should go.

WP:CORP explicitly says that "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." The newspaper coverage does not fall into the prohibited category, so policy says to keep this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Gingo100 and the five pillars. I wonder when I see someone arguing against any well written article whether the person(s) have some pov agenda of their own outside the main mission of this project being a repository for knowledge and quick reference.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;At the least an article like this gives wikipedia visibility due to web searching —a good thing for the other million plus articles—believe it or not there are still a great majority of people out there who have never heard of any wiki including wikipedia.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;As to notablility, any concern that as in the relatively brief history of this company that can grow a new enterprise to 26 employees in such a short time is undergoing explosive growth. By rough rule of thumb assuming unskilled labor that indicates annual sales of well over three million and since they're IT and professionals (taking into account benefits, retirement, medical and such derivative overhead costs needed to maintain a company) we can safely posit well over five million per annum, even in the cheaper labor market of the south US. That they are privately held and capitalized (!) vice being a public corporation is far more to their credit and notability by some significant exponential factor than some market funded enterprise. Try <i>your business plan</i> on the local bank and see how easy it is to get loans and lines of credit to spread out operations costs. Not!!!<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Ask your local mayor if he'd like a company like that on his tax base. Huh! We're not discusing your local retailer with three-quarters of it's employees in a part-time/non-benefits hiring category.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;Not every product can be easily described or packaged, especially when corportate confidentiality and overall security become major peices—ask your local Law firm or CPA for a list of services for examples—but don't doubt that such intangibles are important or necessary to many if not all service businesses.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am interested in this article because of its relationship to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflicts_of_interest_b24a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflicts of interest">Wikipedia:Conflicts of interest</a>. I spent about 15 min researching on the internet and found support for some of the statements, and reworded a statement regarding being "the only US..." to being "a US..." - since the reference I found didn't support for "only." I request those discussing the deletion of this article soley because it isn't totally referenced yet - reconsider since <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:eventualism">eventually</a> it will be, or the unsourced material will be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 17:52, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
