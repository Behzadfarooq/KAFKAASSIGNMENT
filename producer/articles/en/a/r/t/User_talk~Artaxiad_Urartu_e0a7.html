<p>Narek put the Haykazuni dynasty in the Armenia#Antiquity as well. Look in <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haik.html" title="Haik">Haik</a> the Haykazuni dynasty that would be 3rd millennium put with Aratta. Aratta was at the same time. Aratta is also Armeni look here from the Akkadian inscriptions time from armenianhighland.com:</p>
<p>The Akkadian king Naram-Suen [2236 - 2200 BC] launched an incursion into the Armenian Highland in order to fight the powerful kingdom of Armani or Aratta under the leadership of the Armani-Armenian King Madakina. In the inscriptions that were made both in Akkad and in southern portions of Armenia, he gave the details of the military campaigns against the Kingdom of Armani around the area of Lake Van. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To this day Persians refer to us by 'Armani' which you also see here Armani-Subari or Arme-Subria. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you know Dbachmann? He make a joke out of our history. Look in the Talk:Armenia <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If they say no can you approve? Cause when or if they revert it its based on ignorance. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html#Antiquity" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> I put the Haykazuni dynasty.

The "Hurri" is the same from the past as it is now the same meaning we were always Hurri or Hur worship which is Sun or Fire gragabash or arevbashd. You get it? So mention the link with Aryaee and Hurrian.

<p>I wrote to Eupator:</p>
<p>"Why do you keep touching Mitanni when Im editing somethign that has nothing to do with it? Also, Hitittes empire is farther West than "Hurri"-Mitanni. In case you didnt realize also I found something else. Hur or Hurri which we use to this day meaning Sun, Fire, Light, is the same Hurri which is what it means Sun or Fire which Hurri-Mitanni was based on worshipping. We have always been gragabashd or arevabashd. The sun symbol of the royal "Hurri"-Mitanni seal shows you this. Tigran Great's exact symbol on his crown with the Hurri(Sun) and 2 eagles.

<p>Queen Nefertiti of Egypt was a native of Mitanni. The Mittani Kingdom of Armenia was an off-shoot of the Hurrian kingdom. The Hurri and the Mittani in turn were the contemporaries the Hittites and the Hykos, within whom they shared many cultural and political aspects. Today, all these aforementioned nations are considered to be, in varying degrees, proto-Armenians, that is, we modern day Armenians are direct descendants of the remnants of those ancient tribes. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:28, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Mitanni seal of the Sun (arev) is Mitra at that time was known also. Gragabashd gam Arevabashd vor meeshd ayeenk menk. Ayseenkn nayeer Mitanni seal you see thats the arevasbashd which another words "Ar" for light, sun and thats why the very word we still have kept from that time "Ar" and "Hur" same word different slighty pronounced. Just like the Urartu is Ararat the Hur is also another way with the "H" sound added. They both mean the same and to this day we have Hurri and Hur which is Ar. Arevabasdh ayeenk meeshd Ararich Asdvatzeen meeshd eenk havadoom. We always knew Asdvatz and the true worship in spirt and truth. Look at here more references from azgaser's site:</p>
<p>"We think that much before the Achaemenians, in the times of Mitani, the name Mihr was already known to the people, particularly to those living in the regions of Mitani or Armani-Subari (and later Arme-Subria) where Sasun is located, in the form of Mitra (or perhaps even as Mher)." <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 09:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No listen Im saying at that time Hurri-Mitanni married to Egyptian Pharoahs. Daughtes of Hurri-Mitanni married to Egyptian Pharoahs. And it was at that time when the movie is based on that specific time get it? That Pharoah Akhenaten which actualy got the sun worship from us. We were always gragabashd yev arevbashd. So the attention on more on the sun was from us revealing to them that. So in the movie when there is Armenian speaking its showing the Hurri-Mitanni there at that certain time. There is even talk of an earlier time Armenians who were the Hyksos you see&#160;? Hyksos = Hakyuz in Greek its Hyksos like almost every word Greeks use like ends with "sos" like Philipos etc etc. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Hyksos were in Egypt for a long time from the end of 3rd millennium. Most likely when the Hurrian tribes from Armenia. Hurrians are as I said Aryan just like Arevmdahye says Grnam gnal Im Arevelahye I say garogh em gnam. Its different just like Hur and Ar same meaning. Pari looys Bari looys.

<p>Turks are saying Armenians are barbarians who came and killed Mitanni-Hurri and 'Urartians' so this what they use against us to deny the Genocide. That Armenians are not natives and came from outside and killed of the 'native' Hurrians. He is wrong, Armenology is the crux of National Strategy Doctrine!!!!!!!!!!!! So if you want Genocide recognition first of all you have to establish that Armenians are NATIVES not barbarian invaders who killed the 'Hurrians' Armenians are Aryans so were Hurrians who are native. Hurrian is another way to say AR-MENIAN or AR-YAN sons of AR (ARARICH -- CREATOR) the Sun God. Everyone in Armenia knows this. And you are defending our National doctrine that Armenians are natives of Armenian Highland and not 'genocidal invaders' as Turks teach in their 'Armenological' centers to their Armenian-speaking Turkish officers who pretend to be Armenologists and are spies in training <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is from Gevork. Take a look at his site its a lot of info. Like I said all our historians know Hurri-Mitanni is Armenian bedootoon. Oh check out Vardanank they are showing it all over I think your city will show it also. Just check yoru Armenian channels and its Monday nights at 11pm pacific though so it might be late little for you? <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Theres no Armenian channels here, Also Armenians were here way before turks, and the turks originated from central Asia along with all the other Turkic countries. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENareklm_3dec.html" title="User talk:Nareklm">Nareklm</a> 08:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Make sure you study on this time period a lot since you want to be a historian. HOnestly I just got into our Armenian history few months ago. Can you believe in few months since I had such love and passion for our azg I wanted to know the history in detail. So I know now these are Armeian kingdoms. Its not just Urartu (Ararat kingdom) Hurri-Mitanni is the Armenians so after they were Nairi as i showed you the map did you see&#160;? And later they build the stronghold of Urartu kingdom the same Hurrian-Aryan Armenians. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you look at his site he even shows Sumerian words are the same as Armenian. Like Garoon is Gurun and Ab is Ap and Kaidz is kaitz like lightning gaidz. So we have that time when we went south to "Ur" which is "Ar" even in the Hebrew writings explains that Ur is Ara. So Armeni Sumerians were there during that time. And so the Armeni later in 2300 BC Akkadian inscriptions mentions and to this day Armeni is how Persians refer to us isnt that amazing proof? I mean Hyks time was during Armeni Sumerians thats why Armens tribes were the same Armeni. Its always been with that way the root word "AR" for light, life, sun. Examples Arev, Areg, etc etc, Ararat is place of the creator. Ararich you see? Asdvatz = Ar arich <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I sent email to them for permission approval so they can email wikipedia permissions. There response is not right away though. Its important we have these dance photos. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 09:02, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Egyptian sources apply the term 'nhr', Naharina or Nairi (from the Assyro-Akkadian word for 'river' referring to Hurri-Mitanni with Naharina (Nairi). <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 09:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bro i wish it was easier to educate people but to many people twist around history such as the turks did you know they renamed ethnic Kurdish and Armenian animals? Narek 08:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah thats what Gevork my friend is saying. I just talked to him recently he has taken 10 years to make his site from 1997. <a href="http://www.armenianhighland.com/main.html" class="external free" title="http://www.armenianhighland.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.armenianhighland.com/main.html</a> You go to his main page and its right there the Hurri-Mitanni seal. You know whats amazing about that time, is that we went to Egypt bro. That is what this is all about that I want to clear up this history. See there is a battle with truth and lies and its obvious they want to say we didnt go there during that time of the 18th dynasty. You know thats the time of Akhenaten and his son who was Tutankhamen that golden treasure they found 80 years ago of the 18 year old king. Which his mother was from Hurri-Mitanni so what does that tell you?&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:26, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another amazing proof is that theere is a 1960's movie "The Egyptian" and my dad happened to rent it and I noticed Armenians were speaking in there. I had slightly heard that at some point in history we were in Egypt you know? So that was amazing that was during the time of those Pharoahs that Hurri-Mitanni went to Egypt. They speak Armenian in there some of them showing that at that time.

<p>Can you summarize this for me? So who are we descended from the map you showed? Nareklm 08:01, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
You see this&#160;? These scholars and historians didnt even know each other its not like a group of peopel together making something up. So they dont even know each other and they all point out these facts:</p>
<p>Jacquetta Hawkes, "The First Great Civilizations," London, 1967</p>
<p>"Yet the Hurrians did not disappear from history. Away to the North in their Armenian homeland, they entrenched themselves and build up the kingdom of Urartu."</p>

<p>M.Chahin, "The Kingdom of Armenia," London, 2001</p>
<p>"The new kingdom of Urartu, which proved to be the stronghold of the Hurrian race."</p>
<p>If you read in my Talk page you can see its at the end the bottom and its pretty long Im mentioning and explaining to him that the Hurrian=Aryan and its the same language but obviously like I said over the course of time the words change slightly like Bianili is Van now the B changed to V. Or the Hurri and Khurri. Har and Ar. Haran as I said was the main city of our Hurrian tribes in Arevmdahye areas. So there is the Har-minni reference as well with this. Which Har-minni is another way of "Ar"minni or Armeni. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:13, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thats very true but we might have been confused with Kurds since they lived near us but no actual records have overlapped and we used different technology and we look very different.</p>
<p>Mitanni kings names Tusratta means ten chariots "Tus" is ten in Armenian. But in Kurd/Persian its "Daa" its off. Its more near Armenian. Also Ardatama is most rigteous and its "Arda" or Ardar in Armenian. Perisans/Kurds not even close to this. So since peopel think they are Kurds (Aryans) they are more Armenian (Aryan) and its the Ar root word we are the root of the Aryan peoples. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 08:17, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I have all the sources there revealing even about Hurri-Mitanni. Have you also seen armenianhighland.com? The guy took 10 yearrs from 1997 to do it. Basically putting all our historians facts on the "internet" Armenian history from beginning to end. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:23, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I noticed you put the Mitanni seal on the right which I put there. You notice that seal? Its amazing Tigran the Great's crown is the same symbol of the 8 ray sun and the 2 eagles. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bro read my references those scholars make sure you read them. It explains it all there how Hurri=Aryan. People still dont know we say "Aryaee" in our language. We dont call ourselves "Indo-European" we say "Aryan" or "Aryaee" which makes clear most of this confusion. Also the Mitanni kings names are used to this day in Armenian. Like Tusratta means "ten chariots" which Tus is ten. Ardatama means "most righteous" which is Arda , rightreous in Armenian. The Persians call us "Armani" to this day form the Akkadian 2300 BC inscriptions of Armani. So there are a lot more things Im just telling about a few&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look at just a few of them here main ones:</p>
<p>Ivanov explains about the Hurrian-Aryan link</p>
<p>Jacquetta Hawkes, "The First Great Civilizations," London, 1967</p>
<p>"Yet the Hurrians did not disappear from history. Away to the North in their Armenian homeland, they entrenched themselves and build up the kingdom of Urartu."</p>
<p>M.Chahin, "The Kingdom of Armenia," London, 2001</p>
<p>"The new kingdom of Urartu, which proved to be the stronghold of the Hurrian race." <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:28, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We have always had battles yes. Mostly in ancient times with Assyrians. Our neighbors are huge evidence showing that we are that ancient. I mean even the cuneiform sepagir stories of the flood and of Aratta and Mashu (Masees). We are the cradle of civilization and the Aryan (Indo-European) people came from "Ar"arat. The root word "Ar" is the key in all this. Ar means light, life, sun. Which we have like 5 to 10 pages of words in our dictionary with Ar. As you know Armeni means children of Ar(light). Hur is another way of Ar or Har and sometimes we use the Xhy in place of Hye. Also the X is same as Kh like Khy or Khayasa(hayasa). So hurri is even used today which is fire, sun, or light also. Like hur "hr"apogh for volcano and jur "jr"vej. So its Hur = fire Jur = water. There is a lot more to talk about&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All of our historians know that (Hurri)Khurri-Mitanni was Armenian kingdom. First Hurrians were from Armenia. The language is still the same as of today from what I showed you of the Mitanni kings names. Language actually over the course of 1000's of years and from going to different lands. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry Ive been here the whole day I got a headache so I cant talk long. Make sure you read my references ok? Read those historians you will see that Hurri-Mitanni is an Armenian bedootoon. Kurds were mixed actually with Hitittes. Pesians and kurds are almost the same and Indians are also very near. We are the main ones of the "Ar"ya people you see&#160;?&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I kept talking and talking to the egyptian editor of the 18th dynasty which was the time Hurri-Mitanni of Armenian went there and our daughters married with Pharoahs. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vahan Kurkjian, "History of Armenia," Michigan, 1968</p>
<p><a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html" class="external free" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/home.html</a></p>
<p>"The Hurri-Mitanni kingdom of Armenia kept close contact with its western neighbor, Hittite or Hatti land. Masses of population were often transplanted from one country to the other. "</p>
<p>The great Indo-European and ancient Near East scholar Vyacheslav Ivanov.</p>
<p>Look in Hurrians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrians" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrians" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurrians</a></p>
<p>Now look down there in External links it has</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/pies/pdfs/IESV/1/VVI_Horse.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/pies/pdfs/IESV/1/VVI_Horse.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/pies/pdfs/IESV/1/VVI_Horse.pdf</a></p>
<p>Once you get there search Hurrian-Aryan and you will see it stands for Mitanni and the scholar explains it all in detail. And Aryan is the same as Indo-European. He explains all this there.</p>
<p>Are you there? You see what the confusion is? Since they see the "Indo"-Aryan they think its not Armenians. Aryan is Armenian they dont know that we refer ourselves as Aryan in Armenian. Since thats a key to finding out about our history they need to know how to speak Armenian first of all. Or ask Armenians how we say things. So if Hurrians are from Armenia and Hurri words are spoken to this day in Armenian and the Mitanni kings Armenian names and words? And if Haran the capital of Hurrians which is from the word "Har" which is also the "Ar" like in the Armenia page explains Har-minni which is Arminni you see? Or Armeni. So those slight changes we even have today. Like I gave examples some Armenians use the "Kh" instead of "H" for like Khurri its Hurri also. Are you there? <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 07:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Persians seperated from us 800 BC to the south according to Hovick Nersessian he has studied the Avesdan of the Persians which he explains are from our stories. For example the story of the tree of life which is not located in Persia but in Armenian Highlands. Also of the flood story and of Aramazd and Anahit etc etc. Mitra was during the Mitanni time and later came back. So yes those tribes were there with us since they were Aryan like us but Hurri-Mitanni is more Armenian and if you look I just remember something I have a map during that time they are mainly in Van as the stronghold and Nairi is mentioned there as well. So you see now? Here is the map. Map showing "Nairi" near Lake Van part of Hurri-Mitanni and (K)Hayasa is there also <a href="http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg" class="external free" title="http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg</a> Ararat arev 05:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC) This is clearly showing at the time of King Baratarna 1450 BC the beginnings of Hurri-Mitanni it already had the area around Lake Van. I mean that was there to begin with and then they stretched further west. Look in my talk page and hopefully you will understand more on Hurri-Mitanni. Look also in here <a href="http://www.armenianhighland.com/index_light.html" class="external free" title="http://www.armenianhighland.com/index_light.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.armenianhighland.com/index_light.html</a> and here <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/hi/Azgaser/AR.html" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/hi/Azgaser/AR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/hi/Azgaser/AR.html</a>.

<p>I saw the Editing History and I saw an Ip address in the ww1 section and right after that I see the person without the Ip and the name Dacy69. Can you check if this is the same person? Most like they have a connection cause right when the ww1 edit happened the Urartu false claims are put there by Dacy69. Which as you know thats the same thing Turkish people mostly say about they even say that Urartu is them the Turks! <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 06:22, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
