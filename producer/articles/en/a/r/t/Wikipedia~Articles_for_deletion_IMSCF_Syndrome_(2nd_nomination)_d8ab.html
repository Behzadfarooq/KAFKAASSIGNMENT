<li><b>Keep</b>. While it is not an academic term, it (and similar terms) is an informal, cultural term that is used by some in the Filipino-American community. The phenomenon outlined in the article has gone by other names, most notably "<a href="../../../t/i/a/Tia_Carrere_a42e.html" title="Tia Carrere">Tia Carrere</a> syndrome" during the 1990s. Whatever name it goes under, the fundamental concept involved is the denial of one's Filipino heritage and many articles have been written in Filipino-American publications.

Michael Tan, the author of the articles, is a Filipino anthropologist with a regular column in the said newspaper. I saw the term <a href="http://www.dipolognon.com/dipolognonHeadline01272005.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dipolognon.com/dipolognonHeadline01272005.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> as well but I haven't read this paper yet and the article seems to be "tainted" with Internet sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, the first article Michael Tan wrote didn't really delve into IMSCF Syndrome. This was explained in the second article (he didn't have enough space daw in the 1st). Interestingly, the 2nd article says:</li>

<dd><i>IMSCF syndrome</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Now the truth why I’m doing another column on origins. I had a subtitle in last Wednesday’s column that read “IMSCF syndrome,” but didn’t quite get to discuss the syndrome for lack of space.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>So just what is this syndrome? One of my graduate students, Christine Ajoc, alerted me to this term in a paper she submitted for my biological anthropology class. It means “I am Spanish-Chinese-Filipino syndrome,” and it is common among overseas Filipinos living in North America. Among Filipinos in Hawaii, there’s another variation where they claim Hawaiian ancestry as well.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term actually appears in a legal website, dictionary.laborlawtalk.com, and is described as “ethnic forgery” because that mixed ancestry is fabricated. The dictionary entry speculates that this falsified pedigree reflects the lack of a national identity among overseas Filipinos and the need to boost their social status by claiming to have Spanish and/or Chinese blood. Somehow, Filipino takes on connotations of being poor, of being inferior.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It seems even Michael Tan didn't know the existence of this "phenomenon" or term until it was introduced to him by a student. Which is not enough in my opinion to merit as a reference for this article. Had Michael Tan himself researched and verifiably proved the existence of the term through a survey or some anthropological study he conducted, this article would stand. But a paper from a graduate student? I don't think that's enough. And it is said <i>it is common among overseas Filipinos living in North America</i> but hey, if it was actually that common, wouldn't there be more reputable third-party sources?</dd>
<dd>As for the 3rd link, the word IMSCF Syndrome appears in a column (?) or opinion (like youngblood of PDI?) <i>Juvenile Answers By: Tyrone Jay V. Samson</i>. It seems to me that this article is based on this link, quoting:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Aside from colonial mentality, there’s also this IMSCF Syndrome. This is a non-academic term that relates to a unique form of institutionalized identity crisis phenomenon seen amongst overseas Filipinos. IMSCF Syndrome specifically refers to the tendency of many Filipinos, when questioned about their ancestry and nationality, to recite the phrase “I’m Spanish, Chinese, Filipino”. The name of the syndrome itself is an acronym formed from the first letters of this recited phrase.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If this is a reference, well, I find it laughable. All in all, this "syndrome" or "phenomenon" might really exist (in the minds and consciousness of Fil Ams abroad) but really, IMSCF Syndrome does not belong to Wikipedia until a more reputable and credible source crops up. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 12:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and Merge</b>. This article is trivia (it's stated that it is a non-academic term) and it is informal term in Pilippines' society per Chris'.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Ok I must admit, this article is cleverly presented as reputable, verifiable and factual. In reality, this is a non-existent "phenomenon" and unverifiable term. It is disguised with supposed references and external links which will purportedly support the claim of the validity of this syndrome. I've checked the references, and nothing directly refers or talks about IMSCF Syndrome. The references are about facts alright, but facts about different topics like the percentage of Spanish/Chinese, the Catalogo for names, and American colonial mentality. I am really appalled but dazzled by the absurdity of this article, because to uncritical Wikipedians, it will really seem fit for Wikipedia. The External Links do not provide as well an answer to who coined the IMSCF Syndrome, or what it is, or why it has been said. If it is a common non-academic term, why do Google and Yahoo hits only show for the ten most related links <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/IMSCF_Syndrome</a> and mirror sites like answers.com copying Wikipedia?? And to even put as External Links forum discussions just goes to show the lack or want of references to support this article. <b>Laugh out loud</b>. IMSCF Syndrome??!! I've never heard that in my entire life as a Filipino who reads PDI and Phil. Star daily, watches TV Patrol and 24 Oras nightly, and follows up on news in the internet about any Filipino, including Jasmine Trias. No reputable third-party or even primary sources, original research, POV, weasel words, and so forth and so on. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerz_Crit_c81b.html" title="User:Berserkerz Crit">Berserkerz Crit</a> 11:58, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I reject the idea that "non-existant pheonomenons", or any other ideas which individual editors may disagree with, even ones proven false (ie hoaxes), are not allowed on WP, since it's been made abundantly clear in <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> (with the support of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) that the threshold for inclusion is notability--especially when established with multiple independent reliable sources. Given that, I think from the cursory searches that the term is a neologism that might pass the threshold of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in the future. But it's not there yet, and even if it were there it would require a rewrite because of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> issues. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:14, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b>. The article is a clear violation of wikipedia's NPOV. This article shows how easy it is to write a biased article like this, cite references to opinions backing up the claim, and camouflage as a well-written, well-researched article that can standalone.

<li><b>KEEP</b> - and DEVELOP FURTHER. While it may be insignificant ratio wise in the Philippines vis-a-vis other countries, it still is a "culturally" significant "reality" or "possibility" that must be taken into consideration either for purely academic exercise or information dessimination, but mostly also for cultural consciousness and awareness.

<li>The issue is not insignificance, but verifiability.

<li><b>Still Weak Keep plus Major Cleanup</b>. First of all, I only mentioned those articles because they contain the term. I am not saying that they are reliable sources, what I'm trying to say is that its existence is acknowledged even in the Philippines. The term is non-academic so its not surprising that nobody in the Social Science section of the academic world found time to seriously research about the subject. Do they have journal articles for every <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">Internet meme</a> out there? Surely it is a fertile field in the study of human social behavior. This term describes a behavior that exists in the minds of Filipinos around the world. As a Filipino, I know that this term is quite incensing but deleting the article would not make it go away.<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenticel_4dcb.html" title="User:Lenticel">Lenticel</a> 11:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless there are academic sources (i.e. articles in peer-reviewed journals) that have studied this. Another suggestion is to <b>merge</b> the content with an article that describes the wider psychological phenomenon of trying to dilute one's ethnicity in certain situations. I don't know what the proper psychological term for that is but I am sure this phenonomenon is not confined to Filipinos. Barring that, turning this into a section of <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_people.html" title="Filipino people">Filipino people</a> might also be ok. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolaron_cd38.html" title="User:Polaron">Polaron</a> | <a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolaron_e6b4.html" title="User talk:Polaron">Talk</a> 16:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As a Filipino-American, I find that this article pushes the personal beliefs of some Filipinos regarding their cultural heritage as fact, and belittles those who do not agree with them.
