<dd><i>"Joel Leyden is a known SEO spammer and states that on his website. He is using Wikipedia, and has admitted as such, to get traffic to his blog. He is not a noted journalist. I state this unequivocally as someone who has worked for 15 years in the Israeli media, and as anyone from the Hebrew wikipedia will tell you. In fact, he is an unknown in Israel. Here is a classic example of someone abusing wikipedia for personal gain. What is worse, his blog (and as an examination will show, it is nothing more) is one of the tools he is using to fight a custody battle with his ex-wife over his children. As a user, now banned, he attempted to use wikipedia to fight this same custody battle, as a perusal of the history of Raanana will show. In addition, he was banned for harrassing another user, both online and in person. The votes to keep included sockpuppets and personal friends, who have fewer than ten edits each, i.e., make 3 edits and vote for Joel. I am not even going to discuss his personal attacks against me or the foundation on his blog. Given the confusion of information and misinformation there, I can only wonder what kind of nonsense he is posting in his article. Nevertheless, I will state this, summarizing a lengthy email which I sent to the Arb Com about two months ago: if the Hebrew Wikipedia, based in Israel, sees fit to include a version of the article about him or his blog, I will support its inclusion in English. If not, I will continue to regard it as simple SEO spam and unverifiable drivel by someone attempting to use wikipedia to attain fame and pursue his own, selfish agenda, using false information, sock puppets, and what have you. I sincerely hope that this is not the direction that Wikipedia is taking.

<p><b>Comment</b> For people google-checking etc., note that there is a well-established organization sometimes known as "ITIM" or "The Israel News Agency" which as been around since 1950 and has relations with Israel's major newspapers<a href="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This is <b>not</b> the same agency has the one being considered for deletion (www.israelnewsagency.com/ scroll all the way down the INA site and you'll see their own disclaimer).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Redirect to ITIM (Create stub for ITIM)</b> This seems to be an amateur news blog run by an all volunteer staff. For something which is supposed to be a leading news organization, they seem oddly proud about being accredited by the government press office[www.israelnewsagency.com/inaabout.html]. I ran a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> multi-decade newswire and newspaper (including Israeli English language newspapers) database search (which includes the Reuters and other newswires) and came up with <s>no relevant</s> <b>(CORRECTION)</b> about <b>three</b> hits for "israel news agency" or "israel internet news agency" as a source.

<ul>
<li>I strongly oppose the suggestion to redirect. I've never seen ITIM referred to as "The Israel News Agency" - perhaps informally "Israel's News Agency" or "The Israeli News Agency", but never "The Israel News Agency". I'm afraid such a redirect would only create further confusion as readers encountering Leyden's criticism of Wikipedia search for his agency, and find the highly reputable ITIM instead. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">User:Woggly</a> 18:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Of course, I will defer to those more acquainted with the Israeli media, but I'm not making this up out of thin air. See for instance, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=itim+%22israel+news+agency%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=itim+%22israel+news+agency%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this google search</a> which includes an article from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and article from Globes, a leading Israeli Hebrew language financial newspaper that both describe ITIM as "ITIM the Israel News Agency". There are also a few hits on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> database including a report from China's Xinhua news agency, several articles from Israel Business Arena and a column in the Jerusalem Post which describe ITIM as "ITIM - the Israel News Agency" or simply "Israel News Agency (ITIM)". Factiva also shows the BBC as the original source for this March 2006 Israel Media Guide article <a href="http://fmb-ebank.bancinternal.com/portal/story.asp?idstr=90716977" class="external text" title="http://fmb-ebank.bancinternal.com/portal/story.asp?idstr=90716977" rel="nofollow">here</a> (unsourced and breaching copyright in this link), which uses the phrase "ITIM (Israel News Agency)". There also other references to ITIM as "Israeli News Agency (ITIM)" or variations on that<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=F30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=itim+%22israeli+news+agency%22+itim&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=F30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;q=itim+%22israeli+news+agency%22+itim&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Finally if ITIM was never widely known as the Israel News Agency, why does the Israel News Agency blog under afd discussion need a specific disclaimer saying that it is not ITIM?<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:26, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sure the name <i>Israel News Agency</i> was purposefully chosen precisely so as to to give the (false) impression that the INA is a central national and/or government service. In fact, ITIM is the only Israeli news agency of any significance. You've convinced me that ITIM has on occasion been referred to as "The Israel News Agency" - this is equivalent to calling <i>The Boston Globe</i> "The Boston Newspaper". My point is this: if the Wikipedia article Israel News Agency is made into a redirect to ITIM, it will end up looking as if ITIM is responsible for all the nonsense issuing from the INA. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 05:40, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ITIM was never the Israel News Agency. ITIM does not have an on-line or print news presence. ITIM is a media placement organization, not a news agency. According to the Israel Government Press Office there is only one Israel News Agency and that is the one for which Danny deleted after community consensus to keep. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnei_0e73.html" title="User:Karnei">Karnei</a> 19:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC) <small>User has made fewer than 40 contributions, most of which have to do with Joel Leyden and the Israel News Agency -<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a></small>

<dd><b>Response</b> Firstly, if ITIM was never the Israel News Agency, why does the Israel News Agency weblog need a specific formal disclaimer saying it is not ITIM? Secondly, ITIM is specifically intended to act as a news agency not "a media placement organization".

<li><b>Delete</b> with prejudice (again). All the evidence I've seens says this is a one-man propaganda site masquerading as a news agency.

The Hebrew Wikipedia is less than 1/10th the size of its English big brother, so I hardly expect for them to pair up with us, even on subjects which may be of interest to Hebrew readers. This blog (or "news agency") is notable enough to be carried by Google News, and it is more than notable enough for the English-language Wikipedia. If we really are being taken advantage of as Danny suggests, let us provide accurate and neutral coverage of it here. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 18:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Karnei, or Lisa has revealed her personal details - far from being a sock. As for myself, I have spoken with Danny. He knows me and the academic organization I work for which works with Wikipedia Foundation. What we have here is "quilty by association" which must stop. We are not here to discredit Leyden but to establish, as has been proven many times in the past, is the INA notable.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Please don't decide to "keep" simply because this has been discussed before. There may be things about this article and its subject you missed last time. As I've said, Leyden and his friends have done everything they could to make the INA seem more notable than it is, including tilting the AfDs and constantly repeating false information (such as claiming the INA reaches 60 <i>million</i> readers). There is a <i>reason</i> this keeps coming up. Danny's deletion may have been rash, but it seems more and more justified when I get the impression people want to keep this article just so we don't have to discuss this again.

<li><b>Delete</b> The <i>only</i> source that seems to imply any notabiliy for the INA is the INA itself. I would assume the reason behind Geni's action was that Leyden has sent many of his friends to the previous AfDs to vote to keep. I have been following this debacle for a while, and I have yet to see anything that suggests the INA is notable. I do not think being mentioned in small news sources because of an SEO stunt is sufficient notability to warrant a Wikipedia article. It's not surprising that Leyden has a Israeli press card, as everything he publishes has a distinctly pro-Israel slant. As for referring to it as "fully accredited by the Israel Government Press Office," a Google search of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22accredited+by+the+Israel+Government+Press+Office+&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22accredited+by+the+Israel+Government+Press+Office+&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">that phrase</a> shows that it is being applied to <i>only</i> the INA.

<li>Google News is a search engine. INA is run by an experienced search-engine optimizer. It should therefore not be surprising that they manage to show up there. It is also worth pointing out that Google News has, at various times, indexed questionable "news sources" that look genuine on the surface. An example is <a href="../../../o/f/f/OfficialWire_da8c.html" title="OfficialWire">OfficialWire</a>, which was Google News indexed and is associated with a very dubious organization called "QuakeAID"; the newswire was also used to distribute Holocaust denial stories which ended up in the Google News index. Our article <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_News_26ac.html" title="Google News">Google News</a> also points out that they have accidentally indexed white supremacist content in the past. The problem with INA is that, aside from the direct results of their search-engine optimization and marketing, there is very little genuine reporting <i>about</i> INA that could form the basis of a coherent, verifiable article. It appears to me that the crusade of the site's creator is in part focused on establishing the very notability and recognition that it lacks, by gaining an entry in an online encyclopedia. This, in my opinion, weighs heavily in favor of deletion.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a>

The Google News listing does not prove that Israel News Agency is a reliable news source, but it shows up in Google News searches alongside the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, so it would be appropriate for Wikipedia to explain what INA is about. If we can verify that, despite its Google News listing, the INA devotes much of its content to reprints of information released by the Israeli government and op-ed pieces by its founder, it would be appropriate to state that in the article. (Also, I question the characterization of INA as a blog. It lacks several characteristics of the typical blog, like clear chronology of items, items linking other blogs, a blogroll, and comment space for each item. A blog doesn't need to have all of these, but INA has none of them as far as I can tell. It's true that much of it is a collection of opinionated commentaries, but it doesn't look much like a blog otherwise.) --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:52, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You wrote, <i>If we can verify that, despite its Google News listing, the INA devotes much of its content to reprints of information released by the Israeli government and op-ed pieces by its founder</i> - what would serve as verification? I've already sampled ten articles and shown just that: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Israel_News_Agency_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=55537150&amp;oldid=55529606" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Israel_News_Agency_%282nd_nomination%29&amp;diff=55537150&amp;oldid=55529606" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>; the one exception was, quite simply, an advertisement. I don't have the time or inclination to continue this line of analysis. What I can point to, is how much news the INA <b>doesn't</b> cover. In a country where radio news programs are updated by the half hour, updating a website once every couple of days - even if the updates were all genuine news reports, which they aren't - would not sustain a true news agency. There are <a href="http://rotter.net/cgi-bin/forum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&amp;forum=scoops1" class="external text" title="http://rotter.net/cgi-bin/forum/dcboard.cgi?az=list&amp;forum=scoops1" rel="nofollow">unofficial Israeli news sites</a> where one can be updated on news and rumours within minutes of events - not trustworthy reports, but timely. The INA is neither timely nor trustworthy. Take for example this story reported by the INA on [www.israelnewsagency.com/israeldefenseforcesnavyterrorism480516.html May 16] , as an event that occurred <i><b>"earlier today"</b></i>. This story was copied from a government site where it had been posted on <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terrorism+and+Islamic+Fundamentalism-/IDF+Naval+craft+seized+several+hundred+kg+of+explosives+14-May-2006.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terrorism+and+Islamic+Fundamentalism-/IDF+Naval+craft+seized+several+hundred+kg+of+explosives+14-May-2006.htm" rel="nofollow">May 14</a>, two days earlier. Here is a case where, by not being timely, and not bothering to proofread or update copy, the INA is in fact spreading false information. Is this not ample proof, in your eyes, that the INA is no news agency? --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 09:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>QuakeAID is notable for other reasons (though it's definitely borderline). I doubt an article about OfficialWire would survive on AfD on the grounds that it's been indexed by a search engine. Yes, Google News has put obscure websites (including, as noted, Holocaust denial and white supremacism) on equal footing with the NYT. That doesn't make them notable. As for whether it is a blog or a traditional website, I don't find the distinction relevant. The reason people call it a blog is because of articles [www.israelnewsagency.com/wikipedialibelslandersexwoolencyclopedia48330508.html like this], which begins with: " It all started with a divorced father in Israel who wanted more hours with his child.

<li><b>Comment:</b> One of the reasons the article is difficult to clean up into a decent NPOV stub, is that there virtually no independently verifiable information available about the INA. It is a one man show, and virtually every search leads back to that one man and his exhaustive efforts at self promotion. Unlike other Israeli operations, about which information can be found in Hebrew and translated, in the case of the INA there is far less information available on the agency in Hebrew than in English. In fact, no information whatsoever! I searched Google using the name as it appears on Leyden's scanned press-card: "ישראל - סוכנות ידיעות" gave 0 results as did "סוכנות ידיעות ישראל". Proving a negative is very difficult, and I don't know how to prove that the Israel News Agency is a non-entity, absolutely unheard of in Israel. I'd wager that a very high percentage of the traffic to the site comes from Wikipedians and members of the Wikipedia Review who visit trying to figure out what's going on. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 07:40, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would personally support tightening the guideline and citing specifically the number of republications required and the notability those publications should have. For example, I don't think that Kotepho's blog roundups <i>should</i> qualify.

<li>The link is not from the Washington Post, it's from the Washington Post blog. While written by a staff writer, it seems to be a "cast a wide net and find out what people are writing" piece, not subject to general journalistic standards. In my opinion, the Register's little better than a tabloid. The Tampa Bay Primer Kotepho lists is by no means an unbiased journalistic publication. That leaves 4 links of those listed by Kotepho which are, in my opinion, completely valid. Even college newspapers produce many, many more articles meeting journalistic standards. In my mind, the question is whether this should be decided by WP:WEB. I mean, this organization purports to be a news agency. Shouldn't it be judged as one? Unfortunately, we have no notability guidelines for those (though there appears to be a proposed one for US broadcasters.) Actually, in that light, I can't justify calling this a news agency, and I'm changing my Keep to a Comment.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 23:35, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that it's the blog section of the WashPost url (though not in title), but as you say it is a staff writer. My test with this and the Guardian is not their reliability as fact vetters per se - it is their circulation, which I assume is fairly wide, combined, and hence we achieve <i>notability</i> for the subject. Now, whether INA is a bona-fide news agency is another issue - I don't know if we have enough evidence for that, and in general the present article may need serious NPOVing and verifiable sourcing for its various claims. But for me step 1 is notability and we have it. Step 2 would be to present sourced facts about what it really is. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:52, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also from WP:WEB "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it."

<li>I know Alexa rankings are innacurate, but I think they do provide some basis for comparing the traffic various sites get. I don't think the INA is exactly on the "same footing" as these other organizations. I also don't understand what you are saying about WP:WEB contradicting itself. From the "Criteria for web content" section, "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Please show me sources where the INA itself is the <i>subject</i> of works whose source is <i>independent of the site itself.</i> Or are you saying that since WP:WEB is merely a <i>guideline</i> we should ignore it to save <i>this</i> particular article? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 17:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Here is the contradiction in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as I see it:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In "Criteria for Web content" is says, as you quote, that the entry in question must be "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself". Well, WashPost/Guardian are idependent of INA, 2 is 'multiple', both news articles there are 'non-trivial' published works and INA is 'a subject' (note the preposition 'a' - not <i>the</i> subject - this is a critical distinction for later)</li>
<li>In the same major item, a sub-item states: "This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.[5]" - I think you will concede that a published report on the Wash Post online and Guardian online meet that criterion, as 'newspaper' nowadays includes the electronic version and in any case it would fall under 'reliable published works in all forms'.</li>
<li>Now we come to the contradiction. In the <b>Notes</b> section, well after the <b>Criteria</b> section, even past <b>See also</b>, we have a list of examples/clarifications/refinements called 'notes', where one of those 'notes' states, as was also quoted above: "The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it." Note the final <i>focus upon it</i> part. That IMO contradicts the main inclusion criteria section where it says that the item in question must be <b>a</b> subject of the published work, not <b>the</b> subject. I think that in a case of contradiction like this in a guideline, I would assume the main section trumps a note at the end. Of course logic is on our side also: imagine 2 people X and Y invent something important. They get written up everywhere, <i>but always in the same article</i>. If we were to take the footnote version as our inclusion criterion, X and Y would never get their own WP articles, since they were always mentioned together. That's not logical obviously and should be fixed in the guideline.</li>

<dd>Now as far as the ratings of Al Ahram vs. INA - I never implied that INA is as well known as Al Ahram, my point is simply that if a reputable, widely distributed source quotes INA alongside Al Ahram, it gives INA notability, regardless of the Alexa ratings. And note that I switched from Delete to Keep, so I have no ax to grind - just trying my best to be neutral. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we're just reading the same sentence two different ways. I see "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." to mean:
<ul>
<li>"The content itself has been the subject..." That would be the INA. Has <i>the INA</i> been the subject? No. It was merely mentioned.</li>
<li>"...of multiple non-trivial published works..." I consider two quotes from INA stories in two papers (one of them in the blog section) to be fairly trivial.</li>
<li>"...whose source is independent of the site itself." How could the source of the work be independent of the site itself when the only mention of the site is a quote from it?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I would agree with you if both of the articles were <i>about</i> the INA, but all they're doing is quoting one small piece of an INA story. And considering the INA has been around since 1995 (according to... itself) having two quotes used is incredibly trivial. Eleven years, and that's the extent of the "published works" they've been the "subject" of? Nota-what? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 23:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>(outdent) I agree with you that for 11 years worth of claimed existence it's not much, but the question is 'is it notable today or not' - not 'is it fast growing or not'. Now as to your 3 points, let me address them one by one:
<ol>
<li>INA being 'the subject': I interpret that to mean as <i>non exclusive subject</i>. IOW, the Wash Post for instance, used the INA content alongside Al Ahram (in fact they are being <i>contrasted</i>, which is even more of a 'use' as opposed to just a listing of similar items), and I would make a case that in this type article, each of the used quotes are an essential and integral part of the article, hence they are a 'subject' that is being discussed there (per my X/Y example above).</li>
<li>Non triviality: Again, at least in the Wash Post example it is being <i>contrasted</i> with Al Ahram, so it is not a 'trivial' mention, as would be the case if it were part of a list.</li>
<li>Independent source: I think the meaning of the criterion you mention is to elimiate a situation where self-promotion, where the notability citation is on a site <i>related</i> to the web site we are evaluating for notability. I don't think the Guardian or the Wash Post are related to INA.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Again, look at the big picture: does this connote notability? Of course. How much? fairly large circulation/distribution/reach. Will readers remember the name INA or follow up its links and learn more about it? Some will, some won't. But you have to stay objective - it does give it a fairly wide audience.</dd>
<dd>Also, assume that these 2 publications do mention INA in the future (not unlikely). A curious reader (maybe one of many) does want to follow up and find out who in the world is this INA. Well if we delete the entry WP won't educate them any. All they'll have the INA web site itself (and Google-cached WP). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One minor clarification: My reading of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is that the 'subject' of the published article is the <i>content</i> of the Web site being evaluated for inclusion, not the <i>company</i> or individual(s) that run(s) that site. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see the INA (or the content of the INA) as being a <i>source</i> for the article, not <i>the subject</i>, or even <i>a</i> subject. I also see the WP:WEB criteria as being there so we could be assured of having sources for a Wikipedia article (which would require the INA to be the <i>subject</i> of the article). Otherwise, how will we write an article? "The INA was once quoted in the Washington Post blog?" The article tells us nothing really <i>about</i> the INA. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 04:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Crum375, rather than explain, I'll demonstrate. Can you find anything about the INA that is in the nature of <a href="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" class="external text" title="http://www.globaljournalist.org/magazine/2004-2/agency-gets-fresh-start.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> article about ITIM? I think that's the sort of thing Dejah is looking for. An independent outside source giving information ABOUT the agency, that also serves as testimony to the agency's role in the big picture. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 06:56, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you we don't have a nice write-up <i>about</i> INA, like the ITIM article, which of course doesn't need it for notability in the first place, since it's already well established. The article by Wash Post is stated to be about the international online sources' view of recent events. As such, the mention of INA, with its opinion on the events, contrasted with Al Ahram's, is a part of the article and hence <i>a</i> part of the subject (though of course not <i>the</i> subject). I agree that this article is not <i>focused</i> on the INA content, and certainly not on INA as an entity. The point is simply that the citation there makes INA <i>notable</i>. The question is whether it is notable <i>enough</i> to meet WP requirements. The reason I say 'yes' is simply having seen lots of AfD votes on much more obscure organizations or persons that got kept, that had a fraction of INA's exposure. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>AfD is notoriously inconsistent. You'll notice I haven't voted yet, I honestly have not yet fully made up my mind. But one thing is clear to me: IF the article stays, then I will hold the people who voted to keep it responsible for the truthfullness of the article. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 13:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you. I certainly don't see it as a strong keep, but I try to vote on a binary basis. If it is kept, as you say we must ensure that it is factually accurate per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> etc. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:17, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, Woggly. That's exactly the type of article I was talking about. Instead of a non-trivial write-up like that, we're talking about including what's basically a blog because it was a source for... a blog? Look at this another way, if you use <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Notability (organizations)</a> instead, "Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found." That's my issue- absolutely no "verifiable information from reliable third party sources." I believe that's the essence of what WP:WEB means, that we must have <i>something</i> to use to write the article. If we don't have something "...whose source is independent of the site itself," all we have to base the article on is <i>the site itself</i>. The site of a SEO spammer and PR man. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejahThoris_3408.html" title="User:DejahThoris">DejahThoris</a> 18:42, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, it is sad that a few here chose to ignore 67,200 Google pages relating to the Israel News Agency. Google is accurate. One can actually check each and every page. Compared to Alexa which only provides ballpark figures. Also one must consider quality over quantity i.e. - The Register, The Washington Post, The Jerusalem Post, Google News and thousands of blogs that pick up from Google News. Israel is at war on two fronts today with terrorism. Israel and every free democracy needs the INA and other media which transmit direct feeds from their respective governments. If 67,200 Google results is not notable, what is? <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonnieisrael_553e.html" title="User:Bonnieisrael">Bonnieisrael</a> 14:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
