<p>Sigh. Fire department cruft. Do we want an article on every fire dcepartment in the world? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 06:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't really see a reason to delete this. It is not original research, clearly not spam and to the many people interested in or admiring America's firefighters this might be of interest. I see no difference in keeping this and keeping every article about high schools which we have already established are being kept per policy. Also, fire departments in California are of particular interest because of the number of forrest fires. I see no harm in keeping this. And this from a notorious deletionist! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 15:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is <i><b>no</b></i> policy that schools may be kept, merely a cabal that votes in lock step. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 01:52, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I lean toward <b>delete</b>. As has been exhaustively pointed out in every school-related AfD, there is no policy in place for such things other than the usual notability and verifiability. Plus, users have a right to their "I see no harm in keeping this" opinions, but that is explicitly not a criteria for keeping an article. If there were assertions of notability in the article it would be one thing, but again, why should some things (schools, fire houses) be exempt from the explicit policy that an article must assert its subject's notability?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 20:06, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per nom, or <b>Merge</b> (per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>), GAAAAH!

<li><s><b>Keep</b> - Obviously, I am biased because I created the article but I think there is enough information about this topic to make it worthwhile. Outside of the school argument mentioned above, there are many other areas of Wikipedia that have tons of "useless" articles. Examples: The <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_starting_quarterbacks_7f2f.html" title="Miami Dolphins starting quarterbacks">Miami Dolphins starting quarterbacks</a>; the <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Barn_Dance_f8d0.html" title="ABC Barn Dance">ABC Barn Dance</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Barn_Dance_e3f9.html" title="National Barn Dance">National Barn Dance</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_E._Scott_5921.html" title="Howard E. Scott">Howard E. Scott</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rainmakers_%28KC_band%29_1829.html" title="The Rainmakers (KC band)">The Rainmakers (KC band)</a>. I personally don't consider the Miami Dolphins all that important and I certainly don't care at all for country music radio shows or certain musicians, especially ones I have never heard of before. However, they are important to someone, so much so that they took the time to create the article and are valuable to someone else who will read the article. <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpolk_d8a6.html" title="User:Epolk">Epolk</a> 18:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that we have "tons of useless articles" is not justification for keeping yet another useless article. My fundamental criterion for keeping an article is that multiple separate people, independent of the subject, have written and published works of their own about them, demonstrating that they find the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of creating and publishing works of their own about it. This subject fails on that account. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font></a> 19:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> is not an inclusion (or exclusion) criterion—but it is an essay I think you should read. The most appropriate guideline here seems to be <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> (which you should also read). Is this topic of more than local interest? I seriously doubt it. On the other hand, to pick one of your examples (which you obviously culled from our recent-edit lists), <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rainmakers_%28KC_band%29_1829.html" title="The Rainmakers (KC band)">The Rainmakers (KC band)</a> is a band <i>I'd</i> never heard of before stumbling across it at random. But they have charted albums and singles on two continents. Obviously a topic of interest to more than just one local community! And it needed a complete rewrite, which I provided, not because "I like it" (for all I know, I'd hate them), but because it was a topic of obvious <i>international</i> interest. Your local fire department, I'm afraid, is <i>not</i> a topic of international interest. Speaking as a fellow Californian, I don't think it's of statewide interest. And that means that <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> is the guideline to follow. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 18:56, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I live in Southern California, and there is nothing notable about this fire department, believe me. As for the list of articles that Epolk thinks are non-notable, I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the first few are articles I've recently worked on. I'm not even going to try to justify those articles here, as such a discussion is not germane to <i><b>this</b></i> discussion. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><s><b>Comment</b> The vote will come out however it comes out. If it goes down I guess I will have to recommend the other fire department pages for delete and start looking for other articles that have only been written or worked on by one person. <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpolk_d8a6.html" title="User:Epolk">Epolk</a> 22:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>Nomination for deletion of articles solely because only one person has worked on them is not grounds for deletion, you would be violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> if you did such a thing, and I warn you of a block if you do. If you want to delete articles which should be deleted, then by all means, do so, but bad faith nominations out of revenge will not be tolerated. I agree that most other fire department articles should be deleted, but if there is some notability which can be proven, then they might survive an AfD. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 23:06, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> - Sorry about the snarky comments above. It appears that my teenage son got into my Wikipedia account this weekend and thought he was helping me out. I didn't see any of this till I got into work this morning. I am going to change my settings at home so that it doesn't remember my password and am going to change my password as well. I know that saying this now will seem like I am just trying to get out of the things posted above but if you check the IP addresses for the above postings you will find that they aren't from the IP that I do most of my editing from. <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpolk_d8a6.html" title="User:Epolk">Epolk</a> 16:50, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
