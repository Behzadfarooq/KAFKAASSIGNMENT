<li><b>Comment</b>: As an FYI, so far as I can tell <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILITARY_850e.html" title="WP:MILITARY">WP:MILITARY</a> does not have recognised guideline status -- it is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_f31e.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject">Wikiproject</a>. The bio's sole claim to notability is that at some point, prior to his death at 32, the subject received a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuti_Militari_a9ad.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> medal. There is no verifiable source as to why or when such an award was given. In fact, the only reference of such is a Web site list, which itself doesn't source its information -- and lists a dozen Dunins as recipients. How do we even know that this "Antoni Dunin" is the same as the <a href="http://feefhs.org/PL/vm/vm-d.html" class="external text" title="http://feefhs.org/PL/vm/vm-d.html" rel="nofollow">one listed</a>? (Hint: we don't, because it's unverifiable). Further, while the article about the medal claims a comparison to the US <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, this appears to be an exaggeration. It may be referred to as "Poland's highest military medal", but there are actually five classes of the award, the last of which has been given out over <s>4500</s> 10,000 times (since 1939 alone). Compare this to the US Medal of Honor, of which there have fewer than 2000 receipients since the Civil War (during which 1500 were handed out).--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 04:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

How you choose to regard them is, of course, up to you; but I rather doubt that they have less support from the editorial community merely for lack of a banner.</li>
<li>(As far as numbers are concerned: so what? The <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union_01a6.html" title="Hero of the Soviet Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> was awarded more than 12,000 times, but I doubt anyone is arguing it's somehow less distinguished of an award.

<li>Again, <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILITARY_850e.html" title="WP:MILITARY">WP:MILITARY</a> is a Wikiproject, not a WP guideline or policy. Wikiprojects do not trump general WP standards. They are, as pointed out at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROJGUIDE_5ec5.html" title="WP:PROJGUIDE">WP:PROJGUIDE</a> a "social construct" -- they do not set guidelines applicable to the rest of WP, outside of perhaps those particular articles within their participating editors' interest area. In sum, whatever it might say at WP:MILITARY has no bearing on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Likewise, the core points I made have not been addressed: no matter what claim the Virtuti Militari medal might have in the status of Poland's "highest military honors", the 10,000+ recipients of the Class 5 "Silver" medal are simply not notable within the English language Wikipedia. The medal is much closer to the Army's <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_%28USA%29_e6b2.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross (USA)">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, which while certainly an honor, is hardly a qualification for Wikipedia. Finally, <b>no one has a verified source that <i>this</i> Antoni Dunin is the actual receipient of this single medal</b>-- again, the sole reference is an unsourced Web site list.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. Recipients of a country's highest military award are blatantly notable, whether awarded for personal gallantry or for leadership. Is it logical to delete people like this and keep Z list celebrities just because they have acres of tabloid rubbish written about them and live in the computer age? It certainly seems to be if you're a deletionist and worship at the shrine of the great god Googlehits. I despair sometimes! -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</strike> Changing my vote to <b>neutral</b> here. I, possibly wrongly, assumed that this officer had been awarded one of the higher grades of the decoration. Rereading the description, I think that probably only the top four classes are automatically notable and the fifth is not (although recipients may be on a case-by-case basis) - this is in line with my own policy on British decorations that only holders of the VC and GC are automatically notable, plus those who have won one of the next highest awards twice or any other award (or combination) three times. We therefore need to know which class of the Virtuti Militari this officer received. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 11:47, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Recipient of <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuti_Militari_a9ad.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> is a pretty good claim to notability. However, the nominator's concerns need to be addressed.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article doesn't even state <i>why</i> he received the medal, nor give any references except one referring mostly to the subject's daughter's engagement.

<li><b>Keep</b> - As per Kirill Lokshin. Since he's the Mil Hist head, I think he'd know about what's considered notable for a mil hist subject.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> That he won the medal indicates notability. That we can confirm he won the medal also claims so. However, <b>all unreferenced biographical information in the article needs to be removed</b> and the article needs to then be tagged as a stub and tagged for expansion. As <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuti_Militari_a9ad.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> medal winner, he merits an article. However, we need to be able to verify other information before we can add it. The information needs to be verified by existing in other, external sources. The Detroit Free Press article is intriguing, but it is not specifically linked to any facts in the article; if we could do so it would help a great deal. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 04:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This debate reminds me of the recent AfD debate <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sanford_Ransdell_f2d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sanford Ransdell">here</a>, which was also an article apparently created by someone doing genealogical research. While these editors have every right to be proud of the sacrifices of their forebears, in both cases the only claim to notability for our purposes was military service; practically everything else in both articles was original genealogical research or tangential padding. Ancestor cruft is a trickle now; it will likely be a flood in the future. Prepare accordingly. —<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> 22:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The difference is that not everyone's ancestor has won their country's top military honour! Most of them can therefore be speedied as completely non-notable. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:15, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It would be nice if that were true, but as the other debate showed, the notability guidelines can become fuzzy in individual cases. Canny genealogists should usually be able to avoid speedy deletion by turning a traditionally non-notable biography into one that at least makes a weak case for notability. In this article, for example, someone has created an article where normally there would be a one-line entry in something like "List of the 10,000 people who have won the Virtuti Militari". That's fine—it's an important honor, let's have articles on all 10,000 people. Other genealogists, however, undoubtedly feel that their ancestor's achievements are of similar (i.e., 1 in 10,000) distinction. This is just the tip of the genealogy iceberg, I tell ya. —<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> 01:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think you're being unnecessarily pessimistic. I have myself speedy deleted at least two genealogical articles about gentlemen with worthy but not especially notable war service. If someone just does their job, however competently, has not held a senior position and has not received any recognised state reward then they meet speedy deletion criteria without needing to be AfDed. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I hope you're right. Meanwhile, I would encourage others to write and apply notability guidelines in such a way as to screen out genealogy cruft, and to strictly adhere to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a> whenever they catch a whiff of genealogy. Obviously you and others here are already on the case; keep up the good work. —<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> 02:37, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
