<p>Issues with this page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Highly POV term used as a synonym for <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a> in a manner that does not allow WP users to understand the context of the puroported synonymy;</li>
<li>Very little used term, which I believe is used principally by German right-extremists as an analog of the somewhat more common German term to suggest a moral equivalence between the deaths in this ethnic cleansing and Jewish deaths in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoah.html" title="Shoah">Shoah</a>;</li>
</ol>
<p>I propose that this page be deleted, and it and its correctly capitalised version be blocked. Furthermore, the highly POV summary of <i>Prussian holocaust</i> at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Holocaust (disambiguation)">Holocaust (disambiguation)</a> will need to be rewritten to accomodate its removal.</p>
<p>Point of order: this page was originally a redirect to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>, which I edited to make clear was POV. Possibly this page should have been submitted to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a> page with its slightly lengthier process, however I think that the issues raised are more appropriate to a VfD process, and the page used to be an article with an active talk page.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The Oxford English Dictionary defines <i>Holocaust</i> as: • noun - destruction or slaughter on a mass scale. Is anyone arguing that what occured in Prussia was not destruction or slaughter on a mass scale? <i>The Holocaust</i> is defined as: the mass murder of Jews under the German Nazi regime in World War II. If it was "The Holocaust" I would vote delete. But it isn't. People who are interested in this topic will likely refer to it as Prussian Holocaust.

<dd>If you google for the exact term "P.H.", you will find that Wikipedia is on several of the first ten results; we already influence the rankings with the term.</dd>
<dd>First result offers a page where Users like Schlesier might get some of their informations from: <a href="http://www.nccg.org/ezion_geber/preussen2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nccg.org/ezion_geber/preussen2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> It does not appear to be a Nazi site, but an obscure royal-christian-backward-nationalist- antisemitic mixture I cannot identify easily. The writer offers literature (scroll down page 7) which should be investigated for its origins and backgrounds some time.</dd>
<dd>The "Young Prussian Landsmannschaft" (which I believe is one of Schlesiers favorites) was organizing the last big gathering of right extremists from all over Germany on February 13, 2005 in Dresden, marching and shouting with their parole "bombing Holocaust". Intention of use of "Prussian Holocaust" is the same, I think. (Greetings for Charles!) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 23:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, if you google the same term in German ("Preußischer Holocaust"), you find NO result at all for the exact combination. So much for the encyclopedic relevance. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 23:02, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Excuse my arguing, but I suggest you look at the links of "<a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>": one of them is "<a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Terrible_Revenge_a434.html" title="A Terrible Revenge">A Terrible Revenge</a>" which I suggested for VfD also. The author of that book is known as Revisionist in Germany. Listing his book as a main scientific source for the article is highly POV I think.</dd>
<dd>Then, if you look at the Link <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemmersdorf.html" title="Nemmersdorf">Nemmersdorf</a> on "A terrible revenge", you find an external weblink <a href="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv/47aa15.htm" rel="nofollow">Nemmersdorf: New aspects of a crime <i>One of the dark chapters</i> by Thorsten Hinz (in German)</a> leads you directly to the "Junge Freiheit", which is known as right extremist German publication, being watched by state officials. Don´t rely on such POV-sources, I suggest!! I don´t know your discussions and don´t want to interfere, but giving hints is not forbidden, is it? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 00:00, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete!</b> It is more then just POV, it is terminus of (German) revisionists and Right-wing extremists to relate the Shoa by saying that Germans are victims to. See (and delete!) also <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Holocaust (disambiguation)">Holocaust_(disambiguation)</a>: <i>The term Prussian Holocaust refers to the killing of 2 million German civilians near the end of World War II, by invading Soviet armies and air raids, and from the cold and starvation involved in fleeing such abuses. Many refugees were killed by Soviet bombers. Nemmersdorf is particularly associated with these war crimes.</i> and compare it with <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayakovskoye%2C_Kaliningrad_7a5b.html" title="Mayakovskoye, Kaliningrad">Mayakovskoye, Kaliningrad</a>! <a href="../../../k/r/t/User%7EKrtek76_e9fd.html" title="User:Krtek76">Krtek76</a> 10:06, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC) [Dont know, if I have enough edits to vote, I´m often to lazy to log myself in, but maybe counts&#160;;-)) ]</li>

<p>It looks like this VfD is more controversial than I anticipated. I'd like to suggest what I view to be credible alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>What I initially proposed in this VfD;</li>
<li>A redirect to some page such as Politically tendentious terms for historical events, rather as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> is (currently) a redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">List of political epithets</a>;</li>
<li>An article discussing the current political controversy around this name. I doubt there is enough non-WP material at present to support a genuinely encyclopediac article along these lines, but in future there might be.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I regard as unacceptable are either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The situation before I filed this VfD, namely a redirect to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>; or</li>
<li>The current situation, namely a link to that page with a little bit of boilerplate indicating the controversy;</li>
</ol>
<p>Opinions welcome. Please don't vote keep until you have thought about these alternatives. A point of order: it is ambiguous which of the two unacceptable alternatives I summarised a keep vote actually prefers: if you do vote keep, please indicate which is preferable. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 18:57, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s>Probably <b>keep as redirect to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a></b> (unacceptable choice #1), and add more information on naming controversy to the article.

<dd>The fact that the term is sometimes used is not an endorsement to an encyclopedia entry. nearly any two words may be put together side by side to mean something.

<li><b>Keep</b> - These two words put together could mean nothing else. if you find the term itself objectionable, that is your own POV.

<dd>You can't show that they are syndicates, particularly since the article in WP is called Evacuation of East Prussia, and the wording used in the article is not the same as the wording used in the sites I found by googling. The point is, that people do use the term, you have no real evidence to suggest the term isn't suitable, other than the fact that you feel it's a nazi term and you hate nazis. I'm Australian and I've never heard the term Aboriginal Holocaust (and we all study the history in school), but I wouldn't vote to delete that redirect which is used on WP. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786416157/ref=wl_it_dp/102-5519304-8348911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1FKX8HXEX6CLK&amp;v=glance&amp;colid=OW3SNIX6O7JB" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786416157/ref=wl_it_dp/102-5519304-8348911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1FKX8HXEX6CLK&amp;v=glance&amp;colid=OW3SNIX6O7JB" rel="nofollow">Book on Prussia</a> --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChammy_Koala_0670.html" title="User:Chammy Koala">Chammy Koala</a> 11:52, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Denni: If it is a propaganda term <i>and</i> uncommon <i>and</i> plain wrong in it´s worded meaning of course it´s not valid for an encyclopedia.

<dd>"Propaganda" and "wrong" are POV reasons to delete - NPOV means Wikipedia should document all encyclopedically notable terms and views, regardless of their validity or those who use them. However, I now doubt the encyclopedic notability of this term.

<li><b>Keep</b> - political views shouldnt influence VFD decitions. If we would delete this, we would have to delete e.g. mentionings of <a href="../../../w/w/2/WW2_6b83.html" title="WW2">WW2</a> as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Patriotic_War_5e77.html" title="Great Patriotic War">Great Patriotic War</a> as it was known in Russia as it is a communist propaganda etc. This is a term used to describe thing mentioned and therefore should stay.<a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirYassin_27bf.html" title="User:DeirYassin">DeirYassin</a> 13:36, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>"Point of Order". The Great Patriotic War shows the weakness of the communists in Russia. Like the re-opening of the Orthodox Churches during WWII when the chips were down the communists appealed to <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodina.html" title="Rodina">Rodina</a> not Lenin. The Great Patriotic War was named after the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotic_War_b7d8.html" title="Patriotic War">Patriotic War</a> of 1812 when Napoleon invaded Russia. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 18:22, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What is the German expression for "Prussian Holocaust"? As fas as I see, the English expression is of hardly notable usage. Most google links seem from wikipedia&amp;mirrors amd a couple of hate speeches. "Preussisch Holokaust" and "Preussisch Verhichtung" (or with "Preußisch") give zero hits. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 15:40, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The exact term in German would be "Preußischer Holocaust"; as I pointed out earlier, there you find literally NO links at all. No serious historian uses that term, no published books either, only some right extremists. The links you find in English are indeed <i>only</i> Wikipedia copies, <i>all</i> of them: scroll down any of the sites Chammy provided and you find Wikipedia as the source; doesn´t matter if they have earlier versions, they remain to be copies. So there are no substantial reasons to keep it. Wrong comparisons don´t change that, because other terms are in use somewhere: This one isn´t. Political views shouldn´t influence VFD decisions: exactly! The term is only a redirect here because the editor had a political view on it. So vote for Keep is no political view? This is definitely against Wikipedia rules not to build up new theories. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesusfreund_657d.html" title="User:Jesusfreund">Jesusfreund</a> 21:57, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
