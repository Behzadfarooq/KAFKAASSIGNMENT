<li><b>Comment</b> While I respect you as an administrator, there is nothing on the article that accuses any editors of editing on behalf of the "KGB" (in actuality, it's the FSB, but that's another story). That is extremely unfair to accuse him of saying that, as I was the one who made those comments, whereas he only wrote an article about internet troll squads. As well, I would like to point out that no one is mentioned in the article, so I feel like that you are really being judgmental.<a href="../../../c/p/t/User%7ECPTGbr_0699.html" title="User:CPTGbr">CPTGbr</a> 20:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a side comment. I think that comments and opinions like this one: <a href="../../../f/e/d/Talk%7EFederal_Security_Service_of_the_Russian_Federation_d324.html#Infiltration" title="Talk:Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation">Talk:Federal_Security_Service_of_the_Russian_Federation#Infiltration</a> <i>undermine credibility of Wikipedia</i>. That was one of the reasons I have created this article. <i>I think such questions must be openly debated.</i> That is Wikipedia policy to openly debate any problems (but of course without personal offences). That is why I made this notice: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Internet_troll_squads" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Internet_troll_squads" rel="nofollow">"KGB trolls in Wikipedia?"</a> If we delete this article now, then what this anonymous user and other people could think? They (not me!) will think: "Yes, of course, those KGB trolls could not tolerate such article in Wikipedia." Sorry, but they will think so. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 17:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Just another comment</b> User Biophys has been warned twice for uncivil behaviour: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive78#If_this_a_personal_attack</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Again_personal_attack_by_Biophys" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Again_personal_attack_by_Biophys" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Again_personal_attack_by_Biophys</a>. So it's hard to belive that Biophys is concerned about Wikipedia. It was the Biophys who first claimed that KGB trolls are present in the Wikipedia by creating such an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Internet_troll_squads" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Internet_troll_squads" rel="nofollow">entry</a>. So basically he wants to defame Wikipedians with this article - it is an attack page <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttack_page_c5ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Attack page">Wikipedia:Attack_page</a>. Moreover, Biophys is the user who publishes in Wikipedia information taken from the blog La Rusophobe with telling name. His edits are directed against Russian government. He also tried twice to insert a text about Putin Phallus into the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallus.html" title="Phallus">Phallus</a> article. he tried to create an article in Wikipedia about blog La Russophobe but it was deleted.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 18:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>(*Speedy <b>delete</b> this original research. Let me politely ask our Polish friends to leave Russia-articles to the responsibility of Russian editors. I presume the latter know more about Russia than the former. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-Ñ‚Ñ€Ñ‘Ð¿-</font></a></sup> 14:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am strongly against such a proposal. This is a Wikipedia for everybody, and IMHO non-Russian editors are very welcome to edit Russia-related articles, which would help to make them more neutral. Often their contributions are more useful than those by Russian (or Belarusian, or Ukrainian) wikipedians, and it is often not the case that they know less about Russia than Russian wikipedians. And certainly there is nothing inherently Russian in ability to identify original research etc. <b>Neutral</b> As to the nomination, the nominator himself seems biased, as he sees there a personal attack against Putin which is clearly not the case. There is only one mention of Putin in this article as a third party. And the article is not an original research. It is based on sources. Their reliability seems dubious, yes, but they exist, so the nomination misses the point. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColchicum_15ab.html" title="User:Colchicum">Colchicum</a> 02:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>After more than two years in the project, I may tell you that no Russian editor can edit Poland-related articles in English Wikipedia without facing some sort of harrassment. I assure you that I'm not the only one who was driven from English Wikipedia by a gang of Polish editors and their allies from neighbouring countries. Let's hope that the same standards will eventually be applied to Polish-related and Russia-related articles. Currently this is not the case. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-Ñ‚Ñ€Ñ‘Ð¿-</font></a></sup> 06:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think this is not "Russian subject" at all. It is enough to look at the Categories where this article belong. The sources are "Polish" and "Russian", but the article is not.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:30, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is the approach of certain editors towards the Russian topics with an exclusive POV-pushing attitude. This is demonstrated by a sudden coordinated entry of three votes which seems organized by off-wiki canvassing a lot. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply to the criticism</b>. <b>I have made a number of changes to correct the shortcomings of this article.</b> According to Wikipedia rules, deletion of an article <i>is not to be decided by a majority vote</i>. The criterion is consistency with Wikipedia rules and policies. I insist that everything is appropriate here (although the article should be improved). <b>(1)</b> This article was marked for deletion as allegedly inconsistent with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Right now, it is clearly consistent. All major claims are supported by <i>multiple reliable sources</i>. OR means original research by a Wikipedia editor. Citing original research made and published by other people is fine. <b>(2)</b> It was claimed that the article was designed to mount a personal attack against certain editors. Obviously, it is not. It does not include (and never included) any names or even hints on Wikipedia editors. <b>(3)</b> The title of this article was criticized as "ORish". Of course, everyone is welcome to suggest a better name. This name appeared as a result of my personal translation from Russian. I prefer this name for two reasons. First, this can not be simply called "disinformation", although disinformation and astroturfing is certainly is a part of this phenomenon. Second, I tried to keep this name as general as possible, because it well might be that secret services of other countries are involved in similar activities (so, this might be not solely "Russian" phenomenon). <b>Finally</b>, I would like to ask you to take a second look at the article and reconsider you opinion if appropriate. Thank you. P.S. This is certainly a very interesting and notable subject that belongs to many Wikipedia categories and attracted attention of many good editors. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 18:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No way you can justify <i>anything</i> under this title with whatever sources you brought up. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>So, what title would you suggest?<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See my suggestions above. Although I have to say that wrong title is no reason for deletion - the <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> should have been carried instead of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, I could remove word "troll" from everywhere in the article, including title, if it helps (I thought this subject is actually related to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28Internet%29_ba24.html" title="Troll (Internet)">Troll (Internet)</a>). Something close to your title would probably be fine if the article is not deleted.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 22:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Thank you!</b> Thank you all for your participation and discussion of my article. This helped to improve it a lot. It was nominated for deletion as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. <i>Now it is not OR and based on multiple sources.</i> This is obvious from the current list of references. No one of this discussion participants challenged the reliability of any specific references on any reasonable grounds. Most of you criticized the title. Great. Then let's rename it as <i>"Internet teams of Russian state security services"</i> (almost as suggested by Pyotrus). I have made the corresponding changes in the text, but I do want want to move the article during AfD discussion. If you disagree with such title, let's mark this article as <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and discuss a better title. Finally, the AfD nominator believed that the article is "an attack page against Putin". Obviously, it is not, since there is only one mention of Putin in this article as a third party.<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 14:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
