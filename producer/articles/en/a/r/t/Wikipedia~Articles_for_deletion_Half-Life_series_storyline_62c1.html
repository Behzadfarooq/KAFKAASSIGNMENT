<li>How is that justification to keep this overly long, overly detailed, unsourcable novelization of the games? A mistake was made when such a lengthy, overdetailed plot summary was kept in the first place, and this AFD should delete what was originally dumped to a subarticle. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:00, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The merit of the topic's inclusion is more important in this discussion, since these style-specific issues can be addressed later. Besides, there isn't much to criticize about the page in this regard, at least from a personal standpoint: The page is fairly well written (although it is lengthy and isn't short enough to be "plot summary"), while the references, if anything, are mostly from the actual games themselves (but if specific citation is needed, websites are best candidate).
<p>However, there is also a recommendation to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Making_good_use_of_Wikibooks_and_Wikisource" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">make use of Wikibooks</a> on topics such as this, as it has in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html#Plot_overview" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince#Plot overview</a>, for example. Coincidentally, there is also a "<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Half-Life_Fact_File" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Half-Life_Fact_File" rel="nofollow">Half-Life Fact File</a>" entry in Wikibooks, which is ideal for a transwiki merge/move of the plot summaries. With Wikibooks in mind, my <b>Keep</b> vote remains unchanged; but a <b><a href="../../../s/i/s/Wikipedia%7ESister_projects_1129.html#Wikibooks" title="Wikipedia:Sister projects">Copy to WikiBooks</a></b> vote is added as an alternate choice. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 15:11, 2 October 2006 (UTC) ╫</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there comes a point when you have to say, "OK, we don't need to have this much information on a subject." Just summarize the plot in the main article/s and accept that Wikipedia is not the place to go into this much detail. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 13:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the Half-Life series has a unified Storyline, having a single article collecting that information is very useful, as it means somebody won't have to scan several pages at once to get the same info. I don't see the point in asking for sources when anybody can just play the game if they want to do so, but I'm sure there are FAQs and Game Guides that include most of the information. Anything else can(amount of detail, connections to the real world), and should be, dealt with in cleanup, not calls for deleting. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Does every fact in every article need to be sourced? No, of course not. The rigidity implied by your statement of non-negotiability is troubling, because it seems to imply that everything needs complete sources, which is rather silly. The rule of common sense applies. For example, you don't need to find a source to say that the White House is well, White. In this case, you can verify any of the content directly by playing the game. If you don't like that, for whatever reason, though it sounds silly to me, you can easily go over to Gamefaqs and read any number of the Half-life FAQs there. Many of them are quite descriptive as to the Story line. If that's not enough for you, then why don't you identify some of the sections which you find troubling on the article's talk page, we'll see if some sources can be found to establish them. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, article combines of several Half-Life stories. The majority of the article is encyclopedic, except for some parts. Instead, a cleanup tag should be put, and not deletion. This article definitely does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, if it is not properly sourced, source it! If it needs cleaning up, clean it up! None of these are grounds for deletion. With regard to the ever-ambiguous call to <i>not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>, I would like to remind everyone that we are dealing here with one of the most ground-breaking games ever, which certainly means it deserves more than one single article to deal with everything. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<dd>So, are you proposing deleting the story-line content from the individual Half-life games articles? That seems to follow from your comment. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not proposing any changes to the exising game articles. My personal opinion is that the level of detail in the storylines in many of those articles is excessive... but that is just my opinion. Trust me, I have no interest in going to each of these individual articles and fighting to edit those sections down. I don't agree however with having a separate storyline article just to have redundant information all in one place. I think Alba's suggestion below is a rather good idea if Wikibooks will have this.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:02, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I would agree with you, except for one very big thing. The Half-life series has a unified, on-going storyline, as such, it is important to cover that issue. At the least, the information in this article should be merged, however pruned it may need to be to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-life_series.html" title="Half-life series">Half-life series</a>. Since you agree that the information itself belongs in the individual articles, I don't see how you can argue that having it in one single place is a bad idea. Sure, it's redudant, but redundancy is often a good thing. How else would you do it? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's a good compromise that can be made here. The article as is should first be <b>copied to Wikibooks</b> as it is worthwhile but not encyclopedic. A <i>massively summarized</i> version can be <b>merged to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_series_d631.html" title="Half-Life series">Half-Life series</a></b>, to augment the rather sparse material already on that page. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlba_9e53.html" title="User:Alba">Alba</a> 17:31, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - As excessively detailed plot summary that is not encyclopedic, which <i>is</i> grounds for deletion.

<li>I have to disagree. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html#Examples_2" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">WP:FICT</a> also cites the <i>Final Fantasy X</i> article series, which uses Wikibooks to host information that would less likely merit inclusion in Wikipedia. The contents in <i>Half-Life</i> series storyline are simply plotlines and not game guides or walkthroughs, which I would otherwise suggest deleting or moving to StrategyWiki. The existing but incomplete Wikibooks entry on the <i>Half-Life</i> series would also benefit from a transwiki, and is perhaps the best way to resolve this issue. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 11:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC) ╫</li>

However, I strongly disagree that this is a game guide; not every article about a game is a guide and this one tells you nothing about how to play the game.
