<p>New company, launched yesterday. Looks like a startup with <i>hopes</i> of becoming a major competitor to the existing telecom monopoly in South Africa. Most of their services won't actually be available until next year. Google for <i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=neotel+&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=south+africa&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=neotel+&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=south+africa&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">neotel "south africa"</a></i> doesn't turn up much, mainly press releases (there are other Neotel's in multiple countries). At this point, they've got investors and a lot of plans. Seems to me this isn't up to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> yet, and is rather crystal-ballish as to whether it will become a major company. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The company isnt even offering any services yet, remains to be seen if they will become a major player in the region yet. If they ever meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and article can be created but as of now it does not. <a href="../../../d/r/u/User%7EDrunkenSmurf_f5fc.html" title="User:DrunkenSmurf"><font color="blue">DrunkenSmurf</font></a> 14:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> See below comments about it offering services: it is offering services. Re: "remains to be seen if they will become a major player in the region yet" -- that is not grounds enough to disqualify the article. Neotel holds significant economic interest to the region as well as being widely reported on by the media. There hasn't been a single 'advert' to my knowledge from Neotel, just dozens of press articles. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 17:09, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Following the end of AT&amp;T monopoly in the US 20 years ago, Sprint and MCI were formed to compete. So were a whole bunch of other companies that failed and have been pretty much forgotten. We'll need to wait and see on this one. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:38, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Surely it should qualify as an entry because it is both newsworthy and because it will provide coverage of an event that is in progress? Furthermore it does offer some services that have not been rolled out to the public yet. I can completely see the logic involved that would outlaw all businesses from having an article on Wikipedia because that would be tantamount to advertising. But this business holds significant national and regional impact on both the economy and the telecommunications industry. It may not have <i>properly launched</i> yet, but a wide cross-section of the public is aware of it because of the press. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 17:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. The company is already in business, however they are not yet dealing directly with the South African public (these services will be available in April 2007), currently wholesale international bandwidth is being sold to ISP's and other enterprises. Furthermore they will become the first company other that <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telkom.html" title="Telkom">Telkom</a> to offer fix-line access to companies/consumers in the South African market (a market that is currently heavily over-priced due to <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telkom.html" title="Telkom">Telkom's</a> monopoly). In addition to that this company represents the liberation of the South African telecommunications market. If this page is to be deleted, I recommend deleting the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telkom.html" title="Telkom">Telkom</a> page as well.

Neotel will also have economic impacts on the economy of the Republic of South Africa because it will completely change the telecommunications industry. Finally, last I heard Wikipedia was an encyclopedia; I <b>specifically</b> searched for Neotel to find out facts about the company, and the only reason I was ever aware of the company was because of <b>its extensive coverage in the independant media -- NOT in an advertising context (see link above)</b>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I <i>might</i> have voted for deleting it if I didn't believe that this article will just be recreated in a few months time due to increase in information and interest in the company.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The company can be considered notable primarily due to its political interest to South Africa. Because of notoriety of Telkom, the subject is controversial and thus interesting. <i>However</i> the article should follow very strict <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, remain factual and keep in mind that the company hasn't really proved anything yet. It will be a good idea to focus on the historical facts (related to the establishment of the new company) rather than the services or products of the new company. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrantkid_6403.html" title="User:Errantkid">Errantkid</a> 07:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I use Wikipedia regularly to either make sense of terms I don't understand, or to get some basic information about organisations / people that I have been hearing about and want a 'factual' update on. I am not aware of the various policies and guidelines referred to above, but the vast media coverage it has been garnering over the last many days prompted me to check the info on Wikipedia - and the current entry gave me a quick basic overview. I also understand that the company, being the second operator in South Africa, breaking decades of monopoly, represents a historical landmark - enough for the President of the country to comment on its launch. I think therefore, that the entry should be retained - any material discerned as 'advertising' must of course be removed. 196.207.40.213 00:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
