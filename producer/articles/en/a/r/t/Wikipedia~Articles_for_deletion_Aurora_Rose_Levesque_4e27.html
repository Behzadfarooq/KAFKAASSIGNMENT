<li><b>Keep</b> She passes the google and name recognition tests laid out in the biography guidlines. The recognition is largely limited to a niche audience, but it is a large niche as measured by cable ratings and by wikipedia entries. Many professional wrestling wikipedia entries have a section devoted to current activity, not all of which will be noteworthy in itself, but is important in relation to the character the entry is build around. This is a current event and can be marked as such. Time will tell if a deletion is necessary, but for the time being it fits in with the other professional wrestling articles. -- Honkus <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.14.206.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.14.206.230_6c76.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.14.206.230">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>I don't think it does fit in, I am a big wrestling fan(WWE/TNA mostly) but I don't think she needs an article on her. She has done NOTHING noteworthy, hell she's only about 23 hours old. While i'm sure she will do something noteworthy eventually, right now the only thing she's "done" was had her birth announced on TV. She should be treated like all these other celebrity births and have her name be a re-direct page to her parent(s). Also, if she's anything like her cousins(Shane McMahon's kids) we won't hear anything more about her for quite some time. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 00:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Marissa has a page because she is noteworthy. She is the director of public relations for WWE, hosted WWF LiveWire, has acted in a big movie, and made various other appearences for WWE. Aurora hasn't done anything not worthy and WP's guidelines are very clear on this, until someone does something noteworthy they should not have a page. It will be several years before Aurora does anything to deserve a page(unless she does something like fall in a well like Baby Jessica did). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:03, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
