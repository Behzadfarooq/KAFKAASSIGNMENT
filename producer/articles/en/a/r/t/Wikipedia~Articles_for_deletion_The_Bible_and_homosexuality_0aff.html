<li>Delete: <b>Duplicate material</b> is either for deletion or redirection. I have serious trouble with the very idea, however, of The Bible and homosexuality, as it implies that the Bible as a whole can be said to have a view on "homosexuality," which is a 19th century cultural construction. Further, everything in this is "uses of the Bible by proponents and opponents of homosexual intercourse." If no passage in the Bible says "homosexual," and none does, then everything is interpretation, and therefore the subject is really "what people say is sanctioned by passages in the Bible." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The term <i>homosexual</i> does not exist in the Bible, but it does reference homosexuals ith both the Old Testament and the New Testament (as the article explains). The fact that you an educated man think that the Bible does not refer to homosexuality whenit does explains the need for the article. However, condemnation is up to interpretation, I agree. But it cannot be denied how big of an issue it is with governments allowing gay marriages and religious groups condemning it because it is unnatural according to the Bible. There is a need for an article that discusses (or at least lists) the verses of the Bible they refer to. Otherwise the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_Christianity_4e22.html" title="Homosexuality and Christianity">Homosexuality and Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_Judaism_d158.html" title="Homosexuality and Judaism">Homosexuality and Judaism</a>, the <b><a href="../../../g/o/d/Godhatesfags.com.html" title="Godhatesfags.com">godhatesfags.com</a></b> articles (and several others) should be removed as well.
<dl>
<dd>I largely agree with Geogre, but I still think that, since many people believe the bible discusses this topic it merits an article. That article, I think, should include the fact that the whole discussion is comparing ancient writings with a modern day cultural construct. I don't think that fact invalidates the article though. As the unsigned person says this is debated even at the governmental level, and providing a resource to help people more intelligently discuss the topic is valid in my opinion. I am not retracting my statement that the article needs a complete rewrite though. <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion">talk</a> 18:53, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, my point is that same-sex sexual acts are discussed, somewhat, in the Bible, but it takes interpretation to even make that so. On the other hand, "homosexuality" is a construct (the idea of a life-long same-sex pairing) and derives largely from a clinical setting. We're dealing with apples and shotguns, here. It's quite true that governments and shrill folks are speaking of The Bible as having something to say on the issue, but, honestly, I see that as addressed elsewhere already. E.g. the fundamentalist attack on homosexuality is discussed in the Christianity and article, while Judaic disquiet is in that article. I.e. the "what they say about them" is already covered in the various 'they' articles. Other than that, there really isn't a need to offer up a prescriptive group of prooftexts for folks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:45, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The point of this article is not "what they say about them" but "what the bible says about them" which has affected how christians (and societies of christian majorities and even organizations like "the boy scouts") think of homosexuality (and same-sex marriage, and adoption by homosexuals, etc.). This article is supposed to be a collection of the verses that talk about same-sex relationship (whether they are sexual or long-term non-sexual). Christians are being accused everywhere of bigotry when the Bible itself talks about same-sex relationships. Homosexuals are attacked everywhere when the Bible may not even condemn explicitly their relationships. This article is supposed to show the foundation of the positions. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizcarra_288c.html" title="User:Vizcarra">Vizcarra</a> 21:04, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I scanned it briefly and found it very interesting, even enlightening. I have no problem with the pro-and-con layout, I think it works very well. For those who think it is too polarized, perhaps we can add a neutral viewpoint which may, in time, emerge as the backbone of the article.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I did considerable amounts of work on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_on_homosexuality.html" title="Christian views on homosexuality">Christian views on homosexuality</a>, while it was still alive. To be honest, now that I've grown up a bit, I think it's a bit wasteful. Wikipedia is a place to get information. It's not a place to get converted, it's not a place to listen to the latest arguments for or agaist a certain Christian point, et cetera. The topic is almost <i>never</i> given proper citations and references, and, largely, they are the opinions of Wikipedia users. Wikipedia should not be cataloging all of the scripture used to make a point or not to make a point; it should <b>link to the people making the points.</b> They can cite their own scripture, and do their own apologetics, however they please. If this page remains, I would like to see it reduced to a list of citations, possibly with included text, with <b>each quote followed by a link to a non-wikipedia site,</b> and that's it. Since there's no consensus, Wikipedia shouldn't jump to conclusions, and Wikipedia <b>definitely</b> need not present the arguments that prevent a consensus. 128.253.110.167 03:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> - it's a POV fork of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_on_homosexuality.html" title="Christian views on homosexuality">Christian views on homosexuality</a>. Merge any useful material (virtually none IMO) into that article. Insofar as useful discussion of individual passages takes too much space for that article, create individual articles, as already is the case for <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus_18.html" title="Leviticus 18">Leviticus 18</a>. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 16:59, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep and cleanup</b>. The POV problems can be fixed. This is encyclopedic and noteworthy: these issues constitute a huge amount of the public debate on the subject. This is the sort of information that <i>needs</i> to be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightwatch_8a25.html" title="User:Nightwatch">Nightwatch</a>／<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENightwatch_7a38.html" title="User talk:Nightwatch">respond</a> 22:14, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
