<li><b>Delete</b> This may become a controversial nomination. Was nominated before in May 2004 with no consensus. The article has undergone substantial changes but remains poorly sourced. I nominate on the grounds that this subject is ill suited to list format. Its focus inherently excludes most beneficial aspects of United States foreign policy. From the contentious talk page: <i>"Wise.. you're so naif, yes all US interventions have only one goal: US own wealth... and that's not only true since 1945... that's quite older (at least Gen. Butler sayd that).. you said: "But the United States introduced the world to free elections and democratic constitutions."... please read about the world, FoxNews and CNN are not telling you the truth... US never cares about if ther is or not free elections and constitutions."</i> I encourage other editors to scan the talk page as well as the article to set this in context. This article is definitionally skewed to exclude counterexamples to that opinion. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter's</a> Nobel Prize winning efforts in support of human rights and free elections cannot fit into this list, nor can the many instances of political asylum granted to students from <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tienanmen_Square_4382.html" title="Tienanmen Square">Tienanmen Square</a> and other freedom movements. I don't mean to whitewash United States history. Both sides deserve attention. Only a narrative format can treat the subject fairly. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I thought the common definition of "intervention" meant military or espionage action. If that's too narrow then how broad shall we go? If former United States President Jimmy Carter oversees a free election as a private citizen, is that a foreign intervention? When private universities in the United States divest their holdings in a country's industries for ethical reasons, is that foreign intervention? Is humanitarian foreign aid intervention? Do we count private donations as well as governmental ones? When members of the United States military on foreign deployment perform community service work overseas, is that foreign intervention? If so, do we confine this to major disasters like the East Asian tsunami or include smaller command sponsored projects? How about when a United States Navy ship on routine patrol saves the lives of a hundred Ecuadorians? When the United States grants asylum to one African woman who would otherwise be subject to clitoridectomy, is that a foreign intervention? Does it become foreign intervention when the number of refugees is greater? If so, what's the magic number? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:04, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The U.S. is the most hated country in the world because everyone has a different reason to hate them. If they do not interfere they are criticised for doing nothing. If they step in then they are criticised for stepping in. Like it or not the U.S. will never be able to please the world and that is not likely to change, but that is hardly a reason to keep a redundant list. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 06:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My understanding for why US is the most hated country in the world is because it is the most powerful country in the world. At any time in history the most powerful country was also the most hated (except in times when there were 2 or 3 of roughly equal power, in which case they shared the hatred). I believe that that is the main reason. Romans were hated during their empire, Russians during theirs (which they shared with USA), Egyptians (just have a look at the bible!), British, French, you name it. However, the *reasons* differ. Egyptians were hated for their slave trade, Romans for their orgies, Portugese for their piracy, British for their religious conversion, and so forth. But let's not forget that USA really are the most hated country in the world. No other country engenders such hatred. Are they also the most loved? I don't know. We could perhaps do a poll on that one. Might be. But its not just Arabs that hate USA. Something in the order of 90% of the world hates Americans. Just that Arabs hate them a lot worse than say Canadians. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:34, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Indifferent keep</b>. Given the votes so far, this will obviously be kept, either by actual consensus or at least by lack of consensus. And the list seems reasonable enough in annotated with some care. Mostly I just want to chime in in Zordrac's defense on his above vote (I've had some disagreements with him utterly unrelated to this, so take it as a gesture of good will): his argument about US being hated as most powerful country seems perfectly reasonable, and not dissimulative at all. I'm not sure that I actually agree with his position, but there's no reason to suppose he's setting up any kind of straw man, or anything else insincere. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 03:05, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is it? I thought that was what the POV tags were for? Only if it can never stop being POV is it worthy of AFD nomination.

<li><b>Extraordinarily strong keep</b> <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a>, who initiated this recent deletion, states the following five reasons for deleting the article:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>FIRST:"The article has undergone substantial changes but remains poorly sourced"</li>
<li>SECOND: "Its focus inherently excludes most beneficial aspects of United States foreign policy...This article is definitionally skewed to exclude counterexamples to that opinion."</li>
<li>THIRD: "Only a narrative format can treat the subject fairly."</li>
<li>FOURTH: "<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter's</a> Nobel Prize winning efforts...instances of political asylum granted to students from <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tienanmen_Square_4382.html" title="Tienanmen Square">Tienanmen Square</a> and other freedom movements...cannot fit into this list"</li>
<li>FIFTH: "I nominate on the grounds that this subject is ill suited to list format." <font size="1"><i>(Same argument as <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">User:Tom harrison</a>)</i></font></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These five arguments for deletion can all be satisfied without deleting the article. Through editing and communication, all five arguments can be resolved. If communication fails, then as a last resort, mediation then arbitration can be attempted. Ask yourself: has <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> or any of those who vote for deletion attempted mediation or arbitration? Deletion should always be a last resort, not a first one.Travb 00:41, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> who'd have thought it - me voting keep on a list? But yes, this list has definite merit. It is noe of the few I have come across which is, in and of itself, encyclopaedic. I'd like to see a bit more context, but actually it is not bad as it stands. The nomination is not without merit, but I believe the criticisms can be fixed. In the end this provides context to a situation whch baffles many Americans of my acquiaintance: with all the good work the US does, why is it not more popular? This list provides a good answer. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:29, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
