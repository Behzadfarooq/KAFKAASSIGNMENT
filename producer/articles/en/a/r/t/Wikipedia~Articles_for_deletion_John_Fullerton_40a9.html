However, problems remain: any claims of his general notability being on a par with people like Martin O'Neill, John Hume and Seamus Heaney need documented proof (as I said, no sign in the <a href="http://www.derryjournal.com/site_search/" class="external text" title="http://www.derryjournal.com/site_search/" rel="nofollow">Derry Journal</a>, nor in the <i>NewsBank</i> newspaper article).

<dd>The subject is of substantial importance and significance to the local population of Northern Ireland, specifically Derry City. He is just as renowned in the city and famous institution of St. Columb's College as fellow illustrious alumni such as Martin O'Neill, John Hume and Seamus Heaney. I do not see any challenge to the existence of these men's articles. John Fullerton is also a name common to many ears outside his local community as I will discuss below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that the article does make numerous claims to notability for it's subject. John Fullerton was not only a past pupil. The initial statement is a mere introduction. There are other reasons for this article and I feel I have mentioned them within the content, thus warranting the article itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, he is recognised as an overhead and free kick specialist and along with Tony Furey, a fellow member of the Physical Education department in St. Columb's College and a powerful diplomat, he famously negotiated with the British government and brokered numerous deals for the state-funding of his department, resulting in the much-needed investment totalling £2 million to be allocated to the department over a period of 7 years between 1987 and 1994. One of the monthly sums personally designated to John Fullerton for his development proposal can be seen <a href="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" class="external text" title="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This was the standard monthly sum for John Fullerton for 2 years, while Tony Furey received a similar sum and the College was given half a million pounds sterling due to the successful negotiations. As far as I know, further details of the payment are not allowed for reasons of commercial confidentiality as the institution is permanently operational and is currently awaiting acceptance of further development. John Fullerton's ground-breaking negotiations were a huge achievement and are well-known throughout Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as a major breakthrough for Catholic/nationalist equality during the "troubles" era. These negotiations had been the first of their kind since he worked for a department in a Roman Catholic school in Unionist-dominated Northern Ireland. They set an extremely important precedent for Northern Irish politics and social policies. Catholic schools had previously been neglected by the largely Protestant-biased UUP. He is held as a local hero by many among the nationalist community as he demonstrated that the goal of full equality and peace could be achieved by diplomacy and co-operation, rather than violent tactics, like that employed by the IRA. This approach he adopted was similar to that taken by John Hume. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 159.134.207.171 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.134.207.171_0550.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.134.207.171">contribs</a>)</small></dd>

<p>I would have to agree that John Fullerton is a notable character. I’m from Belfast, Northern Ireland but living in Derry, but I had heard about Fullerton before moving here. His often-hilarious exploits at Derry City FC get a brief mention in Norman Giller’s “Football and All That: An Irreverent History”, where he famously scored from near the half-way line in a league football game. This is quite an achievement in football and Giller describes him as “an influential and witty personality to local football at a time when Northern Ireland needed something to cheer about”. The distance he scored the free-kick from was the second furthest distance ever scored from in the UK and Ireland. He is also mentioned in “From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles” by Niall O'Dochartaigh for his breakthrough in cross-community negotiations in Northern Ireland. “an influential and witty personality for local football at a time when Northern Ireland needed something to cheer about”. The article includes all the relevant information. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 84.64.215.208 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.64.215.208_7a92.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.64.215.208">contribs</a>)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Derry Journal online archives do not go back to the when Fullerton carried out his most influential work. Although the article is about a man who planned his physical education department, which does not sound notable on the face of it, the individual circumstances in Fullerton's case are what give him special prominence. He set a famous precedent in Northern Irish politics, as has been noted, by negotiating the planning of the department. Also, although I was aware of his speciality in the area of overhead and free kicking I was unaware that he held the record in football mentioned in Giller's book. I am aware of O'Dochartaigh's book and the mention of Fullerton. - <i>unsigned comment by Johnfullerton (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnfullerton_7d75.html" title="User talk:Johnfullerton">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnfullerton_5370.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnfullerton">contribs</a>)</i></li>

<p>I think another reason why this article ought to be kept is that, in a school noted for the brilliance of its past pupils, john fullerton is a man who has achieved great status in his field. He is important to people in Derry and surrounding areas. It would be a disgrace if he is once again shunned from the limelight that he so richly deserves. I believe some of the best chapters on Fullerton have yet to be written!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> how can anyone say John Fulerton is "not notable"&#160;??? that is insane, he is one of the most widely know and respected figures in Northern Ireland of the past 50 years. I had forgotton about the fact that he was also one of the minds behind the original anti-bullying wristbands worn by thousands of people including many celebrities all over the U.K. What else must one do to be deemed "notable"&#160;??!!??

<li><b>Comment</b> Fullerton played for Derry City FC in the professional Irish football league whilst on trial and his famous wonder-goal is mentioned in Giller's book, as has been pointed out. The Derry Journal office archives on the Buncrana Road in Derry will have numerous articles on Fullerton dating from the time of his most prominent work. His importance to NI society and politics was also pointed out in O'Dochartaigh's book. This clearly demonstrates that he is a major local political figure. Does this not satisfy the criteria? Regarding the anti-bullying wristbands, I'm not sure how influential he was in their creation. Have you any evidence of this? If anything, I think he merely promoted them. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 159.134.206.82 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_159.134.206.82_7dcb.html" title="Special:Contributions/159.134.206.82">contribs</a>)</small></li>

<p>he has also been briefly mentioned in an article by Queens University Professor Kieran McEvoy ("Restorative Justice and the Critique of Informalism in Northern Ireland " (with Harry Mika) (2002) 43 British Journal of Criminology 534 ) as one of the people who have made strides in promoting cross community relations. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> Ciaranmcgonagle (<a href="../../../c/i/a/User_talk%7ECiaranmcgonagle_83f1.html" title="User talk:Ciaranmcgonagle">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ciaranmcgonagle_bed9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ciaranmcgonagle">contribs</a>)</small></p>
<p>Fullerton is a legend and deserves to be on this site.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a vote so I don't see the point in people adding their personal views or support in order to keep this article up. It is both futile and detrimental to any chance of Fullerton being taken seriously by anyone who is unaware of his work. As Tearlach points out, "the interference with the afd and the influx of newly-signed editors endorsing his importance suggests there's astroturfing going on with this article (Tearlach 14:45, 11 December 2005 (UTC))". I'm not sure who these people are but the interference is certainly damaging the subject's credibility so I'd be pleased to see excitable people refrain from treating this debate as a voting arena. Now, regardless of these interferences, the facts are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fullerton is a notable sportsman. He played for Derry City FC in the professional Irish football league whilst on trial and scored a record goal for the UK and Ireland. (<b>Norman Giller, Football and All That: An Irreverent History</b>)</li>
<li>Fullerton is a notable personality in Northern Irish politics and society. He made famous and ground-breaking negotiations with the British government, changing the face of the political and social scene in Northern Ireland gaining increased equality for Roman Catholics in the area of education. (<b>Niall O'Dochartaigh, From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles</b> (I am well aware of this book, as it is in the Central Library in Derry and I have borrowed it previously. If needs be I could check for its availability, borrow it and scan the relevant pages for people to see.), <b>Kieran McEvoy ("Restorative Justice and the Critique of Informalism in Northern Ireland " (with Harry Mika) (2002) 43 British Journal of Criminology 534 )</b>) Evidence of the actual investment resulting from the negotiations can be seen at, <a href="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" class="external free" title="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti" rel="nofollow">http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/qanda/writtenans/000131.htm#eti</a>, as has been pointed out above.</li>
<li>Claims have been made that he was influential in the setting up of the global anti-bullying wrist-band campaign, although I am not convinced by this. I feel evidence of this is necessary as Fullerton merely promoted them within Northern Ireland, if anything.--Johnfullerton 20:14, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think this subject is totally relevant to this page. John Fullerton was footballs original heart throb.

KEEP: I detect a lot of jealousy amongst posters on this discussion of this great man. Don't hate him because he is better than you. Fullerton would not hate you for feeling this way, he is humble in his greatness and I think it's time that you people take a leaf from John's book and honour this beautiful tribute. This is a man who embodied class, touch and vision on and off the football field, it is truly a disgrace that his name be soiled in this way. hame on the lot of you!

<p><b>Comment</b> I am not John Fullerton so I cannot see how the accusation of vanity against the article can stand. Anyhow, I apologise for the mess this has become. These trolls are not sockpuppets of mine and have nothing to do with me. I am as much frustrated by their interference as other serious contributors to this site, as they are damaging the subject's (now slight) chance to remain credible. Before their interference there was a consensus for possibly keeping the article. However, since, this has changed and I feel their interuption has put some contributors on a side against the article. Nevertheless, serious sources relating to Fullerton's notability have been mentioned. Are these enough to ensure the page is preserved?--Johnfullerton 00:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Seriously</b> I am trying here. But the problem is that verifiable sources <i>haven't</i> been provided, to justify the claims of notability in the article. Read this page . . . nothing but paragraphs and paragraphs of personal testimony, but no one has provided the link we ask for. I can only barely prove that this man <i>exists</i>, let alone that he is one of the most well-known and important figures in Northern Ireland. If he is so important, than why does a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22John+Fullerton%22+Derry&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22John+Fullerton%22+Derry&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"John Fullerton" Derry</a> turn up no hits for him? Surely there would be <i>something</i>, either from his work in politics or in football. But alas, there is nothing. Even the link to the school's website shows that he is not even the head of the P.E. department, but rather the school coach. I'm sure his work toward a new school gym is important to that school, and perhaps to that community, but it is not of interest to an encyclopedia reader from a general audience. — <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioneight_f590.html" title="User:Orioneight"><font color="#003366">orion</font></a><a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrioneight_f590.html" title="User:Orioneight"><font color="#999999">eight</font></a> <font size="-2">(<a href="../../../o/r/i/User_talk%7EOrioneight_fcde.html" title="User talk:Orioneight">talk</a>)</font> 01:19, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Nope, it isn't, since the sock votes wouldn't be counted anyway. 95% of the time, socks only hurt your chances to do whatever it is you want to do on here since people will view the credibility of the claims of your side with suspicion since they had to resort to socks. The other 5% of the time is when a losing side puts socks voting for the opposing side, usually because it's so obvious that the other side will win that the losing side feels they have to do something to break consensus. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 17:34, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The local press online archives do not go back far enough to when Fullerton carried out his work. The Derry Journal Office archives on the Buncrana Road would have planty of information. So far we've established that he has been mentioned in two books, not one. And who are you to say they are obscure? O'Dochartaigh's book is an important publication for anyone interested in Derry City and the history of the "troubles" in NI, while Giller's proves that he played in a professional football league. Not only did he do so, but he scored a record goal. There are biographies on here for modern-day professional Irish league footballers. Why should it be any different for Fullerton? --Johnfullerton 11:28, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't worry about the sockpuppets. They're an irrelevant nuisance. The point is still verification. Even if the references in those books are verified, the bulk of the material in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fullerton_d096.html#Career" title="John Fullerton">John Fullerton#Career</a> section remains unverified by published sources. What reputable publication tells us about his tendon injury or his meteoric rise in the ranks to be, erm, deputy head of a school PE department? <i>Who</i> "argued that only George Best in recent times has been more successful at using the medium of sport to bridge political divides in Northern Ireland"? <i>Who</i> suggested "that the reason why his success has not been more noteworthy is due to" etc?</dd>
<dd>As to one of the sources offered: the NI Assembly document lists a John Fullerton as recipient of £8,467, but provides no detail: for all we know, it might be a different John Fullerton and refer to a contract to clean the windows. Another current example: the <a href="http://www.stcolumbs.com/ppu/ppalumni.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stcolumbs.com/ppu/ppalumni.htm" rel="nofollow">Alumni Illustrissimi</a> site only lists winners up to 2003] so currently we've no proof that he won that award in 2005. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 13:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Hargie and Dickson, Researching the Troubles: Social Science Perspectives on the Northern Ireland Conflict.</b></li>
<li><b>Mahon, The History of Gaelic Football</b> (In the chapter relating to GAA in Ulster, and a specific sub-section on Co. Derry, the divide between the “soccer-playing city” and the “gaelic-playing rural areas” are noted and Fullerton’s name is mentioned in connection with this and somewhat contributing to this. People in Derry city viewed him as a local role-model while nationalists in rural areas felt he always has a soft attitude towards Britain, a fact which was allegedly backed up by the fact he played the “foreign game of soccer” according to Mahon.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>She also pointed me to O’Dochartaigh’s book and some newspaper and sport cuttings from the early 1980s and late 1970s. These mention his record goal even though he played only 4 times for the Derry City full-team and mentions the reasons for this return to St. Columb’s. The St. Columb’s College affair is also documented in later cuttings. More detailed articles should be available in the Derry Journal offices although I don’t currently have the time to visit there.</p>

<p>He is ranked third here, however. This ranking includes the worldwide record, though, and the chap in second place is Peruvian. This backs up the claim about his professional footballing I feel. Definitly noteworthy. --88.107.17.245 16:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Keep - I refer to the comment that the academic journal was obscure. I would argue that in the realm of northern irish criminology it is well known and is usually a set text on any criminolgical university syllabus. Outside of this it may be called obscure however, if this is not a forum for knowledge and historical insight which is not well known or has thusfar been overlooked in the public domain, then i fail to see the purpose of this site! I would also hope you disregard the views of the so called sock puppets, both for and against, and give regard to the original authors. (ciaranmcgonagle)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If "hoax" accusations are going to be lazily hurled at the subject they'd need foundation. Does the fate of this article rely on Google now? I do not see where it is the official policy of Wikipedia for its articles to pass the "Google test" before being accepted. Source evidence has been provided to prove Fullerton's professional footballing and his notable role in NI politics. Doesn't this establish notability? By the way, it was 2004, not 2005, when Fullerton won the past-pupil award.--Johnfullerton 17:43, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The speech - so many giants in so many very different spheres, <b>some names well known inside their professional worlds</b>, others household names like Phil Coulter, Bishop Edward Daly - I believe this relates to fullerton and people of that ilk. I think these sites have a duty to spread the word of lessor know people such as fullerton. I think if the site is allowed up it would create a hub or a basis for further works into fullerton and the body of work will expand from there. Surely if everything on this site could be referenced on google there would be no need for it?? This is the whole point of this community and people such as fullerton should be allowed, people who are unfashionable like this will never get the acclaim that they deserve in the normal arenas. - <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by Ciaranmcgonagle (<a href="../../../c/i/a/User_talk%7ECiaranmcgonagle_83f1.html" title="User talk:Ciaranmcgonagle">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ciaranmcgonagle_bed9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ciaranmcgonagle">contribs</a>)</i></small></p>

<p>First thing i noticed when reading this post, is that most of the "Delete" comments are being made by people living outside Ireland, north and south. Asking for proof because they have never heard of JF, well just going to make a few points, If you are not from the surrounding area then you are not going to have heard of them man, most of his work was done before the internet came about and i would wager that all of your so called refrences came from the internet, how many people went down to the derry journal office to get research, how many went to inish times for information. I am cuently studying in Derry and had to write a report on the history of derry's sport. Firstly i must thank wikipedia for providing information helping me in my report. Although the info was hard to come by i stumbled upon the report about john fullerton which led me to here where this debate is happening. Is it taking up so much space on your webpage that it should be deleted? If you were to ask the people of derry who they would rather have represented by their city John F or Nadine Coyle (whom you have on your site) i would say most of them would say john. As for the facts i don't know much about them but i'm guesing he is on this more becasue of his work for the funding rather than his footballing skills. To anyone not from Derry you will never understand what it was like during the troubles and for John and his co-workers to pull that off was an amazing feat from somone on "the city side." As for the football I couldn't give a damm I'm a GAA man to the end and i find it amazing that no one has mentioned that John played Gaa for donegal team. - unsigned post by 212.219.92.232 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.92.232.html" title="User talk:212.219.92.232">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.219.92.232_1f91.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.219.92.232">contribs</a>)</p>

And to <a href="../../../s/c/n/WP%7ESCN_9749.html" title="WP:SCN">those that had not lived pure lives</a>, he spoke: "You I condemn to Hell; there you will be forced to translate articles from <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a> and expand Wikipedia's excellent article on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoe_polish.html" title="Shoe polish">shoe polish</a> for all eternity." And there was a great wailing and gnashing of teeth.' --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 12:34, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
