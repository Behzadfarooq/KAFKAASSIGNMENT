<li><i>I agree that stories about Paris Hilton are not hard to find or generally substantive, however the sophmoric edits of users should not be the measure for whether a blog is noteworthy.

<li>I love Jalopnik as much as the next guy, but right now having Jalopnik in the Wiki would be little more than advertising. <s>Perhaps when the J site gets mentioned in the automotive press.</s> The mention in Time Magazine helps, but a few more reviews, and any awards Jalopnik might have won would make the article eligible for keeping according to the guidelines. <b>Weak delete</b> --<a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 22:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Named one of Time magazine's 50 Coolest Websites of 2005, Jalopnik feeds hungry car enthusiasts content not always accessible or up-to-date in traditional media channels.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.195.53.21 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.195.53.21_adbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.195.53.21">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>We mean -- we <i>were</i> mentioned as one of Time magazine's <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1072872,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1072872,00.html" rel="nofollow">50 coolest websites</a>.

<li>I agree that Jalopnik should probably not be a part of the Wiki, as I think that all the relevant information is on the Jalopnik website. A Wiki entry would simply be a form of advertisement.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.99.122.36 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.99.122.36_1f05.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.99.122.36">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Jalopnik gets mentioned in the automotive press all the time, not in the mags but on the other online sites. There is a lot of shortsightedness here. Automotive media is changing and Jalopnik amongst others is the new wave of things to come. By the time one gets AutoWeek which, as its name would imply, comes out weekly the news is already old. I would argue that Jalopnik is a leader in cutting edge automotive content even though it is in its nacent stage. The ability for users to enter commentary adds to its content. Deleting Jalopnik would be a mistake.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sebrock (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sebrock_9981.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sebrock">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Gawker Media has a wiki page, so why shouldn't Jalopnik have one? Gawker Media is arguably the leading online provider of edgy, obsession-feeding daily content, catering to several different interests by individualizing different blog sites (a lot like Time, Inc offering all of its different magazines). Jalopnik is the one for cars. I guess when Time buys Gawker, then it will be worth noting? Okay, then wait three months. Anyone who dismisses an entry about a Gawker Media site must be completely out of touch (which is pretty impressive for a wikipedia user).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.158.223.86 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.158.223.86_61fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.158.223.86">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How about some hard statistics about how popular this site really is? If it can be proven popular then it may be influential and noteworthy. Isn't that why an article like <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_News_072a.html" title="Wired News">Wired News</a> exists, because it is popular and influential? Being listed on Time Magazine as a top 50 Blog site is no small thing to do considering the amount of blog sites that exist on the net. If the owner of this site can cite some more relevant references and stats I'd be persuaded to vote to keep. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapa_d174.html" title="User:Hapa">Hapa</a> 02:38, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, not so much vanity -- we think we're ugly. However, as we are the largest non-corporate automotive blog (re: not owned by a publicly-traded corporation -- we think we are deserved of <i>some</i> respect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As Jalopnik is an "entity" or in effect a noun, inclussion in Wikipedia does not seem to be unjustified. However ensuring the article is not just an advertisment does seem to be the key issue. I'd argue that the content should be limited to facts about Jalopnik and not opinions as to why they are better then print media. Personally I'm interested in how Jalopnik came to be, How does it operate, what is special about it vs other online autoblogs (things that I think are already in the article). RumorControl 15:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC) <small><i>Note: Editor's first contribution to Wikipedia.</i></small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article reads a tiny bit like an add, however, that should be cleaned up and is not a good reason to delete the entry. There is nothing in any wikipedia policy that I can find that says this entry should be deleted. Admiral.Ackbar 17:39, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've really hesitated to get involved in this discussion as I'm one of the site's editors. I agree that the current post is somewhat advertisey (note that I had no hand in writing it). That said, there's an entry on Screeching Weasel's song "My Brain Hurts," and I'm guessing less people know that song than read our site. Deleting an entry on Jalopnik is frankly, somewhat silly, even from an outside perspective. Editing it so it conforms to standards? Sure, I'm all for it. I'd personally like to see it be more neutral, broad and wikified. But when editors I have a lot of respect for at major car mags tell me that our site is part of their morning must-reads, I know that we're not inconsequential. I certainly agree that the post right now isn't as neutral or fact-based about us as it should be. But give people a chance to rectify that, rather than deleting it. Isn't that what Wikipedia's supposed to be about? -- Davey G. Johnson, Associate Editor, Los Angeles, Jalopnik</li>

<li>From the article you linked to, the "The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation." I think the above mentioned CNN award qualifies this site by that rule alone. Admiral.Ackbar 16:53, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
