<p><b>Why delete</b></p>
<p>It seems to me that if there is a google search that shows and confirms the term Aga Khani than it should be mentioned. Most of the Pakistanis know the followers of Aga Khan as Aga Khani so 140 million people according to the user should be disregarded. Maybe as in the artice on nation of islam there is a link to the criticism of Nation of Islam, than a similar link should be placed for Nizari Ismailis</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> We certainly don't need a separate article on it if it's just going to be a fork of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizari_Ismaili_871e.html" title="Nizari Ismaili">Nizari Ismaili</a>. Aylahs or someone else who would know, is this term one that would be incredibly offensive if we just redirected it to <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a>? It's obviously a real word, so it would be a good idea to redirect it somewhere just so that in six months, this doesn't come up again. But if that would be the functional equivalent of redirecting a racial slur to the article on that race, there's no real need for it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>'Aga Khani' refers to <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizari.html" title="Nizari">Nizari Ismailis</a> (for whom the Aga Khan is the current Imam), which already has an article, so there's no point in it having a separate article. While having a redirect may seem harmless –– (1) the term is something that arises out of ignorance; it is never used in an academic setting which makes it unfit for an encyclopedia, (2) the community does not refer to itself as 'Aga Khani'; if anything, it is considered pejorative by members of the community. (3) people searching for 'Aga Khani' might as well search for 'Aga Khan' and come across the same thing – so having a redirect doesn't serve much purpose.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi All. The term <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khani_a94c.html" title="Aga Khani">Aga Khani</a> literally means <b>of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a></b> in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>/<a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>. A rough translation would be <b>Followers of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a></b>. Though I don't know much about the sect, you can rest assured that it exists. The other term used to describe the members of the sect is <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismaili.html" title="Ismaili">Ismaili</a>. I am not sure if <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khani_a94c.html" title="Aga Khani">Aga Khani</a> sect is an offshoot/part of <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismaili.html" title="Ismaili">Ismaili</a> sect or not. The above information was confirmed by one of my muslim friends, who is <b>not</b> an <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khani_a94c.html" title="Aga Khani">Aga Khani</a>. Sorry for not being much help.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The term <i>Aga Khani</i> is favoured by extremists who falsely claim that the <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismaili.html" title="Ismaili">Ismailis</a> believe the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_IV_00f6.html" title="Aga Khan IV">Aga Khan</a> to literally be God. They use the term to spread false information about the community's beliefs and practices and encourage their persecution. It is a dangerous term, conveying a very narrow point of view. By its very name, this article would lend support to extremist propaganda. <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimm_3723.html" title="User:Cimm">Cimm</a><sup><a href="../../../c/i/m/User_talk%7ECimm_3e66.html" title="User talk:Cimm">[talk]</a></sup> 23:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As with Nation of Islam which has both sides, why is Users here getting so upset as in Nation of Islam there is a separate section of their beliefs. So there is nothing wrong with having this article. Aga Khan followers in India and Pakistan use this term to identify themselves so it is proper.<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETrueblood786_0d56.html" title="User:Trueblood786">trueblood</a> 05:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that as in Nation of Islam Article there is a link to critism of Nation of Islam where the other side is also listed could be a proper compromise so both sides have their opinions listed. why not do the same here. An insert a link to a new article where the other side is also told</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>* In todays world we in the United States see bombings between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq and than witness all kinds of individuals stating that they are the main stream Islam, while in fact Mainstream muslims who constitute over 99% of Islam in Shia and Sunnis but people dont know who to look at. In fact, if one is to look up the suicide bombers it is clear that most of them are members of a sect that follows extremist views such as going to heaven by killing innocent people, while vast majority of muslims are clearly opposed to this. In order to understand Islam and the mainstream Islam it is incumbent upon the editors to have these cults and sects in one section where it is all for see what these small sects really beliveve in. For instance, the Qadianis claim they have 200 million followers while in fact they have less than 10 million members, the Aga Khanis are less than 5 million members, the Nation of Islam maybe one half million, these sects are not mainstreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in Christianity there are the cults such as David Koresh's Branch Dravidians, and the Chritian Identity up in Idaho, those cults do not represent mainstream Christianity, and these cults are listed separately. If one is to look up th Encyclopedia of American Religion, Fourth Edition by J. Gordon Melton, The Encylcopedia lists every single religion in America, including each of the cults mentioned in this article. Thus to delete this article would be unfair.</p>
<p>In fact it would be the same as deleting on the Nation of Islam article the critisms of Nation of Islam. In fact if one puts up anything in the Ismaili article the users who are followers of that particular brand of Islam call it vandalism, while in fact it is a viewpoint which is different than that held by the followers. In one instance a statement was added to the Wahabi sect and a user from Israel objected, eventhough, I doubt very much that Israelis have a very deep understanding of Wahabis, the user called it vandalism, while in truth and fact the United States Government and in particulara the FBI has stated that Wahabis are extremists and that the 9/11 hijackers were all wahabis and that Osama Bin Ladin proclaims himself to be a Wahabi, but the reference was deleted as being untrue and as vandalism.</p>
<p>Here if one is to listen to the argument put forward by the adherents of the view that Islam is a pluralistic religion and all are accepted, than we would not be witnessing over 90 dead bodies in Iraq everyday. In fact my own nephew who was with the 4ID in Iraq was a victim of the cultish violence, in fact he won a purple heart for his bravery. We have to identify the cults in Islam so that the world can see that these cult followers even with their billions of dollars who have bought our Government in Washington, do not in fact represent Islam.</p>
<p>Obvioiusly, the Mormon cultist who was marying off 12 year old girls also did not consider himself to be a cultist. If only the viewpoint of the particular follower of the cult or sect are listed than Wikipedia cannot be called an Encyclopedia but rather a proponent of only the views of the sects or cults that want to propogate their own viewpoints.</p>
<p>I hope that the editors are mindful of the viewpoint that to make a complete encyclopedia all viewpoints must be published.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to consider the above.</p>

<p>Former members of this cult or sect have numerous websites that say the same thing, I have not seen the Aga Khan file a defamation suit anywhere in the world to say that these are false. Every cult in history has said that anyone who says anything about their cult or sect is clearly libelous, see former members of the Church of Scientology or Branch Dravidians or now Aga Khanis.</p>
<p>Everyone says the same things. So to put forward both views is what Wikipedia is all about.</p>
