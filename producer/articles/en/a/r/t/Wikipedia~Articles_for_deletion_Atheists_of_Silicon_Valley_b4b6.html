<li>Changed my vote to <b>strong delete</b> due to the author's strategy of using anon IP sockpuppets. If you really feel it's worthy of an article, then the least you could do is respect the VfD process to determine that, instead of that feeble attempt to cheat. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 23:54, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Has it crossed your mind Ulayiti that maybe word of this Vfd has gotten around and supporters of the Atheists of Silicon Valley have come here to vote for it? What is up with persistent claims of "sock puppets" made without any attempt to verify if usernames are coming from the same IP or not. You will find that they are different IPs, different people. People who prove that this group is significant enought to have an article. What a perverted process. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 01:31, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually what has happend is that the word has gotten around in the Atheist community about the twin attacks on both this entry and The God Movie that was shut down twice by a false copyright violation claim. So there are a lot of enraged Atheists who are here for the first time and they don't yet have accounts. That's why only IP addresses show. But they aren't Sock Puppets because people who do sock puppets are regular users who have a number of fake identities. What you are seeing here is outrage. Wikipedia has a problem with anti-Atheist bias. that it needs to deal with. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcperkel_2849.html" title="User:Marcperkel">Marcperkel</a> 15:01, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A perverted process indeed. Whether or not all edits are by the same person makes no difference, as it is Wikipedia policy not to count VfD votes by users with no previous contributions. And by the way, if you really think 'different IPs' means 'different people', you do have a limited knowledge of how the Internet works. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 01:49, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the author ofthe article seems quite literal-minded, now having added a "Claim to Fame" section, in some effort to make it look notable.

Did you not notice that none of those links have anything to say about the 8,000 members of the Universist Movement? You've destroyed any credibility you thought you had with your immature crusade against this article. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 01:25, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not in my eyes he hasn't. The only 'immature crusade' I've seen is your desperate attempt to create publicity for yourselves by writing vanity articles on Wikipedia. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 02:06, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow not in YOUR eyes huh? What a lot that means. Articles about large freethought groups that have proven their notability are as relevant as those about any other group that Wikipedia is filled with. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 02:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure they are. But you'd need to come up with such an article to make that argument, since it doesn't fit here. Where has your club's notability been proven? Certainly not on this page. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 02:27, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ulayiti, what the heck are you doing trying to edit even a fake encylopedia when you're too lazy to do the most basic research? The Universists have been in the New York Times, BBC, major papers across the country, on the cover of a local magazine, and are cited in US News &amp; World Report this week, among other media such as national radio shows. Oh yeah, and you know the documentary that cites the Atheists of Silicon Valley in the credits? The Universist Movement is there too along with a promotional video on the DVD. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 02:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point of the links, guy, was so people could read the discussion of exactly how bogus are your claims of notability and how much resume-padding you've done, as well as demonstrate the extent of your insanely active self-promotion. I urge regular Wikipedians unfamiliar with the issue to at least skim before taking <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> (or whatever he's calling himself this week) seriously. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:43, August 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I double-dare everyone to read those fascinating discussions, that's why we highlight them on our own website. And yes, the purpose of our corporation is self-promotion, it is the faithless answer to evangelism. That's why we want an article on this website everyone thinks is an encylopedia. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 05:18, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Show me. If you create an article on an obscure topic such as this, it's your job to provide sources, not mine. And what's a 'fake encyclopaedia'? - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 13:03, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fake encylopedia? Well, that would be an "encyclopedia" that anybody on earth can edit. That's not an encyclopedia, and it's highly unfortunate that people think it is. This site is entertainment for its participants and it's popular because people of its google rankings (which result from its constant updating and masses of information of unjudged value) and the fact that millions of internet surfers don't realize a 10 year old just edited the article on terrorism they're reading. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUniversist_3137.html" title="User:Universist">Universist</a> 05:18, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> People have ALREADY voted, and would like their votes to count. A revote would just send the message that on Wikipedia, we vote again and again, as many times as it takes until certain people like the results. Also, a vote to merge would result in ASV being entirely deleted from Wikipedia, since the information here is superfluous elsewhere. For example, if this topic were merged into <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Atheists_1bb3.html" title="American Atheists">American Atheists</a> then it would eventually be deleted from that page because it doesn't have anything to do with that organization.</li>

<li>Nobody's claimed it it's anything more than a local radio show. And BTW, being a regional issue/concern/group is not sufficient justification for deleting an informative article. There are plenty of articles on regional churches, schools, and groups on wikipedia, none of which are up for VFD or likely to be. Puffery, eh?

<li><i>Nobody's claimed it it's anything more than a local radio show</i> Yeah, that's why you just dropped the name as if anyone reading it would understand what it meant. So, yes, puffery, since you explicitly used that factoid as an example of media attention to justify the alleged notability of this tiny local group -- a bit of puffery that I note that an editor has added -- desperately, in my opinion -- to the article's "Claims to Fame" section. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:24, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> ASV's entry needs to be expanded, not, deleted. They are very active both on the internet and in the Bay Area. They were a strong presence at the 9th circuit court of appeals protest for Michael Newdow. Their coordinator Mark Thomas has appeared on national televison, radio and in newspapers several times, most recently he debated Oliver North on Hannity &amp; Colmes. The party making this complaint is simply trying to squelch entries having to do with anything that offends him. It is sickening to see such a clumsy attempt at censorship for no legitimate reason.

This is not a conspiracy to destroy free speech or establish a bias; as it stands, this article is pointless. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 57.66.51.165 (<a href="../../../5/7/2E/User_talk%7E57.66.51.165.html" title="User talk:57.66.51.165">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_57.66.51.165_ab90.html" title="Special:Contributions/57.66.51.165">contribs</a>) 01:54, 2 August 2005.</small></p>
