<p>He's the shopkeeper in the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_Wars_7388.html" title="Advance Wars">Advance Wars</a> series. He doesn't have a part in the nascent story of the three games in that series, he has perhaps two dozen total lines of dialogue, and, oh yeah, he's an unlockable character in the versus mode.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He's playable in all modes, including Campaign. He has a backstory. I can make it longer than any Pok√©mon article. If a Dunsparce is considered notable, than Hachi can too.

<ul>
<li>While I'm not terribly enthusiastic about <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunsparce.html" title="Dunsparce">Dunsparce</a> having its own article, it has appeared in at least nine games I can name, as well as two different anime series and a manga series.

<li>It's worth mentioning that two people weighed in on the "debate" to merge this there, and one of them is me and the other is LttP.

<ul>
<li>He isn't that minor of character. He has a decent enough backstory. Really, he doesn't deserve his own section on the game articles if others don't. I say, if <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umaro.html" title="Umaro">Umaro</a> can get his own article, there's nothing wrong with Hachi getting his own. He is immediately known to everyone who has played any of the AW games, at least, if they visit the Battle Maps store, which is available from the very beginning of each game. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 08:08, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>He's the shopkeeper, has no story, and has no place in the story of those games. He's less important to <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_Wars_7388.html" title="Advance Wars">Advance Wars</a> than Shadowfax (who has an entry on <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> list, mind) is to Lord of the Rings, and Advance Wars is no Lord of the Rings. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Huh?

<ul>
<li>A detailed description of each item and accessory of clothing is a bit excessive, in that instance a picture is worth a thousand words. This is a minor character in a videogame (which is fictional, but not really a literary work) and should be merged with the aforementioned list as suggested in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. Hachi's biographical details and purported motives would be better catalogued at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a>, in a character faq. --<a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode">Anetode</a> 06:14, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That seems to be a third-order claim to notability; Hachi is notable because he's connected to a thing that is connected to a thing with its own claim to notability. I don't necessarily disagree that <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_Wars_7388.html" title="Advance Wars">Advance Wars</a> is an encyclopedic subject, but not every single person and object in that series borrows on the series' notability. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article has been swelled with trivia. Half of this article is a detailed description, GameFAQs-style, of his in-game abilities and how to unlock him and a description of his appearance.

<ul>
<li>Of course, describing many of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a>'s abilities and their appearances is not trivial. Their unique abilities ARE encyclopediatic.

<li>Describing them in detail, down to percentage differences and the specific method for unlocking him in each game, is not encyclopedic. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:35, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> (or delete). There is simply not enough information about these CO's to warrant their own articles.
