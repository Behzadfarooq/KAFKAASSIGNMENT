<p>This article is highly biased and unencyclopedic. A small group of users is replacing any occurrence of m/z with m/q, e.g. in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">Mass spectrometry</a>. Google ("m/q mass spectra" vs "m/z mass spectra") and the scientific literature clearly shows that m/z is the most common term. The probably more correct but minority term m/q is already adequately mentioned in the cited articles.

<li>Nobody ever uses z as a symbol for charge. Everyone uses q. And in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> page m/q is explicitly refering to the mass and charge of the formulas in this page.

<dd>I would guess because m/z is what was used in earlier versions of the article. On the sources issue, a journal article where m/q is used is not the same as a journal policy about the use of m/q. The latter is really the sort of thing you need if this is to not be considered original research.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Morganite: already in the very earlyest stage of the article there was the Lorenz formula included, and in this formula q was used, not z. So there was always an inconsistency between the Lorenz formula and the m/z. This is why it was necessary to change to m/q. I mean, we should write consistent articles in Wikipedia, shouldn't we? <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 14:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Journals: many Journals have a policy to allow both, m/q and m/z as mass spectra x-axis labels. However, once you use q in the Lorenz formula most journals would probably insist on using m/q in the text (maybe not in the mass spectra labels) for mass/charge, otherwise it is just inconsistent. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 14:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's obvious from searching that there's a fair amount of inconsistency in the usage of m/q and m/z - many pages seem to be using both.

Trying to merge information on this with <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> might just confuse things further, and this seems to be an issue that should be mentioned somewhere. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorganite_5124.html" title="User:Morganite">Morganite</a> 02:04, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct: m/q is the more original version. m/z was introduced later by mass spec users (no longer designers), probably by analytical chemists that did no longer understand the physiscs behind their instrument.

<li><b>Comment</b> Kehrli: Nobody disputes that m/q is more correct than the way more common m/z. But this is not the place to promote your personal opinion that only m/q should be used - this is an encyclopedia. Please see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for the way how we handle such issues here at Wikipedia. Please stop replacing m/z by m/q, instead write a neutral and short paragraph why m/q is more correct. I don't see a way to keep this biased article, especially under this title and I doubt that the topic deserves more than a short paragraph.

<li>m/z cannot be used in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> page because the formulas in this article would no longer make sense. Please look it up. The m in m/q stands for mass and the q in m/q stands for charge. This is is a very different use of m/q than the one the m/z promoters claim. They claim to use m/z for the mass-to-charge ratio and they claim explicitly that z does not stand for charge and m does not stand for mass. In the formulas, however, there is mass and charge and therefore m/q MUST be used in this case. Otherwise the whole article is no longer consistent. Please, please look it up. Look up the formulas. There is no way you can have z in those formulas. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 22:21, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Cacycle: I agree that this topic does not deserve even a short paragraph. It should be completly clear that m/z is wrong. Unfortunately some people (not me) keep changing m/q into m/z which makes the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> artcle inconsistent. In order to explain this to those people I had to write the page that is now in danger of being deleted. I am happy to delete the article as soon as the m/z is gone, but not before. The m/z makes the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> page inconsistent and therefore cannot be tolerated. <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">Kehrli</a> 22:47, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The IUPAC orange book says abut m/z: "It has long been called the mass-to-charge ratio although m is not the ionic mass nor is z a multiple or the elementary (electronic) charge, e." The "it has long been" indicates that m/z is no longer considered to be the mass-to-charge ratio. And that makes sense since the mass-to-charge ratio is not dimensionless.

To get something accepted in Wikipedia, you shouldn't prove that it is right, you should prove (with references) that it is considered right by many people. So, a reference needs to be provided which says that m/z is wrong. On the technical side, the article starts by claiming that "The concept of the dimensionless mass-to-charge ratio m/z is a misconception". However, as the IAPUC "orange book" says, <i>m</i> is the mass number, defined as "The sum of the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom, ion or molecule" <a href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha12sec2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha12sec2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and <i>z</i> is the charge number, "the total charge on an ion divided by the elementary charge (<i>e</i>)." Both are dimensionless, hence <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> is also dimensionless. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 04:04, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not convinced by your technical arguments. Different symbols are used for the same quantity, and the difference between mass/charge and mass-number/charge-number is just a constant factor, so saying that you can only use the former to report the results of mass spectroscopy goes a bit far for me. But more importantly, for the Wikipedia article to be kept we would need at least a reference which says that m/z is wrong. The references you provide only can be used to build an argument that m/z is wrong. To take your 2+2=5 example, of course I know that it's wrong, but if there is a reliable source which says that 2+2=5 and I can't find one which says that it is not 5, then there is no place in Wikipedia for an article on the "2+2=5 misconception". -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 02:34, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article as it presently stands still does both for about 80% of its length.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are two major ways in which the article does not meet these policies at present that I can see. The first is that you need to link to <b>external references</b> that say that 1) m/z is misleading or incorrect, and 2) that do all of the calculations you're doing in the article, or equivalent calculations, in order to include those conclusions or arguments in the article. Otherwise it's "original research". The second is that in order to be "neutral", the article must represent opinions with coverage proportionate to the degree to which they are present in the associated expert communities. Mass spectrometrists are a community relevant to this article, and they apparently think that using the term "m/z" is fine. As far as I can see no attempt has been made to _count_ the number of scientists saying "m/z is bad, use m/q", but in order to have most of the article be a diatrabe against it, you're going to have to show that the number of scientists vocally opposing the use of "m/z" greatly outnumber the mass spectrometrists. This can't be done by hand-waving ("every scientist _should_ oppose"), but by citing bona fide statements and publications and texts and so forth that specifically state, "this is called 'm/z' in mass spectroscopy, and should not be".</dd>
