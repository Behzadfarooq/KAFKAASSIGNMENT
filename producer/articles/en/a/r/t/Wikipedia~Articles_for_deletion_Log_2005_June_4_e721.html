<p>Subject is daughter of VfD-nominated <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Adams_ca11.html" title="Joe Adams">Joe Adams</a>. An editor with a great affinity for <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_White_%28agitator%29_afad.html" title="William White (agitator)">William White (agitator)</a> is adding articles about White's friends, ex-girlfriend's, and enemies. Jennifer is one of White's exes. Otherwise not notable or verifiable. No sources. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 18:39, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adams is the former webmaster for the national Hammerskin website, Hammerskins.net (check the WayBack machine)</p>
<p>Willmcw is involved with anti-racist groups and is pursuing political motivations for deletions of critical articles. Joe Adams is a public figure. Jennifer Adams's involvement in the Hammerskin Nation is verifiable through news reports of the stabbing of two black men in Columbus, Missouri at a Denny's, and the resulting news coverage. She has also been the subject of public "research reports" on such things.</p>
<p>Willmcw is angry about comments made on the origin of the term "white supremacy" and editing out of material critical of his point fo view, and is pursuing personal political objectives.</p>
<p>Nomination to VfD regarding Joe Adams has been withdrawn by Willmcw.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't found any source for the Denny's stabbing. The only source that I have found of any kind that refers to Jennifer Adams is this page of the <a href="http://www.onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=29" class="external text" title="http://www.onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=29" rel="nofollow">One People's Project</a>. However, in another edit you called their research "wildly inaccurate", so I don't know if we should pay any attention to it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_People%27s_Project&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14691927" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_People%27s_Project&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14691927" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 19:56, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Springfield, Missouri:</dd>
<dd>In June 2001, an African American male was stabbed in a Denny's restaurant because he was in the company of a white female. Another African American male, who was also with <b>a white female</b>, was threatened with a knife. On the night of the incident, Steven A. Heldenbrand was arrested by the Springfield, Missouri Police Department. On February 3, 2004, Mark Thomas Kooms, Michael Shane McCormick and Michael A. Osorio were arrested by the FBI in connection with the incident. Kenneth Francis Johnson was arrested by the Belton, Missouri Police Department on February 2, 2004.</dd>
<dd>On January 21, 2004, all five subjects were indicted federally on one count each of 18, U.S.C. 241. All five subjects ultimately pled guilty to one count of Conspiracy Against Rights (Title 18, USC, Section 241). On August 2, 2004, Osorio and Kooms were sentenced to 51 months in prison while McCormick was sentenced to 24 months in prison. On August 13, 2004, Johnson was sentenced to 51 months in prison and Heldenbrand was sentenced to 32 months in prison.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Adams was detained as a witness in the case, but was later released without charges. She was scheduled to testify twice to the grand jury, refused, and was dropped as a witness when Shane McCormick confessed.</p>
<p>Adams is a key link between a number of white nationalist and Republican Party figures. I think the entry is important on that basis. Plus, she has been involved in publishing the webpage of the Hammerskins and did direct one of their regions, which gives her notariaty on that basis as wel.</p>
<p>However, I guess we can just link the Bill White bio to her father, who is now an official "keep", if people really don't want it.</p>
<p>However, on the yet another hand -- we now have as many hands as Kali -- the people voting in favor of willmcw, in at least one case, are friends and associates. Personal attacks have nothing to do with it, except that willmcw personally targeted all of my profiles because he doesn't like my statements on an article he contributed to. <i>unsigned by user:68.10.35.153</i></p>

<p>Once we got the name right and found a few sources there appears to be enough verifiable information about this person to keep the article.

<p>This appears to have been created for personal reasons, perhaps by an an editor who was personally involved with the subject. Not verifiable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 18:05, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that I did not create the page in question, but merely added to it.</p>
<p>Willmcw appears to be involved with anti-racist groups (Public Eye, Chrip Berlet, anti-LaRouche groups) and has politically motivated reasons for recommending deletion, including a desire to protect one of their sources. It seems wrong to allow biased sources to dominate content on Wikipedia for personal political reasons.</p>
<p>Additional information on this page can be verified by multiple public sources, and I am curious as to what information Willmcw feels is "not verifiable". Specifics would help.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article has grown considerably since nominated. Some of the sources are odd, not all of the material is NPOV, and some non-GFDL photos have appeared, but there does appear to enough verifiable info to make an article worthwhile. For the purposes of voting, I assume that <a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxter2_3a44.html" title="User:Baxter2">User:Baxter2</a> is the same as the unregistered user who posted some information (but no vote) above. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 18:37, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I am that user. Specific criticisms would be appreciated. Why don't you remove your delete from the article?
<ul>
<li>Specific criticisms are best dealt with in the talk page of the article. I don't feel comfortable simply removing the VfD nomination once voting has begun.

<li>I also think this is a really strange listing, because I don't see how anybody could think it's vanity to begin with. Here's the second sentence from the version that was VfDed: "She plays on the hit show "Zoey 101" as the ditzy, boy crazy preteen Nicole Bristow. Alexa has the same birthday as co-star Jamie Lynn Spears." Hit TV show? Co-star Jamie Lynn Spears?

<li>There's nothing to explain. The point was that you should be a little more careful in VfDing things.

<li>Well... that's all the explanation I needed. Yet I did read it, but I hope you understand that a nickleodeon show which started this year is not exactly worldwide famous, neither is Jamie Lynn Spears. Also most of the article was about a 13 year old girl who has a dog and likes to dance... Still I do agree it was a hasty nomination. Lesson learned, I hope.

<li>I disagree with a merger, but I can accept your criterion with some qualifications.

Anything at the sub-unit-of-nation level (e.g., state, province) or above is reasonably noteworthy. --<i><a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarfooz_0c12.html" title="User:Barfooz"><font color="#0355B9"><b>Barfooz</b></font></a></i> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarfooz_1a6c.html" title="User talk:Barfooz"><font size="1" color="#76A67D">(talk)</font></a> 04:37, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

If all members of all state legislatures (and that would imply members of all comparable sub-national legislative bodies in other countries), past and present, are considered encyclopedic, we are talking about adding tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of additional articles to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">(talk)</a> 14:17, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why is non-updating stubs on elected representatives an <i>inherent problem</i>? If information is missing from an article, this "problem" can be "solved" by editing the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> As one way of avoiding the <i>Is this person still in office?

<li>Having worked on the United Kingdom General Election results recently, I disagree. There are an <i>awful lot</i> of losing candidates for national legislatures, I suspect more than you think. See some of the candidates listed in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbury_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_bf8d.html" title="Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)">Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)</a>, for example. Would you really have an encyclopaedia article on someone whose sole claim to fame would be that 49 people (out of 57,399) voted for them in 1993? If the <i>only</i> thing (apart from raw genealogy data) that can be said of someone is that they ran for national-level political office and lost, that doesn't warrant an encyclopaedia biography article — unless, of course, they lost repeatedly in a deliberate and spectacular fashion, and gained notoriety for exactly that. This person ran for state-level office and lost, of course. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:49, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that simply losing an election does not establish notability.

Alas, I was shot down both times. But this time poor Mr. Mitchell seems to be destined for deletion!

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid_Tension_Experiment_571e.html" title="Liquid Tension Experiment">Liquid Tension Experiment</a>. It seems to me clear that the <b>band</b> is notable (64,000+ hits on google for "Liquid Tension Experiment"). The album certainly deserves to be covered and should not be deleted. If you want to merge it with the band page, I guess that is OK but it should really be kept as a separate article and cleaned up with the album format. see <a href="../../../a/l/b/WP%7EALBUMS_d210.html" title="WP:ALBUMS">WP:ALBUMS</a>. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 06:02, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Highly encyclopedic. The Christian Bible is among the world's most influential books. Articles on its content are very relevant. If the content itself needs improvement or POV correction, then it should go through a cleanup process, not the VfD process.

<li>If you think that lists of lists containing redlinks are "good articles", which they are not (You yourself described this as a "framework", effectively no more than a to-do list sub-page of a Wikiproject that has been put into the wrong namespace.), then I suggest that you argue with the authors of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Lists_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists_(stand-alone_lists)#Lists_of_lists</a>, who write "<i>On lists of lists, nonexistant lists should not be included.

<li>I have no argument with the authors of any Wikipedia document, but observe that the document that you cite also incorrectly states that lists of lists are obsolete.

<li><b>Keep</b>, categories full of lists are incredibly ugly (like <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_schools_f0e0.html" title="Category:Lists of schools">Category:Lists of schools</a>, and this list can be edited without using a bot.

<ul>
<li>I find the assertion that the category is "incredibly ugly", whereas the list is (by implication) not, to be rather bizarre, given that the only significant differences between the two right now are the number of columns and the greater breadth of the category. (It's indicative of the way in which the category is better that for months, <i>up until this article was nominated for deletion</i>, it had only 10 states listed, whereas <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_schools_f0e0.html" title="Category:Lists of schools">Category:Lists of schools</a> had grown as new articles were added and had 27 states listed.) Moreover, if people wished to annotate this list of lists, they would have, in the months that this list of lists has lain fallow. They haven't. Instead, they've have in fact added such data to the individual list pages, as you yourself did to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_high_schools_in_Alabama_5958.html" title="List of high schools in Alabama">List of high schools in Alabama</a>. I strongly suspect that readers are more likely to expect a table of the total number of schools in each state somewhere such as <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_States_31b7.html" title="Education in the United States">Education in the United States</a>, or somewhere referenced from there. I think it unlikely that they will think that this list of lists will be the place to look for such a hypothetical table, or even that this list of lists even exists. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:50, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In my opinion, nearly all high schools in the United States fail to qualify for mention on WP for lack of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I see nothing wrong with the list, one advantage of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia/almanac is that we don't have space contraints.

<li>Interestingly, that's the same question sometimes asked by the writers of vanity or neologism pages. Now ask: Where's the benefit in it?

<li>So let me get this straight: your point is that if we follow the rules concerning vanity articles then my comments are irrelevant? I suppose if it actually <i>were</i> a vanity article...the fact is that many school district articles are beginning to appear in Wikipedia. This is a great crossreference list. It actually is serving a niche purpose.

<li>No. The first point is that "Where is the harm in it?" is the question often asked by those who don't understand that what we are writing here is an encyclopaedia.

The fact that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_schools_f0e0.html" title="Category:Lists of schools">Category:Lists of schools</a> listed all of the school list articles whilst this article did not speaks for itself. If you are going to assert that this list "serves a niche purpose", please <i>answer the question</i>. <i>What</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists">purpose of lists</a> does this list of lists (in the main article namespace) fulfil? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:22, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not actively being maintained? I think we need to delete half of the articles on Wikipedia then. That is not a criteria for deletion. The purpose is a place for the lists to be linked to (for instance, <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_States_31b7.html" title="Education in the United States">Education in the United States</a> can't link to each list, but this list of lists <i>is</i> relevant to the article; a category is unlikely to be found by someone not familiar with Wikipedia, making it a less than ideal choice.--<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaryathegreat_16dd.html" title="User:Naryathegreat">naryathegreat</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENaryathegreat_faa2.html" title="User talk:Naryathegreat">(talk)</a> 21:44, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not actively being maintained, whilst the pre-existing category of lists, being a category, is being <i>automatically</i> maintained by the software. And again you state a purpose for this list that the pre-existing category can, and does, accomplish. Are you under some confused misapprehension that <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_States_31b7.html" title="Education in the United States">Education in the United States</a> cannot link to a category page? It most certainly can, and does. Furthermore categories can be easily found if editors don't use your brand of circular logic: "We don't link to categories, therefore categories cannot be easily found, therefore we don't link to categories.". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:44, 2005 Jun 9 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh yes, and its maintained so well. I wonder why so many of the lists fall under "U"? Maybe I'm just seeing things then. Automation is not the key. Then there's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Australia_3773.html" title="List of schools in Australia">List of schools in Australia</a>, which is under "*".

<ul>
<li>Very effective and organized with the knowledge that there are many countries in the world, even. The United States lists of schools fall under "U" because "United States" (and hence "United States, Arkansas", for example) begins with "U". Did you think that the United States was the only country that had schools? You make my point for me. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:59, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately nobody's first instinct is to look for <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> under "U". It isn't a list by country and then states, it is <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_schools_f0e0.html" title="Category:Lists of schools">Category:Lists of schools</a>. Nothing in the title says by country. And you still can't explain why Australia is under "*" <i>(edit: Oh, and Hong Kong is under "H", and Hong Kong is a city)</i>. It's okay, but it leaves the impression of disorganization. And yes I understand the different country lists. Also, on a side note, what is the automative feature called that does this automatically?--<a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaryathegreat_16dd.html" title="User:Naryathegreat">naryathegreat</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENaryathegreat_faa2.html" title="User talk:Naryathegreat">(talk)</a> 02:15, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know how to vote on this thing, but Nicholas Stern did not write this. I'm not exactly sure how to prove that, but there are plenty of outsider artists that have no albums that would'nt be found on either of those sites you mentioned. I was adding this to the growing list of outsider artists, not trying to promote someone, whom I'm assuming doesnt even wan't to do music anymore. If you were to delete this article on those grounds, it would only be fair that you delete Shooby Taylor as well. Only it can basically be proven that his was not a vanity page as he is dead. Also I think you would have better luck in the searches if you looked up: Nicholas Stern+Slapshot Rock as this was his most recognized song. (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>I only get 7 hits on the above search. Considering that one of them calls him "not-so-famous", it's still a question of notability. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 22:06, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again however fame is relative. He is famous in the outsider world as is <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooby_Taylor_2e1b.html" title="Shooby Taylor">Shooby Taylor</a> but he obviously isnt on MTV. I did'nt know that fame was the prerequisite for being on Wikipedia. After all if everything on here was famous, there would be no point in posting something. (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>But Shooby Taylor gets thousands of hits when you search on his name. Yes, fame is relative. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 22:48, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Shooby was included in the first wave of Outsider interest sparked by Irwin Chusid's book "The key of Z". I guess if we're talking amount of hits on websites to justify being on Wikipedia, whoever is typing has got me beat, however I don't see how this justifies not keeping an article on especially from the prior reasoning of "not having an album" which has now been replaced by "Does not have a lot of hits when searched for". I may have misunderstood but were you being sarcastic when you reitterated that fame is relative? (comment by <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubin_7cd2.html" title="User:Aubin">Aubin</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't being sarcastic, I was just pointing out a comparison between the two. All I'm sayingn is that Shooby Taylor seems more notable. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> has some guidelines on notability for musicians. To me, it seems like Shooby passes. Nicholas Stern doesn't. (This is all just my opinion, of course) By the way, sign your comments with four tildes (this char: ~). --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11">Etacar11</a> 23:04, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I mean it would be really hard for Shooby Taylor to legitimately live up to those standards with the exceptions of websites. Nicholas Stern was at one point featured prominently amongst a lot of the outsider pages such as "worst of the worst" and "Incorrect Music" and is still featured in the Outsider Music Group. I mean if this is going to be a standard, you have to put up notice that says "You must have X amount of hits in order to qualify to be on Wikipedia before you can post." Also would it make a difference in fame if I mentioned the fact that Steve Pascuito did some sidework on some 90's television shows as a stand-in and extra? Which is the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del</b>, sort of. This is overdue to be called, and no one has mentioned that the article was created by removing long-standing content on the real Nicholas Stern, and turning his lks into false lks. It doesn't seem worth going thru the motions of deleting just to restore the old one, so i am calling this VfD &amp; construing the result as "remove all mention of the non-notable one, with prejudice, and revert to the version that made no mention of him." ("With prejudice" means in this case that any article restoring essentially the same content under a different title would be speedy-deletable.)</li>

<li>no, it shouldnt. if you submit to IMDb and wikipedia at the same time, the submission will display here instantly, but will have to wait to be reviewed by an editor at IMDb, which sometimes takes several weeks. but if he was submitted to IMDb, that submission would have to include names of his films, which this article doesnt yet do. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 10:22, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Most of the Google hits are either a few bloggers saying "huh?" or things that you seem to have posted yourself to open directories.

<p>The only member of this purported church appears to be Marc Perkel. The only evidence of its existence stems from that same, single, central source, either from his own vast flood of web log postings and discussion forum contributions, or from other people simply citing the several web sites that he created and owns (<a href="http://perkel.com./" class="external text" title="http://perkel.com./" rel="nofollow">perkel.com</a>, <a href="http://churchofreality.org./" class="external text" title="http://churchofreality.org./" rel="nofollow">churchofreality.org</a>, and <a href="http://bartcop.com./" class="external text" title="http://bartcop.com./" rel="nofollow">bartcop.com</a>, for starters). Marc Perkel doesn't seem to be lacking the ability to create his own soapboxes. Looking at the discussions that Tommynchucky points to above (where the tag team is exactly the same as it is here), people seem to be ignoring what he cries from atop them, rather than joining his purported church. The other two purported members of the purported church's "Council of Realists" are strangely quiet about the entire thing, too. One doesn't even need to read the "Tithing" section of the purported church's "Fundamental Concepts", where it says "<i>I am a person who has unusual mental talents. I think science should study me to see what it is about me that gives me my unusual mental abilities.</i>" to know that this is a religion of 1 adherent.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand the arguments for deletion. They are primarily "vanity" and lack of "notability". It seems that the argument from vanity would imply that if I, someone who is on the emailing list for the church, wrote this thing then it wouldnt be vain and it would be acceptable. And the argument from notability would imply some objective standard of notability, which there is not. Those arguing from notability are just declaring their own ignorance. And those arguing from vanity are just arguing their own contempt. It is just an article about a very real existing church, one that is obtaining IRS status, and one that has a very sympathetic membership. Delete it now, it will be back later, perhaps written by someone notable and not so vain.By the way I am not a "sockpuppet" but I am a new user with no notoriety. And I only know this this article because I am on the CoR mailing list, which says something about how known it is.--Asklocus 02:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>It looks like the Universist Movement is getting the same sentiment for this entry as this one. They have a discussion <a href="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> with references. They are more notable than the CoR and have gotten publicity in a relatively short period of time. I guess even <a href="http://universist.org/nytimes121204.htm" class="external text" title="http://universist.org/nytimes121204.htm" rel="nofollow">an article</a> in the New York Times is still not good enough. Also interestingly enough there is an entry for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">Bright</a> which was started in 2003, and they seem less notable then the Universists. There is overlap in principles in these groups. What is notable is that Starblind and other made the allegation of sockpuppetry without providing any evidence in these talk pages Talk:Universism, Talk:Universist_Movement, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_Universist_Movement_666c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion/Universist Movement">Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion/Universist_Movement</a> -- Tommynchucky June 05, 2005 1:45AM EST</li>

<dd>Tommynchucky, If you are not a sockpuppet — and I see no proof that you are — then I'm sorry, and I apologize on behalf of Wikipedia, for those who are calling you one. For the record, I don't see Starblind (explicitly) calling you a sockpuppet, it was user Duncharris, who did that, although others have (naturally enough) expressed their suspicions about a new user with no previous edits. Nevertheless, it is a well-respected Wikipedian practice to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, and we may have fallen short of that here. In any case, as Starblind pointed out it is our policy to listen and consider the comments of new users, but, in our efforts to reach a consensus, we sometimes give less weight to their votes. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 15:43, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a new term and it is totally valid. The Church of Reality is a new religion and it has some new original concepts that don't exist in other faiths.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because an article is too long or not wikified is no reason to delete it.

</li>
<li><b>(Speedy) delete</b>. Even if it was a real town called Springfield, the article fails to mention the state, or even the country it's in. Also, listing streets doesn't provide the reader with any useful information when their locational relationsship isn't apparent. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:59, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I speedied it because there really was no context. Tony Sidaway then restored, then inserted the line about it being streets in the Simpsons Springfield, so obviously then it didn't qualify. I still stand by my original decision to speedy it as it was. That being said, I still say it should be <b>Deleted</b> as it is a simple listing and provides no useful information aside from that. It's not even good enough to qualify as cruft. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 16:08, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. My thought here is that the Springfield article is long enough. I would guess that most people looking at the Springfield article are not necessarily going to want to see the names of all of the streets. If the text is going to eat up a valuable 700 valuable bytes on the server, why load it every time someone looks at the Springfield article.

<p>Everything in this world is being "criticised", and we don't need articles on that. Besides, as this article is now, and as it has been for quite some time, it's just a collection of links. The intro is the only thing that isn't, and I say that part is redundant and being covered elsewhere. I'm only surprised this hasen't been up for deletion before. I say it's time. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 13:36, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comments</b> if this is merged into Islam, as has now been done, then it can't be deleted for copyright reasons. In theory this is a legitimate topic and there is still no section of criticism of Islam in the Islam article, however nobody seems willing to write decent material in anything like NPOV so I'm not going to actively oppose this deletion. Until there is material to censor, nobody can cry censorship.

This article is nothing about a long non-encyclopedic essay on why the creators of Star Trek don't have gay characters. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigi30_dfff.html" title="User:Luigi30">User:Luigi30</a> (<a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuigi30_5295.html" title="User talk:Luigi30">Ταλκ</a>) 17:45, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Category:Gay icons and other homosexuality-related articles aren't really part of this discussion. The article needs some editing--it is not unbiased, but at the same time seems to be describing a real debate, and has sources to back at least some of this up. I'm not even sure it needs a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} tag, so I'm voting <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemi_6641.html" title="User:Demi">Demi</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemi_ab67.html" title="User talk:Demi">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demi_a1b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demi">C</a></sub> 18:11, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> that is a debate that I already encountered years and years ago, and this is not an essay, but a summary of all the related things, both in the series and behind the screen. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 18:18, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I say that almost reluctantly, because it's a long, thorough, well-written and presumably well-researched article. However, the whole thing could basically be summarized by "Star Trek doesn't have any gay characters" though it takes quite a few paragraphs to get there. Much of the padding material consists of speculation and descriptions of characters who kinda-sorta might have been gay. At best, it's a well-intentioned article which really needs to document its sources better. At worst, it veers dangerously close to libel: "<i>Some fans feel that...Berman and Paramount of selling out the progressive Roddenberry dream in favor of contemporary bigotry and a hypocritical commercial cop-out.</i>" See also <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">Weasel words</a>. I definitely feel this is an interesting subject and should be posted and discussed somewhere, but isn't an encyclopedic topic. If it absolutely must stay, I suggest squeezing it down into a paragraph or two and putting it in one of the main Trek articles or into a GLBT in culture article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:19, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rewrite somewhat as the insertion of sections looks somewhat forced in the flow of the text, and they should be able to be read out of order. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 19:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Liberally condense and <b>Merge</b>. There's not much meat to this article, and most of it is original research couched in language like "some fans believe...", etc. This whole concept could easily be summarized in a paragraph or section in one of the main Star Trek articles, such as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_and_Star_Trek_1149.html" title="Society and Star Trek">Society and Star Trek</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 20:12, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but revise to remove original research and filter for possible POV.

<li>An interesting topic, and a fairly unbiased approach.

<li>I am going to have a section on the Star Trek comic books/novels and one on the video games. Both are brief.

<li>Many schools do educate young children. This one happens to be a complex of two schools (infant and junior) that occupy the same premises and educate children up to age 11. There is a nursery, but what of it? How does this affect the fact that it educates 11-year-olds? Should a university that shares premises with a kindergarten be deletable? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:59, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

"Verifiable and NPOV" are not our sole criteria. In every case so far, people espousing this rationale have actually turned out to have a different rationale when pressed. (See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Wikimedia_In_Memoriam_9_11_b709.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wikimedia In Memoriam 9/11">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wikimedia In Memoriam 9/11</a>, for example.)

Firstly, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a>. Secondly, I believe schools are encyclopedic.

<li>With respect, I think you only needed to point out that the article was "verifiable, NPOV and about a school".&#160;:) Wikipedia hasn't deleted a single school in over seventy nominations for deletion, and looking at the 25-or-so pending discussions I don't think that's about to change soon. I have no idea why anyone would want to vote on a number article; presumably people who are interested in numbers know which ones they think are interesting and which not. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:05, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Allow</b> The show actually did exist and I watched it several times (5) when it aired earlier this year. It was a live call-in show and I did call in several times. Though it was called a comedy hour the hosts (David and Rhyanne) did reserve time for the serious dicussion of the topics they were ridiculing during their episode, which did include abortion (they had some whack-o pro-life nut on) and suicide (it just happened to be some angsty kid for this one). Rhyanne did go on to be part of several other local shows as a guest for months following and another season of the show is alloted for next season's line up according to Comcast. They hosts (David and Rhyanne) tried several times during the season to get big name politicians from the area on such as (Gov.) Mayor Wilder. It would be good to see an article like this to remain on Wikipedia for it makes the site feel like a place where one can go to find knowledge even on one's own community.

<p>I'm not certain, but I think this is either a fantasy or a hoax.

<li><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_state.html" title="Metropolitan state">metropolitan state</a> redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colony</a>. I think that <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a> is referring to the first definition given, namely a mother country in contrast to its colonies. If that is the case, then, yes, in the sense of an "origin country" motherland does have this meaning. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:55, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)

<li>Are you sure that a son of a British colonel born and brought up in India would call Misty Albion his motherland? (I am not arguing here, I just want to confirm the usage). Of course, Britain is the motherland for the colonel himself; but in most generic meaning, rather than as a term to refer to a state that owns the colony, IMO. Once again, I don't see this usage in the dictionaries on my bookshelf. The same colonel may be recruited to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Legion_62cb.html" title="Foreign Legion">Foreign Legion</a> and fight in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo.html" title="Congo">Congo</a>, but he will not refer to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> as Motherland while sitting in <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopoldville.html" title="Leopoldville">Leopoldville</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:05, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's a good question. I don't know offhand. Finding quotations to demonstrate exact real-world use is something that Wiktionary will have to do, now that the article has been transwikied.

The bulk of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motherland.html" title="Motherland">motherland</a> is translations and synonyms, which Wiktionary will deal with, leaving not very much encyclopaedia content at all.

<dd>Well, how do you know the name is un-notable as I had no chance to complete it? Yours truly, the author-to-be, would not appear in it. Paul Riedesel, Ph.D.
<dl>
<dd>I accept your point. I see that you have just added further info to the article, and it is clear there are historical connections, which <i>perhaps</i> do merit a Wikipedia entry. Still not entirely convinced about creating an article on your own surname, though, however notable, and Wikipedia is not a genealogy site for you to post family history, however detailed or interesting. It's nothing personal - if you view the page history you'll note I even wikified the original version of the article for you! Personally, I think it would be better suited to your own user page, but we'll see other Wikipedians valued comments and how the vote works out... <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 22:05, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I allowed time for the article to grow - I watched the article and commented when further info was added to the page. However, I maintain that the information is promotion of the user's surname (and their website, linked at the end of the article). Yes its accurate, detailed, and maybe even interesting, but I'm not sure it is what Wikipedia should be about. It sets a huge precedent for people with numerous surnames to start generating articles - plenty of people know their family history these days. Are we now saying that providing there was nobility somewhere in the past, such genealogy articles are wanted? <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 07:13, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi, i am the author of one of the below "keep" comments. i would like to adress the sock puppets accusation... im not sure what exactly sock puppets means, but i guess it's something to do with all the votes being from the one person? you may find with a little research, perhaps contact the institution mentioned on the ian hedger page (st. bede's college, mentone, victoria, australia), that many of these comments come from students. they have heard about the page through word of mouth, and are supporting the <b>TRUE</b> story about their friend/acquantance. You may also find that the two entries from the same IP adress are entries from step brothers, using two computers on the same network. I urge that these facts be considered before this page is dismissed as a hoax or a joke. Before dismissing this, someone please do some research.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> The Ian Hedger case is very much a true one, I was once a friend of this tortured soul back in '98. he was a great person when i knew him, full of life, with a smile that could melt an iceberg. it is unfortunate that we have not crossed paths since his departure from our youth group, because he was one of the only people i knew that could make a man with my condition feel normal again. he will be in my heart for eternity. - D.M.Wenckowski - <i>anon vote by User:211.28.164.142, the user's second vote on this page, so struck through.</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't believe this story is being considered for deletion. I think one will find over the next few years a number of websites and articles being made in devotion to this story. The myths surrounding this case are simply untrue and unjustified. A depressed boy goes missing, and immediately people begin pawning off murders onto him. The chances of the boy still being alive are virtually zero, and it is my belief that he has found a happier place. Ian Hedger must not be forgotten, and I hope anyone who tries to remove this tribute to him, or deface it, suffers a similar fate. - Brother Paul Kenjamin, F.S.C. - <i>anon vote by User:203.31.184.154 - only three edits to Wikipedia are on this VFD and the page.</i></li>

Second, there is the precedent set by the many, many other first name disambiguation pages on Wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron.html" title="Aaron">Aaron</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Ada.html" title="Ada">Ada</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice.html" title="Alice">Alice</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia.html" title="Alicia">Alicia</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison.html" title="Alison">Alison</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alva.html" title="Alva">Alva</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin.html" title="Alvin">Alvin</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda.html" title="Amanda">Amanda</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy.html" title="Amy">Amy</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashton.html" title="Ashton">Ashton</a>, and those are just the first names I can think of off the top of my head. Compare with articles like <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael.html" title="Michael">Michael</a> which have long lists of people with that first name. Third, the list is expandable: there are no doubt more encyclopedic people named Alessandra and probably places named Alessandra as well. Fourth, the <i>article</i> is expandable, by giving the history/entymology/source of the name Alessandra. Fifth, it's a <i>disambiguation</i> page. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, so how is this hurting the project? —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">talk</a>) 12:55, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are mising the point. Disambig pages are to list <b>identical</b> terms. Ada contains list that are known as "Ada". The same is with <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Aaron (disambiguation)">Aaron (disambiguation)</a>. If some list hase something else, it mst be cleaned up. Some of these lists come from eraly days of wikipedia, when the role of disambig pages was not very clearly understood and formulated. If you wasnt an "expandable" articles, with explanations, then traditionally the proper name would be "List of ....". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You and xe don't get it. The <i>etymology</i> of the name belongs in a <i>dictionary</i>, i.e. in Wiktionary in the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary_Appendix:First_names" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary_Appendix:First_names">Wiktionary appendix on first names</a>.

They are name disambiguations for encyclopaedia articles for people, places, and things <i>known solely by that name</i> (although <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice.html" title="Alice">Alice</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alicia.html" title="Alicia">Alicia</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael.html" title="Michael">Michael</a> are in need of some serious trimming because they also "disambiguate" between things that aren't actually ambiguous in the first place) and that would be at that title were it not for one another. (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael.html" title="Michael">Michael</a> has a whole list of kings and emperors known solely by that given name, for example.)

<li><b>Delete</b> in an imperative way with these contents. If a person is known <i>only</i> as Alessandra (and, I'd say, its variants), then that person should be disambiguated. However, "people who have this first name" is utterly absurd. First name dabs are <b>not</b> "List of" articles in disguise, and one of the few things I would edit war over is precisely that. It's one thing to have <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis.html" title="Elvis">Elvis</a> disambiguate Elvis Presley and Elvis of Montfort or Elvis of Hippo, because he is known by that name exclusively (Madonna is the better example, of course), but it's quite another to have "yuk yuk all the people named Bob" clobbering the valid disambig of an article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:38, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So who decides? This is a dab page specifically because two people were edit warring over a redirect.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The examples Lowellian made makes my point. Disambigs for names are not used for people's first names unless they have no given or widely known last name.

<p><i>Jonathan Sharpe</i> gets no google hits related to this article. The article states that Sharpe is "cited" in a book by Margaret Cruikshank, entitled <i>The Gay and Lesbian Liberation Movement</i>. Margaret is real and so is the book, but the full text search engine provided by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415906482/qid=1117925683/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4891611-8779005?v=glance&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415906482/qid=1117925683/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4891611-8779005?v=glance&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">amazon.com</a> turns up no references to Sharpe in the work.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, the term is formally used in the names of sports meets held by the three schools.

As I mentioned before on <a href="../../../h/y/p/Talk%7EHYP_%28universities%29_b13f.html" title="Talk:HYP (universities)">Talk:HYP (universities)</a>, "<code>PHY AND (Princeton OR Harvard OR Yale)</code>" only returns as many results as it does because PHY is an abbreviation for "physics" that is often used in course catalog names. As for "<code>HSM AND (Harvard OR Stanford OR MIT)</code>", the problem is that the search is skewed by German language results ("mit" in the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a> means "with"). If you restrict to English-language sites, then "<code>HSM AND (Harvard OR Stanford OR MIT)</code>" returns 27,300 results (a mere 6% of the 474,000 in all languages), while "<code>HYP AND (Harvard OR Princeton OR Yale)</code>" still returns 30,100 results (as compared to 32,800 in all languages). —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">talk</a>) 12:40, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, and as I mentioned just above, the reason that <b>HYP</b> returns results is because <b>Hyp</b> is a common prefix and abbreviation in the English language. If it's a single word or abbreviation, and it's not even recognized by the dictionary, then it's not enough of a real term to warrant an encyclopedic entry. <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenster_73ff.html" title="User:Fenster">Fenster</a> 08:39, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this one I'd keep as opposed to others that have been previously debated. HYP is a subset of the ivy league that is a commonly used term, especially among sports within the three. Harvard, Yale or Princeton couldn't don't care at all whether they are number one in the ivy league--they just want to beat each other. (Although, Yale couldn't give a shit about Princeton.) Take a look at the Yale athletics site: "HYP champions," it will say (some years). <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolGuy_a681.html" title="User:CoolGuy">CoolGuy</a> 03:02, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I've changed my mind. Both of those articles (and also HYPSM and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyps.html" title="Hyps">hyps</a>) should redirect to this article, wherever it ends up. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> makes a good point that this article isn't really about the initialism. Wiktionary can (and now does) handle the initialisms. This article is about the facts that a small group of universities is generally regarded as being distinguished from all of the rest and that that group is considered as a unit. (These facts are hardly unique to the United States, either. They are true for several countries.) The problem, as <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkalai</a> says here and as <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> says in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_HYPSMC_9614.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/HYPSMC">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/HYPSMC</a> when talking about having articles for all of the combinations of letters, is the name of this article. <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyps.html" title="Hyps">hyps</a>, HYPS, HYPSM, HYPSMC, <i>and this article</i> are all basically POV forks of a single article dealing with the single concept of a small group of institutions. When it comes to admissions, people don't agree <i>which</i> universities are generally regarded to be in the group, and <i>in what order</i> to rank them within the group. There's a perfectly fine encyclopaedia article to be had here, <i>about these very things</i>. As per the NPOV, Wikipedia should stay out of the argument, though. <i>All</i> of these articles should be redirects to a single article with a neutral title, which I suggest this one be <b>Rename</b>d to. Unfortunately, I suspect that the name is going to be cumbersome, and nothing springs to mind that isn't problematic. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Yale-Princeton_d9c5.html" title="Harvard-Yale-Princeton">Harvard-Yale-Princeton</a> has the same problem as the other titles of being too definite and too ordered. Big Three universities is out because (as shown by this rash of little articles, and by real-world usage) people don't even agree that there are solely three universities in the group. Something like Highest ranked universities in the United States probably encompasses too broad a scope. Elite universities in the United States is just as controversial a title as these initialisms are. A merger into <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> ignores the fact that this isn't quite the same thing; some people including at least two non-Ivy institutions in the group, and equally excluding some of the Ivy institutions. <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_admissions_and_ranking_shorthands_in_the_United_States_e81c.html" title="College admissions and ranking shorthands in the United States">College admissions and ranking shorthands in the United States</a> might work, although that would involve factoring out the three-letter athletic meets into a separate article (for which <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Yale-Princeton_d9c5.html" title="Harvard-Yale-Princeton">Harvard-Yale-Princeton</a> is a good candidate) and disambiguating more finely between the meets and the admissions shorthands at <a href="../../../h/y/p/HYP_857f.html" title="HYP">HYP</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:09, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Uncle, you agree with Geogre, but while Geogre votes keep, he/she adds "there is a limited amount to say about the [acronym] qua [acronym]". Meanwhile, all I've learnt is that the term bunches together three universities for somewhat self-congratulatory, PR purposes: if they're "selective", this must be qualified by consideration of "legacy" dullards, etc. As you've pointed out, there are plenty of these acronyms; I say, let those people who are interested google for them, and let the snobs and PR industry produce pages for them. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:07, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clarification: I take it as our mission to NPOV to ask only that it be verifiably in use and potentially needed to answer a researcher's question, so I voted keep. The reason is that I think that HYP ain't no great thing, myself (how hard is it to turn out great scholars when you only accept people who need no teaching in the first place?), but the effective use of this hype is sufficient to have a smallish article that answers the need of potential researchers. If the article is safely away from other "hyp" lemmae, I can't object or see that it violates deletion policy. So, even though I don't think it's a good <i>idea,</i> I have to presumptively keep. (Besides, Cornell is kicking their rears in most fields, and Stanford and CalTech do, too, and the old sisters of the south are nipping at their heels.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:29, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is a real abbreviation that has been in common use for at least half a century.

The present article on <a href="../../../h/y/p/HYP_857f.html" title="HYP">HYP</a> isn't very good. Nevertheless, it is quite conceivable that someone might encountered the abbreviation somewhere and look it up for an explanation.

<li>Comment: It says "This FAQ may be reproduced if it is referenced as the Anti-Aging Skincare FAQ, version 4.1, posted to alt.skincare.", but that doesn't seem to fall under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:18, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
