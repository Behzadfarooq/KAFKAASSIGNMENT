<p>I've noticed that Angel Carter has her own article. What has she done to derserve one. I believe you all have it out for this artist and i think you all should be reported. And for the record, I am not brooke. Sorry I just work on her site</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment:</b> Personally, I wasn't aware of the existence of Angel Carter before you pointed the article out for me, and the same goes for CrystalCherry until I saw the this AFD. Anyway, as they are two similar artists, the easiest thing to do is to search google for "ChrystalCherry" and "Angel Carter"...and the results: 605 for the ChrystalCherry, and 10.100 for Angel Carter.</dd>
<dd>This is not to say that Angel Carter isn't to be deleted, but it clearly shows a big difference between the two! <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 16:30, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's nothing personal. CrystalCherry does not meet Wikipedia's guidelines for inclusion. Most, if not all of the relevant Google hits for 'CrystalCherry' are either her own pages, her postings on bandamp.com, or mirrors of the Wikipedia article on various other sites. As I have previously mentioned, there is no reference to her on allmusic.com, her records are not available for sale at amazon.com (in fact, I am unable to find a single site online that sells them) and even her own label's site has no mention of her. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 17:23, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I don't think you get it. Angel Carter - whatever level of popularity she has achieved or not - is an actual artist in the public eye acknowledged by the media and by many internet sites. We can debate if she is worth a Wiki entry or not, certainly - maybe she doesn't - I don't really care. The point here - and the difference here is that "CrystalCherry" does not show up in ANY media publications, web sites, etc. that do not come from either A. Wikipedia or B. her own official website. None of the info - i.e. singles, chart listing, and especially the crap like "feuds" can be confirmed anywhere else on the net. Simply, no sites have this information or any information about this person. Cherry bought herself a domain name, made an official site pretaining to being a singer, then created a Wiki entry for herself matching the same info. Since her name is common enough and not something weird, it would show up in enough web searches so people actually think she has some sort of a career. The reason this should be deleted right this second is not that this person is not really that well-known an artist - the reason is that she doesn't have a music career at all. I am going to delete as much of her entry now as I can - again - until someone provides me with a link proving it to be true - and I don't mean her official websites or sub-versions of Wiki. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 17:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You went on and on about this artist's career isnt real, i have found not only a site that houses her music. <a href="http://music.lulu.com/content/176923" class="external free" title="http://music.lulu.com/content/176923" rel="nofollow">http://music.lulu.com/content/176923</a> I doubt you undestand what an indy artist must go through. For example can you find any music on stayefish on Amazon? No, you can't must indy artist have issues with there releasing of music. Her fueds are word of mouth, the hacking maybe a matter of dispute. However her music is easy to find if you actually look. Angel Carter is only known because she is related to a backstreet boy. Other than that, she is famous for doing nothing. This is personal, i can tell when anyone write the hateful and all around things like you all have been doing. Her chart status however, i will admit, i can source, but i know for a fact she have been getting radio time. Along with the fact "CrystalCherry" can be confused with "Crystal Cherry" so try looking under both. Don't condem just because you have a personal vendetta. It's unprofessional. Keep that in mind.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter why Angel Carter is known - the point is that she is known for whichever reason and all the info on her Wiki entry can be confirmed in other sources. It doesn't matter what an indy artist must go through or not - the point is Wikipedia is not and should not be free advertising for a person that no other websites confirm even exists. The Lulu site you linked me to has a record by publisher "Brooke Burns" - not surprising - it's an independent website and an independent record. The release date, according to Wikipedia - is October 31st, 2005 - and yet there's a review up at Lulu. None of the information that would make this article relevant can be confirmed in any good source on the internet. If, for example, the record due to be released on Oct. 31st is a hit and is reported on by media sources - then this person can have an entry. Otherwise there is a big media void here - and I've searched and cross-checked a large amount of this information - and it simply can not be proven to be true.

There's a small section in the bottom "Crystal Cherry" - written by CrystalCherry, it says "Audience: 3". The little note by that "CrystalChery" box says "Web Note: If you want to share your mp3 file and your story, log in a add your performance... To experience the performances already posted"". That's exactly what Cherry did.

<li><s>Funny how I searched CrystalCherry's lyrics "When I'm a sparrow in winter" from "Crystal Clear" on Google. What do I get? <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jaci_Velasquez_e33f.html" title="Jaci Velasquez">Jaci Velasquez</a> lyrics! Same, exact lyrics. Is CrystalCherry plagiarizing her then? Maybe it's a cover but an upcoming artist who wants to be notable should be original, the least. Absolutely no mention of Velasquez was present in any site I've searched except <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=crystalcherry+jaci+velasquez&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&amp;q=crystalcherry+jaci+velasquez&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (which doesn't even show, believe it or not) If this is the case, does this girl "CrystalCherry" even have the guts to give credit where credit is due? Is it so hard to say that you're doing a cover of Jaci Velasquez? It isn't an original composition by CrystalCherry anyway. Oh, and get this. The name of CrystalCherry's and Jaci's album is exactly the same, except that CrystalCherry's has a "revisited" in one of them. How uncreative, right?</s> Even if this "artist" succeeds some distant future in 80 years time, I doubt she'll last if all she ever does is covers by other artists.

<p>I created this article, (the original) and it is not only but accurrate. I find it hurtful that you would call my daughter and I liars. You have every excuse for why she is "invented" but has it ever crept into you judgemental minds that it is all true. She is more than notable, she is extrodinary. You should all be ashamed of how you are doing her, she has never disrespected you, though you treat her like trash.</p>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The contents of articles in Wikipedia must be written from a neutral-point-of-view, and also must be verifiable from other sources, excluding the subjects own website/blog. As it is not possible to verify most of the information in the article, it does not conform to <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, and as the article does not pass any of the criterias listed in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> it is to be deleted. This might seem cynical if you are new to Wikipedia, but a necessity in order to avoid Wikipedia from being filled up with articles about unknown/irrelevant subjects <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjelleklang_549f.html" title="User:Bjelleklang">Bjelleklang</a> - <a href="../../../b/j/e/User_talk%7EBjelleklang_ea22.html" title="User talk:Bjelleklang">talk</a> 22:02, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> What you are talking about, AnnieB, is called "original research" - which isn't allowed on Wikipedia. The information may well be true - but the problem is we can't confirm any part of it. Like in the legal profession - you must not only be right, but be able to proove you are right. In this case, you need media publications, articles, etc. not personally submitted by the subject of this article (the two sites - Luna and the Wiccan one - contain info that was submitted by Cherry herself). <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 03:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment.</b> With respect to your comment, AnnieB, no one was lying and no one called Brooke a liar. You're saying that she is extraordinary, so we believe you, although you ARE her mother after all, and exaggerations are normal since offsprings are the pride of all parents. But notable? Not just yet. You know what's missing, Mrs Burns? External sources. Articles need to be cross-referenced. Even though an article could be 100% true, without external sources (those who aren't affiliated with CrystalCherry), the article <b>cannot be proven</b> to be true. Why don't you supply us sources that are reliable, and aren't created by CrystalCherry herself? For once, when I search for "Brooke Anne Burns" or "CrystalCherry", I would love for another website to be result #1 instead of Wikipedia. I also understand your daughter's ego might have been bruised by all this, but please do understand, we're just trying to do what needs to be done. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlen_660b.html" title="User:Kahlen">Kahlen</a> 09:49, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I doubt my daughter ego is buised at all. I know many things, for one, that information released via the internet was not released by her, Brooke isn't very computer shavy, though she would like to believe so. Another thing, she is not to be blamed for the problem, had you read the article, you would know, when her first album was released she went by Brooke, not CrystalCherry. Another thing to think about is the spelling of her name, on many occassions, they spelled it "Crystal Cherry" so take that into consideration. [<a href="http://www.idnmusic.com/bands/crystalcherry.html" class="external text" title="http://www.idnmusic.com/bands/crystalcherry.html" rel="nofollow">IDN Profile</a>] Another thing you have to think about, the "feuds" well, what moron would pick Trevor Guthrie as an enemy, who the hell knows him anyhow besides a few 18+ kids who have very good memory. The Hacking is obvious, the picture are over the net. Another reason i believe that there's an issue is because of the death, which isnt't her fault. Blame David for that one. I am looking for articles, and when i get something that you feel is "official" then i will email you or whatever. But do not condem my daughter, she has yet to do anything to you -AnnieB</p>

<dd>You know what's still bothering me? The fact that the picture of the kiss between your daughter and Aaron Carter is still on the website <a href="http://www.crystalcherryonline.tk" class="external text" title="http://www.crystalcherryonline.tk" rel="nofollow">crystalcherryonline</a>. Your daughter stated she was embarrassed of the picture being leaked, yet it's still on her website. It just makes no sense. Does she WANT to be embarrassed? If you are not responsible of running the website, you can always inform the webmaster to kindly take it down to prevent your daughter from experiencing furthur humiliation.<a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlen_660b.html" title="User:Kahlen">Kahlen</a> 04:59, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is annoying. I have so many questions I don't know where to start. Like, say, why give us a link to yet another copy-and-paste version of the exact same insipidly-written biography from her official site? Why spell it "Pouter Rican"? Is that through some geniune error or does someone out there really believe that's the way human beings spell Puerto Rican? Why keep making statements that lead me to believe you think Burns' eligibility to be listed here depends on whether or not she has "done something to us" or not? And if that's the way the system works here, then why do people like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Phil_5086.html" title="Dr. Phil">Dr. Phil</a> still have a Wiki entry?</dd>
</dl>
<p>And, for the record, I was genuinely offended when I first opened this page and read sentences like "Burns' camp was flooded with notices of her death" or "this was all believed to have happened online" (for the Guthrie gossip crap). The second sentence and the whole bit of info relating to it are just inexcusable garbage, while the first sentence is a typical example of ridiculously sensationalistic trash that can't even begin to be proven to be true. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 05:45, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
