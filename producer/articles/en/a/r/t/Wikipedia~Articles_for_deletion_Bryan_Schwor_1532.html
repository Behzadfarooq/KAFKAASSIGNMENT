<p>'<i>Bryan Schwor is a 2004 movie directed by Neil Vanos....</i> but IMDB hasn't heard of it (or Vanos), and Google seems not to have done so either.

<li><b>Keep</b> I saw Bryan Schwor at a Spokane theatre, though I live in Pullman, about three hours away. I drove to Spokane specifically to see Schwor after it became the topic of discussion on the WSU campus and in Pullman coffee shops (I am something of a small-budget film nut--there are a lot of gems hidden out there, and Bryan Schwor rates high on the list of films produced locally). I would estimate that 95% of WSU students and people living in Pullman have heard of or watched the movie, not to mention all the rural communities in the PNW. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMooVluvr_faf1.html" title="User:MooVluvr">MooVluvr</a> 21:17, 13 April 2005 (UTC)

<li>That would seem more the sort of logic that (in certain contexts) people derride as "consipiracy theory." It's not inconceivable that people would edit articles without having accounts - I did so myself for a bit before I registered this one. But you are right that it is overwhelmingly unlikely that a whole bunch of new people would sign on just in time to vote on a VFD. Any one case could be coincidence, but a whole lot of them at once is very unlikely.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a> describes vanity as an article which describes a person, but says "Articles about start-up businesses or musicians are not vanity pages and are considered acceptable, but it's preferable that the initial author not be someone affiliated with the project." This may be a small film companies movie, but by wikipedia's standards is not vanity. It should also be noted that "A page should not be cast away as 'vanity' simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia, and therefore, lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates." -<a href="../../../z/e/c/User%7EZechenia_0035.html" title="User:Zechenia">Zechenia</a> 11:51, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not a member so i dont know if my vote even counts, but i'll throw my two cents in here: its a small movie and small movie company. The whole point of wikipedia is you can find articles you normally can't find in other sources. Just like the articles on various California highways and their history: are they notable? If you live in the area, yes. Article worthy? Will some people find it interesting? Apparently yes. It's being snobish to say "It doesn't count because it's small, even though it meets the Wikipedia basic standards, it doesn't meet our standards." The Wikipedia-Masters out there might wanna just relax a little. Also, there's some sockpuppet stuff going on here though, which is stupid.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Regardless of how noteworthy it currently is, I see no truly compelling reason why this article should be deleted. Cries of vanity seem like an excuse to silence these "Schwor" zealots. The film appears to be, and in all likelihood, a small student-based film by a new motion picture company supported by unusually devoted fans and their respective sockpuppets. We should notice that many great film makers have had similiar beginnings. For example: Trey Parkers film <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal%21_The_Musical_53ab.html" title="Cannibal!
