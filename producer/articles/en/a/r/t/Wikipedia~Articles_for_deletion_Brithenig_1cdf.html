<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not an absolutist about keeping every possible piece of knowledge on Wikipedia, but in this instance it is not clear to me how to make an objective decision about which conlangs to include and which to exclude. I mean, just look at the following three things I discovered with the randomizing function: <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohtas_Fort_6a52.html" title="Rohtas Fort">Rohtas Fort</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Arms_3dd2.html" title="King of Arms">King of Arms</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellsville%2C_Ohio_6185.html" title="Wellsville, Ohio">Wellsville, Ohio</a> (population: 4,133). Should every fort in Pakistan, every member of the hierarchy of heralds, or every city in Ohio, no matter how small, have an entry? Well, maybe. The decision is ultimately about counts as important, and nobody can predetermine what will count as important before it actually becomes so. Brithenig is a small conlang, but one developed by a number of people, and has drawn some attention in the online conlanging community; it is equivalent to a town slightly more important than Wellsville, Ohio. But Wellsville has an entry. Why not Brithenig? <a href="../../../t/r/w/User%7ETrwier_773c.html" title="User:Trwier">Trwier</a> 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure about the notability of Brithenig in particular, but constructed languages cannot all be eligible for Wikipedia.

As regards the comments of <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> on the worthiness of the topic in general, that is why there is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">constructed language</a> article. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel7687_4b33.html" title="User:Joel7687">Joel7687</a> 16:16, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. First off, I find this very interesting, privately. However, the article itself admits that this "language" is nothing but a <i>"thought experiment"</i> conducted as a <i>"hobby"</i>. We <i>must</i> draw a line somewhere, and I think that private thought experiments that have not gained any wider currency should not be included in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 17:05, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heresiarch, you are making me very angry! Where did you get the godforsaken <b>arrogance</b> to state these things? I have been in contact with Andrew Smith at numerous occasions, and I can testify that he is an extraordinarily gentle and modest person. I hate to see him accused of "vanity" by someone who obviously doesn't know him, doesn't know his creations and doesn't know anything about conlangs in general. For the record, he did not create the article himself, nor did he contribute anything to it. Likewise, your accusation that this is an "advert" is ridiculous! I've nothing against a little healthy polemising, but ad hominem attacks like this one, so deeply under the belt, are really out of line. By all means be ashamed of yourself! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 22:45, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>And so are yours! Why otherwise would you be counting the edits of everybody who votes "keep" and complain about the fact that someone made a note of these VfDs at ZBB? What counts is that people are wikipedia users. There's nothing wrong with notifying other wikipedians that a VfD has been made in a field of their interest. Since you are so interested in the personal background of the voters, consider this (from <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_Deletion_fa1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion</a>): <i>You don't have to vote on every nomination; even consider not participating if: a nomination involves a topic of which you are ignorant; [...]</i>. For the record, I have no problem with the status quo. It's you who want to delete these articles, so if anybody were supposed to come up with good arguments its you! Frankly, I haven't seen any yet. All you could come up with is: non-notability (not a real criterium anyway, see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html#Notability_not_a_criterion_for_deletion.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">here</a>); vanity; and advertising (both evidently are complete nonsense). I must say, in related discussions in other wikis I've heard much better arguments! Now I'd love to give you a whole list of arguments in favour of all those articles that are currently under attack, but I wonder if it wouldn't be worth the effort to have all these discussions in one place. So for now I'll limit myself to this: language construction is a serious, full-fledged artform, and most of the languages that have attracted your wrath are excellent, important and representative examples of this artform. Therefore, their lemmata are warranted. For the record, I'm nót proposing that every conlang have its own entry in the wikipedia. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 07:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Without any irony whatsoever, I'd be interested to learn what your criteria to measure the notability of fictional languages are. What is it that sets <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a> apart from <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a>, where you voted delete, IIRC? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 13:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC) <small>actually from earlier this morning, forgot to sign</small>
<ul>
<li>I think it was the fact that "Brithenig is respected among the conlang community, being the <b>best-known example of the altlang genre</b>. It is the <b>first known</b> conlang to extrapolate a real Earth language through an alternate evolution, and as such can be considered the <b>grandfather of the genre</b>."

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. It's sooo tiring: every once in a while someone pops up who claims that all conlangs are non-notable and who want to limit the pages about it to Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua. Why can't those people accept that language construction is a form of art like any other? That the audience is smaller doesn't make it insignificant IMO. Now I agree that it is important to distinguish between notable and non-notable conlangs. But being a conlanger myself and knowing my way in conlangland, I assure you guys that Brithenig is an extremely notable language: it has been an immense source of inspiration for many other conlangs, it is the first known and most notable language of its kind (the "altlang" genre). It's a true masterpiece! --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 22:52, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>...someone pops up who claims that all conlangs are non-notable and who want to limit the pages about it to Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua</i>: Sorry Jan, but I think there is a huge distance between languages seriously designed for real-life international communication, and languages that form part of some work of fiction someone pursues as a hobby without any evident audience. "Klingon" or Tolkien's invented languages are special cases as they have established a huge audience. Further, see mine and others' comments on <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenedyk.html" title="Wenedyk">Wenedyk</a>'s <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Wenedyk_2610.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Wenedyk">VfD</a>. No offence, --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 10:03, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There ís such a distinction, Thorsten. Brithenig and other artlangs have not been created with the purpose of building up a community of speakers. So, you can't judge them by that criterium. That's my entire point here! As for the hobby element: yes, that is at least an argument. But if you ask me, virtually every form of art starts out as a hobby and in many cases never ceases to be one. Admittedly, the audience for artistic languages is a rather small one. But that conlanging is not the kind of artform people make a lot of money with does IMO not render it insignificant. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 11:14, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>NB if you insist on using the number of speakers as a criterium, we might as well delete at least two third of the auxlangs listed in <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_auxiliary_language.html#Auxiliary_languages" title="International auxiliary language">International auxiliary language#Auxiliary languages</a>. In fact, their case is even worse since they serve no other purpose than being used by "the world", while in reality they never gathered a community with more than a neglectable number of speakers. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 11:14, 24 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jan, I do not at all insist on the number of speakers, but I do agree that a significant proportion of auxiliary languages on Wikipedia probably are, at best, of borderline interest to anybody but their creators or smallish fan communities. But as I tried to explain on Wenedyk's parallel VfD, two wrongs don't make a right, and neither do two thirds of wrongs. <i>"every form of art starts out as a hobby and in many cases never ceases to be one</i>" - that is true enough. But for me, the decisive question is not what something starts out as, but what it ends up as - and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brithenig.html" title="Brithenig">Brithenig</a> has yet to transcend the status of a private hobby, at least I see no evidence that it has already accomplished that. Once it has, I'll be glad to renegotiate my vote. To use a Dutch example, had Van Gogh not posthumously received the recognition he was denied during his lifetime, we would rather not have immortalised him here, either, even if the paintings were the same. <i>"conlanging is not the kind of artform people make a lot of money with does IMO not render it insignificant"</i>. Not by itself, no. But, like it or not, the way our society is structured, making a lot of money with something usually proves that it is of significance. Of course, if something isn't making lots of money, this does not mean (yet) it is insignificant by definiton. But then there have to be other, objective signals to indicate significance. Even though I might subjectively agree with your opinion, I still fail to see what the objective indications might be in this case. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 13:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I'd disagree that Brithenig hasn't transcended the status of a private hobby. It did, after all, spawn a highly active community developing the world around it (Disclosure: I participate in <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>, and handle Ireland and a few other small sections). It's also notable amongst conlangs as one of the prototypical examples of the <i>altlang</i> genre. While there's few reasons I'd add an article on a conlang to the wiki, Brithenig and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdurian.html" title="Verdurian">Verdurian</a> are, because of their influence upon the art and their completeness, some of those I'd deem notable enough to keep. (And Wile E., don't post up the number of edits I've made. If anybody's interested, they can find them out for themselves. It's childish and demeaning to your fellow Wikipedians. Quality of edits is far more important than quantity.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>No indication of having, now or ever, been a vernacular for any sized group of people. No pop culture notability, as per Klingon. No academic notability, as due to the fact that I couldn't find a reference to it after searching over a half dozen scholarly journals' online editions. I suppose one could say that the fact it seems to have spawned some other conlangs nobody seems to speak and nobody who studies languages cares about could be called notability, but the first lemming off the cliff isn't encyclopedic either. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:15, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>(very) Weak keep</b>. Brithenig just creeps in over the line of notability to me (as a conlanger). It's spawned a lot of copycats as well as Ill Bethisad and members of the conlanging community generally know about it. Nothing less notable than Brithenig should be included, though, which is why I voted delete on Venedic and Breathenach. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 14:06, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b>. As a conlanger, and much as I would like to make public the art of conlanging to the greatest extent possible, I really don't see the need for grammatical treatises and descriptions of individual conlangs here on the Wikipedia.</s> There is already a good Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_language.html" title="Artistic language">Artistic language</a>, which should serve as a central locus for this particular art form and has already got a quite a long list of conlangs there. I think it vèry meet and right for conlangers to link to their own pages or to some other conlang oriented source, if they wish to do so. I wouldn't create a Wikipedia article for any of my conlangs, even though at least one of them ìs "notable" per these <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmafeta_Conlang_0956.html" title="User:Almafeta/Conlang">criteria</a>, and if I found one, I'ld delete it for the reasons stated.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> -- having found and read the deletion policies, I have to reconsider my opinion. I still don't think most conlangs warrant individual articles, but they are works of art and as such should not necessarily be removed simply because some people don't get the artform or can't think of anything better than personal attacks against the artists that create languages. Anyone who wants to create such an article on a conlang should be responsible enough to really consider whether this piece of artwork warrants an individual and unique article of its own. If possible, this article should be merged with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_languages.html" title="Artistic languages">Artistic languages</a> or <a href="../../../i/l/l/Ill_Bethisad_2b64.html" title="Ill Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Personally, I don't understand why "notable" should even be a criterion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am not an absolutist about keeping every possible piece of knowledge on Wikipedia, but in this instance it is not clear to me how to make an objective decision about which conlangs to include and which to exclude. I mean, just look at the following three things I discovered with the randomizing function: <a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohtas_Fort_6a52.html" title="Rohtas Fort">Rohtas Fort</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Arms_3dd2.html" title="King of Arms">King of Arms</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellsville%2C_Ohio_6185.html" title="Wellsville, Ohio">Wellsville, Ohio</a> (population: 4,133). Should every fort in Pakistan, every member of the hierarchy of heralds, or every city in Ohio, no matter how small, have an entry? Well, maybe. The decision is ultimately about counts as important, and nobody can predetermine what will count as important before it actually becomes so. Brithenig is a small conlang, but one developed by a number of people, and has drawn some attention in the online conlanging community; it is equivalent to a town slightly more important than Wellsville, Ohio. But Wellsville has an entry. Why not Brithenig? Incidentally, I find the argument that conlangs are ipso facto unworthy of an entry, as <a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIsh_ishwar_2d58.html" title="User:Ish ishwar">ishwar</a> does, a little bizarre. Does <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Super Mario Brothers</a> deserve an entry? Surely that's considerably more fatuous than conlanging (8P), but Wikipedia has devoted it a whole set of pages just to the characters in that series.
