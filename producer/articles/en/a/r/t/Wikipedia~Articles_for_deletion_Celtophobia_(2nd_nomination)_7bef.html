<dd>Bah! Celtophobia ain't a made "up word", and besides, even if it were, the rules by which it is formed are so obvious that it is just a short-hand way of writing a more complicated title. The topic is valid. We have topics like <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonophobia.html" title="Polonophobia">Polonophobia</a>, and if someone wants to write about Brazilophobia then they should be able to. I'm sick of this deletionist attitute on some part of the wiki community. You can have articles on amateur soccer players and college squash players, but not on a topic like this where shelves and shelves of books have been written. This particular article as it stands is but the potential material is limitless - it's a potential FA&#160;;) . Deleting it is little better than vandalism guys. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 09:16, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

All it gives are some lists of <i>phobias</i>,<a href="http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/oth1/phobias.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/oth1/phobias.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> some articles where the word is used to mean a general <i>racism</i> against celts,<a href="http://www.fathom.com/feature/122035/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fathom.com/feature/122035/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and some Hungarian sites (it seems to be an unrelated Hungarian word or name!). The top scorer is the wikipedia article, and that has only existed for a few weeks/months. The other site that comes up is the site refered to above, which calls for the creation of this article, apparently for no other reason than as <i>revenge</i> for the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">anglophobia</a> article. These sites are all very well for the purposes of definition, but wikipedia is not a dictionary. Unless the contents of the article can be properly verified, then all that can stand is the definition, which seems to be accurate. In that case the correct place for this word is in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:">wiktionary</a>. As for deletionism, I have never nominated an article for deletion before, but it must be true that there are a plethora of pointless articles on wikipedia. I note that polonophobia has a long bibliography, and a google search gives much more material for verifiability.<a href="http://www.google.fi/search?q=polonophobia&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.fi/search?q=polonophobia&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 10:01, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see Calgacus' point though: whatever the name something like "Celtophobia" certainly exists. I have had some nasty experiences in England myself, but I've never been clear whether it was just anti-Welsh or more generally anti-Celt and in the circumstances it wasn't really feasible to enquire. There could be room for a decent article here, but deleting the current article wouldn't stop anybody creating a decent one later on. Rhion 15:02, 27 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For sure it's a word that has been used, but it's not in either of the online dictionaries I have checked. It's the viability of producing a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> article I think is the problem, not a definition of it's meaning. It's not the scope of an encyclopedia to be a dictionary, defining the meaning is easy. But is there enough material out there to produce anything other than a stub article? Without verifiable material then it is not a viable article. At the moment it's just a lot of POV, none of which is verified and the article contradicts itself anyway. I can't see it getting any better. Just because something is a <i>concept</i> doesn't automatically qualify it for an article. Just because there are British people who are anti-Welsh or anti-Irish and French people who are anti-Breton (presumably) doesn't necessarily qualify them as <i>Celtophobes</i>. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 15:43, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not getting the verifiability stuff. Any advanced English speaker knows the word is a compound and can work out what it means. And as no-one can possibly deny that prejudice against "Celts" has existed and to a certain extent still exists, the article is fair game. That for me is the bottom line. I hope someone will reopen the article in future, and write something "verifiable". - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 23:42, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be under the impression that verifiability is the same as definition. Have a look at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">anglophobia</a>, they are struggling there.<i>Football hooliganism</i> and <i>devolution</i> are just two examples given. Neither of these are <i>Anglophobia</i>, and neither are verifiable as such. How about <i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i> as you think all <i>compound</i> phobias that have a <i>meaning</i> are <i>fair game</i>. The problem is that the <i>Celts</i> are not a discreet ethnic group or nation, so Celtophobia is almost impossible to identify and therefore verify. You cannot claim that every anti-Scottish or anti-Welsh event is <i>Celtophobia</i>, prejudice against one celtic nation is not necessarily a bias against all. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 03:33, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hey, I never claimed that bias against one "celtic" nation is celtophobia, did I? So let's not be arguing over something irrelevant. Moreover, while the status Celts have as one nation may be disputed, the Scots, Irish and Welsh have been linked with the same "scientific origin" (i.e. common language) since at least the 18th century, and thus have been able to generate collective prejudice. They also share, BTW, the status of the non-English of the British Isles, which implies some kind of identity since the 12th century, when the Normano-Angevin monarch of England had a finger in every part of it. While I admire "<i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i>" as a nice attempt at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>, it isn't very relevant, since the first part of the compound is not Greek (nor even Latin), football-opponent is itself an English compound, and football-opponent is not an ethnic group, nor any like group - i.e. nationality, racial group, gender group, disability group - that is likely to be subject to the prejudice (etc) that experience of the suffix -phobia tells any advanced English speaker the suffix -phobia would designate. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 10:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you missed my point. First my point about football is that agression against English football fans was used in Anglophobia as an example, but agression against supporters of opposing fans is not necessarily relevant to their nationality, your comment about <i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i> is the point as I am making. It was an example of how difficult it is to produce good examples, even with something as well accepted as Anglophobia. Secondly the point about bias against one celtic nation is that in order to get good verifiable sources on <i>Celtophobia</i> one has to find examples of bias against <i>all</i> celtic nations, and the source would have to explicitly claim that this was <i>Celtophobic</i>, bias against a single Celtic nation would not be enough for it to constitute a source for <i>Celtophobia</i>. Your grouping together of some of the <i>Celtic nations</i> does not constitute evidence for <i>Celtophobia</i>, and where do the Bretons figure? If you are arguing that <i>Celtophobia</i> applies to these nations because they are the <i>non-English</i> nations of the British Isles, I would argue that this is <i><a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a></i>, because they are disliked because of what they <i>are not</i> (ie they are not English), rather than <i>Celtophobia</i>, which would ba a dislike of them because they <i>are</i> Celts. The Normans oppressed everyone, including the English, by the way, and I think 12th century Normans would themselves identify as <i>non-English inhabitants of the British Isles</i>. You don't seem to be addressing my point about verifiability. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 12:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wobble/Alun, what's all this stuff about "bias against one celtic nation is that in order to get good verifiable sources on <i>Celtophobia</i>"? This doesn't seem like an appropriate argument addressed at me, as I haven't been saying the opposite. Anyways, there are lots of books about Celtophobia. Perhaps this is just more obvious to me, having read them. One that comes to mind is the rather good <i>Celtic Identity and the British Image</i> , by Murray Pittock. It's not hard to read Celtophobia in action either, just pick up a few history books written in England (or "Lowland Scotland" for instance) dating from the 19th century, or 50 decades before and after, from your local 2nd hand dealer. Or consider <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pinkerton_cf7b.html" title="John Pinkerton">John Pinkerton</a>. This is Celtophobia, addressed against people identified by the author as Celts. Alun, it is not up to me to deal with the Bretons. In British insular culture they are largely irrelevant, just consider the term "Celtic fringe", perhaps itself a moderate example of (British) "celtophobia". Your problem with this article seems to be the content, rather than the topic. Perhaps someone will come along and write decent content, and he won't need to deal then with any of this "verifiability" stuff which you're so concerned with.
<dl>
<dd>You seem not to understand the proper meaning of the word <i>Celtophobia</i>, though you claim its meaning should be obvious. You appear to be suggesting that it is <i>Celtophobic</i> to dislike only some Celts (eg <i>British</i> Celts), but <i>Celtophobia</i> <b>must</b> include a dislike of all <i>Celts</i> and things <i>Celtic</i> simultaneously. If you exclude <i>Bretons</i> from the list, then it is not <i>Celtophobia</i>, is it? And it is a <i>cop out</i> to evade an answer about Bretons with <i>it is not up to me</i>, because you have chosen to defend the article, so I would suggest that it is indeed up to you. You are talking about Norman/English expansionism, subjugation, cultural domination and ultimately assimilation; and applying an innapropriate <i>label</i>, this did not happen <b>because</b> these people were <i>Celts</i> (as <i>Celtophobia</i> would have it), but because they <i>happened to be in the way</i>, it would have happened to whoever was there, irrespective of whether they were <i>Celts</i> or not. The motivation was a good old fassioned <i>land grab</i>, you are choosing to interpret it as <i>Celtophobia</i>. Yes, you are spot on, my problem is exactly with content, which is what I said right at the start, it is unverifiable and a simple definition is not good enough as this is not a dictionary. It's also worth taking a look at <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phob-.html" title="-phob-">-phob-</a>. The OED online does not have a listing for this <i>phobia</i>, so that's three dictionaries I've checked. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 00:38, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, are you now defining the word? It has to include Bretons does it; well, I'm sure it does, in the same way "celtic fringe" includes Britanny. Please do a little reading too of what I've written. Just because a few dictionaries don't have it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and just because you've not done any reading, doesn't mean that this article has to be a dicdef.

<dd>I think the 12th century is a bit of a red herring - there was no real concept of "Celt" as such at that time, and as Alun says the Normans didn't really care who owned the land if they wanted it. However there is, as Calgacus says, plenty of 19th century material aimed at Celts in general rather than a specific variety of Celt for a fully verifiable article, though whether the appropriate title would be "Celtophobia" or something else is another matter. It's an interesting subject which should be covered by Wikipedia. Rhion 11:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You make a good point, I don't think it is necessarily <i>celtophobia</i> as much as xenophobia. The 19th century was full of misunderstandings/deliberate distortions of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin's</a> model for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>. These people believed they were dominant because they were superior, and believed that natural selection <i>proved</i> this. This is what led to vile concepts such as <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a> and of course ultimately to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialism_62c4.html" title="National Socialism">National Socialism</a> and the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_solution.html" title="Final solution">final solution</a>. It's as much the product of imperialism and and political dominance as anything else. The motivation was to define themselves as superior to everybody, not just the Celts, this is what led to things like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid</a> for example, and I bet you can find many instances regarding <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">India</a> as well. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:28, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
