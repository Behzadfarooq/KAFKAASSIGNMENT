<p>This is a term that is in common use in the context of dietary calcium supplements. Calcium is an element. It is a metal. So one might expect 'elemental calcium' to refer to pure calcium metal. In the nutrition business it does not. In the nutrition business 'elemental calcium' refers simply to calcium. If you are told you require 1 gram of elemental calcium per day that means you require 1 gram of calcium per day. This will not be calcium metal, as the name 'elemental calcium would lead one to think, but a calcium compound such as calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is 40 % calcium by weight, thus a 500 mg pill of calcium carbonate contains 200 mg of calcium; the container may indicate each pill has 200 mg of 'elemental calcium'. It would be much less confusing if the container label said each pill contains 200 mg of calcium.</p>

<p>His style is often associated with that of Nu Jazz as his performing, improvising and albums feature a strong 21st century electronic influence. He is considered to be one of the unqiue re-interpretations of what the role and sound of the electric guitarist can be.</p>

Not to be confused with the character actor of the same name, Stacy Harris is the doyenne of Music Row, and thanks to her column's blend of facts and informed opinion, would be the often sordid country-music industry's conscience- if it had one- as her scrutiny strives to hold the gatekeepers accoountable.</p>

<p>So why wasn't this added? Stacy Harris, the American-born author, broadcaster and musicologist, has more and higher-ranked entries in Google, Yahoo, MSN, GoodSearch.com, etc. than the Canadian-born actor? 170.190.40.78 18:29, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd say she's the most honest voice on Music Row. She didn't pull any punches commenting about Chris LeDoux and the people who let Chris downn, either. 170.190.40.78 19:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By all means, this entry should be added. Why are Wikipedia contributors who know nothing about country-music, Music Row, etc. making all of the decisions about our business' icons? 70.157.34.167 06:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Stacy Harris is my favorite country-music resource. She's a walking country-music encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Nintendo Has Announced The Official Name Of Its Next Generation Game Console Code Named Revolution On 27th April 2006.An Official Announcment Said:</p>
<p>"Introducing... Wii.</p>
<p>As in "we."</p>
<p>While the code-name Revolution expressed our direction, Wii represents the answer. Wii will break down that wall that seperates videogame players from everybody else. Wii will put people more in touch with their games... and each other. But you're probably asking: What does the name mean?</p>
<p>Wii sounds like "we," which emphasizes the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii.</p>
<p>Wii has a distinctive "ii" spelling that symbolizes both the unique controllers and the image of people playing it. And Wii, as a name and a console, brings something revolutionary to the world of videogames that sets it apart from the crowd.</p>
<p>So that's Wii. But now Nintendo needs you. Because it's really not about you or me. It's about Wii. And together, Wii will change everything."</p>

<p>Pope IX started Warner as "Soup with a Fork" in the early 80's. The band went through a few members including Deez Thompson and Harvey Winklebaum. The sound was loud and intense and few people really clicked with it, but they had a loyal following. Mid 80's Warner played some East Coast shows and found a kid by the name of Martin Freedricks. Martin jumped on stage to sing a song with (then singer) Herb of the Burbs, only to find after the show that Herb was quitting. Pope IX talked Martin into joining and Martin immediately left the East Coast to fly out to Cali to start work on the now famous album "Fuck You, I Fucking Hate You, Suck My Balls" which was released under then independent RCA records.</p>
<p>Despite overwhelming success, "Fuck You..." was banned across all 7 continents and over 40 minor islands, many without a single record store. RCA dropped the band from the label, tore up the contract, stole all the money, and sold out. The album was later re-released on still-independent label "Fail Everything." The cover art was changed and the tracks re-arranged and a couple live covers added to the end. The live covers were later pulled when they were found to include copyrighted James Brown samples from a rap concert in the next building that could be heard on the live recording. Regardless, the band "Soup with a Fork" had left it's mark.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah Nirvana, grunge music. 90's come around and "Soup with a Fork" is tired of recanting their former glory to continually dwindling live audiences. They adopt a grungier sound and rename themselves "Fuckwagon" -- a clever twist on "Chuckwagon" who at the time was a lighter indie band they would open for. As "Fuckwagon" they released the benign "Marshall Law" which was a punk rock-esque ode to music crammed into one 30-minute long song. It was met with mixed reviews and some harsh criticism. The band quickly lost all hope.</p>
<p>Mid 90's everybody agrees to let rock die and opts for electro-industrial-metal instead. Fuckwagon, on the other hand, believes that while rock might be dead, punk rock is inherintly different, regains some hope, and decides to try a second time. Unfortunately, the band decides they hate each other for the most part and falls apart. A few days later Pope IX and Martin get together with long time bass-player friend Flea and talk over the formation of a new band -- Warner.</p>
<p>Flea calls up legendary drummer Phil Hammerstein and the four start writing. Somewhere around this time Martin starts going by Fuk Choo, a clever twist on Fuck You. Warner in it's new incarnation clicks instantly and starts releasing album after album with their new independent label "presh records." The band is innundated with offers to sign to major labels but refuse -- recalling what happened with RCA before. All the releases are underground legends and the band tours extensively (sometimes having other bassists fill in for Flea who was also working with side projects at the time).</p>
<p>2005. Warner is hard at work drinking and partying, every few months or so making up a song and recording it. Eventually, Project 33 will be released and it too will be an underground hit.</p>

<p>Spookie Daly (the bandâs leader, a singer, keyboard player and unselfconsciously joyous live performer), Tommy Diehl (percussion), Pete Whitham (guitars, vocals) and Floyd Kellogg (bass) have just the prescription for your flagging spirits with this 12-song antidote. Running the musical gamut from hip-hop to jazz to roots rock to Nâawlins funk, Spookie Daly Pride (SDP) may have flown under the radar of music critics so far, but their grassroots reputation as a guaranteed good-time live band has registered loudly and proudly with their rabid and growing fan base. Replete with saloon-style piano pounding (think NRBQ, one of the bandsâ biggest influences), blazing rock guitar riffs, meaty Memphis-style bass lines and carnivalesque electronic flourishes, the music embraces a wide variety of influences. But from the rhythmic thrust dance beat and double-entendre of âThe Bumpinâ Uglies Songâ to the cute, infectious groove of âThe Personal Ad Songâ to the feel-good jazz-funk of âSooo Delicious!!!â (complete with a Roy Orbison-ish vocal alternating with Spookieâs usual big bad wolf delivery), the music falls squarely within the category theyâve aimed for all along: uncategorically original and FUN.</p>
<p>SDP shares Boston roots with crazy-busy, way hi-profile production team of Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie. Founders of the legendary Fort Apache recording studio in Cambridge Mass., Kolderie and Slade have served as the production powerhouse behind rock bands like the Pixies, Radiohead, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dinosaur Jr., Buffalo Tom, Hole and countless others. In 2002 the pair opened Camp Street Studios, keeping the Fort Apache tradition alive by continuing to work with vital new bands and eclectic sounds. When they heard Spookie Daly Prideâs hip-hop infused brand of funk rock, the pair enthusiastically signed on â Slade as producer, with Kolderie sharing the mixing duties.</p>
<p>Hailing from Boston has worked some other karma into the mix too: the band does a bang-up business bringing their live show to the college crowd, and have a grassroots army of fans who are devoted to converting music lovers to the ranks of the Pride. Suffice to say their performances are parties (or is it vice versa?). They play their hook-laden, groove-filled songs with joyful, irreverent abandon, and the happy feverâs catching.</p>
<p>Spookie Daly Pride has been mentioned in the same breath as Soul Coughing, Tom Waits, Dr. John, and G. Love. Certainly comparisons can be made. But thereâs something completely unique about the playful charisma of lead man Spookie and the swaggering second line antics of the Pride. Having shared bills with the likes of Leftover Salmon, Foo Fighters, Busta Rhymes and Rusted Root, theyâve grabbed the attention of audiences with a wide range of tastes. Songs from their first album, MARSHMALLOW PIE have been used on TV shows on MTV and ESPN; theyâve also had their music placed in feature films, thus widening that illinâ audience even more.</p>

<p>Pick tapping is a technique wherein the side of the guitar pick is used to fret notes on the guitar neck. It is very similar to <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finger_tapping.html" title="Finger tapping">finger tapping</a> except the pick is used, rather than the finger.</p>
<p>Pick tapping can give a cleaner sound than finger tapping, but it is harder to add vibrato to the tapped note than with the finger.</p>
<p>Generally, it is also easier to tap more rapidly with the pick than the finger. An example of this can be heard near the beginning of the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Rhoads_a428.html" title="Randy Rhoads">Randy Rhoads</a> guitar solo on the Blizzard of Ozz's <i>Crazy Train</i> where rapid taps on the G string are performed while the left hand is slowly bending and releasing a fretted note lower down on the string. This gives an effect similar to that of a whammy bar being depressed and released.</p>

<p>The cave architecture in India is believed to have begun in the third century BC. These caves were used by Buddhist and Jain monks as places of worship and residence.Some examples of this type of cave structure are Chaityas and Viharas of Buddhists.The great cave at Karle is one such example, where great Chaityas and Viharas were excavated by hewing out rocks.Besides the caves at Karle, many caves were excavated at other places. These were excavated not only by Buddhists or Jains but also by Hindus. Some of the famous and prominent caves are at Nashik,Elephanta and Ellora,etc.</p>

<p>[Maryland State Soil Established in 1901, the Sassafras series was one of the first soil series in the early days of soil survey activities in the U.S. It is one of the oldest soil series in the U.S. It is designated as a Benchmark and Hall of Fame soil series, which is a recognition of its historical significance in the evolution of soil science in the U.S. These soils are mapped on nearly 500,000 acres in Maryland. The Sassafras series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy marine and old alluvial sediments of the Coastal Plain. These soils are categorized as prime farmland, which means that they are among the most productive soils in the state for agriculture and forestry, in addition to being one of the soils best suited to construction, onsite effluent disposal, and recreational development.]</p>

<p>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp. 429 U.S. 252 (1977) In this case the village of <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_Heights%2C_Illinois_0270.html" title="Arlington Heights, Illinois">Arlington Heights, Illinois</a> refused to rezone property so that low-income housing could be built. The developers seeking zoning changes sued, saying that the decision not to rezone violated the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_protection_clause.html" title="Equal protection clause">equal protection clause</a> of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_Amendment_b4f0.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>. The theory of the case was one of discriminatory impact. The plaintiffs relied on <a href="../../../y/i/c/Yick_Wo_49c6.html" title="Yick Wo">Yick Wo</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomillion_v._Lightfoot_6b80.html" title="Gomillion v. Lightfoot">Gomillion v. Lightfoot</a>, in which plaintiffs succeeded in challenging laws that were written in racially neutral terms, but that severely detrimented one racial group. The court has never recognize racial impact as an adequate basis for a constitutional violation all by itself, but has always required that the plaintiffs prove a discriminatory intent. However, in Yick Wo and Gomillion, the court accepted an extremely disproportionate impact as evidence proving a discriminatory intent. The plaintiffs in this case asserted that the disparate racial impact of the zoning proved that the city intended to discriminate against racial minorities.</p>
<p>The SCOTUS dealt with two significant issues: First, whether the plaintiffs had <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standing.html" title="Standing">standing</a>. Second, whether the zoning was in violation of equal protection.</p>
<p>Regarding the second issue, the court stated that in order to use disparate impact alone to prove discrimination, they plaintiffs must show a "clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race." Ultimately the court ruled against the plaintiffs. This case reaffirmed the principle articulated in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_v._Davis_d89e.html" title="Washington v. Davis">Washington v. Davis</a>, that discriminatory impact was not a per se violation of equal protection, but merely evidence of discriminatory intent. While appearing to allow considerable latitude for the use of statistical evidence of discrimination, in application Arlington Heights and similar cases almost entirely foreclose using discriminatory impact to prove intent. Ironically, many of the most fervent opponents of the use of statistics to prove racial discrimination end up using those statistics themselves to support overturning affirmative action. See Grutter, Rehnquist J dissenting.</p>

<p>Chain Chomps reside in the land of Mario, appearing in such games as Super Mario Bros 3., Super Mario 64, Paper Mario, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and other such titles. Chain Chomps are attached to chins and chomp at their enemy, their name basically a blunt descripition of what these creatures do. Chain Chomps have even been seen harassing some areas of golfing (Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour)and were even used as a Special item during Kart races (Mario Kart: Double Dash!) A Chain Chomp even blocked the way to a Star in Super Mario 64, forcing the player to pound down the stake the chain was attached to until the creature was freed. Once out of its captivity, this Chain Chomp hit the fence blocking the Star and then fled the scene. Chain Chonps have also blocked the way in the second chapter of Paper Mario (the first) guarding important relics. For more information on Chain Chomps, go to nintendo.com</p>

<p>PCTFE (PolyChloroTriFluoroEthylene) is a fluorocarbon-based polymer and is commonly abbreviated PCTFE. PCTFE offers the unique combination of physical and mechanical properties, nonflammability, chemical resistance, near zero moisture absorption, and excellent electrical properties. These characteristics cannot be found in any other thermoplastic fluoropolymer with a useful temperature range of -400Â°F to +400Â°F. PCTFE also has extremely low outgassing, making it well suited for use in aerospace and flight applications.</p>
<p>Kel-FÂ® is a registered tradename of 3M Company. In 1996, 3M discontinued manufacturing of Kel-F &amp; today, all PCTFE resin is manufactured by Daikin under the tradename of Neoflon Â® or by Allied Signal under the tradename of Aclon Â®. Kel-F is still the most commonly used tradename used to describe PCTFE.</p>

<p>Skybus metro technology is invention by Mr Bojji Rajaram , to improve the century old rail guided system. The serious safety concerns of conventional railway to derail and capsize is elminated in Skybus metro rail.While the Skybus uses all the proven and time tested elements and sub-systems of the railway, it is uniquely re-engineered, to make sure that the whhels can never get separated from railway tracks.A 1.6km test track and a freak accident which tookplace while on experimental run, proved all the major positive points of Skybus system, that both derailment and capsizing are truly eliminated.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-01_14aa.html" title="Edit section: Stately Wayne Manor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stately_Wayne_Manor_88ad.html" title="Stately Wayne Manor">Stately Wayne Manor</a></span></h2>
<p><b>Stately Wayne Manor</b> With such "Manorisms" as "I don't believe in organized religion. People should be free to worship me any way they choose" and "Humility is a flaw, and I have none," it's hardly a surprise to learn Stately Wayne Manor has thrice been touted as "The World's Most Conceited Man" in such prestigious journals as <i>The Weekly World News</i> and <i>The Sun</i>. Nor is it a shocker that the letters in his tribute site URL, [www.SWMSWM.com], stand for "Stately Wayne Manor's Site to Worship Me."</p>
<p>What tends to most infuriate people about Manor is that he actually does have a multitude of talents (and achievements in those genres) to back up the boisterous braggadocios.</p>
<p>For instance, having "America's greatest rock drummer," on his resume was not sufficient for Manor. He: without a single lesson, became competent enough at songwriting, synthesizer, various percussion instruments, harmonica, vocals and electric bass to perform each discipline onstage; knowing one published article might be considered a fluke, wrote three for <i>Modern Drummer</i> magazine to further establish credibility; and, was dubbed "a virtuoso" by a Philadelphia-area newspaper.</p>
<p>Fueled by the advent and aggression of punk rock in the late Seventies, and combining his interests in performing and "learning great new ways to injure others," Manor immersed himself in a childhood hobby, professional wrestling, and was particularly drawn towards the "heels" ("bad guys.")</p>
<p>Never content to merely observe, but lacking the bulk required to participate in matches, Manor eventually broke into the bonebending business in 1984 as a pro-heel columnist for <i>Wrestling World</i> magazine, his highly provocative "Stately States" inspiring hate mail from around the globe. Having established himself as "The Sultan Of Insultin'" for his blistering attacks on the mat heroes and those who support them, Manor expanded into color commentating, managing grapplers, performing in-ring skits and ghost-writing wisecracks used by several wrestling superstars on pay-per-view and national TV broadcasts.</p>
<p>During 1995, in the midst of his 17-year tenure with <i>Wrestling World</i>, Manor debuted a second villain-praising column, that one in Britain's [[<i>Power Slam]]</i>. It too provokes a great deal of controversy among readers, no doubt fueled by outrageous antics such as Manor one-upping John Lennon with the declaration "Jesus couldn't hold a candle to me. Besides, if he tried, it would fall right through the hole in his hand."</p>
<p>When not penning zingers denigrating shirtless mammoths, the long-time self-proclaimed King Of Columnists takes on the general public and mainstream celebrities via his sociopathic "On Manor's Mind" rants for the alternative set. He also authors "Manor On Movies," a remarkably non-abrasive homage to obscure so-bad-they're-good films, and one of the earliest columns of its kind still regularly published.</p>
<p>Manor has guested on countless radio programs throughout the US and Canada, including morning drive time shows in Philadelphia and New York City. In addition to the above publications, his photo has also appeared in books about David Bowie and the original supermodel Gia, as well as on national television.</p>
<p>An absolutely <b>shameless</b> self-promoter (guess who ghost-wrote the trio of "Most Conceited Man" tabloid pieces), it is rumored Stately Wayne Manor will pose as someone else in order to rave about himself on Usenet, individual site bulletin boards and even online reference sources.</p>
<p>His latest exploits include: writing to the White House and insisting the name of the country immediately be changed to "the United Statelys"; and, being ejected from the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, after it appeared he was about to autograph "The Persistence Of Memory" to, as Manor put it, "give that old thing some real market value."</p>
<p>There are those who theorize the entire SWM persona is a hoax. Tonia Milford, editor of <i>Art Scene Zine</i>, has suggested Manor is in fact "one of the paramount Absurdists to ever live.</p>
<p>"Manor has taken the form to the ultimate level. Whereas others use paint, film, found objects, plaster, and so on, Manor's medium is <b>himself</b>. Also unlike others, there is no separation between the artist and his art. no defined exhibition or performance.</p>
<p>"A letter to the Queen Mother opening with the salutation 'Yo, Queenie, baby'? The pocket device that is a small mirror on one side and a photo of Stately labeled 'Perfection' on the other so, as he puts it, ' a user can compare'?</p>
<p>"Surely, he is winking on the inside. Look at the subtle clues. For example, if one abbreviates 'Conceited Man,' one gets 'Con Man'!"</p>

<p>The Talented And Gifted Magnet at Tonview Center is one of the top 3 public schools in the United States, according to Newsweek magazine. The school has been featured in other places such as D Magazine.<a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://teacherweb.com/TX/TAGMagnet/Main/griffin1.bmp">Image:Http://teacherweb.com/TX/TAGMagnet/Main/griffin1.bmp</a> The school mascot is the griffin, and the colors are blue and gold. ID badges are worn, but not willingly. Unusual fashions are common. It is a very diverse school, ethnically, religiously and culturally. As well as wonderful, smart students, there are wonderful teachers who are very cool and fun. Many unique things are done in TAG, such as the TREK field trip at the beginning of the year, which is a 3-day trip during which lots of interesting and mind-stimulating things are done. As Townview in general doesn't have sports teams, TAG has been known to organize their own. Once example of this is the Powderpuff football team. Here is some information about TAG from the website<a href="http://teacherweb.com/TX/TAGMagnet/Main/ap1.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://teacherweb.com/TX/TAGMagnet/Main/ap1.stm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>: "TAG graduates are accepted to and attend the most prestigious colleges and universities in the country, such as harvard, Stanford, Yale, Columbia, NYU, Cal-Tech, MIT, Cal-Berkeley, Vassar, Amherst, Oberlin, Wellesley, Carlton, Swarthmore, Rice, Johns Hopkins, Reed, Morehouse, Emory, Howard, the Honors Programs at UT-Austin, Texas A&amp;M, Washington University-St. Louis, and the U.S. Military Academies. The 2005 graduating class of thirty-eight students was offered cumulative scholarships in excess of $9 million.</p>
<p><br />
All students are expected the follow the Distinguished Achievement Program as outlined by the State of Texas and the Texas Education Agency. In 2005, ALL graduates were recognized as DAP Texas Scholars. The TAG curriculum includes interdisciplinary activities such as TREK, TAG-IT, TAG Forum, and grade-level seminars that reflect the principles of gifted education as outlined by the Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students and national standards for gifted education.</p>
<p><br />
Students are required to follow an extensive Advanced Placement (AP) and Pre-AP curriculum that includes a minimum of eleven required AP courses. In addition, TAG offers many opportunities for academic, civic, and personal enrichment through its wide variety of honor societies, academic competitions, clubs, and organizations. "</p>
<p>Overall, TAG is a stupendous high school, and if you are a middle schooler: go there. If you are a parent: send your kid there. It is the best school ever.</p>

The letter bursted with irony and sarcasm, and can be understood partly as a reaction to the open letter that the murderer pinned on the victim's body, which was adressed to the dutch people and some politicians, and partly as a humorous assault on the dead-seriousness and censorship-like character of religious fundamentalism.</p>
<p><br />
Dear Mohammed and friends,</p>
<p>What a shame things turned out like this. We hadnât any idea that matters were so precarious. Weâve certainly had our lesson. How is the leg doing?* Please lets try and keep things together, with some mutual respect it will all work out just fine; otherwise things again will end up in such a bloody mess. Could you provide us with some strict guidelines as to what we can and cannot say? That al of this had to happen - dammit, especially during rammadan. We will try our utmost to learn more about your religious beliefs, so further misunderstandings can be avoided. We are all deeply ashamed, Mohammed. Surely, we are accountable for putting you in such a terrible predicament. This time weâve really gone too far. We blame ourselves. For heavens sake, try not to lose your sense of humor, God knows youâll need it in the time coming. We hope this open letter doesnât contain anything which might upset you and your fellow believers. If it does, please forgive us; we also are a bit confused. Well, dude, chin up! Try and put it all behind you, tomorrowâs another day. And remember, whatever happens: always keep smiling.</p>
<p>Courage,</p>
<p>untill we write again,</p>
<p>The friends of Theo van Gogh</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Whitchurch High School is a secondary school located in the Cardiff Suburb of Whitchurch. Its catchment area includes much of the Cardiff North Parliamentary Constituency, including Whitchurch, Rhiwbina, Llandaff North, Thornhill, Tongwynlais, Birchgrove, Heath and Gabalfa.</p>
<p>The school itself is located on two sites approximately five minutes walk from each other, the lower school site serving years 7-9, and the upper school site serving years 10-11 (GCSE)and the Sixth Form Centre (AS Levels, A Levels, and the International Baccaleaureate). The two sites were originally built in the 1930s as two seperate schools. Until the early 1970s, the current lower school site operated as Whitchurch Secondary Mondern, and the current upper school site operated as Whitchurch Grammar School, both within the juristiction of the Glamorganshire County Council.</p>
<p>Currently, Whitchurch High is the largest state school in Wales with approximately 2,400 students, and the second largest in the United Kingdom. It is operated by the Cardiff Council. In April 2006 it was suggested that the school be moved in its entirety to the upper school site, with the lower school site becoming a Roman Catholic High School, however, these plans were rejected by the full council shortly afterward.</p>

<p>The Blank made his way to the Dick Tracy comic strip by kidnapping Dick Tracy, Jr on October 26, 1937.</p>
<p>The Blank drove off with his captive. "You havn't any eyes" Junior gulped. "Or mouth...or nose!" "The Blank. That's me." he said.</p>
<p>This grotesque figure of nothing just kidnapped Dik Tracy Junior. He also saved his life.</p>
<p>The Blank was the first of The Grotesques, A nickname for Dick Tracy Villians. The Blank was actually Ankle Redrum. Shotgun blasts turn him into a groteque human mutation. Donning a face colored cheesecloth, and thus the Blank was born. The Blank was a good-bad guy. Dick Tracy chased the Blank for 4 whole entire months before he was finaly unmasked on January 6, 1938.</p>
<p>It wasn't a pretty sight.</p>
<p>Ever since the Blank was unmasked there have been many copy-offs, like DC's The Question. The Blank dissapered since then.</p>

<p>Cornography is an art created by two very ingenious people, Mitch Martin, and Chris Wolf. It is a form of pornography in which the human body is replaced with corn. It contains images of corn in the field, canned corn, corn removing its husk, creamed corn, and other adult images pretaining to corn. Cornography is sometimes refered to as <i>corno</i> or <i>corn</i>. The are many magazines currently in print <b>PlayCorn</b>, <b>Cornhouse</b> etc. Some videos include "Corn Gone Wild," "Real Corn," "Busty Corn," etc. There is also a large number of websites spreading rapidly throughout the internet containing the types of images.</p>

<p>The Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club was founded in 1962 in Toronto, Canada by Bernie Guidon. Like other motorcycle clubs of the time they were inspired by the movie "The Wild One" featuring Marlon Brando. What started out as a club of drinking, fighting young men grew to become Canada's largest and most dangerous outlaw motorcycle club. At its peak in 1978 The Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club controlled Ontario and Southwestern Quebec, and supplied LSD to other Canadian and U.S. outlaw motorcycle clubs including the Hell's Angels.</p>
<p>The Choice suffered a severe setback with the arrest and conviction of its leaders for drug trafficking in the late 1970s by Canadian Police. Murder convictions of other key gang leaders eventually led to a split between the Ontario and Quebec wing of the club, which was fighting a prolonged bloody war with its arch-rivals The Popeyes in eastern Montreal. The Quebec Choice joined the Chicago based Outlaws Motorcycle Club in a bid to secure more weaponery and drugs and to combat the Montreal Popeyes who had joined the Hell's Angels.</p>
<p>The Ontario Chapters of Satan's Choice turned a cold shoulder on the Outlaws and the Hell's Angels throughout the 1980s, and with a loose coalition of smaller clubs including the Para-Dice Riders and The Vagabonds they ruthlessly controlled Ontario until 2000, when they struck a deal to join the Hell's Angels. The deal was prompted by a bloody battle taking place across North America between several warring motorcycle club factions who had now started to court gangs in Ontario in an effort to strengthen the depleted ranks of the Quebec Hell's Angels and Bandidos. The Satan's Choice, with their lucrative Ontario business and hardcore membership secured the Hell's Angels as the supreme rulers of outlaw gangs in Canada.</p>

<p>The Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club was founded in 1962 in Toronto, Canada by Bernie Guidon. Like other motorcycle clubs of the time they were inspired by the movie "The Wild One" featuring Marlon Brando. What started out as a club of drinking, fighting young men grew to become Canada's largest and most dangerous outlaw motorcycle club. At its peak in 1978 The Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club controlled Ontario and Southwestern Quebec, and supplied LSD to other Canadian and U.S. outlaw motorcycle clubs including the Hell's Angels.</p>
<p>The Choice suffered a severe setback with the arrest and conviction of its leaders for drug trafficking in the late 1970s by Canadian Police. Murder convictions of other key gang leaders eventually led to a split between the Ontario and Quebec wing of the club, which was fighting a prolonged bloody war with its arch-rivals The Popeyes in eastern Montreal. The Quebec Choice joined the Chicago based Outlaws Motorcycle Club in a bid to secure more weaponery and drugs and to combat the Montreal Popeyes who had joined the Hell's Angels.</p>
<p>The Ontario Chapters of Satan's Choice turned a cold shoulder on the Outlaws and the Hell's Angels throughout the 1980s, and with a loose coalition of smaller clubs including the Para-Dice Riders and The Vagabonds they ruthlessly controlled Ontario until 2000, when they struck a deal to join the Hell's Angels. The deal was prompted by a bloody battle taking place across North America between several warring motorcycle club factions who had now started to court gangs in Ontario in an effort to strengthen the depleted ranks of the Quebec Hell's Angels and Bandidos. The Satan's Choice, with their lucrative Ontario business and hardcore membership secured the Hell's Angels as the supreme rulers of outlaw gangs in Canada.</p>

<p>Nortelâs premier âintelligent subversiveâ was perhaps Dr Rudolph Kriegler. He initiated and led the development of optoelectronic devices â which laid the basis for the fiber-optic transmission product line that put Nortel at the heart of the Internet. Kriegler often risked his own career at times to carry out the research in the face of opposition and organizational politics.</p>
<p>Nortel might have ended up as a leader in fiber optics without Kriegler, but the probabilities would have been much lower without him and the body of expertise he helped to build up in the company over the 1980s and early 1990s. Rudy as he was known to all envisioned what we call the internet years before it existed. He used to say to his co-workers... "we will all want to move multimedia across fiber and soon !"</p>
<p>Rudy was both an artist and scientist. He prompted the development of the OC-192 laser in BNR's Lab 1...which was and is the world's fastest laser at 10 gbps. He asked his team to develop this laser at a time when the whole world said it could not be done. Rudy and his team of 'intelligent subversives' proved the world wrong. Those of us who worked with Rudy all understood that we were in the presence of a great scientist. Perhaps one of the greatest Nortel has ever seen!</p>

<p>Smar Jbeil is a very old village of North Lebanon. It has been the refuge of the first Maronite Patriarch Saint John Maron before heading up to Kfarhay.</p>
<p>According to some historians, the name is believed to be composed of three phonenican expressions:" The tombs of the kings of Jbeil". Other historians believe that the name is an old syriac name which means "Shemreho da Gbel" or The gardian of Jbeil. Smar Jbeil is definitely a Phoenician village and one of its ruins is a carving on a rock showing a Phoenician king kneeling in front on an Assyrian king paying him loyalty. The Romans too occupied this village and built in it a temple with huge pillars that lay today in ruins. However, five Roman statues wearing the typical scarf are still intact.</p>
<p>In the center of the village is the old church of Mar Nohra, said to be the burial place of this Lebanese saint, who was a Persian Christian missionary. Partially built with temple debris, the north side of this picturesque church has been modernized. The oldest part is the south wall, which incorporates a medieval window and sections of temple columns. The church features a typical outside stone staircase and a bell tower. The front entrance is decorated with three sculpted chains carved from a single stone, a design also found on the portal of the Hammam al Jadid in Tripoli. The remains of an earlier church stand nearby. A simple vaulted structure, one of its corners appears to be a section of a classical altar. From the southwest of the church you can walk to a hill where the Crusader castle stands on rock-cut foundations. Smar Jbail was part of the crusader fief of Saint Montagne of the Lords of Batroun. The Crusaders built walls of bossed stone and rubble and surrounded the fortress with a rock-cut moat. Within the inner courtyard stands a central keep along whose north wall is a well preserved cistern covered by a pointed arch. The simplicity of its plan, which is similar in arrangement and appearance to the Byblos Castle, as well as the square tower, date this fortress to the early 12th century. The area around the castle is worth exploring. Oil and other presses, some in very good condition, are cut into the limestone hillside below the southwest part of the castle. This prominent rocky hilltop may have been an ancient high place or temple. In the cliffs to the north below the castle are tomb chambers and some very worn bas reliefs of standing, seated and kneeling figures that predate the castle. These reliefs, carved above the entrance of the funerary caves, are similar to those found in Ghineh or Machnaqa in Mount Lebanon or Qana in the South</p>

<p>University High School in Morgantown, West Virginia was opened orginially as a demonstration school in 1925 for the local university's (West Virginia University)student teachers. It had a very small student population, but kept growing over the years. In 1972, Monogalia County Board of Education bought the school from WVU and it has since seen rapid growth. In the 1990-1991 school year, there was close to 600 students attending the school, which has grown to about 1,300 today. Because the building isn't equipped for so many students, a new UHS is being built and will be finished within the next ten years. Mascot: hawk colors: red and gold principal: J. Forst</p>

<p>Menigheden is the fan club of I.K. StartÂ´s football team. The fan club was started in early 2005 as the result of a partial breakup/name change from the old fan club named Tigerberget. Tigerberget was the old fan club for I.K. Start, but several members felt that the fan club was stagnant, and that new ideas and new blood was needed.</p>
<p>Before the 2005 season Menigheden was established on the remains of Tigerberget, and coupled with the success of I.K. Start the fan club quicly grew in membership. Tigerberget had never exceeded a thousand members, but in the first year of operations Menigheden actually had a membership of more than 2000 people.</p>
<p>Menigheden is always present at all of I.K. StartÂ´s matches, most notably at home games where they are located at a seperate section called the "M-field" (Menigheden-field). The main goal for Menigheden is to support Start in every game, to support the team in any way possible.</p>
<p>As Norwegian fans are very influenced by the British culture, singing is the most important aspect of Menighedens work at the games. But the South-European style of Tifo is growing in popularity in Norway, and Menigheden also take part in making great "Tifo-shows" before matches. The Tifo is usually large banners that display some supportive motif of Start, and often something disheartening display of the opposition. Current internal discussions in Menigheden is to whether drums should be used to cheer the team on.</p>
<p>BÃ¸rre Fredriksen is the current leader of Menigheden.</p>

<p>Ying Chow is a Chinese restaurant located in Adelaide, South Australia. It is within Chinatown, at 114 Gouger Street, Adelaide.</p>
<p>It is a small and extremely popular restaurant. Its food is not the run of the mill Chinese fare, but offers some interesting dishes, with a more traditional approach.</p>
<p>The Aniseed Tea Duck is simply sensational.</p>
<p>Its popularity is due to its high quality food, fast and efficient service, both of which are somewhat surprising giving the extremely humble fittings within the restaurant. Furthermore, Ying Chow offers amazing value for money, both with food and drink prices.</p>
<p>It is open very late, closing well past midnight on weekends. The late hours and cheap high quality food make it very attractive to workers from the hospitality trade.</p>
<p>Bookings are recommended, and just about compulsory during 'regular' dining hours. It is not uncommon to see several groups waiting outside for a table.</p>

<p>A sexual manuvuer that takes much preperation and practice to pull off without the man's partner knowing. It involves an anal sex willing partner, a penis sized funnel, a condom, baking soda, and vinnegar.</p>
<p>After starting the anal intercourse, the man will pull out of his partner's anus, leaving the condom in place. This would take much practice. Stealthily, insert the funnel in place of the man's penis. Pour a sizeable amount of baking soda into the condom, followed by vinnegar. The man procedes to remove the funnel, and squeeze his partner's butt cheeks together. He will then shake them about, and when questioned on what he is doing, he should reply with "I'm all shook up, uh-hu-uh" in the styling of Elvis Presley's "I'm All Shook Up".</p>
<p>After this, he will release his partner's buttocks and the vinnegar/baking soda will have had a chemical reaction in the condom and explode out of his partner's anus, much like a fourth grade science fair volcano. Food coloring may be added for extra effect.</p>

<p>The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) is a Type 2 Partnership which arose as a consequence of the inability of participants at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) to agree on targets for increased deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems.</p>
<p>The International Secretariat of REEEP is based in Vienna and it is supported by seven Regional Secretariats in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, South East Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Southern Africa. Activities in North Africa are co-ordinated through MEDREP.</p>
<p>The REEEP programme line was developed on the basis of nine regional consultative workshops held in 2003 and it was formally launched in London in October 2003.</p>
<p>REEEP seeks to stimulate accelerated adoption of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency by addressing two key aspects of service delivery in the energy sector, namely:</p>
<p>- policy and regulation - finance</p>
<p>In addition to high level collaboration among partners and other stakeholders, REEEP funds projects which are judged to provide better provision or utilisation of energy services by enabling the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These projects and the overall administration are supported by REEEP donors which include: UK, Ireland, Spain, Netherlands, Austria, USA, Italy, Germany and the European Commission. There are over 100 partners including governments, multi-national and smaller businesses, local authorities and NGOs.</p>

<p>An example of the Northeastern Ohio combinatorial style of fried chicken and cake donuts. Patrons are divided on whether the name is Bob's Chicken and Do-Nut, or Bob's Do-Nut and Chicken, and both are understood as accurate references to the establishment. Offering both drive-thru and walk-in transactions, Bob's is located on the main strip of Lorain, Ohio. Those who walk in will perceive that the frying is done in a large communal trough. To connoisseurs, this lends a taste of doughnut to the fried chicken, and a subtle note of fried chicken to the doughnut. This can be best experienced in one of the several combo options available for purchase. The parking lot accomodates several cars easily, providing space for customers to eat their chicken and doughnuts fresh from the deep fryer.</p>
<p>Bob's is a key establishment in Northeastern Ohio doughnut culture, one of the centers of doughnut production and appreciation in the U.S. Other notable establishments in this style, each known for its particular approach, include Presti's of Cleveland, Gibson's of Oberlin, and Kiezlowski's of Elyria. In addition, the area is known for its paczki's, which are available in most Polish bakeries prior to Easter.</p>
<p>Northeastern Ohio boasts a large Polish and Eastern European population whose culture has influenced the local food of the area (another example is the well-known Parma Pierogies). Lorain, a former steel town, is home to significant Puerto Rican and African American communities, as well.</p>

<p>Barry Posen, Professor of Political Science at MIT. He has written two books, Inadvertent Escalation: Conventional War and Nuclear Risks and The Sources of Military Doctrine. What follows is a description of one of his better known articles, "The Security Dilemma and Ethnic Conflict."</p>
<p>Argument: The end of the Cold War has accompanied an upsurge in nationalist, ethnic and religious conflict in Eurasia, but 'ancient hatreds' theory does not explain why there has not been equal problems among each group, eg. Ukrainians and Russians haven't really fought each other, while (Serbs and Slovenians) (Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims), and (Armenians and Azeris) have fought each other. The answer lies in the security dilemma (what a state does to increase one's own security causes other states to react, which in the end makes the first state less secure). "Here it is argued that the process of imperial collapse produces conditions that make offensive and defensive capabilities indistinguishable and make the offence superior to the defence." When an empire collapses, ethnic groups emerge which must quickly assess the strength and intentions of potential rival groups. In order to do this, they look at history, often by highlighting periods of conflict. The result is a worst-case analysis. Furthermore, the political geography often crates an 'offence-dominant world,' because ethnic groups are often dispersed among potential rival groups. The case of Croats and Serbs in the former Yugoslavia is offered as evidence for the theory. As Yugoslavia disintegrates, ethnic groups emerge that remember how each other acted (slaughtered) during World War II, the last time they were free from constraints. Offense has advantage because Serbs are 'marooned' in Croatian and Muslim territory. Power assets, access to wealth and military equipment varry. "Preventive war incentives were consequently high." Ultimately, Posen is pessimistic about the international communities ability to deal with such problems.</p>

<p>This magazine was launched with the objectives of encouraging debate, helping to increase Spanish artists` relevance internationally and creating a contact point with Latin America. It also aims to pay special attention to new media and net.art.</p>
<p>The deep transformations taking place in the territories of art require new forms of approach. Artistic practises are currently being contaminated by formulas coming from different fields, and they deserve a more complex analysis and demand new and diverse reading tools. We aspire to gather and reflect this complexity, and thus seek to create a space in progress, capable of fulfilling its role both as a seismograph and a detonator.</p>
<p>ARTECONTEXTO is a quarterly publication, with issues appearing in January, April, July and October. It is bilingual (Spanish-English), includes 156 pages in colour and black and white and is available at specialized bookstores. In Spain it is also distributed to news stands.</p>
<p>ARTECONTEXTO currently assists major contamporary art fairs, such as Art Basel Miami Beach, ARCO (Spain), and MACO (Mexico).</p>

The International Relations Institute of Cameroon, IRIC, is a top class educational mold serving African and world diplomacy.

IRIC takes on its status as the oldest school of diplomacy south of the perceptions and the experiences of countries of the southern hemisphere to the world community. By so doing, IRIC is fully taking part in the global effort of analyzing and understanding world affairs. IRIC's vision of international relations in the 3rd millennium leans towards helping countries of the South - and Africa in particular - to capture a more preeminent place and a better audience in the great concert of world nations: a fair share as per their actual merits.</p>

<p>Moshay is known as a number of things. There are various definitions for the word which I will explain below:</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Moshay Definition 1: The Sound</b> This is the most common understanding for what Moshay is. This definition of Moshay is a sound you can make with your mouth. You make this sound by jutting out your lips in the shape of a duck bill, but more spread out, and blowing gently. Variation is made by moving your upper lip up, and your lower lip down, and back and forth while blowing. You can also variate the sound by moving your hand to and away from touching your mouth while blowing. This was first practiced and invented approximately in the year 2003.</p>
<p><b>Moshay Definition 2: Nonsense Word</b> Moshay can also be a nonsense word. Such examples are "What the moshay," and "Shut the moshay up." When used in this context, the word could be a synonym to 'crap' or 'heck'. You may have never heard these terms before, but they are not in wide circulation yet. There is only a small spot in the United States that uses these terms as of now.</p>
<p><b>Moshay Definition 3: Last Name</b> Yes, there are actually some people-- lucky people they are-- that have the last name Moshay. It is a real last name. Here is an example of someone with the last name Moshay: <a href="http://www.petermoshay.com" class="external text" title="http://www.petermoshay.com" rel="nofollow">Peter Moshay</a></p>

Chuzzle is a highly addictive matching game for your computer. What everyone says proves true: Once you pop a chuzzle, you can never stop. Chuzzles are cute balls of fur that squeak and giggle when you push and pull them across the game screen. In the Deluxe version, rainbow and super chuzzles are also available.</p>

<p>137.44.1.200 21:37, 29 April 2006 (UTC)When James Browning left school he didn't fancy a 9-5 job, and he knew college wasn't for him - so he joined the circus instead.</p>
<p>Life's had a maverick twist every since - including stints as a comic impressionist (even appearing at the London Palladium) and then as a professional backgammon player - being crowned European Champion back in 1984.</p>
<p>James then made a smooth transition from backgammon to blackjack - but he was a little too smooth for many of the big casinos, and they were soon on the lookout for James - he was just too good and they wouldn't let him play.</p>
<p>Like many a card player before him, James finally discovered poker, and has become a major player on the UK circuit - particularly in the North East. He's also been achieving top finishes in European ranking tournaments and his lively wit and extensive gaming experience make him a valued member of the Poker Night Live commentary and analysis team.</p>

<p>It is increasingly being recognise that there is an increasing tendence towards chav culture in Oxford. Ringleader is Jon Cleland. According to local legend, Jon Cleland ruled the streets of Coventry in the seventeenth century. His great grandson continued to do so in the 1990s and stayed there pimpin and ruling as king chav for many a year, eventually he grew tired of the local turf wars and expanded his hood to Oxford becoming the first chav to ever gain a place at the university , Terrified Oxford student RK says:"Jon can now be seen pimping around the medic area, on da westside of Oxford with his many (upon many) lady friends. The science area is now officially Jons' kingdom where he reigns as the king of all the chavs." Big up yourself man, much respect to Jon Cleland-king of the Chavs.</p>

<p>In the late 20th century, an advanced alien race conquered Earth. They call themselves th "Masters". Other planets than Earth were conquered by the Masters, the only other one evident in the game is called Kullrathe, home to a species similar (in looks and physical abilities) to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minotaur.html" title="Minotaur">minotaur</a>. Earth is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Any of either species (Kullratheans refered to as "beasts") who happened to survive were enslaved. The Masters, a presumably sadistic race, have set up games in which one or more of the smartest, strongest and fastest of the slaves are placed within an environment controlled by the masters, with mines, patrol robots and turrets guarding an "exit" that they try and get to for the Masters' amusement.(in reality, the exit removes one from the environment, but the winner is still enslaved and get later put into another level) The story follows the games of two of the slaves, Jake the human and Garathe Den the beast. As they complete these horrible games, they gather scrap parts to assembleonto an escape vehicle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-01_14aa.html" title="Edit section: Paradiplomacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Paradiplomacy</span></h2>
<p>The concept of paradiplomacy comprises a whole set of international relations conducted by subnational, regional, local or non-central governments on their own, with a view to attaining their own objectives. This feature appears to be an aspect of the overall process of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalisation.html" title="Globalisation">globalisation</a>, under which a number of non-state actors plays an increasingly influential role in the international arena. Regions, federal states, provinces and cities seek their way to promote trade, investments, cooperation and partnership in a long list of subjects and account for a significant part of todayâs cross-borders contacts. This trend raises new interesting questions concerning <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_International_Law_9fee.html" title="Public International Law">Public International Law</a> and opens a debate on the future of the state system that has provided the grounds for the international political order in the last centuries.</p>
<p>Although the term "paradiplomacy" would be casually employed in the 1980's, it was introduced into the academic debate by the Basque scholar Panayotis Soldatos. The canadian author Ivo Duchacek further developed the concept and became one of its main theoreticians. Paradiplomacy may be performed both in support of and in complementarity to the central state conducted <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">diplomacy</a>, or come in conflict or compete with it. Duchacek points out a distinction between: a) cross-border regional microdiplomacy, b) transregional microdiplomacy and c) global paradiplomacy, to describe: a) contacts between non-central units situated across borders in different states, b) contacts between non-central units without a common border but situated in neighboring states and c) contacts between units belonging to states without common borders. A comprising view of the phenomenon should also consider contacts in a wide range of multilateral associations of local authorities.</p>
<p>Non-central governments may formally develop official international relations by: a) sending delegations in official visits; b) signing agreements, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memoranda_of_understanding.html" title="Memoranda of understanding">memoranda of understanding</a> and other instruments; c) participating in international "local" fora; d) establishing permanent representative offices or delegations abroad. Local governments seek international cooperation for economic, cultural or political reasons. In the economic field, it is known that most central governments cannot properly assist local communities in all their needs. They may lack expertise and cadres to fully understand local realities and to deal with their complexities. Local governments tend to think that central authorities do not show sufficient interest in helping them and find themselves perfectly able to pursue their own interest.</p>
<p>In the cultural field, some regions may seek to promote themselves internationally as an autonomous cultural entity. This is the case of the Spanish province of Catalonia and the Basque Country. Some regions my seek to cooperate with their diasporas worldwide and try to gain the support of their nationals abroad in attaining their diplomatic goals.</p>
<p>As to the political aspects, local governments may join efforts internationally to pressure their central governments into a desired course of action. This strategy is exemplified in the case of eight memoranda of understanding signed, in the years 1980, between three American states and three Canadian provinces to control and combat <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_rain.html" title="Acid rain">acid rain</a>, as the Reagan Administration and the American Congress could not reach a consensus on the matter. The cross-borders paradiplomatic efforts eventually led Washington to amend the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clean_Air_Act_e032.html" title="Clean Air Act">Clean Air Act</a> in 1990 and to sign with Canada, in 1991, the US/Canada Air Quality Agreement in which both countries agree on a timetable to reduce acid emmisions.</p>
<p>A particular kind of local political ativism is called "protodiplomacy", through which a local government may seek international support for their emancipation or independence plans. This is typically the case of the Canadian province of QuÃ©bec in the sixties, under the Parti QuÃ©becois.</p>

<p>Kelly Benjamin (born June 18, 1975) is a freelance writer, former political candidate, pirate radio pioneer, and general rabble rouser based in Tampa, Florida. He operated an underground unlicensed (pirate) radio station, 87X in Tampa until getting raided by the FCC in 1997. He later ran a grassroots political campaign for the Tampa City Council in the 2003 election and won one third of the vote. ....................... Kelly Benjamin was born at Tampa General in 1975 and raised in Tampa by his mother. He attended Stephen Foster Elementary School, Oak Grove and Van Buren Junior High Schools, and Chamberlain Senior High before graduating from King High School in 1994.</p>
<p>After high school, Mr. Benjamin attended the Ybor City campus of Hillsborough Community College for his freshman year before taking leave to create a community-based micropower radio station in Tampa (87X-Radio Free Tampa). From 1995 to 1997 Mr. Benjamin operated and managed a small, non-commercial, unlicensed, low-power radio station that sought to cater to the diverse needs of the central Tampa community.</p>
<p>In 1997, as the Department of Agriculture sent low-flying DC-3 planes across the city to spread a toxic pesticide called Malathion, Kelly Benjamin helped form a neighborhood activist group called the Citizens for the Responsible Application of Malathion (CRAM) to stage protests and lobby agaisnt the use of the toxic poison.</p>
<p>In November of 1997, 87X was shut down by the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Benjamin spent six months in a legal entanglement with the FCC in which he finally settled out of court in May of 1998. As a result of the historic civil disobediance activities of patriots such as Mr. Benjamin, the FCC finally agreed to open up a petition for rulemaking to allow for a low-power broadcasting network nationwide. Congress later passed a version of this legislation.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1998, Mr. Benjamin set off on a tour to visit other low-power radio stations all across the U.S. In the summer of 1998, Mr. Benjamin continued his tour to Europe and visited such famous European pirate stations as Radio Tonka in the Hague and Telios Radio in Budapest, Hungary. During this time, Mr. Benjamin also worked as a conversational English teacher in Budapest as well as an intern at Maslinova Gora, a Swiss-based humanitarian organization working with refugees in Veli Iz, Croatia.</p>
<p>In Febuary of 1999, Mr. Benjamin moved to Gainseville, Florida where he immediately became involved with social justice groups such as the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, Veterans for Peace, and assisted with Gainesville's community based micro-power radio station: Free Radio Gainesville. While living in Gainesville, Mr. Benjamin also attended Santa Fe Community College.</p>
<p>Returning to Tampa in January of 2000, Mr. Benjamin enrolled in the University of South Florida's Anthropology program. In the Summer of 2000, Mr. Benjamin hit the campaign trail as a correspondent journalist. He reported from the National Republican Convention in Philadelphia and the National Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. He also attended the Inauguration of George W. Bush in January of 2001 and 2005.</p>
<p>In April, 2001, Mr. Benjamin was the recipient of the the National Security Education Program's David L. Boren Scholarship to study abroad. Mr. Benjamin returned to Veli Iz, Croatia to work with Maslinova Gora. While in Europe, Mr. Benjamin also attended the Global Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany as well as visited war torn Serbia, and lived for a time in an abandoned army barracks in Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2002, Mr. Benjamin received a grant from the Globalization Research Center to participate in the Monteverde Institute's Globalization and Health program in Costa Rica. Benjamin received a Bachelor's degree in Anthropology (with a focus on Urban Studies) from USF in 2002.</p>

<p>Mike Spadafino is a college dropout from Bedford, New York. He is perhaps most known for his confusing depiction of his friend's, Scott Harper, jump into the net at Yankee Stadium. Spadafino told NewsChannel 4 correspondent Aimee Nuzzo, "He was just standing, leaning over the 'ting', and next 'ting' he's gone" (in an Italian accent only a guido can pronounce). Shockingly, in other published reports, Harper supposedly jumped on his own will, refuting Spadafino's accident theory. Spadafino is a true liar and will forever be shameful of his failure of a life. He was most recently spotted at a party chugging beers like it was his job.</p>

<p>Mead denotes a deity who is believed by monotheists to be the sole creator and ruler of the universe. Conceptions of Mead can vary widely, despite the use of the same term for them all.</p>
<p>The Mead of monotheism, pantheism or panentheism, or the supreme deity of henotheistic religions, may be conceived of in various degrees of abstraction: as a powerful, human-like, supernatural being, or as the deification of an esoteric, mystical or philosophical category, the Ultimate, the summum bonum, the Absolute Infinite, the Transcendent, or Existence or Being itself, the ground of being, the monistic substrate, etc. The more abstract of these positions regard any anthropomorphic mythology and iconography associated with Mead either sympathetically as mere symbolism, or unfavourably as blasphemous.</p>
<p>Theologians and philosophers have studied countless conceptions of Mead since the dawn of civilization. The question of the existence of Mead classically falls under the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, but is also one of the key discussions taking place within the field of the philosophy of religion.</p>

<p>Cozonac is a traditional romanian cake, usually prepared on the Christmas Eve, Good Friday and several other feasts. It is an yeast cake, prepared basically as bread, to which milk, sugar, eggs, butter and flavours are added. For the dough one only uses the egg yolk. The more of them, the better; in Moldova they sometimes use for 1 kilogram of flower about 12 yellows of an egg. This is the reason why the moldavian cozonac is recognized to be the best. The beaten white of the egg is mixed with cocoa, nuts and sugar and is used as filling. One should not underestimate the preparation process: when homeade, it takes quite some energy, skill and time. Romanians eat cozonac after a good meal or as a snack in the afternoon, and almost always accompanied by a glass of red wine, or simply by coffee.</p>

<pre>
Francelia M. Butler (1913-1998), author and professor.
</pre>
<p>Francelia McWilliams Butler was a reknowned expert in Children's Literature, author, journalist, and Professor of English at the University of Connecticut, Storrs (1968-1992). Known for her unique teaching style, Butler's bi-weekly Children's Literature classes were the most popular lectures on campus for more than 20 years, attracting multitudes of students and famous guest lecturers such as <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Sendak_4f95.html" title="Maurice Sendak">Maurice Sendak</a>, Carol Spinney (Sesame Street's Big Bird), and world-famous author Dr. Bejamin Spock.</p>
<p>Born Francelia McWilliams in Ohio in 1913 (she wrote a novel, The Lucky Piece about her childhood), she left America prior to World War II, becoming a reporter for the <i>Paris Herald Tribune</i> (later the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>). She met her husband, newspaper editor Jerome Butler, in Paris, but was forced to flee Europe days before the German invasion of France. Her husband died in the late 1940s, and after the war, she earned her doctorate from the University of Virginia, taught briefly at the University of Tennessee, and moved to Connecticut in 1968, where she lived until her death thirty years later. She had one daughter, Ann Waddell, who is a locally famous artist in Connecticut. Her entire collection of thousands of children's books and research titles was given to Hollin's College in Virgina, which named a section of its library in her honor.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler is also credited with starting the International Peace Games Festival, now a part of Yale University (www.yale.edu/peace). Some titles by Butler include <i>Skipping Around the World, The Lucky Piece, and Sharing Literature With Children.</i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Francelia McWilliams, when 24, was fired from her first job as the publicity director for the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, DC in 1937 when she allowed Black students to attend a function in the hotel. Disgusted with racial segregation in the United States, she left for Paris, and talked her way into a job as the drama critic for the International Herald Tribune newspaper.</p>
<p>Jerome Butler, a city editor at the Tribune, soon found that the perky but brazen young woman had no journalistic experience. He not only taught her how to write, but ended up marrying her as well. Francelia Butler was pregnant when the young couple fled Paris just as the German forces were marching in. They tied some of their belongings in blankets and started down the street on foot, towards the railway station. Taxis were not available, they had all been requisitioned by the army.</p>

<p>Jerome Butler, a city editor at the Tribune, soon found that the perky but brazen young woman had no journalistic experience. He not only taught her how to write, but ended up marrying her as well. Francelia Butler was pregnant when the young couple fled Paris just as the German forces were marching in. They tied some of their belongings in blankets and started down the street on foot, towards the railway station. Taxis were not available, they had all been requisitioned by the army.</p>
<p>Parisians did not want their treasures to fall into Nazi hands. Along the way, the proprietor of a fancy china shop offered them a set of tea service meant for the Duchess of Windsor. A gallery owner gave them paintings by some minor French artists. They tied the china and paintings in blankets, and kept with them in the train. On the way, German planes bombed the train and the back compartments with their luggage were destroyed. The china, up front with them, remained intact. Francelia Butler still had the china (and the paintings) when I first met her in late 1980s, and she gave me a cup and a saucer from the set.</p>
<p>The young couple's adventure was not yet over. A fellow passenger gave them a ride to the port where the ship to America was docked, and helped them aboard. In mid-Atlantic, their ship was threatened by a German submarine with torpedo attack. America was not yet at war, so they were allowed to pass. On reaching New York, the helpful fellow passenger was arrested by the FBI because he was a known Nazi spy. Dr. Butler's courses in children's literature at the University of Connecticut (where she taught for 21 years) were among the most popular, and drew eminent visitors including Dr. Benjamin Spock, the childcare guru, Nobel prize-winning writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, and internationally known illustrator and children's author Maurice Sendak. She retired when she was 79, with several books to her credit. In 1990, Francelia Butler launched the International Peace Games Festival that in its first year was attended by some 2,000 elementary school teachers and children from across US. The idea for the peace games came to her through her children's literature classes. She had her students create games that involved cooperation and negotiation instead of competition, conflict and rivalry. Her ideas spread quickly. Since 1993, peace games festivals, with participants from all over the world, have become an annual feature at Harvard, Yale, Columbia and a few other U.S. universities.</p>

<p>Sega Sonic Cosmo Fighter is a unique arcade game intended for children that was released December 31,1991.The machine resembles the shape of a spaceship. The player controls Sonic as he chases Eggman through space in a red space ship. A flight stick on the left side of the control panel maneuvers the shuttle in four directions,while firing and weapon toggling os controlled by two buttons adjacent to the flight stick. A lever to the right can be used for a burst of speed,which tilts the cabinet for a more realistic feel. At the end of each stage,Sonic must defeat Eggman in a giant boss ship. If you are successful in defeating him, a new weapon will be added to your arsenal.</p>

<p>A little-known aspect of owning rental properties in large U.S. cities is that city officials have found it politically expedient to blame landlords for crime that occurs in neighborhoods where their buildings are located. Housing inspectors, working with the police, target so-called "problem properties" by citing them with code violations which must be corrected for the business to continue to operate. The idea is that buildings owned by "slumlords" or "absentee landlords" cause crime and the crime will go away if these buildings are closed down. Condemnation of buildings thus becomes a prime crime-fighting tool for city governments.</p>
<p>This approach to crime was brought to a fine art in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, in the 1990s. At this point, a group of Minneapolis landlords banded together to bring a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis for its misuse of inspections powers. The lawsuit was thrown out court but the organization continued under the leadership of Charlie Disney, a nine-time ping-pong champion of Minnesota who operated one of America's largest parlors in that sport. The group of landlords engaged in political action. It picketed police stations and city hall and, once, closed down a meeting of the Minneapolis City Council.</p>
<p>This group, Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee, found that it could influence public opinion in the Twin Cities by hosting a monthly free-speech forum which was videotaped and shown on cable-television. A member of the group published a free-circulation newspaper. The payoff came in November 2001 when the incumbent mayor and seven of thirteen City Council members were voted out of office. The landlords were especially instrumental in removal of the City Council president. To a lesser degree, members of the group also played a role in the defeat of St. Paul's incumbent mayor in November 2005.</p>

<p>The example of Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee shows how a determined group of people, thinking outside the box, are able to fight City Hall successfully. 199.174.240.59 16:51, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mayor of Ecija, located in Spain, in 2006. Approved and oversaw a car park project that ended up uncovering the ruins of a 2,000 year old Roman city. He then proceeded to have the construction company bulldoze and cement over the ruins, to the dismay of the international archeological community. Prior to its destruction, it was considered one of the most important Roman finds. Wic justified this action by stating he was keeping an election promise to build the car park, and if it wasn't for the initial excavation to start that same project, the ruins wouldn't have been found to begin with. A tiny portion remains untouched to be used as a tourist attraction.</p>

<p><i>Sabrina: The Animated Series</i> debuted in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Comics_6f6c.html" title="Archie Comics">Archie Comics</a> star had already graced the Saturday morning airwaves in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, but the popularity of the live-action <i><a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina%2C_the_Teenage_Witch_%28sitcom%29_6038.html" title="Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (sitcom)">Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</a></i> sitcom in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> formed part of the basis for this spinoff series.</p>
<p>Unlike previous versions, Sabrina in this series was depicted as a 12-year-old attending <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_school.html" title="Middle school">middle school</a>. As in the original comic series, Sabrina lives with her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, and Salem Saberhagen, Sabrina's sarcastic <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cat</a> (voiced by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Bakay_1fea.html" title="Nick Bakay">Nick Bakay</a>, the voice of Salem in the live-action <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i> <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a>), all of whom advise Sabrina on the use of her powers.</p>
<p>In this series, the two aunts little resemble their comic counterparts in appearance (Hilda becomes a brunette, while Zelda's hair is turned reddish-blonde in color). They appear to be young (thanks to having been de-aged as part of an undefined punishment by the Witch's Council), but in the episode "Witchery Science Theatre," Zelda claims to be over 65 years old, and proves it with a scroll from an <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>. In the episode "Working Witches," they claim to have been hired by the king of Troy to "help interior decorate his fortress" by bringing in the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trojan_Horse_b8d1.html" title="Trojan Horse">Trojan Horse</a>, followed later in the episode by remarking that "we have 300 years under our belt, but our bodies are 16."</p>
<p>An original character created for this series is Uncle Quigley, Sabrina's maternal great-<a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle.html" title="Uncle">uncle</a> and the household's adult guardian.</p>
<p>Sabrina's best friends in this series were Chloe Flan (voiced by <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cree_Summer_13ad.html" title="Cree Summer">Cree Summer</a>) and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Kinkle_4ec6.html" title="Harvey Kinkle">Harvey Kinkle</a>. Chloe, an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> girl, is the only "mortal" (the name that witches give to ordinary <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>) besides Quigley that knows that Sabrina is a witch. Harvey, meanwhile, is the boy that Sabrina has a crush on. Together, the three friends lived in the fictional town of Greendale, and would engage in numerous adventures.</p>
<p>Most episodes centered around the typical problems of middle school, along with those that stemmed from Sabrina's inexperience with or misuse of <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. Sabrina and best friend Chloe would often use magic (often from the "Spooky Jar"âa spell-containing <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_jar.html" title="Cookie jar">cookie jar</a>âin the family's <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitchen.html" title="Kitchen">kitchen</a>) for all sorts of perceived emergencies, ranging from trying to fit into skinny new clothes to making Sabrinaâs boyfriend Harvey into a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a>. By the end of each episode, Sabrina would learn that using magic usually wasn't the solution to her day-to-day problems.</p>
<p>Sabrina's chief rival in the series is Gem Stone, a wealthy <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snob.html" title="Snob">snob</a> and Sabrina's classmate.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melissa_Joan_Hart_3159.html" title="Melissa Joan Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>, title star of the live-action sitcom, acted as producer of this series, but her younger sister, <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Hart_fdbf.html" title="Emily Hart">Emily Hart</a>, voiced Sabrina. Melissa instead voiced Sabrina's two aunts, Hilda and Zelda.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Steve_Holland_f172.html" title="Savage Steve Holland">Savage Steve Holland</a> (whose previous credits include producing <i><a href="../../../e/e/k/Eek%21_The_Cat_8ed5.html" title="Eek! The Cat">Eek! The Cat</a></i>) was the executive producer of <i>Sabrina: The Animated Series</i>. As such, the series reflected some of the irreverent style of humor seen on <i>Eek! The Cat</i>. Celebrity voice cameos in this series included <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._T_d006.html" title="Mr. T">Mr. T</a> and <a href="../../../22/w/e/_Weird_Al__Yankovic_79e3.html" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>.</p>
<p>The series ran in syndication (on <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney%27s_One_Too_990b.html" title="Disney's One Too">Disney's One Too</a></i> weekday afternoon block) and on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> (on <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney%27s_One_Saturday_Morning_82ef.html" title="Disney's One Saturday Morning">Disney's One Saturday Morning</a></i> block) for one season with 65 episodes produced.

This was soon followed by a follow-up animated series, <i>Sabrina's Secret Life</i>.

<p>The Go Hard Brothers are an experimental jazz electronic pop drum and bass outfit from south central regency Cheltenham. With their sythensisers, retro and straight up gangsta lyrics, the Go Hard Brothers take no prisoners. Their work is inspired mostly by the world reknowned hip-hop radio DJ Tim "The Big Dawg" Westwood.</p>

<p><b>Truely the future of drum and base - 5/5</b> 04-Feb-2006 01:48:07 PM Reviewer: JassyS</p>
<p>First there was Elvis. Then the Beatles. Then Michael Jackson. Then for a long time, there was nothing, until now.</p>
<p><br />
The Go Hard Brothers are an example of what happens when two musical prodigys fuse their minds as one, and create music which dares to challenge the dreary bland mess that the current music scene is in. Set up recently, they have moved from strength to strength and are widely tipped by many to break into the lucrative US market within the coming months.</p>
<p><br />
Their latest additions include the instant classic "You Ain't Got NUTHIN" which takes the listener on a magical journey through drum and base, brought back to earth with strong powerful messages from both Go Hard Brothers themselves. But perhaps the jewel in the crown which is this album comes in the form of "The Jazz," a 1 minute 38 ballad of sheer adrenaline, passion, ecstacy. From a personal point of view I felt it provided a challenge to people with a stereotypical view of drum and base, almost screaming, "forget what you know. This is the truth now."</p>
<p><br />
The future looks bright for these two young men and they must learn to cope with life under the media spotlight from now on. But one thing is for sure, the face of popular drum and base music has changed - changed forever.</p>
<p><b>A new genre is born! - 5/5</b> 29-Mar-2006 08:23:02 AM Reviewer: jay87cee</p>
<p>Go Hard Brothers..hhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmm,,,</p>
<p>Well with a name like that the connotations are as endless as the sheer raw talent displayed by these brothers with they're debut album.</p>
<p>I sat in my chair, relaxed and press play and was literally blown away by the cutting edge material I was hearing!!!</p>
<p><br />
This really is a new frontier in modern music, forget Faithless and Prodigy, these gentlemen will reach nothing less than the kings of the nu-age dancefloor.</p>
<p>What's the recipe for a revolutionary album?</p>
<p>Well my honest answer is I don't know but you would definately get a solid answer from these bad boys because they are here to stay.</p>
<p>A genuinely new genre which takes on the creativity of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart........genius</p>
