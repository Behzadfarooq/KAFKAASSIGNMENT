<li>Falls beneath the bar of Wikipedia <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">not being an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. And I've gone to silly lengths googling "Sabrevision", "Jesus TM", etc. to be completely confident. <b>Delete</b>; but perhaps the author would be so generous as to add any additional relevant information and maybe a photo or two from different stages of his life to the article on Joshua's <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hellyer_ebee.html" title="Paul Hellyer">clearly notable grandfather</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 12:11, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The ability to Google Jesus TM certainly does not indicate the relevance of a film, as my attempt to google it brought about 2 million hits back. It is obviously difficult to discern the importance or lack thereof of the lesser-known entries, but I think this article should be kept. In the outline for wiki articles, the criteria lists that artists who have sold 5000 cds or more are included, as are people who have written articles read by 5000 or more. Jesus TM, though difficult to google, is certainly a relatively well-known film, and has been seen by more than five thousand people. Likewise Sabrevision. <b>Keep</b>; . Muract 4:01, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You clearly have a vested interest in the article. "Jesus TM" brings up about 2,500 hits, <b>not</b> 2 million, and I was unable to find a <b>single</b> hit about a film with Joshua Hellyer in it -- everything I found was either an irrelevant book title in which Jesus was the final word before the trademark symbol, or a joking reference to corporate trademarking of religion. Likewise "SabreVision", which mainly brings up references to an airline reservation system; I could not find <b>one single solitary hit</b> for a television show hosted by Joshua Hellyer. Proof by "because I said so" is not valid; you need to provide sources to back up your claims. Also, I note that this was your first-<i>ever</i> edit to Wikipedia under this user name; you need to be aware that such votes are normally disregarded. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:17, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't aware that making an informed comment on a topic on which I am knowledgeable is against Wikipedia policy. You may therefore disregard my vote if you would like. The two million number is searching for Jesus TM without quotes. The reason for this is because the actual title of the film has the trademark in superscript beside the Jesus, and therefore the film could appear under many variations of the name (the film is a satiric view of the media). I think we could agree that Jesus is a word that appears somewhat often on the world wide web. The ability to not find the correct Jesus TM in two million hits seems a poor excuse for deletion. I came across this site while googling Joshua Hellyer, whom I know. I have also seen Jesus TM. The indie film world, especially the short film world, is a world where "because I said so" is often as good as you can get. Short of providing pictures of the many screenings of the film, there's little way to back my claims, but this is the case with most short films that haven't won academy awards. I don't believe that because of this unfortunate reality successful short films, or the actors who appear in them, should be destined for obscurity. Muract 19:17, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well, unfortunately, the bottom line on Wikipedia is <i>verifiability</i> of information, meaning that the inability to find an independent reference about the film <i>is</i> a reason for deletion. So far, this article has no verifiable details whatsoever. Googling Joshua Hellyer's name brings up a grand total of 13 hits: five that are either Wikipedia pages or mirrors of Wikipedia pages, two for an American university student, and five for a completely unrelated Joshua Hellyer who lived in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> over 200 years ago. I can find exactly <i>one</i> web page referring to this Joshua Hellyer appearing in a film, and that film isn't even <i>Jesus TM</i>. In a nutshell: the onus is on <i>you</i> to provide proof of his notability, <i>not</i> on anyone to provide proof of the obverse. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:58, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Here's what I came up with in a few minutes of searching: <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/web/about_yorku/yorku_magazine/YorkU_Dec03_FINAL.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.yorku.ca/web/about_yorku/yorku_magazine/YorkU_Dec03_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorku.ca/web/about_yorku/yorku_magazine/YorkU_Dec03_FINAL.pdf</a> , which is a magazine that has a page layout about the movie. <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?IssueDate=5/9/2003&amp;section=York%20in%20the%20Media" class="external free" title="http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?IssueDate=5/9/2003&amp;section=York%20in%20the%20Media" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?IssueDate=5/9/2003&amp;section=York%20in%20the%20Media</a>, which is a press page for York University. This press page also cites another newspaper article, which I haven't been able to find online. This is a page from a speech that the director, Jordan Hellyer, did, which mentions Jesus TM: <a href="http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocknreelfestival.ca/indiefilmseminar.htm</a>. I know that articles about the film appeared in a few other newspapers, which I haven't been able to locate online. Because something is difficult to locate in the digital arena doesn't mean it should be earmarked for deletion. The onus shouldn't be on me to provide proof of it's notability, because it's implicit in the article existing in the first place. Wikipedia isn't a talent contest, it's an encylopedia for things that people might be interested in knowing. Joshua might get deleted because his accomplishments are not famous, but I could randomly search for any combination of names on Wikipedia and find people that I've never heard of. I don't try and have those people deleted because I cannot verify their accomplishments. The hit that you mentioned for a new film that Joshua is in would re-enforce my argument. Regardless of the descision made about this article, I wanted the perspective of someone who is knowledgable about the topic to be heard. Muract 00:32, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
