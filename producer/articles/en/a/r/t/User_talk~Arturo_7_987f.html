<p>Thanks for uploading Image:000 7289.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<dd>Thanks for uploading such a cool picture of yourself. However, it needs an image tag. If you are the image creator, decide which tag you want to use. Here are a few tags you can choose from. Pick one, click 'edit' on your image, and add the tag at the end of the image editing page, on its own line. If you're not the artist, ask the artist which tag you should use. Thanks!</dd>

<p>Just a note: you are using the word "falsifiable" wrong on your user page. You have currently written: <i>The Genesis account is a falsifiable truth, as it cannot be proven wrong but that doesn't exactly mean it's right.</i> "Falsifiable" means, roughly "can be proven wrong," so "it cannot be proven wrong but that doesn't exactly mean it's right" is only correct if you mean that the theory in question is <i>not</i> falsifiable. Just though I would try to clarify that, since it looks like either a misunderstanding of the meaning or else a typo.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You may also want to be aware that Java Man was almost certainly not a gibbon. Among other problems, the skull is much to large. See <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/gibbon.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/gibbon.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Also, the claim about part of it being found 70 miles away is a misunderstanding arising from the same group discovering 70 miles away the Wadjak skull pictured here <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/wadjak.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/wadjak.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:26, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks JoshuaZ for the awareness. Perhaps the femur was more recnt that the skullcap, so then as a matter of fact we must assume that they were not even related species. Java man had 940 cc, perhaps being most likely some king of athrophied human or something like that. You just got the skullcap. Java man is allegedly a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_erectus.html" title="Homo erectus">homo erectus</a>, just like the Peking man, right? That's just trusting in C14 dating, and for your sadness a recently dead seal in Antarctica was dated 1300 years old by C14. How could it have been 1300 years old if it had been killed 3 days ago?--<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 03:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't want to get in an extended discussion with you about this on Wiki (if you want to continue over email, that would be fine). I was merely pointing out that Java man was not at all Gibbon like. Also, I did not intend to make any claim that Java man is by itself very useful evidence- we have many other homo erectus remains at this point. Your others claims are similarly flawed or misguided. Note for example, that seals could easily be found to be much older by C14 dating than they are due to the reservoir effect (which is why when dating marine life using C14 one often needs to think carefully about what sort of life it was and what its habitat was (and why one in fact often uses other methods to cross-calibrate)). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I don't believe there is a Portal:Evolution. Second, even if this hypothetical portal did treat evolution as a fact, that would only be an NPOV problem under a limited set of circumstances- for example if it noted that the vast majority of scientists accept evolution, or called it a "scientific fact" - the first would be defintely acceptable, and the second would be possibly with NPOV. Third, even if there were a Portal:Evolution the correct thing to do would be to bring up possible NPOV issues there not create a rival portal with the other POV (please see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I mistook, in Biology portal evolution is treated as a fact. There's a WikiProject for evolution. And the main idea for this Creationism portal is not supporting it, it's rather debating issues between evolution and creation. A skeptical developing a creationism portal. Notice that is NOT a creationist portal (it would be more likely to support creationism as it's cevouted to it the term "creationist"), it is a CREATIONISM one, regarding it as a valid topic. Stop bothering with nonsense. You might be blind if you don't see the clear NPOV violation across Biology Portal. This portal will be treated according to Wikipedia's NPOV policy, rather than "consensus-defined" topics like mainstream science. Or does the word consensus mean true to you? If the entire catholic church has an unproven consensus over Mary's virginity, does it make it true? No. Consensus are for unproven stuff and their belief is a matter of faith, as they cannot be proven right. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 02:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, Wikiprojects are often given more leeway than normal space pages(since they are not encyclopedia content). Second, a Portal that claims that Creationism has "its roots in the truth behind the creation from a biblical perspective" is hardly NPOV regardless of what comments you make. Third, if you thinkt here is an NPOV problem at the bio portal, then bring it up there. However, there isn't one- the vast majority of biologists support and acknowledge evolution and to give any credence to creationism as a scientific idea would be undue weight. Fourth, even your claims contradict themselves because in the portal title you say that it is biblical and that it is scientific - theology and science are not the same things. As for the meaning of consensus, where science articles are concerned, we have well developed understanding of how to handle these matters. Remember, Wikipedia never cares about what is true, it cares about what is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm curious as to what directly on the bio page you think is so POV. At present there seems to be little evolution on the page. Did you have a specific sentence in mind? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's hard NOT to figure out what is so POV.. Just look at the <b>Major fields in Biology</b>... don't you read the <b>Tree of Life</b> and numerous references to <b>evolutionary biology</b>? And take a look at the millions of evolutionist references in all of those themes. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 03:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand, so now referencing evolution is POV? Do you think those aren't major areas of biology? Are you arguing that there are not thousands of researchers in those areas? I would think that even most diehard creationists would agree that these are major areas of biology. They might think that the conventional understanding of those areas is wrong, or they might think that the entire basis for those areas is flawed, but they would agree that those are major areas. Am I missing something here?

<dd>They refer as if they were essential and factual fields of biology. And oh I'm sorry, they're not. They're everything but a fact.

<dd>I didn't touch the intro, someone else did.

Also as I've attempted to explain before, Wikiprojects and portals are different and have very different rules applying to them.

<dd><small>(reduce indent)</small> It seems to me that Arturo is really trying to create what should be a blog or private web page, not a WikiPortal. In addition, the selection of categories seems to be clearly POV driven, rather than following any logical rationale. For example, I'm at a loss as to how "Jesus" plays a part -- that seems to be a bit outside the issue. I'll need to look over the portal page further to see if any other clearly POV-driven cats/subjects/etc., play a part. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 09:51, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Er what? Your saying that Jesus shows that creationism and christianity are incompatible? I know a few people who think that, but given your earlier comments that seems a bit odd coming from you. Incidentally, you may want to be aware that a Wikiproject and a portal are very different- projects are behind the scenes for organizational purposes, not encyclopedic in themselves. Thus, projects should not be listed in "related portals" <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is my first portal, and I'm working on the scheme of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Portal%7EBiology_c9fb.html" title="Portal:Biology">Biology Portal</a> for it. I'm sure I'll make mistakes, like listing projects in related portals or putting a NPOV-violating intro, but it'd be smarter to correct these mistakes instead. And as a matter of fact, if you claim that this portal has a NPOV violation, tell me WHERE and I'll correct it. Just look at the numerous references to anti-creationism stuff, like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_drift.html" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> and the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_theory_dd9e.html" title="Big Bang theory">Big Bang theory</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 16:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Er, I'd be highly surprised if the bio portal had anything about the Big Bang (that's physics and cosmology, not bio and has nothing to do with biological evolution)- a glance through confirms that there isn't anything there. At present your portal seems mainly NPOV, if any specific issues come up, I will be happy to point them out. (I also took the liberty of reincluding the project list and labeling them as projects rather than portals which should deal with that). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Only the very large portals with a lot of contributors change things daily. If you want a possible way of doing it I would ask on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good news, we were given permission to use the images! I've put them back up, but I'm thinking of adding a different one for the second one. Have you seen the Historical Society's picture of the back of the stone? I think it's a better picture of the symbols we are describing in the article, so I may upload it later today.--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:25, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, thanks so much! Currently I'm trying to re-edit the <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_vineyard.html" title="Noah's vineyard">Noah's vineyard</a> article as it was created when I was almost going to sleep so it lacked of any encyclopedic content at all, so that's why I erased it. I'll re-edit it and perhaps I'll look for more OOParts like that. Seems like a great topic for debate. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 18:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While I've got you on the line here, could we standardize OOPArts? I see them listed alternately as OOPArts and OOParts - I believe the former is the more correct, since "Art" is a separate word. As it is now, it looks like we're talking about "Out Of Parts" instead of "Out Of Place Art's." Thanks--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm not sure Noah's Vineyard is an OOPArt, judging from what I've dug up about it. There's so little material on it, and most of it from Wyatt himself, don't you think it would do better as a section on the Wyatt page than a little stub in its own right?--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:31, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've thought something else about it. On Wyatt's entry it already lists his claimed discoveries, so we could take a deep look at them and create an entry like Ron Wyatt's alleged discoveries for a general detailed view for all of them (ranging from <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_of_the_Covenant_ce22.html" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> and the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 18:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is there enough literature on that not written by Wyatt? I agree that could be very interesting.--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... on <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a> I've seen a lot of TV shows related to it, specially on the History Channel, and some about Wyatt's findings about the Exodus on a few creationists sites. I'll check them out on Google.<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 18:40, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just did a little Googling myself - don't know how reliable tentmaker.org is, but they've sure got Wyatt's number! Also, [<a href="http://www.ldolphin.org/wyatt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ldolphin.org/wyatt.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. Work it up and we'll see how it goes - there is already some analysis of Wyatt's findings on the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wyatt_9533.html" title="Ron Wyatt">Wyatt</a> page, and we wouldn't want things to get too redundant.--<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurabianNights_0009.html" title="User:TurabianNights">TurabianNights</a> 18:42, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm currently working on it, but I'll go out to my beach house for a few days (short vacation here in Chile =D) and I'll edit it later on next tuesday or wednesday.

<dd>Oh calm down. Labeling most of these people creationists is akin to labeling <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibonacci.html" title="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> as geocentrists. I have not however, reverted you in four recent cases: <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thomson%2C_1st_Baron_Kelvin_0b2c.html" title="William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin">William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Young_Simpson_b9d6.html" title="James Young Simpson">James Young Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Mendel_b43a.html" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolus_Linnaeus_b3d7.html" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> since creationism is relevant to them and some of them were more later time period where creationism was a distinct view in contrast to other viewpoints.

<dd>OMG.....I'm NOT talking about being involved. I talk about a NEUTRAL point of view. Saint Isaac Newton WAS a creationist, like it or not. And do u think that if all past creationists were alive 2day they'd believe in evolution? Oh, assh*le.. B disappointed... Evolution and old-earth thought are PRETTY old. Democritus, for example, was an old earth creationist. And even post-darwin .scientists didn't back up evolution, like <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Kelvin_3362.html" title="Lord Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Agassiz_1837.html" title="Louis Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Glaisher_b76c.html" title="James Glaisher">James Glaisher</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joule_4124.html" title="James Joule">James Joule</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pasteur_5462.html" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Mendel_b43a.html" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ambrose_Fleming_8abd.html" title="John Ambrose Fleming">John Ambrose Fleming</a> and MANY more.

<dd>Again, calm down. Pasteur wasn't (hence I just removed him) see <a href="http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Also, I think your defintion of well known scientisit is a bit small. And you seem to be confusing anti-evolution or skeptical of natural selection or favoring guided evolution etc. with creationism. As for other well known scientists, it isn't that relevant, but oh Sagan and Hawkins come to mine. Or Gould. Or about 10 others. But I have dinner now. In the meantime, please stop posting the category everywhere. And be mindful of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh no, Pasteur was NOT a creationist according to who? A EVOLUTIONIST SITE? lol... you are so lame. do u no what a well-known scientist is someone who has made science greater. Galileo's telescope. Saint Isaac Newton's gravity. Pasteur's pasteurization.. what has Gould done 4 science except for promovin a THEORY? (evolution is just a theory, unluckily 4 u it hasn't been proven right EVER) <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 21:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And researching again, guess what..... SAINT LOUIS PASTEUR was a creationist!&#160;:) Pasteur’s works on abiogenesis should have dealt the death blow to the idea of spontaneous generation. But spontaneous generation is an essential part of the theory of evolution. Despite all the efforts of evolutionary scientists, not one observable case of spontaneous generation has ever been found. Pasteur’s findings conflicted with the idea of spontaneous generation (as do all scientific results since). Consequently, Louis Pasteur was a strong opponent of Darwin’s theory. And keep on trying! The origin of the universe is a dicotomy: was or not created by God? That leads 2 3 types of answers, the yes, the no and the dunno. The yes stands for young earth creationism, the no for naturalist evolution and the dunno for theistic evolution. Saint Louis Pasteur couldn't have supported any form of evolution, haven't u heard of <b>HIS</b> Law of Biogenesis? Keep on trying evo-loser. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 21:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many problems with what you've put above. First, abiogenesis and evolution are distinct issues. <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> only cares about what happened once there was life, not how it got here. As far as evolution cares, life could have been made by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, aliens, the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a>, <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>. Second, I don't know why you insist on this odd defintion of a "well-known scientist" since well-known generally means known by many (and on a related note, all scientists have "made science greater" that's what they do). Gould wrote many scientific papers and made extensive research and contributions in a variert of fields, so by your defintion he would be well-known. Third, in any case, the well-knownish issue is irrelevant; the issue is whether each of these articles should be marked as creationist. Fourth, spontaneous generation and abiogenesis are not the same thing at all. Nor for that matter does anyone claim that abiogenesis is currently ongoing on earth (one reason so many people want to send probes to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa.html" title="Europa">Europa</a> is because it might be occuring there) I suggest you read up on them and try to learn how they are different. Fifth, as to your claim that "hasn't been proven right EVER"- science doesn't care about proof for anything. Proof is for alcohol and math. At best science can give overwhelming evidence for a claim. Now assuming you mean no prediction of evolution has ever been found to be correct. I think the many pharmacologists and other doctors who use evolution to help model predict and test drugs would be a bit surprised by that claim to name just one example area. Sixth, if you actually read the relevant page I put above instead of dismissing it as a "EVOLUTIONIST SITE" you might notice that it gives a quote that makes it pretty clear that he wasn't a creationist by most definitions. Seventh, your attempted trichotomy (not a dichotomy since there are three options) is highly flawed. Among other problems with it, it ignores the existence of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_earth_creationism.html" title="Old earth creationism">Old earth creationism</a> and ignores the fact that theistic evolution is not as you make it somehow associated with agnosticism but is in fact a form of theism. I'm also puzzled as to why you feel a need to put the word "saint" in front of Pasteur and Newton's names. I'm not aware of any religion in which they have been canonized. Finally, regarding "Keep on trying evo-loser" I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. And to just rehash the primary point, none of this is relevant as to whether in individual articles the cats should be there or not. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfolding astonishing ignorance once again, how surprising? You claim <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abiogenesis.html" title="Abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a> are not the same thing. Ok, they're not, but haven't u heard of naturalist evolution?? It claims that life came out of nowhere, just like <a href="../../../l/e/e/LeeLee_Sobieski_5c43.html" title="LeeLee Sobieski">LeeLee Sobieski</a>'s career. And perhaps NO evolution model has ever been able to answer where did life come from. Life just doesn't pop out of inorganic matter, it hasn't happened and it won't ever. Second, u think <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Jay_Gould_f91c.html" title="Stephen Jay Gould">Gould</a> is even a "respected" scientist? lmao.. "well-known" scientists are people who have done something USEFUL. Did Louis Pasteur just write a paper? Absolutely not. He created pasteurization, the germ theory and he's the father of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microbiology.html" title="Microbiology">microbiology</a>. Is Gould father of something else than his evolutionary ideas and marxism? not at all. Are u comparing Sagan and Hawkins with Saint <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, Saint <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Kepler_51d5.html" title="Johann Kepler">Johann Kepler</a>, Saint <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasius_Kircher_5c70.html" title="Athanasius Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a>, Saint <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, Blaise Pascal, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Steno_cbf2.html" title="Nicolas Steno">Nicolas Steno</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo.html" title="Galileo">Galileo</a>????????? You must be the king of shit mountain then. They had more science in their little finger than in Gould's white fat ass. Third, trust me, I'm not interested in trying to find "popping-out" forms on life in Io, Europa or whatever. Life is on earth and there's no doubt about it. Are there any insects living in the Moon? Or kittens in Mars? Not at all. Fifth, unproven theories are anything but science. Flat earth is a theory and is definitely not science. And, oh little disappointing, I wouldn't be surprised if pharmacologists developed something as it has NOTHING to do with the origin of universe. Maybe speciation in microbes but what does it have to do with evolution?. Sixth, I read it. I've read the entire site, and trust me, it's bullshit. Most of their claims make no scientifical sense. I wouldn't be surprised if that quote was invented by them. Seventh, do you know what a dichothomy is? Two based answers. Theistic evolution is not an answer, it's just a mix of both. Theistic evolution is just trying to believe in God but with evolution and go to hell in peace. Do you think <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Earth_creationism_b65e.html" title="Old Earth creationism">OECs</a> truly believe in God? I wouldn't be surprised if most of them are leftists. It is a form of theism, so what?? Evolution is a religion itself. The origin of the universe is a question that can only be answered by religions, like christianity and evolution. And eighth, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonization.html" title="Canonization">canonization</a> is stuff of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_church_512a.html" title="Roman Catholic church">Roman Catholic church</a> and I'm definitely not catholic. I'm a christian and I believe in the literal understanding of the Bible, and the Bible says that every believer is a saint. It makes more sense to me that true believers like <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Kepler_51d5.html" title="Johann Kepler">Johann Kepler</a> to be called <b>saint</b>, instead of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a>, for example. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArturo_7_9c44.html" title="User:Arturo 7">Arturo #7</a> 19:18, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is going to most likely be my last reply on the matter since Wikipedia is not for debating but for constructing encyclopedia articles and this seems to be far off the original point. First, by "naturalistic evolution" you seem to mean <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_naturalism.html" title="Philosophical naturalism">philosophical naturalism</a> which has little or no bearing on evolutin. And again, evolution doesn't say life came from nowhere, it just doesn't care. Where life came from is a question for biochemistry not biology. To use an analogy, if you ask me how I made some potato dish, and I give you all the steps starting with buying the potato at the store you don't reject my instructions and recipe because I don't know how the potato got to the store. It simply isn't relevant to the information I am trying to impart to you. I'm still puzzled by your defintion of "well-known." This may be a linguistic issue (I don't know what your native language is) but in English well-known simply means known by many. Your insistence that it has something to do with their work having applications is unique to you. In any event, as to the people you have mentioned, I think it would be hard to find much in the way of practical applications by Kepler or Galileo. I'm also puzzled by your claim that "more science in their little finger than in Gould's white fat ass" in that I don't know how you intend to measure levels of science (and to the sentence before that please mind the personal attacks). As to your not being interested in abiogenesis on other planets, you interest or lack thereof isn't relevant, and the idea that insects on the moon or kittens on mars would somehow be expected indicates a deep misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. Among other problems with that comment, the same thing would evolve twice with probability 0 and given how different the Martian and lunar environments are from earth's one would expect any life on them (if there were(there certainly isn't on the Moon)) to be radically different from life on earth (at minimum, there is no reason to expect <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chitin.html" title="Chitin">chitin</a> to evolve on multiple planets).</dd>
<dd>As to your fifth point, if you think "proof" has anything to do with science and continue to insist that "unproven theory" is somehow a bad thing that makes something not science, I strongly suggest you read a book on the philosophy of science or at least the intro chapter of most college science textbooks. As to the pharmacology point- perhaps I wasn't clear enough. A large amount of pharmacology research and related research using the evolutionary links between species to predict what species are good for modeling what (for example predicting that mice are good for modeling the human immune system). As to your related point about the origin of the universe- I don't know how many times I need to repeat this, evolution isn't about that, or about abiogenesis or much else. Please read <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> to get some idea what it is about. For all evolution cares the universe could have been created by God or Vishnu or could have been always around. It doesn't matter at all.</dd>
<dd>Sixth- calling a site "bullshit" does not in anyway actually refute any point, and you'll forgive me if given your track record I don't immediately decide to trust your view of what constitutes bullshit.</dd>
<dd>Seventh- as to the defintion of "dichotomy" it might help if you checked a dictionary. A dichotomy is two mutually contradictory possibilities. By defintion, a dichotomy cannot be a continuum, there is no middle ground. As to your claim that "Theistic evolution is just trying to believe in God but with evolution and go to hell in peace." and related claims, you may want to consider that you don't have a personal monopoly on faith nor on interpreting the Bible nor on anything else. I am shocked and appalled that anyone would have the arrogance to decide who goes to hell and who doesn't. Do you think on the final judgement you will be sitting at Jesus's right hand and telling him whether people should go to hell or not based on how old they thought the earth was? "Sorry, I know you have faith in me and accepted me as your lord and Savior and my blood washed away all your sins, but Arturo here says you thought the world was too old so you are going into the fire reserved for the devil and his angels"? Do you really think God is going to damn people based on believing how old the world is? Your comment about leftists is almost as appalling- the notion that somehow modern political alignments have something to do with whether people are good or evil or saved or lost or whatever is off the wall. And what for that matter do you even mean by "leftist"? After all, in most countries today it is the right that is in favor of capital punishment, and yet Jesus said "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone." I could go on for hours, the point is that neither the "left" nor the "right" in any country have an agenda which has much to do with what Jesus preached. As to your insistence that evolution is a religion, again evolution doesn't care about the origin of the universe and such. And even if it, would that magically make it a religion? Do you see evolutionist churches or temples? Are there evolutionist doctrines? Do they call anathema on <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamarck.html" title="Lamarck">Lamarck</a>?</dd>
<dd>Finally, as to asserting that Newton and Kepler were "true believers"- Newton had is own peculiar beliefs which rejected the Trinity and Kepler had similarly odd beliefs, not exactly true believers. It might help if you would do a little research before you claimed everyone as your own. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I totally disagree with creationism, but I agree it would be useful to the debate to have this so called list of evidence. And I will not "vandalise" it by putting in al the obvious refutations. Go ahead and bud your list. But, to me it has nothing to do with science, it has everything to do with religion. You cannot deny others the right to categorise your articel as they feel appropraite. I'll leave your science-stub tag there if you'll leave my reli-stub there.</p>
<p>Otherwise, game on for an all out war to destroy your article, as being totally and obviously not NPOV. Your choice!--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardb43_7e1e.html" title="User:Richardb43">Richardb43</a> 12:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No idea, I've never read the page. Perhaps if you refered to that page in your page it would be useful and informative. Obviously though, both are going to be POV. But hey, I said I support your right to have a view point, even though I strongly disagree with it. But I am interested to be more informed about what I "blindly" disagree with.

<p>Please do not have a debate in this evidence of creation page. Even more so, do not pretend to have a debate, where you put up what you suggest are evolutionists' (weak) arguments, and then yourself counter them. To do so will only invite a lot of counter debate from evolutionists.</p>
<p>The page will be more useful just as a basic list of your claims of the Evidence for Creation, or, as you seem to be doing, putting up evidence againt evolution (which is not really the same thing at all, but we can let that pass)</p>

<dd>Per Richard, the article seemed like a soapbox. That is inexcusable even for talk pages, but for articles it represents a whole new level of nerve. I've accordingly made some major changes and have described my reasons in the talk page.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 06:12, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Admin Coaching, now being coordinated by <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighwayCello_1384.html" title="User:HighwayCello">HighwayCello</a>, is a program for people who want help learning some of the more subtle aspects of Wikipedia policy and culture. People are matched with experienced users who are willing to offer coaching. The program is designed for people who have figured out the basics of editing articles; they're not newcomers any more, but they might want some help in learning new roles. In this way, Esperanza would help keep hope alive for Wikipedia because we would always be grooming the next generation of admins.</p>
