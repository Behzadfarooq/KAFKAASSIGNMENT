<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a club that has been in existence for some time. I am personal friends of many members, and the society serves primarily as a social group, though their networking and significant influence is well known. There are various items of clothing that are available for members, who suprisingly for a secret society, are happy to wear them around the university. I think photographs of the apparel would certainly lend to this group's credibility.</li>

<li>I can at least verify that <i>some</i> of the claims of this article are true. Whilst the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> links are probably bordering on impossible to prove and tenuous at best, I can attest that the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantom.html" title="Phantom">Phantom</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_College_9093.html" title="St Paul's College">St Paul's College</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_fa65.html" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a> links are irrefutible. Whilst I didn't attend <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_College_9093.html" title="St Paul's College">St Paul's College</a>, rather <a href="http://www.standrewscollege.edu.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.standrewscollege.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">St Andrew's College</a>, I do know that most of the things argued in this article are true. I also know that the society is not as secret as they make out. <i>The Rock</i> is an actual place next to a public thoroughfare within the grounds of the college. This article, whilst possibly a vanity piece, does have some truth. Perhaps we should give them an opportunity to introduce some more facts and remove some of the more tenuous claims. I know of at least one Australian CEO who was a President of this society. 138.130.23.157 14:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC). I don't care if the article gets dumped, but the facts, although I hate to admit it, are mostly true, barring what I mentioned previously about Skull and Bones

<li>Personal testimony isn't what we mean by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. We need to have an outside reference, preferably a print reference although a website will do, that is one which readers will acknowledge as reliable; the contents of which can be inspected; and which confirms the claims. A newspaper article would do, or a reference in a book, or a university's official website, or something like that. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:29, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I was surprised to come across mention of SUCKS here as I wasn't certain of the existence of the organisation, however mere mention of the society here has verified many specific details that I had already heard elsewhere in the past about the body. While not connected to Sydney University in any way (I am, in fact, based in the United States), I first heard mention of the organisation a few years ago in conversation with an Australian stockbroker in his sixties. What I can tell you is that the society certainly is real, as regular contact with this financier and some of his associates subsequently confirmed. These are reputable individuals who are discreet and well-respected, and it is erroneous to suggest they'd be making this all up (and I can't see them as the kind of folks who'd be authoring a piece on Wiki!!). That said, I'll concede that you are always going to have trouble verifying the existence of something that, at least to my knowledge, has not received media coverage and attempts to remain under the radar. The page would, however, be of interest to members as well as those curious of the existence of such societies so I believe there is merit in allowing the page to be saved from deletion as, especially given the subject matter, it is likely to receive more expansive and in depth additions once it has become available for broader viewing. That something like the Men In Black conspiracy theory which is equally unverifiable as an event of fact appears on Wiki (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory</a>) provides equal justification for inclusion of information about something also speculative, that being S.U.C.K.S. I suggest it is given time to flourish.</li>

<li>"mere mention of the society here has verified many specific details that I had already heard elsewhere" - Mere mention doesn't verify anything, and neither does hearsay, even from people who aren't "the kind of folks who'd be authoring a piece on Wiki" (whatever that means).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Bankers in their 60's are unlikely to be spending time on the net working on a piece about their secret society... and none of what was on the site read like something written by well-educated bankers (i.e it was riddled with spelling errors until I cleaned it up). If I'm to make a fair assumption that they haven't written this, then someone else presumably also knows about this society. I raised the appearance of this page with my Australian contact this evening and while he sounded a little perturbed about the existence of the information he offered that the best he could do would be to contribute a photo of one of the group's items of clothing bearing the society's logo for page verification. Might this serve to satisfy some of those eager for more proof of the body's existence?</li>
