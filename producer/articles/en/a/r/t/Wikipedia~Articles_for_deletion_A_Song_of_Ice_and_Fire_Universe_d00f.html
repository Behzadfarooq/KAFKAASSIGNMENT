<p>The reason this article should be deleted has nothing to do with this being an article about fiction and has nothing to do with notability. It is composed almost entirely of original research by a single indivdual who has, as stated in the talk page, decided to take references to various things and events in the universe of the series and provide them with his own scientific explanations that are found nowhere in the books, the authors words elsewhere, or any published material. One user proposed that the article be merged, but as virutally every word is original research, that is not a feasible approach. It should be deleted. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 08:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, third attempt. And I also want to re-iterate the claim I've made on discussion page: Westeros is a continent on the larger planet in the yet larger fictional universe. This is not true of Middle-Earth, as the only account we have on it is some hobbit's diary and a book of myths published after the creator's death.oakad 07:54, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And one more. <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a> are two different articles (not in risk of merging) and quite full of speculations themselves. In fact, at present revision, I don't see any problem with my article (can we have the AfD tag removed?).138.217.34.39 12:13, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I'm afraid the AfD tag can't be removed. The AfD process still has to be carried out. In any case, the article is still full of POV judgments and minor speculations. I'll see if I can clean it those up (as well as some grammatical problems). As for <a href="../../../a/r/d/Arda.html" title="Arda">Arda</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a>, if those articles (which cover distinct topics) contain speculation, the solution is to remove it, not use it as precedent to keep other speculation. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with regard to Westeros and Middle-Earth, though. Could you be clearer?

<dd>I've finished reworking the article, and given its present state I still think a merge with <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html" title="Westeros">Westeros</a> is the best option. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendan_Moody_0029.html" title="User:Brendan Moody">Brendan</a> 17:41, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Middle-Earth was used as a model in the early stage of the discussion. It is a long accepted article, and an Arda article is long accepted too (Middle-Earth is a continent in Arda). ASoIaF is however, much better developed world with lot of additional info - it's probably 4 to 6 time bigger than LoTR together with Silmarillion. Westeros itself has enormous amount of historical and political data.</dd>

<dd>I've looked at your edits:
<ul>
<li>You deleted my account on astronomical seasons - GRRM explicitly clarified that planet has both astronomical years and climatic seasons (multi-year spanning).</li>
<li>You removed references to his past works - I think its important to leave them (given the habit of GRRM to reuse his ideas).</li>
<li>What's wrong with valyrian lords? Everybody, from free cities to Lannisport distinguishes Dragonlords and plain valyrian descendants. They are also a specific sub-species of humans, having considerable magical abilities and distinguishing look.</li>
<li>Every story insider who ever speaks of Ghis considers it to be older than Valyria. Valyria influence is large in Westeros - through trade, rulers or artifacts. Valyria craft is more advanced than any other we see in the book (these are facts you removed).</li>
<li>Info that is not yet in the article. GRRM provided specific references to climate, nature and recent geological past (Dorn was connected to eastern continent by the land bridge, there is no land at the far north, climate data is available for most of the free cities). I need time to merge this in.</li>
<li>Future info. FoC has a lot of info that was not available in the first three books. However, the next book is expected to have even more and there is also a chance that GRRM will go on and explain his line of reasoning in writing of the book (like he did with Windhaven). This does not precludes us to cover already available data.</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Alternatives:
<ol>
<li>Why not merge with Westeros: Westeros is already heading to be a huge article (even without the rest of the world).</li>
<li>Why not merge with some book description: its beneficial to have page that describes settings, but has no spoilers.</li>
<li>Why not change the title: Precedent: Arda is considered to be both universe (artice uses term "solar system") and planet (long accepted claim on Arda page). Encapsulation: We have (or will have) some info on cosmology, more info on the planet and even more info on couple of specific places. Consider definition 1b of M-W for "universe": "the world of human experience" (in our case - story humans).</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm neutral-to-merge on this (see above)--I think the topic is OK, but the title is terrible, and it should try a little harder to fit with existing <a href="../../../a/s/o/ASOIAF_0c66.html" title="ASOIAF">ASOIAF</a> material--but I have to say, Oakad, you are getting a little excited here. Most of that stuff above belongs on the talk page. Here we're <i>just</i> talking about whether this encyclopedia should have an article on this subject (and if so, secondary questions like where). But it seems like you really, really want to defend your approach to this material, and given that this is a wiki, that can't be guaranteed. You don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> this article, remember; if someone comes along and edits it—for instance, to take out the original research component, per Wikipedia policy—is that going to be OK? —<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 01:54, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
