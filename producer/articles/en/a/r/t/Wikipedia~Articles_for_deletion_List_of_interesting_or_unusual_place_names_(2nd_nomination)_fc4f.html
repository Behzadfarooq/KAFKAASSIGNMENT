<li>The article was originally at List of places with interesting or unusual names (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names_ee58.html" title="Talk:List of interesting or unusual place names">original talk page</a> still exists), and a version is sitting there just now, problem is it's a cut'n'paste hackjob of a repost, so I've tagged it as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-repost_a444.html" title="Template:Db-repost">db-repost</a>}} (since it's missing the correct version history). We need to get the house in order here before we're even ready to do an AfD vote. First off the article was never orignally at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_interesting_or_unusual_place_names.html" title="List of interesting or unusual place names">List of interesting or unusual place names</a>, that was just a mistake the review poster made.

<li><b>Keep/Bring Back!!!</b> This article is very useful. I agree the title could possibly be changed to something a little less subjective, but all in all, the article isn't very subjective - in my opinion. For example, I think everyone can agree Fleahop is a wierd name for a town, no matter who you are or where you are from. I also don't see the problem of having this article, when you consider the fact that Wikipedia has extremely long, detailed article about most all <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_kombat_characters.html" title="Mortal kombat characters">Mortal Kombat Characters</a>. See the one on <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noob_Saibot_d4cc.html" title="Noob Saibot">Noob Saibot</a> for example. KEEP IT!</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I would certainly not oppose a title change, seeing as so many people consider the title itself inherently POV, but the concept behind this list is perfectly encyclopedic, and as we've established numerous times in the past, amusing articles are not inherently less useful than serious ones. — <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 17:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> if this is about moving it back to the article space. It's still inherently POV for reasons I expressed on DRV. Unorthodox, unusual, weird, interesting... it's all subjective and cultural. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 05:15, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep as long as it's in Wikispace</b> - if it's put back in articlespace, I will commence to randomly and irrationally remove any city name I don't find interesting or unusual. If I'm reverted, I'll just add a squillion cities that <b>I</b> find interesting and unusual. Like, say, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond.html" title="Richmond">Richmond</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany.html" title="Albany">Albany</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento.html" title="Sacramento">Sacramento</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livermore.html" title="Livermore">Livermore</a>, and a few thousand more. Who is anyone to tell me that <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walnut_Creek_1aa2.html" title="Walnut Creek">Walnut Creek</a> is less "interesting" than <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta.html" title="Delta">Delta</a>? This entire list is completely and utterly subjective and hence unencyclopedic, and if I have to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to do it, I'll do it. This list is patently and obviously <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is expressely forbidden by policy. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 05:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>You'd really have to stretch the definition of both "vandalism" and "article" to make that a true statement. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Who are you to say it's vandalism? I think <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond.html" title="Richmond">Richmond</a> is an interesting place name. Who are you to tell me it's not? You have no fact or source which says Richmond is less interesting than <a href="../../../p/h/u/Phuket.html" title="Phuket">Phuket</a>. Given the entirely subjective nature of "interesting or unusual," you have absolutely zero grounds on which to oppose said addition. I trust I've made my point clear. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 09:23, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the concensus of this AfD is keep, then <i>List of interesting or unusual place names</i> will be an article. Threatening to add names that even User:FCYTravis presumably, by use of the emphasis around the pronoun "I" in his remarks, finds uninteresting given the context of his remarks and also his reference to his proposed violation of WP:POINT is vandalism in my book. I thought administrators were not supposed to behave like this. The pronounciation of Phuket gives rise to the link with criterion specified on the page - how would Richmond link to the criteria? --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 09:51, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Except the "criteria" are all entirely subjective and non-exclusive. "Exactly what is "interesting or unusual" is of course open to debate, but most of the names fall into recognizable categories" - note the weasel wording and the word "most." You have no grounds to oppose my additions or deletions, because the article itself states, it's "open to debate" - so who are you to impose your POV of what is subjectively "interesting" to you only, and not allow my POV of what is "interesting or unusual" to me? <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 18:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
