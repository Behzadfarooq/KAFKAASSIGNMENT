<p>I am the anon who protested (I removed the message because I didn't know how to protest -- I'm still finding my way around here, friends). I created the page because I wanted to give a link to the product download URL. If it violates Wikipedia policy, please delete the page. As for "strangely" not contesting the companion article, that was because I had not checked to see if it was listed for deletion.</p>
<p>Prod contested by anon (who strangely didn't contest the companion R4U Multilingual-English-Tamil-Telugu article).

<dd><b>Addendum</b> despite the recent rewrite by Aguerriero, I'm sticking with the nomination; it's better now but still makes no claims to notability, and sounds like a software plug (I won't say 'ad' since it's apparently free.) <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 19:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"Prod contested by anon" is a phrase that should never appear in an AfD nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b> It has nothing to do with, how cool or ugly his MySpace is. It has to do with meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria and the evidence of meeting said criteria coming from verifiable, reliable sources. So far no evidence has been presented to show that Deacon meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (though Angus McLellan has advanced an arguable point). Appearing on a local NBC affiliate in any given city does not meet any criteria at either <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, do that is irrelevant. Touring meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but as you've said it has to be <i>"reported in notable and verifiable sources"</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> guidelines say he only has to meet "any ONE of following the criteria", and he clearly meets several. He "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources." why would you say there is "no evidence"? Is the Baltimore City Paper not a verifiable, reliable source? He also "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city." again verified by the Baltimore City Paper naming him "best solo performer" and running several articles on the resurgence of the Baltimore music scene, attributing it to him and his venue / non-profit music and art collective, Wham City. If you would like to see where releases of his are for sale, visit <a href="http://psych-o-path.com" class="external free" title="http://psych-o-path.com" rel="nofollow">http://psych-o-path.com</a> (featuring "notable" band Sightings on the roster) or to <a href="http://standardoilrecords.com" class="external free" title="http://standardoilrecords.com" rel="nofollow">http://standardoilrecords.com</a> (where you will notice that Dan appears on a split called "Porky Pig" with "notable" bands The Bran Flakes and Big City Orchestra). If you go to www.allmusic.com (which is a little bit more difficult to break into than wikipedia) you will notice that there is a page on him. You will also notice that he appeared on "Electric Love Letter" an EP by the very "notable" Langhorne Slim. To top it off he appeared on the first episode of Liam Lynch's podcast show "Lynchland".

<li><b>Keep</b> There are a number of musical artists much less well-known than Deacon whose Wikipedia entries are ignored for deletion by the staff. Plus, <i>have you ever seen this guy perform</i>?

<li><b>Delete</b> - let's begin with the fact that (as far as I recall) Classical Greek has no 'j' and no 'sh' sounds. Also that 'vereor' means 'I respect' not 'he fears', and 'homo' rather than 'vir' would be used for 'man' in the context given. Also that books written around that era do not tend to have punchy novelistic titles.

<p>I have checked many of Seckel's claims in the past and have documented evidence that he is extremely dishonest. This evidence includes proof of phony credentials and false financial statements. Because of this, we should not accept his version about himself. I welcome a genuinely neutral entry on Seckel, but this current one is hopelessly biased and is pure self-promotion. Many of the current claims are demonstrably false. By way of disclosure, I worked with Seckel in the 1980s. When I saw how unethical and dishonest he was I criticized this. He then promised to sue me if I criticized him further. Afterwards I obtained documentation from Cornell and Caltech that his claimed credentials with those institutions were lies, and documentation from the State of California that he made false financial statements about his Skeptics group. I also received letters from Prof. Pearce Williams and from Prof. Feynman's secretary showing that he is lying about their relationship. Some of this evidence is included in <a href="http://www.phact.org/e/z/klass1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.phact.org/e/z/klass1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.phact.org/e/z/klass1.htm</a>, which is listed on the Wikipedia entry for Philip J.

<dd>Fine. So far, we appear to disagree. And please sign your comments by typing four tildes, like this ~~~~. It creates a time-stamped signature. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 06:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Vanity article" is typically used in Wikipedia to describe an article (usually self-written) about an individual who is not notable. It doesn't apply here, as Seickel is clearly notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 06:01, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree we disagree, and that is fine. I don't *disagree* with Seckel's entry, however; I know it is dishonest self-promotion: "...every Wikipedia article is expected to cover its subject in a neutral, fair, and comprehensive way in order to advance knowledge of the subject as a whole. Articles that exist primarily to advance the contributor will likely be deleted." I apologize for lack of tildes: I am brand-new to Wikipedia. 67.20.104.67 06:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The solution to biased articles is more editors, working to eliminate bias. Unless you want to claim that the dozens of publications don;t exist, he is clearly a notable person, worthy of an article. Don't like the article, work on it.

<li><b>Comment</b> This list may be interesting, but the same can be said of many other things (e.g., personal essays) which also do not belong here. Also, consider the vast amount this covers. I have old fantasy football magazines that predict various things about NFL players. Should I add quotes about the expected fantasy worth of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Rivers_39ff.html" title="Philip Rivers">Philip Rivers</a>? Should I find people who have failed to predict the proper results of various elections? Should I pull quotes from magazines or other sources that predicted <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Daughtry_4d28.html" title="Chris Daughtry">Chris Daughtry</a> would win <i>American Idol</i> in the fifth season? If this list has its place somewhere, let it grow happily, but I do not see it as the sort of article which belongs on Wikipedia. Perhaps if it were more specialized to some degree that it could reasonable be kept, I would vote differently, but as it stands, this is an indiscriminate collection of non-notable information with great potential to spiral into a great mess.

<dd>Well, Wikipedia isn't a place for lists of quotes in the first place - that's for Wikiquote. Secondly, why list failed predictions? Predictions often fail, often succeed - what is notable about that? Failed predictions as a category aren't notable in themselves, though they may be good in the relevant articles. (Would we want a list of successful predictions, where somebody once said something like "Everyone will drive cars to work in the future"?) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Famous_Movie_Director_f37a.html" title="User:The Famous Movie Director">Grace</a> 02:16, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Why delete it? If it doesn't seem "professional" enough, why doesn't it just get cleaned up a bit. It's an extremely enjoyable read, and a more complete list of failed predictions is nowhere to be found anywhere on the web. It is the perfect supplement to the 'predictions' Wikipage, and it would be downright discriminatory to deny people the right to explore the various predictions made over the years that have amounted to nothing!

<li>Please sign your comments by typing four tildes, ~~~~, at the end. That something is "an extremely enjoyable read" (which I agree it is, in parts) doesn't qualify it for inclusion on Wikipedia.

<li>If you still want to delete it, why not integrate many of these quotes into their respective articles? And we just have to keep those failed Doomsday predictions- as far as I'm concerned, they're a part of human history, and, therefore, are worthy of inclusion in any encyclopaedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm really sorry, but I just want to get a genuine vote in. I changed a comment earlier, and it was a stupid, childish thing to do (and I really do apologise), but now I've been told that my previous vote is void. So I'm just trying to get one proper vote in here. If you want, I'll delete my previous comments and just leave the most recent one, but I'm not sure if that's counted as vandalism. Can I do that, or does somebody else do it? Thankyou. 203.49.243.1 09:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> My only complaint was that you started more than one statement with the word "Keep." That makes it look as if you're trying to vote more than once. I have no problem with you posting your views on here, but start the rest with the word "Comment" as you have done with the most recent one. GassyGuy 09:05, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirect</b>. Okay, "delete" really, but when people say things like "that similar article doesn't count as precedent for keeping, because it was redirected", it's hard to reconcile that with an argument for flat-out deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:26, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>/<b>For retention</b>, i would just like to comment that mikee's entry would be viable for an article itself (stub), as a matter of fact, it just needs an overhaul or for it to be expanded, i think the notability of mikee stands not on whether he was runner up or something but because of the impression of being a housemate. Yes, the celebrities, they're notable, but i think lee is far more noted than the likes of Rudy, Budoy, gretchen or angelina for that matter, except for those who are celebrities already. I think a number of teen housemates deserve an entry and to be noted as STUBS. It's my point of view. Emerald 04:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>as could stand as it is. Yes his popularity stems from PBB, yet we could definitely expand the article considering much of the many references available, i for a fact has gathered a number of references and would be very much into updating and expanding his article, i think he deserves an entry much as Jason Gainza (who doesnt have his own entry) who, like Lee, was a runner-up finish, it's a feat almost, yes almost, to the extent of winning and i think it should be given credit, just as other first-runner ups. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECane_crew_ccdd.html" title="User:Cane crew">User:Cane_crew</a> 05:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I guess Kwarta o Kahon contestants seems a far-fetched cry from the notability of the housemates, i mean common, primetime viewing pleasure. And yes Jayson needs his own article, i could see he has come to be famous, or Sam or even Cass and Uma. They could stand their own entry. I would be very much willing to do that myself. I resent the fact that notability becomes such an issue whilst, they all have been quite notable ever since they entered the house, much more the Big Four. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cane_crew_55b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cane crew">Special:Contributions/Cane_crew</a> 05:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've cleaned up the "External links" section, and nice try, Blintz, but my only bias as far as this article is concerned is that plenty of other articles on porn stars are allowed to exist with much less information. Why don't you go list them for deletion instead? <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> 16:06, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>Because, Gong, I can only focus on one article at a time. Why? The obstructionism of people like you makes deleting even the most frivolous article such an ordeal that I have to neglect cleaning up the porn section until the one at hand is dealt with. By "bias" I was referring to the tendency of partisans of topics (for example, trans-sexual Malaysian deconstructionist authors) to jealously prevent even the most absurd articles under their "protection" to be deleted. Thus, I wasn't surprised that some Asian user defended the right of some other Asian to inflate his nonexistent reputation in a PUBLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA. Unsurprisingly, the other user making strange accusations about "hostility" is named "Zhao." <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlintz_7052.html" title="User:Blintz">Blintz</a> 22:45, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What ho, Trialsanderrors? I didn't make any accusation of xenophobia, nor did I get into any fight. I made a comment that "Gong" chose to take offense to. You'll notice that while the only accusation that I made concerned "pro-Asian bias" (a charge that, since not specifically attributable to "Gong, I addressed in a general way), you accused me of xenophobia, a far more serious matter.

<dd>My mistake regarding xenophobia. I meant to address your use of straw-man tactics: wildly claiming that I was making accusations of xenophobia. I'm not sure why you feel the need to delve into Wikipedia jurisprudence for this matter, but I doubt that my rather inocuous comments violate any rules. In fact, since you felt the need to imply that I wasn't acting in "good faith", consider the phrase "well-intentioned error." Even though you may have taken offense to my comments regarding ethnic partisanship, you should have noted that my efforts were well-intentioned - for the benefit of WP - so you should have assumed that I was acting in good faith. By assuming that I wasn't, you've violated the rule. And "no personal attacks"? I was merely mentioning that the user was tendentious. That's not an attack, nor is it particularly personal. Throw the book at someone else. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlintz_7052.html" title="User:Blintz">Blintz</a> 01:06, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't implying you didn't act in good faith, I was implying you didn't assume good faith in others. A seemingly minor but ultimately crucial difference. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:21, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your last comment is irrelevant. The issue of good faith doesn't even enter here, since I made no comment regarding the quality of the intentions of the author of the article or his apparatchiks. In fact, I made no assumption on the subject whatsoever. Again, your citation of the rule wasn't necessary. Are you finished? <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlintz_7052.html" title="User:Blintz">Blintz</a> 02:30, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you'll review my comments, you'll probably be struck by the absence of any personal attacks. I did mention the tendency of partisans of topics to mechanically oppose the deletion of articles under their purviews, but I didn't make any personal attacks. In return, I've been labeled as the source of hostile accusations (you chose to raise the bar by falsely attributing the offensive charges of xenophobia to me) and insinuations. As for your charge that I attempted to discredit others, I only "point[ed] out" and "referr[ed] to the tendency" of the partisan activities mentioned above. This was for the benefit of the other readers to casually consider, not an attempt to discredit. In fact, your attempts to discredit me are far more thorough than any imagined attempts that I made. No need for any "end of communication": a period will do. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlintz_7052.html" title="User:Blintz">Blintz</a> 02:42, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like opinions on this one. She does appear to have had at least one book published (<i>Trilho de Pó</i> but I'm unable to determine whether self-published or not - it seems likely). The article was unanimously deleted from pt.wiki (which I think is usually fairly inclusive) as vanity - see <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:P%C3%A1ginas_para_eliminar/Fernanda_seno" class="external autonumber" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:P%C3%A1ginas_para_eliminar/Fernanda_seno" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. An anon claimed in that discussion that she has books in legal deposit in the National Library and on sale in Lisbon but nobody commented on that. There are some streets named <i>Fernanda seno</i> but I suspect they are named after someone else.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that I had moved the content of Fernanda seno to the article Fernanda Seno, so there are <b>two articles</b> that should be kept or deleted as per the decision. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStumps_5af0.html" title="User:Stumps">Stumps</a> 11:55, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can not see why this page should be deleted. I has sat here for over a year documenting a well known journalist and businessman in the UK. As a result of constant vandalism the page is continually flooded with innaccurate information.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Philsome, if you read my post you'll see that I said that none of the references on the page about you are less than 6 years old. In other words, all the links you added about yourself are old, and not up to date. Who is this person who states that they just saw a TV series about Cohen? There was not any such series broadcast in this country (the UK) recently yet the IP address is a London one. Philsome claims to have heard a lecture on Cohen on the UCL economics course yet there is not one - I have checked with the department. Why on earth would there be? Not only this, but a brief glance at the history of this page, or at Philsome's talk page shows that he clearly repeatedly adds information about Cohen that, at best, could be described as an exaggeration. Wikipedia is not a forum for self-publicity and this whole page is entirely ridiculous. Cohen had a website that he sold for £40 000. He "occassionally" writes short articles for the Times of London's internet site. He used to run a pornography search engine. This is not reason for an article on wikipedia. If it is, I may as well put in an entry about my neighbour's cat. Look at Philsome's user page. He repeatedly dodges the remarks people have made about his posts there. 12:09, 11 June 2006 YEDIDO(UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Yedido- the IP address of the poster 80.33.141.151 is in Spain not in London. Secondly, the Trouble at the Top documentary was played on BBC Prime Europe on the 26th May this year. Thirdly, a lecture on the e-economy did reference Cohen earlier this year. Philsome 13:34, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think merging with the ULA is correct. All of the events excluding the one fact that Hendricks is an officer of the ULA, is outside the ULA and almost all was done before the ULA was founded, and all was done exclusive and independent of the ULA. I hope no part of the protest is due to problems with the ULA. This is outside the issue in my opinion. I encourage all non factual info to be removed, instead of the entire article. I also note many references outside of the Musea.us or hunkasaurus.com website - neither of which were started by Hendricks. What is userpage and how would that apply? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusea_e111.html" title="User:Musea">Musea</a> 15:12, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can confirm that no part of the process is due to problems with the ULA; the main question is the notability of Tom Hendricks — is he notable enough to include in the encyclopedia? The page <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> provides the most relevant information, although Wikiproject Music have notes on notability for musicians at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. Personally, whilst I may find Tom's work laudable, I'm erring towards feeling that he's <i>not</i> notable enough for an encyclopedia article, although my uncertainty has driven me to open this process, in order to reach a consensus from fellow editors who are more familiar with the requirements. As for your other query, a userpage is explained in <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a> — yours is <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusea_e111.html" title="User:Musea">User:Musea</a>. — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 15:35, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have been having some dialogue with <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusea_e111.html" title="User:Musea">Musea</a> about this issue, and would encourage him to provide any verifiable references that exist for Hendricks's work—this could be newspaper or magazine mentions, books published by external sources, or even substantial web mentions.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would argue that the ULA is a notable organization. They have acquired, as a group, real press, whatever their aims as an organization might be. However, I do not think they should be used as a source to verify information, since their entire reporting structure is based on superlative claims about their membership, usually directly in the words of the member on which they are reporting. At the talk page for Tom Hendricks, Tom/Musea mentions his own works, the ULA's writings, Artvilla, and the Texas Monthly June '06 issue as evidence of his notability. Artvilla is a fine publication, but I don't think a credit in Artvilla can be considered notable. I'll acquire the Texas Monthly article, though -- that's certainly legitimate reportage. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanPenton_3236.html" title="User:JonathanPenton">JonathanPenton</a> 01:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Artella has recently sent word that they will reprint the 'end of art' article. See talk Tom Hendricks</li>
</ul>
<p>One wider concern is this - if articles depend on mainstream sources for verification, they will eliminate all entries whose notable achievement is to oppose mainstream art and media. Mainstream music press will not do articles on anti-band music. Mainstream art press will not do articles on end of modern art protests. Mainstream publishers will not do articles on zines or zine movements that oppose them. I think valid indie sources - if there are enough to fit the wikipedia criteria - like ULA or Zine World, should be considered as well as more noted media such as Artella, Texas Monthly, David Darling website etc. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusea_e111.html" title="User:Musea">Musea</a> 02:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is the point I made above. I think if there were sufficient "non-mainstream" references, this would form a strong argument for inclusion.

<dd>I guess my point wasn't clear, probably because I nested my comment under your words instead of Tom's. I was trying to advocate the consideration of sources by their reputation for accuracy, not their readership. Unfortunately, the ULA web site has no reputation for accuracy, and I agree that the other references listed, which now seem to involve Texas Highways rather than the Texas Monthly, don't imply notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> I rewrote the article and removed all the POV/autobiographical/vanity/irrelevent stuff. Almost the entire article was written by Tom previously. Tom really doesn't formally meet the requirements for notability, but I think he should be included here. Primarily because he's been publishing a zine consistently for 12 years, but also just because I think there should be exceptions for eccetric outsider-artist-type people like him. But I do think he needs to stop editing his own article. If he has something he wants added or changed, he can put in on the talk page. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Slocum_c3fa.html" title="User:Paul Slocum">Paul Slocum</a> 22:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, that's a <i>much</i> better article, thanks Paul. Although notability is still the issue here — are you suggesting that someone who is an eccentric should be treated as if they are more notable than they are? I think making any exceptions to what are (once read) actually quite straightforward guidelines is dangerous. The drive behind <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> seems to be concerned primarily with how many readers are likely to come to Wikipedia to look up the subject; I'm just not sure I see this happening. The very fact that Tom is the main editor on an article about himself just has vanity written all over it. Wikipedia is not here as a medium for self-promotion, surely? — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 22:51, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess persistence is more what I'm referring to. The 14 years of the zine (I miscounted), that he constantly writes letters to local papers (which are occasionally published, and I can document later), that he's been playing his music at the Inwood for years, that he continues to post his Usenet art quizzes and articles week after week. None of it alone has reached formal notability requirements, but I feel that if you sum it all together, he's made enough contribution to warrant an article. I ain't gunna cry if you remove it, but personally my vote is to let it stay. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Slocum_c3fa.html" title="User:Paul Slocum">Paul Slocum</a> 23:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> OK, well done Paul Slocum. I agree that Tom has to stop editing it and should put info on the talk page for other editors to filter. I hope you'll be able to work on this article, as it's greatly improved. I think the problem is that there is a category that Wiki simply doesn't realise exists, namely the sort of underground/alternative art/literary pioneers, who are recognised within their field and who undoubtedly do have a reputation, which people knowledgeable in that field would recognise. I was certainly aware of ULA and would be glad of being able to find out more about them through Wiki. I would feel it a loss if such articles weren't able to be included. The thing is that everything has to be taken on a case by case basis, and I'm going with Paul Slocum's arguments as above. It doesnt't mean everyone that's ever published a magazine gets included, but someone that has this kind of consistency has developed a (cult) reputation. We have enough space on Wiki for all kinds of games info. Let's accommodate this as well. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 10:25, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It appears from what has been written that the only thing that Tom might be notable for is editing Musea - which might in itself be worthy of an article, but being a persistent eccentric shouldn't be considered notable in itself, unless of course, we are talking about a "notable persistent eccentric." However, I am happy to let the matter rest as is.

<li>I personally think he's notable specifically for being a "persistent eccentric", which in my mind is in a large part <i>Musea</i> but also the music and stunts — it's really a label for a level of notability garnered by someone who has persistently, recognisably and (to some degree) famously maintainted an eccentric but consistent and public style over years. The notability of <i>Musea</i> is still an open question in my mind, as I haven't really studied that issue, but the consistent thread through Tom's endeavours is his eccentric style, and I <b>do</b> think that's notable in this case.

<li><b>(Weak) Keep</b> This discussion has helped me to form an opinion, and that opinion is that Tom is notable enough as a persistent eccentric to have his own article. I will confess that I still feel it's borderline, and strongly feel that Tom should stay away from the article itself — particularly because Paul has done such a good job on rewriting the article and actually made Tom look better that way. Should Tom attempt to make it a vanity article (vanitise the article... do we have that verb?) in the future, it would be looking for trouble IMHO. — <a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_Esperanza_23fc.html" title="User:Estarriol/Esperanza"><font color="green">Es</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstarriol_eb96.html" title="User:Estarriol"><font color="blue">tarriol</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/s/t/User_talk%7EEstarriol_4f49.html" title="User talk:Estarriol">talk</a></sup> 20:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. However my dealings with Musea/Tom in the past have been quite civilised and I think he would be happy to work with other editors and learn more about the Wiki ropes. I suspect also that in his extensive period of committed time to art/literary/music projects there's other stuff that would add to the article, but which he's simply not recalled. There may also be interesting material on the scene(s) he's involved with which could add to Wiki in other places. We have a huge amount of specialised knowledge on certain subjects, but not so many people filling out the contemporary arts coverage. It would be good to encourage further involvement. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 21:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is essentially an advertisement for a non-notable indy wrestling promotion in Ireland, I mean, they've uploaded the banners to the servers and make it look as if they're using Wikipedia as like a backup hompage. <a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaint-Paddy_d585.html" title="User:Saint-Paddy">Saint-Paddy</a> 01:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I wrote this article and uploaded the banners, if they are taking up too much server space, I will of course take them down and leave it as a text only entry or with one picture, whatever is recommended.</p>
<p>As for non notable, professional wrestling is obviously not to everyone's tastes but it is an interest shared by many and very popular among internet fans. This particular company have a TV show and run over 40 shows a year nationally as well as having national press and media coverage.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to change or amend the article in any way that would make it more aceptable to wikipedia or its users. Apologies for any inconvienience. - Bncrew 16:07, 26 May 2006</p>

<p>I would be more than happy to change anything about it if someone could give me a few pointers. Obviously, if the pictures are taking up space on your servers, they have to go but I'll edit it down to more basic fatual information if you like. - Bncrew 17:40, 07 June 2006</p>
<p><br />
In relation to the whole non notable thing, this company does perform more than dates in a year than 90% of companies in the Europe. They have changed alot for wrestling fans like me here in Ireland. I have edited down the article to exclude things that might seem like advertisement and taken the pictures off. Anything else that would make the article better or more acceptable to the wikipedia guidelines? Thanks. - Bncrew 02:08, 08 June 2006</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An absolute mess of an article that talks of the auto racing "world" yet only talks about a specific <i>type</i> of racing in a specific country. In terms of being an overview of motorsport in general, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_racing.html" title="Auto racing">Auto racing</a> covers everything this article possibly could; and in terms of being simply about NASCAR, then <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_bd9d.html" title="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> does the business. It's unencyclopaedic, doesn't offer information that can't be got elsewhere, and offers no justification for putting info on a quite specific topic under a pretty general header. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 12:44, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Insulting someone's work by putting "artist" in quotes isn't really necessary in an AFD. Please remember that these pages get archived for eternity. What are your credentials for deriding someone's work as "alleged art"? This is hardly very different from the <a href="http://www.onethousandpaintings.com/home/" class="external text" title="http://www.onethousandpaintings.com/home/" rel="nofollow">thousand numbers</a> currently on sale for around $600 each, for which about 500 have been sold in about a week. Your personal tastes should have no bearing in an AFD. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 14:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>My "credentials" are that I have eyes and discretion, and scrawling numbers on construction paper is something kindergarden kids do before nap time; we don't hang those up in art galleries either. (For that matter, debate over someone's personal tastes, and their right or lack of right to have them, scarcely belongs in an AfD either.) <b>Delete</b> the heck out of this, per nom. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, we do put them in galleries <a href="http://www.v-gallery.ch/de/vernissage/onethousandpaintings_com.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.v-gallery.ch/de/vernissage/onethousandpaintings_com.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, and I'm glad <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kline_fbea.html" title="Franz Kline">Kline</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Pollock_e5b4.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Pollock</a> didn't have you as their agent, dismissing their work as kindergarden scrawls. But the <i>point</i> of my comment was that AFD should not be a place to insult the subject of the article, particularly if the subject is a living person. There have been numberous cases brought to Jimbo because of living people discovering that one of their first Google-hits is some insult on AFD (e.g. <a href="http://www.nabble.com/AFD-courtesy-problem-t939597.html#a2434386" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nabble.com/AFD-courtesy-problem-t939597.html#a2434386" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Another-AfD-example-t962497.html#a2494156" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nabble.com/Another-AfD-example-t962497.html#a2494156" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>), something Jimbo refered to as a "sickness in the process". — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 19:50, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Possibly the likes of Pollock and Kline would have been glad as well, given that I believe their efforts to have been tripe. That being said, before we have whitewashers and spin doctors suitably sanitizing AfD discussions so that no one could ever, ever fancy themselves disparaged, I'd far sooner purge AfD of the knee-jerk editors who vote without ever bothering to verify the merits of the nomination, one way or another.

<li><b>Comment</b> Strongly agree with Asbestos that derogatory comments about people or their work have no place on AfD. There are criteria for deletion which should be respected. One of them is not an editor's personal opinions of artistic worth. This is specifically cautioned against as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">OR</a>. It therefore represents an illicit attempt to influence the outcome of a debate that should be conducted strictly from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>, and shows no respect for the process or other editors. It is also apparent from the disparaging comments made (e.g. on Pollock) that the editors making them <s>have little knowledge of</s> are indulging in a strong <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> on the subject, which only makes it even more embarrassing for those of us who are trying to strengthen the art presence on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Arts_d4ad.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Arts">WikiProject Arts</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Visual_arts_ab0a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Visual arts">WikiProject_Visual_arts</a> for a start. <s>Ignorant</s> Such comments are likely to be seen as ignorant by those versed in the field and will merely discourage <s>new editors with genuine knowledge</s> them from contributing.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just out of curiosity, upon which basis are you making unsupported suppositions about anyone's art historian expertise? Someone so interested in NPOV and in not making anything that could be construed as a disparaging comment should surely be familiar with <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, and not automatically assume that anyone differing from his personal artistic tastes is ignorant and inexperienced by definition. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 03:59, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The point is, this isn't the place to say whether or not you think his work is any good.

<dd>My apology. Someone expressing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> may have a lot of knowledge of the subject, but, in that case, is unfortunately not following policy in making use of it to give a balanced representation of established views in the field, which is that Pollock, for example, is recognised as a major artist and not "tripe". <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:08, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> Apologies, i created the article and it is not a hoax. The organisation exists, although its foundations are small, and even smaller online. My attempts to redirect the page to Milites Christi have been unsuccessful, however this was my initial idea. I currently have no verifiable publicy published sources to back up the information held on the article. The only testemony I can give to prove the organisations existence is my own, after interviewing a member in January of this year. However in accordance with Wikipedias Deletion Policy I aknowledge its deletion as viable. User:1303 20:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> People claim to be members of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priory_of_Sion_9df8.html" title="Priory of Sion">Priory of Sion</a>, too, but I wouldn't regard that as firm evidence. If this isn't a hoax, then it's original research. (1303, I'm not accusing you of perpetrating the hoax - but you are conceivably the victim of one.) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 08:15, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I aknowledge your comments and fully understand the dilema faced here. However the organisation is a relatively small one, and as far as i'm aware has had only one article in a 1997 edition of Clitheroe Today, Lancs, UK (for which I do not have a link). As you say the organisation could conceivably be a hoax, however i'm near to fully certain that the source is a reliable one. I would classify this as Original Research (in terms of online conent), although I do not know if this would save the article from deletion. If the article is to be erased on these grounds, so be it, but it was originally added to highlight the organisation within the online public domain. If hard evidence is needed to maintain the article, i have none as yet, although I suspect some will come to light.1303 10:58 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Further investigation shows that an organisation called 'Milites Christi' was founded in 1939 by Giuseppe Lazzati. (Source<a href="http://www.pust.edu/oikonomia/pages/febb/lazzati.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pust.edu/oikonomia/pages/febb/lazzati.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>) That body subsequently became the Secular Institute of Christ the King. There's also a fiercely Catholic, distinctly American, and almost certainly non-notable body (12 members!) calling itself 'Milites Christi' with a painfully slow web page here: <a href="http://apmitter.tripod.com/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://apmitter.tripod.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you American? Fathers have no rights here; other than the right to pay child support. Seriously though, in my opinion, Redirect to the mother is probably best practice unless the mother has no existing wikipedia article, but the father does. Disco King's top page note would definitly work... or, I imagine that the child's birth would be mentioned somewhere in the article. We could just (*gasp*) <i>make people read the article to find out who the father is</i>. I know, it sounds dastardly... On a side note, expanding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s "involvement in newsworthy events" to a child's birth, even when covered extensively by the press, it really pushing it in my opinion. I'm still of the opinion that you have to do something other than be born to be article worthy.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I thought that as well.

Maybe a note at the top, like "Suri Cruise redirects here.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In fact, I'd probably be up for deleting pretty much any CCG player articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>; nor does there need to be anything new added.

That CCGs aren't a "mainstream competitive sport" is irrelevant (and POV); <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> doesn't draw a distinction between "mainstream competitive sports" and any other sport. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:22, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, in this case I agree with RGTraynor, CCG major competative players are as notable as any other competitive game players. Particularly in this case, you have a player who was fairly highly ranked but was banned for cheating. Within the realm of CCG I imagine this is probably the equivalent to a baseball player getting caught using steroids (OK, maybe not... the baseball player wouldn't get banned from the game). Regardless, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> could be construed to include notable competative game players under notable sportspeople (hey, if <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">walking around swiping at a little white ball with metal stick</a> is a sport, then cards are too).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Original research. The discussion on the article's talk page gives a pretty good summary of why grouping together all of the literary works mentioned in this article is inherently POV: many of them do not, in fact, depict pedophilia, but rather, abuse by people who may or may not be pedophiles. In addition, some of the works depict consensual adult/child sex, which is neither pedophilia nor abuse. I think that "pedophile" is rather like "terrorist": using it is almost always inherently POV. Finally, the article discusses many works by non-notable authors (at least judged by whether the author has a Wikipedia article) -- it's okay to mention such works, of course, but in this case, the majority of the article is devoted to them. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 16:16, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I oppose the move to "Pedophilia and adult-child sex in fiction". It only had that title for a few hours, previously. The title was discussed on the talk page. Now the article has been moved with no discussion. "Adult-child sex" is a term used primarily within the pro-pedophile community and its use is POV. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:10, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This illustrates the problem. "Adult-child sex" is considered POV by some (and is inaccurate since many of the works are about teenagers.) "Pedophilia" is considered POV by some, including me, when applied to literary works where the author didn't necessarily intend to portray a character as being "pedophilic". There doesn't seem to be a good possible title, which certainly throws question on whether the article can be NPOV. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 04:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Will, while we're often in agreement, I think you're wrong in this particular case. I was convinced by 24's argument that if an an adult-child relationship was described <i>in fiction</i> as non-abusive, it should not be listed under "child sexual abuse"... it's fiction, a fantasy. You wouldn't list <i>Pippi Longstocking</i> etc. under "Child Neglect in Fiction" even though she's left to fend for herself, and so forth. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:36, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's certainly a matter which is worth dicussing. In my view, some of the novels, like Mystic River, are about sexual abuse, not sex. More broadly, "child sexual abuse" is a synonym of child molestation. If we don't want the title to include those terms we should remove those books from the list. Pedophilia is simply the wish to have the sex, not the performance of the act. Then it is child sexual abuse, child molestation, or statutory rape, in most circumstances. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm I see what you're saying... technically, instances of raping a num could be included in an article List of instances of nuns having sex, sice a rape <i>is</i> sex and there <i>was</i> a nun involved... but we wouldn't do that... similarly, you're saying (I think) that putting instances of child molestation/sex abuse in an article titled "Adult-child sex..." is kind of bizarre. OK, I agree with that. Hmmmm. But removing just the abuse cases leaves a list of <i>just</i> fantasy fiction where the adult and child fall in love and live happily ever after or whatever... hmmm I dunno if that's good either, since to the extent that it claims to be complete list it would kinda sorta imply that <i>all</i> "Adult-child sex in fiction" is benign... I dunno the answer to that, be it can be figured out.

<li><b>Comment</b> A relationship between an adult and a 14-year-old is certainly abuse. It is not pedophilia. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Clearly a child can "freely" consent to sexual activity; the question is whether they can give <i>informed consent</i>. A blanket legal conclusion would form a ridiculous basis for abuse laws, since it would naturally suggest that sexual experimentation between young peers should be on par with adult-child sex in terms of punishment. CSA should instead be criminalized because of the nearly innate power imbalance of adult/child relationships. Most research has concluded that adult-child sex is (generally) much more harmful than youthful exploration: <i>nothing</i> is pointing at the "informed consent" myth. The problem, instead, appears to be imbalances (or possibly even stigma). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayW_e416.html" title="User:JayW">JayW</a> 19:21, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The article consists not only of a list of works, but of detailed interpretations of those works, and I think it's fairly obvious that the interpretations are OR. As for the works themselves? I think for many of them, it's a matter of opinion whether the works in fact depict "pedophilia", "abuse", or neither. Thus this article cannot be NPOV. Finally, your comments about my POV (and please check my user page and use the pronouns I prefer to refer to me) illustrate why this article cannot be written in an NPOV fashion: there is disagreement about whether sex between someone over 18 and sex between someone under 18 is <i>always</i> abusive, and the existence of this article reflects the POV that it is always abusive. Given the existence of a debate, an article like this encourages POV-pushing. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatamorphism_4920.html" title="User:Catamorphism">Catamorphism</a> 20:48, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, I did mean informed consent. Catamorphism, I don't see any interpretations in the article, much less detailed ones.

As to your preferred pronoun "they" — sorry, I didn't notice that and certainly have no intention to offend you.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the lower half list is useful. The authors may only be unnotable because of the bias of editors and readers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Needs a tidy up, certainly a controversial issue - but encylopedic - agree with Skinnyweed on title - pedophilla is a controversial term but 'adult-child sex' covers both pedophillic and (arguably) non-pedophilic child-adult sex (I note concerns about and debate about informed consent - unlikely a child can ever give - power issues etc).

<dd>True enough. But the Oxford English Dictionary defines "child" as someone short of full physical development (which includes most people through about age 20 or so).

<li><b>Keep</b>. And definitely <b>Move</b> to "Pedophilia and adult-child sex in fiction". And tag for Cleanup. Or else move to ""Pedophilia and adult-child sex in <i>literature</i>". Speaking as one unlikely to be tagged as a pedophilia apologist, I think that's it's valid and useful list. I have spoken against links and other material that may be taken as promoting pedophila, but this article doesn't much worry me. It's validly encyclopedic. Also, as a general rule, you can pretty much assume that work by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">User:Tony Sandel</a> in this area is probably scholarly and correct. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 06:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly, categorising under-18 sex as statutory rape/abuse is inherently NPOV. The <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_consent.html" title="Age of consent">Age of consent</a> is not universally fixed at 18, either geographically or historically. Would <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a> count? As far as I know, few people consider that play to be about child sexual abuse. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Hi everyone. I've read all the keep/delete comments and thought I'd better comment too, as I contributed most of the list and article. I don't think it's really OR as there are many similar respected lists on this topic on the Internet like at amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-7868480-7176834?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=child+sexual+abuse&amp;Go.x=11&amp;Go.y=6" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-7868480-7176834?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=child+sexual+abuse&amp;Go.x=11&amp;Go.y=6" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> for books or imdb.com <a href="http://www.imdb.com/keyword/pedophile" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/keyword/pedophile" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> for movies. Likewise, I have tried to keep POV neutral. We will never get agreement on what is/isn't pedophilia or who is/isn't a child so I considered it valid to include references to books/films that a significant number of people in the UK or USA would consider as pedophilia and/or child sexual abuse. I recognise that the text (as opposed to the lists) causes more problems, but it does at least define the context of the pedophilia/sexual abuse. And I thought it was important to include works where there is no 'proof' of either pedophilia or abuse! The books/films <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_in_Venice_aef3.html" title="Death in Venice">Death in Venice</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Without_a_Face_089a.html" title="The Man Without a Face">The Man Without a Face</a></i> are well known examples and the list would lose credibility if they were left out.</li>
</ul>
<p>One solution would be to cut up the first sections and put one line/two line descriptions under each work, but I feel it would be less useful as an encyclopedia reference. Surely the point of an authoritative wikipedia article is to answer firstly a search then to provide many links to whatever aspect of the topic the searcher is looking for.</p>
<p>Finally, we should recognise the views of experts. Carolyn Lehamn has just sent me a mail saying "It's a good list you have. I'm glad you're including both fiction and non-fiction as they inform each other. It makes for a much richer resource." See her OR on the topic at<a href="http://www.strongattheheart.com/books_films.html" class="external text" title="http://www.strongattheheart.com/books_films.html" rel="nofollow">"Carolyn Lehman: Strong At The Heart"</a> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony Sandel</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Some comments here are bizarre. "pedophile" is rather like "terrorist": using it is almost always inherently POV". Pedophile is a very normal word that everyone understands - some arguement about the age of the kids I know. Also "non-notable authors (at least judged by whether the author has a Wikipedia article)" - more than half the books on the first list have wiki articles and who's to say whether an author is notable or non-notable??? Article seems NPOV to me, though some could be OR.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ganymedes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ganymedes_a783.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ganymedes">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Most articles on literature on Wikipedia have lists and do not just mention well known works. The entries are non-notable? To who? Just because you haven't heard of an author, does not make him or her non-notable. An encyclopedia should try to be encyclopedic.<b>Note: this user already voted.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with this comment - that there is "a real, substantive difference between genuine pedophilia and inappropriate relationships between adults and teenagers". The article is headed pedophilia AND child sexual abuse, and I have excluded the dozens of works that deal with adults and teenagers well past the age of puberty. There are, however, a number of borderline cases and I have included them where, having read the book myself, the relationship could be interpreted as being either pedophile behaviour and/or child sexual abuse. It's best that readers make their own judgement. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony Sandel</a></p>
<p>If you want to be a universal encyclopedia you have to include everything. The bad with the good. Otherwise it is a pointless exercise in ego. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.234.85.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.234.85.117_d375.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.234.85.117">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Unmaintainable list of no encyclopedic value; also inherently biased towards a US-centric worldview. If people want to stay up-to-date on who's sleeping in whose bed, they'd be better off visiting a celebrity gossip site. If people are interested in whom a particular celebrity is dating, they are more likely to find the correct information in that celebrity's own article. It's hard to see what other purpose this list serves.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>: The list is only supposed to include fictional characters who have explicitly expressed certain views. It is not up to the editors to interpret the character's views. This should reduce debates about content. I don't expect the list to get too big, but if it does it can be broken up. I wanted to make something like this instead of list of fictional characters opposed to the death penalty, list of fictional characters against gun control, etc. because those would be mostly stubs.

<p>This article is basically a POV fork of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScientology_d9f8.html" title="Category:Scientology">Category:Scientology</a>, cherry-picking items favorable to Scientology ("1997-12 Thousands of Scientologists hold candles and demonstrate in front of Clearwater police headquarters, accusing police Chief Sid Klein of discriminating against Scientologists." -- why is this protest notable enough to make the timeline?) and slanting items in a notably pro-Scientology fashion ("the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association ... rejected [Hubbard's claimed "findings on the mind"] and later <i>attempted to discredit his work and reputation</i>." (emphasis added); "the High Court of Australia overturns Scientology ban, contributing greatly to the scope of religious freedom in that country.") At first I thought a timeline of the major events involving Scientology could be useful. After seeing this, however, I'm not sure it would even be possible to create an NPOV timeline. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. Not sure if cleanup is a vote, but regardless this article does have some factual content. Instead of deleting it why not slap a POV tag on it and add information from the other point of view.--<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeStranger_9931.html" title="User:SomeStranger"><font color="green">SomeStranger</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeStranger_f8cb.html" title="User talk:SomeStranger"><font color="green">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SomeStranger_a6e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/SomeStranger"><font color="green">C</font></a>)</small> 17:19, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Cleaning it up is what I started to do. But where would it end? When an article has a tight focus, editors from all sides might be able to reach agreement on which events are significant enough to merit discussion and which are not. Here, where the only requirement is "it involved Scientology and it can be tied to some rough span of time," there's nothing to prevent an arms race in which all sides add whatever incidents they feel support their cause, going into ever-more-intricate detail in order to counter what they'll see as over-representation of the other side. In the best-case scenario, all we'd wind up with is just a duplication of everything that's in all the other Scientology articles, rearranged chronologically. And the worst case is a never-ending POV-fork maelstrom. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sorry, but AfD is not for content problems, and this does not appear to be a content fork of a category (I can't really imagine such a thing) or of anything else, although I'm not familiar with the Scientology-related articles. The timeline is probably encyclopedic, given the impact (for better or worse) that Scientology has; also, the first entry I picked at random was quite non-flattering ("Hubbard's wife and 10 other church staffers are convicted of conspiring to steal federal government documents and cover it up."). Cleanup is quite warranted, though. Normal editing practices ought to be able to determine what to include or not; if necessary, criteria need to be agreed upon.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 18:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Yes, all the significant events could never fit in one article, but that doesn't stop it from including the most important. Plus, if it gets too large, we can always go to the summary + main article link format, maybe by decade.

<li><b>Keep, but....</b> I think if the article is to ever be any good, the timeline should be restricted to MAJOR events, <i>not</i> an endless torrent of trivia like dates that various books were published (There are so many Scientology publications, this one aspect alone would make the article unacceptably long) or dates that various churches and missions were formed (ditto).

<p>The article on NAKID should be deleted. It is just an advertisement for a business to recruit members. "They" have been spamming the Kickball article repeatedly with external links to their website and they are now trying to get around this by linking Kickball to their NAKID article via the See also, where they put their external link there. Wikipedia has a policy against being used for business advertising and this article should be deleted. Also, they are not significant enough to warrant an article. They did not significantly impact the sport of kickball as WAKA did. <i>Note: This AfD is created on behalf of User:204.149.192.90</i> by <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_6ef6.html" title="User:Henrik">H</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_E_5da8.html" title="User:Henrik/E"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrik_6ef6.html" title="User:Henrik">nrik</a> 17:30, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've ben obsessed with Discordianism for a long time and have never heard of this book until I found this Wikipedia article. "Discordian works" doesn't list any other works, other than the Apocrypha Discordia, which has it's own article. Almost every person I know who calls him/herself a "Discordian" has written his or her own plagarism of the Principia Discordia and released it as an e-book. I don't think they all need encyclopedic coverage. If the book is "controversial", why have I never heard of it and why does it only get about 40-50 Google hits?</p>

</ul>
<p>"Whereas Apocrypha Discordia is a collection of pieces from various sources, most of the material in the Ek-sen-trik-kuh was created specifically for the work. The book claims its inspiration came from a dream-vision that featured Goddess Discordia, her sister Goddess Harmonia, and their daughter, the naked Cherub Princess Shamlicht, who had hundreds of monkeys flying out of her butt. These were actually Bonobo apes, who gave their tales to Loveshade to first digest, and then to 'spread them far and wide, for digested flying monkey tales make great fertilizer.'"</p>
<p>Eh, I think Discordians could be finding something better to do with their time than writing Wikipedia articles for their books, and I don't think Wikipedia should be a soapbox for Discordian heresy! <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinatraFonzarelli_4fe1.html" title="User:SinatraFonzarelli">Sinatra Fonzarelli</a> 18:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- <b>Warning: This might be considered a personal attack.</b> Wickethewok seems to like voting to delete articles and has gotten some not-so-favorable reactions from several people here.

But before you make a judgement, check out the discussions on <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok's User Page</a> and look for Wickethewok's contributions and people's reactions to them. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 00:48, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- The article is intended for Discordian works that do not have their own article. It originally had a section on the second <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> and <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht</i>. The section on the second version, compiled by Rev. DrJon Swabey, was removed on 24 May when hte article on that work was kept. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discordian_Works&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discordian_Works&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> It is intended that sections on other Discordian works that don't have their own article be added here.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As to the importance of <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht</i>, some of it's material was in a work called <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> years before Rev. DrJon Swabey's collection. The name was changed to <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</i> a few months ago, and <i>The Tales of Shamlicht</i> subtitle was just added about a month ago. That's why it doesn't appear in more search hits.</dd>

The ones I checked all talked about the book but under different names--Apocrypha Discordia, Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia, and a few for Tales of Shamlicht. "rev drjon swabey" on MSN got 810 and Google gave 791 but 7 or 8 of the top 10 on both also talked about Reverend Loveshade. On Google the top two hits for DrJon were written by Reverend Loveshade!

<p>The reason the article that was just about <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</i> was deleted were as stated above--some people felt that it didn't deserve its own article/others did--the split on that issue leaned toward keeping the article. The other issue, the one that killed the article, was that some felt that the legal problems were a hoax/a few did not. The hoaxers outvoted the non-hoaxers, and it was deleted.</p>
<p>This article addresses both those things. First, the legal problems have been posted online since 2001 (the dateline on the links proves that; as someone said in their addition, this is admissible as evidence in international court, so it should count here). But if a hoax, an old hoax is still a hoax. This article says the claims of the legal problems have been made since then and may be a hoax, which is fact according to Wikipedia's guidelines. While that was a major part of the original article, it's relatively minor here.</p>
<p>Second, this is not an article about just <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</i>; it's about Discordian Works. There's a whole list of them, which could each have their own section. If they get big enough for their own article, they could each have their own article. Anyone can add something about whatever Discordian Work they chose--that's the point of this article. Should we delete this before they have a chance to add them? <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 00:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the original version of this article, it talked about two works in detail, the two <i>Apocrypha Discordias</i>, one of which still has that name. A lot of the hits for <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> (which were used to justify keeping that article) actually refer to an earlier version of <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</i>, which as somebody said was first called that just a few months ago, and <i>The Tales of Shamlicht</i> was added only a couple weeks ago, so of course it doesn't appear in many hits. (If you notice, the article that was deleted doesn't even include that subtitle).</p>
<p>Check the links listed in this article and you'll see that a lot of the hits for <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> are for the early version of this work, which became <i>Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia</i>. In fact, Rev. DrJon Swabey, who compiled the <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i> that still has that name, recognized that Reverend Loveshade had his own version of <i>Apocrypha Discordia</i><a href="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" class="external autonumber" title="http://appendix.23ae.com/apocrypha/" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> (which became Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia) <a href="http://discordia.loveshade.org/apocrypha" class="external autonumber" title="http://discordia.loveshade.org/apocrypha" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. Check your Google hits and you'll see many more. Note also that in DrJon's argument to keep the article on his collection, he recognized Reverend Loveshade's Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia site as a major Discordian site.<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Apocrypha_Discordia_4329.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Apocrypha Discordia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Apocrypha Discordia</a></p>
<p>There is now a section in this article about <i>Novus Ordo Discordia</i>, and about <i>Summa Universalia</i>, so the article isn't just about two works.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - For the reasons stated above. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamthatIam_66be.html" title="User:IamthatIam">IamthatIam</a> 01:30, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would have said Merge with Apocrypha Discordia, but since they posted this article has been expanded to talk about three Discordian works. <a href="../../../m/r/n/User%7EMRN_67b7.html" title="User:MRN">MRN</a> 05:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Despite some comments to the contrary, this article is about general Discordian works which do not have their own wiki entries. The explosion of Discordian Tracts is most certainly a notable recent development in Discordianism. The article is useful. <a href="../../../d/r/j/User%7EDrjon_0697.html" title="User:Drjon">Drjon</a> 02:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the reasons for suggesting a deletion have already been answered and corrected. I've taken the liberty of putting a Merge suggestion on the article <a href="../../../a/_/d/A_Discordian_Coloring_Book_c930.html" title="A Discordian Coloring Book">A Discordian Coloring Book</a>. It's been a stub since it was created, which is not surprising--how much can you write about a coloring book? But adding that article here would solve the stub problem with that article, and would expand this one to include an additional work.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. I'm disturbed by the possibility that this discussion may have been influenced by recruitment and the presence of people associated with the company, but the article does seem to be considered keep-worthy in its present state. I assume the nominator's threat to take me to arbitration if I closed as keep is nullified by his later 'keep' opinion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Eek, I think I may be guilty of asking people within the Laserfiche community who already have editor accounts to participate in the debate. i.e. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wp%7Esockpuppet.html#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets" title="Wp:sockpuppet">Wp:sockpuppet#Advertising_and_soliciting_meatpuppets</a>. And, as you might note, someone without an editor account has been posting under the name "Employee". So it's not as if I was encouraging people to be deceptive. More like trying to bring "my side" to the discussion. Which, as I've learned from reading the soliciting meatpuppets article, is a no-no. I am very sorry about this.

<ul>
<li>Looked good, but is a Q&amp;A with the founder of LaserFiche when she was elected to the board of directors of AIIM. A tad self-serving?
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> This article was used as a reference source in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserfiche.html" title="Laserfiche">Laserfiche</a> article because it provides company history information. As a side note, Nien-Ling Wacker was on board of directors of the Association of Information and Image Management from 1994-1997.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an employee of Laserfiche. I've been watching the drama unfold. So my 2 cents may be biased. Laserfiche is a not well know consumer brand but it is well known within the industry. Many installations do not get public coverage because document management is not sexy. BTW, the Iraqi deal was sold though a foreign contractor (not US). One of our larger customers is the the 'social security' of Saudi Arabi. It is a distributed system covering different cities connected to a main system in Riyadh (over a bad internet connection). Another interesting application is in US Congress where mail was converted electronically because of Anthrax scare. For what it's worth, CIA (can't say what they are using it for--but they do pay for support and I have been involved with their support incident;) We do have a tens of thousands of government installations (small towns, cities, counties, parashes all over the US) helping local government go paperless and publish documents online. A lot of installations all over branches of the military. I'm sure all this can be independantly verified if you google it (but I don't have time for this). I'm not here to start an argument just posting information in good faith.

<li><b>please read the guidelines for notability</b> Boy, I sure am sorry I've managed to piss you off. I thought I was helping by showing how Laserfiche follows the guidelines for inclusion for corporations. And it follows the guidelines for notability for software. For people like <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> I notice you've never before been involved on a deletion for either a corporation nor for software. Since I wouldn't want to think you work for a competitor and have a grudge against Laserfiche due to its notability in the document management or document imaging industries, I have in good faith been trying to demonstrate how the article actually follows both <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">Wikipedia:Notability (software)</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> by showing a long list of non-trivial third party references. As stated in both those links. Perhaps if you had been involved in more deletions of either software or of corporations I wouldn't be feeling suspicious. Why do I get the feeling that the more I try to provide evidence that the article follows the guideline for inclusion, the less it seems to matter? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 00:57, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not particularly concerned that you're "pissed off"; my only concern is (and was, see below) that the article <b>at the point where I nominated it for deletion</b> did not meet the criteria for inclusion. I do not work for a competitor of LaserFiche. Also note that this looks and feels like a vanity page. I do, however, commend you on attempting to justify inclusion on the grounds of notability, and the research you have undertaken. My voice is just one amongst many. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> 19:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>oh yes, regarding the autobiography issue. There used to exist an article on Laserfiche here on wikipedia that <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlextangent_35bc.html" title="User:Alextangent">Alex</a> nominated for deletion back in March. (The only article he's ever nominated for deletion BTW) I took a look at this article through one of the wikipedia mirrors, and I suspect this article was written by one of our resellers, who are independent companies that are involved in integrating solutions for clients. I didn't know about any of this and so when I learned that we had an article, and it had been deleted, I set out to create a NPOV, independently verifiable article with no original research. Its one thing to edit the earlier article, to conform to wikipedia policy, but as it no longer existed, I felt that I could commit this faux pas to preserve a listing of a notable software product, and a notable company (as defined by the earlier mentioned policies/guidelines). I hope I can persuade others to see things this way, and I thank you for you time and understanding. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 01:13, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Your suspicion of a reseller being the original author of the deleted article is immaterial to the current request for deletion. Your suggestion that I have nominated LaserFiche for deletion twice out of some implied spitefulness or maliciousness is without justification. The original article was very non-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and was a straight advert without merit, as was this article.

<li>I tend to agree, but your opinion would count for more if you were to create a userid and sign in; the IP address does not match the block from LaserFiche (it's now 71.105.240.224).

<li>just out of curiosity, is there <i>anything</i> that can be done to demonstrate that this article should be included in wikipedia? I mean, is there a certain length of story that would make you feel the third party reference is notable? Is there a certain circulation size that would make you think the third party reference is notable? I mean, let's be reasonable here. Does the mere presence of an entry written by an employee make the article deletable, with no consideration of attempts to ensure the article is NPOV, verifiable or notabile? Are there any circumstances under which the article could be edited to satsfy you feeling that Laserfiche could be listed in wikipedia? I.e. If you feel that certain sentences are unverified, or biased, could those sentences be removed, and make you feel that, finally, the article should remain? Please let me know under what circumstances you'd be satisfied that this document management software company would qualify for inclusion.

American Honda engaged her to design a system to help manage documents, primarily for litigation support.

<dd>So, if the issue is Notability and the avoidance of advertising or vanity pages, what burden of proof do you require to satisfy these concerns? For example, let's start with "non-trivial." Since it seems that the links I've provided to show that the company has been "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself," do not seem to fit your criteria of "non-trivial," could you perhaps help provide some criteria that you use to determine if a work is trivial or not?

The short version is that it receives more than a little media attention <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9961735/the_rise_of_the_video_blog" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9961735/the_rise_of_the_video_blog" rel="nofollow">[38]</a><a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/05/01/8375939/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/05/01/8375939/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[39]</a><a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4114" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4114" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. Also, I don't believe that this article qualifies as vanity. So far as I can tell, the subject has not been involved in the creation or editing of the article. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 02:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Many citations and references have now been added. I agree that Baron will be remembered as one of the important pioneers in Internet history. Researched and written by me, so not vanity. The Rocketboom people are so busy making their first million they certainly don't have time to hang out on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepso_53bb.html" title="User:Pepso">Pepso</a> 17:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> With the recent boom in popularity for Rocketboom, someone who's this involved is most definitely notable. As for WP:VAIN, I don't see any conflict of interest with any of the major editors; the burden to prove vanity is on you. WP:BIO: look at the references, they're pretty big sources. WP:NN: that's sort of redundant with the other accusations you've made. WP:VERIFY: once again, look at the references and external links; they're all pretty big and reliable. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 15:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmmm, I've been unsure of this one since it was created. Olsen doesn't have notability from being covered by the mainstream media, and this article doesn't particularly do anything to establish other notability for him (note that the interview in Wired is nothing more than a one sentence quote). However, so far as bloggers go, he is well known. Ultimately, though, I guess he doesn't meet WP:BIO at this point (although I don't believe this article is vanity). So, unless someone can state a good argument for keeping this one, I say <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 10:53, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Correction</b> The Wired article contains more than just a one line quote from Olsen. There actually is a little more content involving him toward the end. Its title under External Links is still a bit misleading though. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 10:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Chuck is actually a well-known online storyteller in Minnesota. He has received lots of regional news coverage there, and his Minnesota Stories project is cited regularly in journalism circles as a best-practice example of community-oriented citizen journalism. I think it would be a shame to see him deleted just because he's not as well known in other parts of the US or the world. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcarvin_7b22.html" title="User:Acarvin">Acarvin</a> 22:38, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The band name was changed this week - however their singer, Din Yalonen is a nationally published and recognized Columnist and Artist who works and sells in Canada. As well as the band... which highest Charting was # 13 at Guelph University Radio - however, this is the biggest indie sation in Canada... Type in Din Yalonen in Yahoo and you get many hits right way. However, this discussion is understandable. Din is not huge, but is certainly notable.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It would seem the entry should be 'Din Yalonen' or "Din Yalonen &amp; the Artists In Exile"</li>
<li><b>Spelling error &amp; Update</b> - Jason Collette should be Jason Collett - Greg Keelor SHOULD be in Wikipedia - he is Jim Cuddy's equal in the band</li>

<p>This page appears to be a vanity page. While a search of Amazon reveals she has indeed published a book, that alone would not make one noteworthy. Millions of books have been published by millions of people. They don't all rate a page on Wikipedia. Nothing about her beyond self-promotion seems noteworthy. The links to the various press releases are links to services that contract press releases from small businesses. Again, they all appear self-aggrandizing. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 21:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Please don't count me twice for deletion as I am the originator of the AfD nomination, but Ms Woodbury, a google search of your name and email address reveals your email address as being "yourfirstname@arhiannonwaitscompany.com", so I seriously doubt you have a neutral interest in this article. If the person you seek to promote is indeed noteworthy, write the article as such. As written, it appears more and more to be as <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> wrote, an article where "Ms. Waits herself edited Wikipedia, or at the very least a friend/employee of hers." Since you apparently work for Ms Waits, you are actually in a far better position than any of us to show why she is notable. But you haven't done that.

<dd><b>Annoyed Answer:</b> it's called a talk page. USE IT. Can anyone help me clarify this for her? We don't email other editors about articles, we talk to them... on their <i>talk</i> page. While it is not required, it's also reccomended that you use proper grammar.</dd>
<dd><b>Calmer, more detailed answer:</b> the places where you would discuss Rhiannon Waits would be my talk page, your talk page, and the article's talk page... and possibly here. At this point, I'm pretty sure everyone agrees you are not Rhiannon Waits. However, you are too close to her to present an unbiased viewpoint, something we value greatly.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia does cover notable New Age authors, certainly - the difference is that I've heard of 4 of the 5 people you mention or their work; plus the pages about them were not generally started by people with a vested interest or partiality in the subject matter, as can be seen from the balanced style most are (I hope) written in. Links might be useful in supporting notability, at least if they are to well-known print publications (such as newspapers) reporting on or reviewing the subject. PR releases just clutter the web with needless verbiage that few take seriously, and have made it very hard for me to extract any relevant factual information about the subject. To put it bluntly, it currently looks like one big publicity bubble with little content, at least none of general interest. <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> remain relevant here. --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a><sup><a href="../../../c/e/d/User_talk%7ECedders_4da3.html" title="User talk:Cedders">tk</a></sup> 20:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wrote the following in a good faith effort to provide some suggestions to you, but was prevented from saving it due to and edit conflict... you had just written your comments above during the time I was editing mine. After reading what looks like a sarcastic retort on your part, I'm only going to continue leave these suggestions as a matter of continued good faith in the hopes you weren't being facetious, but were rather serious. Sarcasm really won't get you anywhere. Please keep that in mind when you write to a discussion page. Anyway, my original comments where as follows: It does not help or lend credibility to your argument that you work for Ms Waits, and that a new wikipedian has logged on to lend support to your cause under the name "Athena Louise", a name that also appears under one of Ms Waits websites as being the pseudonym of a friend of hers, a Ms Barbara Melit.<a href="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/friendrhia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psychic-rhiannon.com/friendrhia.html" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> It leaves other wikipedians (in my opinion) looking at this like it is a publicity campaign, along with all the contracted press releases. My suggestion to you is to follow the old adage "less is more". Example, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Sites_9eef.html" title="Kevin Sites">Kevin Sites</a> is a journalist known by millions of people around the world for his blog and his prominence on Yahoo's website. Yet take a look at his page here on wikipedia... it's not even a full page long. The more "fluff" and unsourced claims you put in this article, the more you link to magazines most of us have never heard of, the more it appears you are trying to make someone seem famous that really isn't. My advice, and it's only my opinion, is to trim the article down to something smaller and well written. Leave a link to her homepage, and put all the magazine links there. I say all this, but even with improvement, the article may be better written and not appear as a publicity stunt, but it still lacks any indication of notoriety. I've thought about this... what is notoriety. The best answer I can give you is not to list what <i>she has written</i>, but rather include what <i>others have written about her</i>. Tolstoy and Asimov may have been among the most prolific authors of all time, but what makes them truly notable is only partly based on what they wrote... the rest is based on what others have written about them. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 21:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The show is aired in Washington - yet also online.Even ABC is airing a TV show online now. You asked for proof of an author - I gave you 2 books and a CD. You asked for proof she is a syndicated columnist. I gave links and proof. You asked proof that she is a motivational Speaker. I gave links, proof and names of owners of several shows. You asked for proof that she works in the same group as people on here. I gave proof and links. You asked to see things writen by OTHERS. I gave you links. You said Prove she is a psychic. I sent you links and I offered numbers to people that validated her predictions while she was on stage.You asked I edit the page. I did and still am. One says add more links - another says shorten. I am thankful for all suggestions. The nice ones for sure. I have tried e-mailing others as I was - and was accused of harrasment even though I was not rude. I have asked for suggestions.

<li><b>Keep</b>.

He has actually deleted this article once already, using the rather bizarre claim that "orphaned re-directs should be deleted", when, in fact, the opposite is true - ideally all re-directs <i>should</i> be "orphaned", to avoid straining the servers. Now he is simply trying to avoid having <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> merged into this article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:16, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>

<dd>I really wish you would read the previous comments; as I said above if Wikipedia *must* have articles on pejorative POV political epithets (which, of course, it really shouldn't), then they at least should be presented in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> way and <b>context</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Homey's reasons for this afd are extremely suspect, especially considering his crusade to keep the Israeli apartheid article. In fact Homey created half a dozen ridiculous articles ending in "apartheid" all of which were about terms that didn't actually exist, just so that he could make a pov disambigiation page. Now he wants to delete the only article that really makes sense to keep.

<dd>So there's no problem with "epithet", because outside of the South African context, the word "apartheid" is being used in a defamatory and abusive manner. Do you think the people who talk about "Israeli apartheid" are trying to <i>praise</i> Israel? Are the people who talk about "sexual apartheid" trying to praise those who believe gay people should be kept apart and discriminated against? "Apartheid" as used in this way <i>is</i> a term of abuse, so "epithet" is correct and non-POV. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:18, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's your POV.

<dd>Actually Homey, I agree with your last sentence. In <a href="http://www.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/Tutu_IU_Israeli_Apartheid.html" class="external text" title="http://www.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/Tutu_IU_Israeli_Apartheid.html" rel="nofollow">one of the "Israeli Apartheid" articles attributed to Archbishop Tutu</a>, his tone is compassionate and constructive. If one reads the article carefully, the first parallel he draws is between the *struggle against* South African apartheid and the *struggle against* the Israeli occupation. In the fourth paragraph he starts to compare the suffering of Palestinians to that experienced by South African Blacks. My reading of it is that his analogy between apartheid and the occupation has as much to do with his faith in the techniques for ending it as it does with criticizing Israel's practices (which, no doubt, he does criticize!).</dd>

<dd>And BTW, I'm not entirely convinced that Desmond Tutu would approve of "Israeli Aparatheid" used as the title of an article on Wikipedia. First, the people who write articles are not usually the ones who write the headlines, so he might not even have used the term. He does compare Israeli practices to apartheid, using the term "apartheid," but (please correct me if I'm wrong) he does not call Israel an "apartheid state." Second, newspaper article titles tend to be written to grab attention so they can compete with the "Jen &amp; Vince keep 'em guessing!" headlines. Wikipedia articles have almost comically utilitarian names like "Trade and Usage of Saffron." What's par for the course in a newspaper headline could be inappropriate in a different context. Like Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-laine.yeo</a> 05:58, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Neither motive nor their characterization, or analysis have anything to do with the fact that it is an epithet. The term apartheid is political and abusive because the term has powerful negative connotations associated with a past system of injustice that everyone is familiar with. When you label someone a "Nazi" it is to demonize that individual by drawing upon the negative connotations of Nazism.</p>
<p>Catagorizing a state or system as an "apartheid state", without it actually being lawfully entrenched apartheid as recognized by international law, gains an audience because of the inflammatory nature of the word. But then offering colloquial or anecdotal evidence is not objective research and wholly manipulative.</p>
<p>It is abusive, it manipulates and maligns by drawing upon an imagined system in one place and stealing the momentum of a successful organized movement that was once against apartheid and hijacking it to the political agendas of those who oppose another state or society. Using vague associations between their target states, these individuals attempt to gain the same legitimacy as the anti apartheid movement, by coopting their agenda through sophistry into what was an existing successful one. It is easier to organize a movement when the groundwork has already been laid down and the inferstructure is there, but the goal has been achieved or is obsolete. Hence, its a propaganda tool to malign and forward a political agenda through negative past association.</p>

<dd>I agree with what Guy said, and written very well I might add. Or, in my own words (written before I saw Guy's) the term "apartheid" in the modern day is used as a pejorative, in a derogatory, defamatory, abusive way (even if, in a particular case, I might think the users of the term are correct), in virtually all cases. The only people I know of who ever used "Apartheid" in a positive sense were the Apartheid-era governments of South Africa (and maybe Rhodesia, or maybe it was called something else there), who decided to call their racial policy "apartheid," and the supporters of that policy of South Africa. Today it is understood to be a bad thing, hence "epithet" is a correct description and non-POV. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 02:39, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep Until</b> either a mediator or the arbitration committee can get this mess straightened out. As others have pointed out, this AfD is part of a much larger disagreement involving several articles.</p>
<ol>
<li>I think that allegations of "apartheid" applied to any country other than South Africa should be discussed only in the context of broader, neutrally-titled articles about that country.</li>
<li>However, I feel even more strongly that if the community accepts having an article specifically about allegations of apartheid in country X (other than South Africa), then it should allow the same for all other countries.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are trying to deal with issues #1 and #2 in no particular order, and one AfD at a time. It's not working. It feels like playing chess with the board broken up and the pieces in different rooms.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen long pages of Talk and AfD discussions for the various related articles, some of which are alleged to have been tampered with. There is a long trail of page renames and redirects, and allegations of all kinds of seriously bad wiki-behaviour. We have multi-day page protections with no end in sight, bans, blocks, and AfD discussions that end in no consensus. Desmond Tutu's name has being brought into the fray; thank God nobody's brought up Mother Teresa yet. Understanding all of this would require stretching out a very long piece of paper on the floor and drawing a detailed timeline.

<dd>Su-laine's comment is a perfect description of how I feel about this as well. It is so confusing. I love this line, it is so true: "It feels like playing chess with the board broken up and the pieces in different rooms." That is perfect. Using (or abusing) the same analogy, I feel like I keep making moves but they don't get me anywhere because after each move, suddenly it's a different game at a different table and nobody can see what happened before.

<li>Indeed. The only appropriate name for a general article on apartheid is <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>; "Apartheid outside of South Africa" is unnecessarily clumsy and convoluted, and "Apartheid (political epithet)" or "Apartheid (epithet)" violate Wikipedia's naming conventions. It's either <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, or deletion, and clearly the term <i>apartheid</i> is noteworthy enough for its own article, even its its usage oustide of a South African historical context is illegitimate. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 16:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is definitely not an indiscriminate collection of information, nor is it a tutorial or instruction manual. Just like dictionaries have pictures of some words to (literally and figuratively) illustrate what they are, encyclopedias contain examples for reference.

The tone of the article is also quite encyclopedic, and the article really helps to explain how to find a derivative; I understand that WP:NOT includes "how-tos," but this is a math function- it would be like the article for multiplication not explaining how to find a product. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:58, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I had to mull over this one for a few minutes.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The main problem with this article is the level: it uses the difference quotient definition to compute derivatives. There is no good reason to do this for any of the functions given; indeed, the only time anyone actually uses the definition to compute such derivatives during the brief time in a calculus course between the introduction of the derivative, and the introduction of the power rule. Therefore this page is <i>de facto</i> textbook material and should go. The tone of the article reinforces my opinion of this. It would not be enough to replace the calculations with more reasonable methods, since then it would just be lost property of the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_derivatives.html" title="Table of derivatives">table of derivatives</a>.

<p>Thanks for the 'nice' comments, but I'll only take the first one (on indiscriminate information) into account, and not much taking into account this encyclopaedia includes a version in Klingon (very 'existent' information, yeah). Of course you English speakers know it is NOT a word, a pretty obvious piece of knowledge many non-English speakers do NOT have. That's why I got the idea of including it, after finding 1100 occurrences in Google and many (non-English speakers) people looking it up in dictionaries. It is my only and last try to include something in here, after watching the encouraging and constructive comments you devote to contributions. Anyway, let me just share another piece of knowledge that you nice brainy English-speakers do NOT have but might find useful one day: lakhu lakhara, ben zonot.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unfortunately. The list is huge, and unverified, in the sense that it is impractical to check whether an entry belongs on it or not, especially given there is no stated criteria. It therefore has gotten filled with things blatantly do not deserve to be on it. (<a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_liver_cirrhosis.html" title="Alcoholic liver cirrhosis">Alcoholic liver cirrhosis</a>? The article on it says it's the 12th leading cause of death in the US, for goodness sakes!)

Per Peyna, though, I will change my vote to a Strong Keep if anyone (Andjam being a strong candidate) were to go through the list and mark just how rare each disease is next to the entry according to some standard people can look up, and say - yup, this source says it's pretty rare. It would then be maintainable and verifiable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:04, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>But again, such information may be addded to the full <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_diseases.html" title="List of diseases">List of diseases</a>. The often-repeated argument arising each time when someone proposed to delete some list because a category exist — is that a list can contain annotations. In our case annotations are most definitely lacking. For example these disease lists contain a big number of synonyms. To mark them would be a good idea as well. To add some to-level classification ("infectous"/"mental disorder"/"unknown") wold be useful as well. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 15:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The entire content of the article is <i>"Lucas Crowson is the character who is first seen when driving into Toon Town in the popular movie, <u>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</u>"</i> Unfortunately, I don't think this meets the speedy deletion criteria, since it's rather obviously non-notable. I'm also not at all sure that the article has anything to do with reality; searching Google for "Lucas Crowson" gets less than a dozen non-related hits, which either underlines the lack of notability or indicates that this is a hoax. (Otherwise I'd just do a redirect, but as the latter seems rather likely, there would be no point in that.) Either way, I don't think this has any place in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:24, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Nominator appears to be a relatively new wikipedia contributor, and may be unfamiliar with wikipedia policies and procedures. A couple of days ago nominator put a {pov-check} tag on this article. The placed a one sentence question on the talk page, asking if others agreed that the article seemed "anti-American". I asked nominator to explain, specifically, what they thought was anti-American. Instead of engaging in a dialogue nominator responded by nominating this article for deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> says that a perception that an article expresses a biased POV is not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a battleground</a> says:

<li>I think it bears repeating that the wikipedia is an international effort. Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of war. Most Afghans are totally illiterate. The loss of a single doctor, like Mohammed's brother, willing to serve in a rural area would be notable, in Afghanistan. Mohammed is not a doctor. But he is a trained medical technician, and he ran their clinic's well equipped lab. So, his loss too is notable in a country where most people are illiterate. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 17:57, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Mohammed remains in detention, even though he was cleared over a year ago. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 04:42, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have no opinion on whether the article in fact satisfies WP:BIO, though I found myself interested in reading the details of the case against a particular member of a group of individuals - the Gitmo detainees - that are indeed, very notable.

<dd>A complete list of all the players who have played in the NHL is very important for when people create player articles. The complete list prevents duplicate articles and helps with disambigs. Categories don't work as well because they only include players who have articles. By listing all the players, red links or not, it is so much easier. One possibility would be to merge all the players onto one article, but i think that would create too large of an article. Separating them alphabetically is efficient and easier to read. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 20:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Unfortunately, categories don't work as well as a complete list of all the players who have played in the NHL for reasons that i have stated above. The idea is, of course, to eventually make an article for each NHL player (except players who have only played one game as one game doesn't make him noteworthy enough for his own article) thereby removing all the red links. I make about 10 player articles a week and I am not the only one making player articles. Not only do I create player articles regularly, I am also spending my time using media sources (such as tsn.ca) to update the list. as far as i know, it is the most complete list of sports players, and therefore the most usefull. A list (such as the baseball one) that is no where near complete is useless. having a complete list is the best way to keep track of all the NHL player articles. Can the articles be changed and improved? of course they can and should, but whatever fate holds true for this hockey list, the same fate must hold true for the baseball, football, soccer, rugby ones too. If you really want to tackle and delete a useless list that should be a category, then delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_in_sports_d4c3.html" title="List of Jews in sports">List of Jews in sports</a>. Why not a List of Christians in sports? or a List of Mormons in sports? Anyways, my point is that there are countless useless lists on wikipedia, and a complete list of sports players that have played in a major league is not one of them. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 17:20, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>: Sorry I've had internet problems and was not able to contribute to the discussion as of yet, but this is just silly that these articles are being put up for deletion in the first place. I agree these pages could be improved so it just isn't names beside links, but it still is an effective way of seeing which NHL players have articles and which do not, so that we may create new articles because they are a ton of very notable NHL players (mostly former ones) who do not yet have an existing article. This list is continuing to get updated, and it is a great guide for us people in the hockey editing world, that could not be used categorically because as I said before, you can't put uncreated articles into categories. I have created numerous stubs (at least 100-150) about hockey players thru these lists that need to have been created. There is no way that these articles should be deleted. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECroat_Canuck_1286.html" title="User talk:Croat Canuck"><font size="1"><font color="blue">Go Leafs Go</font></font></a></i> 15:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
