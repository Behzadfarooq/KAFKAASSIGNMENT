<li>Of course, since these are for the countries as a <i>whole</i>, it's a phony comparison: where you actually are, the actual place I referred to as "the provinces", not the country as whole as you (misleadingly) implied, Kitakyushu is about 0.8% of the population and Fukuoka about 4%. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a></li>
<li>OK, Calton, since you are so keen for my comment on this, here's one. When you first used the term "the provinces" it was pretty clear that it referred to all of Japan outside Tokyo. Now you want it to mean <i>only</i> (if I'm still allowed to use this word!) Kitakyushu. If I may be permitted a soccer metaphor here (ha ha, how appropriate) I would say that is moving the goalposts, or making the goal much smaller if you prefer (that reminds me, our team could do with some bigger ones!). Oh, and I think you should clarify whether you mean Fukuoka <i>prefecture</i> or Fukuoka <i>city</i> in your last comment above. Presumably you mean that Fukuoka prefecture has 4% do you, because there is not such a great difference between the population of Fukuoka city (about 1.4 million) and Kitakyushu (just under one million in the recent national census.) --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 07:54, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've changed my vote. I thought it was a good idea at the time I started the entry, but it seems that it is vanity and inappropriate to wikipedia, or perceived as such by the majority, so that's fair enough. I can probably use this material elsewhere on the web anyway. Thank you everyone. I have learned from this rather bruising experience.--<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 22:55, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you, Kappa. That's the nicest thing anybody has said about it so far.I shall certainly be more careful about starting articles on wikipedia in future, because I haven't encountered <a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWhouk_b2f7.html#Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FColin_Carmichael" title="User talk:Whouk">this level of testosterone-fuelled aggression</a> before. Life must be even more stressful in Tokyo than I imagined. Glad I don't live there, though I do enjoy the occasional visit.--<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 07:38, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To whoever has the power to delete articles - administrators I presume. Please note that I have deleted my initial <b>Keep</b> vote and replaced it with a <b>Delete</b> vote, which makes it unanimous now in favour of deletion. I do hope it will not be too long before that happens and we can all forget about this mistake on my part.

<li>Thank you. That makes it 11-0 in favour of deletion if my arithmetic is correct. If that were a soccer score it would probably qualify as a "hyper-rout" (if the word exists) or a massacre, thrashing etc. So surely it is time to put this article out of its misery? --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 15:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, it is still here, and if it is not going to be deleted yet I may as well keep editing it. (Is this a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catch_22.html" title="Catch 22">Catch 22</a>?!) Though I say it myself, it is getting better and better. I might even change my vote back to <b>Keep</b>! --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistorian_91b7.html" title="User:Historian">Historian</a> 23:14, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
