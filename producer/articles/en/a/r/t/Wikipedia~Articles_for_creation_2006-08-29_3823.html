<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-29_3823.html" title="Edit section: Jonathan Eddy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jonathan Eddy</span></h2>
<p>Jonathan Eddy was a resident of Nova Scotia during the time of the American Revolutionary War. He was considered by some to be a radical as he strongly encouarged the residents of Nova Scotia to join their American brothers in open revolt against the King George III and England and to become the fourteenth colony to sign the declaration of independance on 4 July 1776.</p>
<p>Jonathan Eddy had been a prominent businessman in Halifax until 1775 when the revolution began in Massachussets. He made what some would call a mistake and pledged openly his support for the Rebellion. Following Governor Legge's crackdown on seditious persons and seeing an opportunity, Jonathan Eddy fled to Cumberland on the far side of Truro into what is now New Brunswick, Canada. He frequently made excursions to Samuel Adams and the General Court of Massachussets as well as to General George Washington. Here he was met with different levels of support for his rebellion in Nova Scotia. Sam Adams pledged full support, troops, weapons, ammunition, and more, while Washington basically said not to expect any support at all. The General Court of Massachussets made empty promises of support, but when the time came none was given.</p>
<p>In August 1776, shortly after the lack of support from his brother Nova Scotians on the signing of the Declaration of Independance, the new governor of Nova Scotia ordered Colonel Gorham's Royal Fencible Americans to secure Ft. Cumberland and keep watch for any signs of an American invasion of the province from what is now Maine. Jonathan Eddy, knowing he was being monitored by authorities loyal to the King, fled to Massachussets where he was made a full colonel in the Continental Armt and given authority to raise a regiment of his own with the sole purpose of invading Nova Scotia through Cumberland and Truro and then east into Halifax, securing the Royal Navy's last anchorage on the continent.</p>
<p>Shortly after General Howe's army departed Nova Scotia to attack New York in 1776, Jonathan Eddy made his move. His force of 500 American militiamen and an unknown number of Nova Scotian rebels marched on Fort Cumberland. They attempted to storm the fort on 13 December 1776 and were repulsed, two more attempts were made on the 22nd and 23rd, but before long a British frigate arrived in the Bay of Fundy with Canadian Regulars aboard and relieved the fort. Jonathan Eddy and his militia force fled back to massachussets leaving Eddy's Nova Scotian supporters to face the British reprisals alone.</p>
<p>Little information is available about Jonathan Eddy after the failure at Fort Cumberland.</p>

<p>Derek Edward Weston is one of the leading young orchestral and choral conductors in Florida and is recognized as a leader in the artistic community of Tampa Bay. He conducted his first international professional symphony orchestra at the age of 23, was appointed as Director of Choral Studies at the Pinellas County Center for the Arts at 24, conductor of "Una Voce:" The Florida Men's Chorale at 25, and Assistant Conductor for a professional choral and orchestral performance in Carnegie Hall at age 26. In August of 2006, Una Voce appointed Derek as their first Artistic Director.</p>
<p>Derek's first performance with the Florida Men's chorale combined the chorus with members of The Florida Orchestra performing "When We No Longer Touch." The performance was heralded as having achieved technical perfection along with winning the audience over with heart and soul. Una Voce's success with this work earned them an invitation to perform "When We No Longer Touch" in Carnegie Hall along side twenty-one other choruses from around the world. Derek was appointed Assistant Conductor to Tim Seelig for this performance and conducted the 250 member chorus in rehearsals.</p>
<p>At the Pinellas County Center for the Arts at Gibbs High School, Derek teaches courses in vocal performance, choral and instrumental conducting, and conducts four choruses. His Choral Arts Ensemble frequently performs major works with the PCCA Chamber Orchestra under his baton. During his first year of teaching, his Women's Chorale at PCCA earned Superior ratings at the Florida Vocal Association assessment.</p>
<p>Derek also joined the faculty of Eckerd College during the spring of 2006 as the college's Director of Choral Activities (sabbatical replacement), where he conducted the Eckerd College Choir. The ensemble will had several performances across Florida under his baton.</p>
<p>A native of Illinois, Derek earned his Master of Arts in Orchestral and Choral Conducting and his Bachelor of Music Education degrees from Eastern Illinois University. While at Eastern, Derek was appointed as a sabbatical replacement conductor of the Women's Chorus and served as assistant conductor of the Eastern Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, University Mixed Chorus, Concert Choir, and Oratorio Society, all of which he conducted in performance. Derek was the first graduate student to conduct for the winner of Eastern's Annual Concerto Competition, as well as the first graduate student to conduct a major orchestral and choral masterwork in performance. One of his concerts at Eastern was reviewed in the newspaper as "a performance that sparkled from the first note to the last."</p>
<p>In June of 2003, he was selected for the Conductor's Institute of South Carolina where he was coached by Paul Vermel, Samuel Jones, Victoria Bond, Peter Jaffe, and Donald Portnoy. Later that summer, Derek made his first international conducting appearance with the Rosario Symphony in Rosario, Argentina, one of South America's premier professional orchestras. Derek also served as Director of Music at First United Methodist Church of Mattoon, Illinois, where he was founder and conductor of the First United Methodist Church Chorale. The Chorale had their PBS television premier in December of 2000 under his direction. He spent two summers as Music Director and Conductor of the Gumball Theatre Company in Chicago where he led a semi-professional cast in several productions. Derek has been active as a guest conductor, clinician, and adjudicator for festivals, summer music camps, and municipal ensembles, both choral and instrumental, and has sung in professional choruses. Derek, his wife Gwenn, and son Gregory live in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p>

The pendulum is positioned above the victoms cheast, so when it reaches him, the pendulum slices through the man's heart, killing him. Although an intresting idea, the pendulum is not known to ever been used. It has appeared in sevreal books and movies, inculding the Pit and the Pendulum, The Raven (1935, and the Return of Chondu, in which a scimatar-like blade is used.</p>

<p>In particle physics, the ADD model, also known as the model with old large dimensions, is a scenario inspired by string theory to explain the weakness of gravity relatively to other forces in which the fields of the Standard Model are confined to a higher-dimensional membrane, while gravity can propagate in several additional spatial dimensions that are compact but large. A solution was proposed in 1998 first time by ADD\footnote{Nima\, Arkani-Hamed,\, Savas\, Dimopoulos,\, Gia\, Dvali} to the Hierarchy problem not relying on low-energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The pointview was the nullifying the problem by bringing quantum gravity down to the TeV scale. This is the fateful evocation of the presence of $n\geq 2$ new dimensions of sub-milimeter size, with the SM fields localised on a 3-brane in the higher dimensional spacetime. In other words, the gravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which taken as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature.</p>
<p>If the extra dimensions were indeed so large, the laws of gravity would be modified at distances comparable to the size of the extra dimensions. So, why don’t we see this in experiments? In fact it turns out that we know very well how gravity works for large distances (Isaac Newton’s famous law that says that gravitational force between two bodies falls off as the square of distance between them). However, no one has tested how well this works for distances less than about 1 mm. It is complicated to study gravitational interactions at small distances. Objects positioned so close to each other must be very small and very light, so their gravitational interactions are also small and hard to detect. While a new generation of gravitational experiments that should be capable of probing Newton’s law at short distances (up to 1 micron) is under way, our current knowledge about gravity stops at distances of the order of 1 mm. We currently cannot say whether there are, or are not, possible extra dimensions smaller than 1 mm.</p>
<p>The new premise was that the fundamental Planck scale is taken to be about the weak scale, where gravity becomes comparable in strength to the other interactions. In this approach, the observed weakness of gravity at long distance is caused by the presence of $n$ large new spatial dimensions which compared to the electroweak scale.</p>
<p>This can be inferred from the relation between the Planck scale of the $(4+\delta)$ dimensional theory $M_{Pl(4+\delta)}$ and the long-distance four dimensional theory $M_{Pl(4)}$\footnote{See hep-ph/9807344 for detailed discussion by ADD} by two most simple ways: \begin{itemize} \item Einstein equation in any $4\, dimensional\, spacetime$ is \begin{eqnarray} \label{GmunuRmunuRgmu} G_{\mu \nu}=R_{\mu \nu}-\frac {1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu}=\frac{1}{M^2_{Pl}}T_{\mu \nu} \end{eqnarray} where $R_{AB}$ is Ricci tensor, $R$ is Ricci scalar, $g_{AB}$ is metric tensor and $T_{AB}$ is energy-momentum tensor. This equation is valid in any dimension spacetime. Dimension can be arbitrary D dimension. Therefore equation is \begin{eqnarray} \label{GABMDPlTAB} G_{AB}=\frac {1}{M^{D-2}_{Pl} T_{AB}} \end{eqnarray} where, $A,B=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...$.</p>
<p>To know this, we must look Einstein-Hilbert action in $D-$dimensional spacetime. For now, we do not know whether $M_{Pl}$ in $4-$dimensions and $M_{Pl}^{D-2}$ in $D-$dimensions are same or not. \begin{eqnarray} \label{SdxddeltayMDD} S=\int d^4x d^\delta y \sqrt{-g}\left\{-\frac {1}{2}M^{D-2}_D R \left( x,y \right)\right\} \end{eqnarray} where $D=4+\delta $, $M^{D-2}_D$ is a mass term which is defined in $D-$dimensional spacetime, $R$ is $D-$dimensional curvature scalar. Here, we separated $4-$dimensional part and extra dimensional part. Absolutely, the curvature scalar is a function of $x$ and $y$. $x$ are related with $4$-dimensional spacetime, $y$ are related with extra dimensional space.</p>
<p>In other words, we live in $4-dimensional\, spacetime$, and with our spacetime, there are some neighbor spaces which are compactified. The particles i.e. which are sufficiently energetic, can pass beyond $4$-dimension. The space, which is over the extra dimensions, is extra space. For instance, we assume a scenario as in $figure-4$. The circle belongs to extra dimension is a compact object. This structure is most basic form of ADD model.</p>
<p>As a special case, \begin{eqnarray} \label{SdxMR} S=\int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\left\{-\frac{1}{2} M^2_4 R_4\right\} \end{eqnarray} Recall that, the equations of motion are obtained from (\ref{SdxMR}) \begin{eqnarray} \label{GmunuMTmunu} G_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{M^2_4} T_{\mu \nu} \end{eqnarray} The (\ref{GmunuMTmunu}) says us, the interaction between two massive particles obeys the Newton's law is defined by \begin{eqnarray} \label{piMmmR} \frac{1}{8 \pi M^2_4} \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2} \end{eqnarray} where, $8 \pi M^2_4$ is Newton's constant ($G_N$). \begin{eqnarray} \label{dxpiRdypiRd} S &amp;=&amp; \int d^4 x \int^{2 \pi R}_0 dy_1 \int^{2 \pi R}_0 dy_2 ... \int^{2 \pi R}_0 dy_{\delta} \sqrt{-g}\left\{-\frac{1}{2}M^{D-2}_D R \left( x \right)\right\}\\ &amp;=&amp; \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}\left\{-\frac{1}{2} M^{D-2}_D \left( 2 \pi R \right)^\delta R_D \left( x \right)\right\} \end{eqnarray} where $R$ has no $\overrightarrow{y}$ dependence since existence of Kaluza-Klein's cylindrical symmetry condition.</p>
<p>In this point, let's conpare the last line of the equation (\ref{dxpiRdypiRd}) with the equation (\ref{SdxMR}) since $R_{\mu \nu}$ is function of $x,y$ and Kaluza-Klein's cylindrical symmetry condition. \begin{eqnarray} \label{MRMDDpiRdeltaR} \frac{1}{2} M^2_4 = \frac{1}{2} M^{\delta + 2}_D \left( 2 \pi R \right)^\delta \end{eqnarray} Since, we know the Newton's constant ($G_N$), we know that $M_4$ is $M_{Pl}$. Thus, \begin{eqnarray} \label{MPlMdeltaDpiRdelta} M^2_{Pl}=M^{\delta + 2}_D \left( 2 \pi R \right)^\delta \end{eqnarray} Indeed, importance of weight in this work is that $M_{Pl}$ is related to strength of gravitational force between two massive particles in $4$-dimension spacetime. In addition, Newton's constant $G_N$ is very small ($M_{Pl}=10^{18}\, m_{proton}$). Then, the idea is the reason of the attraction force is very weak in $4$-dimension spacetime.</p>
<p>In despite of the $M_{Pl}$ is enormous, $M_D$ is chosen as small. In string theory, \begin{eqnarray} \label{MPlMdeltaDpildeltap} M^2_{Pl}=M^{\delta + 2}_{Pl\,\left( \delta + 4 \right)} \left( 2 \pi l_p \right)^\delta \end{eqnarray} where $l_p$ is ($10^{-33}\, cm$) planck length. On the contrary, if we consider the large extra dimensions, \begin{eqnarray} \label{MPlmpdeltapidelta} M^2_{Pl}= \left( 1000 \, m_p \right)^{\delta + 2} \left( 2 \pi \it R \right)^\delta \end{eqnarray} where $R$ is equal to $1 \, mm$, $1000 \, m_p \simeq 1\, TeV$. \item To derive the exact relationship between the Newton constants $G_{N(4+\delta)}$, $G_{N(4)}$ of the full $(4+\delta)$ and compactified $4-$dimensional theories, defined by the force laws \begin{eqnarray} \label{FdeltazGNdeltammR} F_{(4+\delta)}(z)&amp;=&amp;G_{N(4+\delta)}\frac{m_1m_2}{R^{\delta +2}}\nonumber\\ F_{(4)}(z)&amp;=&amp;G_{N(4)} \frac{m_1m_2}{R^2} \end{eqnarray} One of the easiest derivation is a trivial application of Gauss' Law. Let us compactify the new $\delta$-dimensions $y_\delta$ by making the periodic identification (as in sec. 1.2.2) $y_\delta \sim y_\delta + L$. Then assume that a point mass $m$ is placed at the origin. This situation can be reproduced in the uncompactified theory by placing "mirror" masses periodically in all the new dimensions. Of course for a test mass at distances $r\ll L$ from $m$, the "mirror" masses make a negligible small contribution to the force and we have the $(4+\delta)$ dimensional force law. However for $r\gg L$, the discrete distance between mirror masses can not be discerned and they look like an infinite $\delta$ spatial dimensional "line" with uniform mass density. The problem is analogous to finding the gravitational field of an infinite line of mass with uniform mass/unit length, where Klein's cylindrical symmetry and Gauss' law give the answer. Following exactly the same procedure, we consider a "cylinder" $C$ centered around the $\delta$ dimensional line of mass, with side length $l$ and end caps being three dimensional sphere's of radius $r$. We now apply the $(4+\delta)$ dimensional Gauss law which reads \begin{eqnarray} \label{surfaceCFdSSdeltaGN} \int_{surface\, C}FdS=S_{(3+\delta)}G_{N(4+\delta)}\times Mass\, in\, C \end{eqnarray} where \begin{eqnarray} \label{SDpiDGammaD} S_D=\frac{2\pi^{D/2}}{\Gamma \left( \frac{D}{2}\right)} \end{eqnarray} is the surface area of the unit sphere in $D$ spatial dimensions (recall taht the usual Gauss law has a $\pi$ factor on the RHS). In our case, the LHS is wqual to $F(z)\times 4\pi \times l^\delta$, while the total mass contained in $C$ is $m\times (l^\delta / L^\delta)$. Equating the two sides, we find the correct $1/R^2$ force law and can identify \begin{eqnarray} \label{GNSdeltapiGNdeltaV} G_{N(4)}=\frac{S_{(3+\delta)}}{4\pi}\frac{G_{N(4+\delta)}}{V_\delta} \end{eqnarray} where $V_\delta=L^\delta$ is the volume of compactified dimensions. \end{itemize} See in (Arkani-Hamed and Dimopoulos 1998) for detail. As a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions, the Planck scale must become enormous. In this case, the Planck scale $M_{Pl}\sim 1/G^{1/2}_N$ is no longer a fundamental scale. Our search for extra dimensions is not over yet. In fact, it has only just started. We are also looking for the effects of extra dimensions in collisions that produce different types of particles, such as quarks. We are also looking for events where gravitons are produced in the collisions and then leave our three-dimensional world, travelling off into one of the other dimensions. This would cause an apparent non-conservation of energy from the point of view of our three dimensional world.</p>

<p>Rimfrost was founded in the summer of 2002 by Hravn and Throllv. The music is extreme and cold. They have one MCD out and the debut album "A frozen world unknown" will be released in the autumn of 2006. Rimfrost has a record deal with the german label No Colours Records. Here`s a little list of what Rimfrost created (from the first demo to the debutalbum):</p>
<ul>
<li>Debut demo 2002: "Mörkrets Furstar"</li>
<li>Demo 2003: "Unredeemed Demons"</li>
<li>Demo 2004/2005: "Winds of hostility blows the horizon"</li>
<li>MCD 2005: "A journey to a greater end"</li>
<li>Debut album 2006: " A frozen world unknown"</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first songs they ever wrote was a primitive kind of black metal and the lyrics was on swedish.</p>
<p>Luckily they abanded that genre and moved forward to the extrem black/death metal they play today. Rimfrost had a lot of trouble finding the right bassplayer. Hravn and Throllv is the only two original members left in the band.</p>

<p>Sanchia Lewis was born in Blackheath, London, in 1960. After completeing her foundation year at Medway College of Design, she studied printmaking at the City and Guilds of London Art School, passing her certificate in printmaking with distinction in 1982. On leaving college, she trained as an editioner with the etcher Paul Bisson before receiving an award from the Princes Trust, which enabled her to set up her own studio.</p>
<p>Sanchia has exhibited widely in the U.K., Holland, France, the former Soviet Union and the United States. In 1993, she was awarded First Prize in the Portobello Open Exhibition and in 1995, the Marlborough Gallery Prize at the National Print Exhibition.</p>
<p>U.K. Galleries include, Honor Oak Gallery, London SE23, Westbourne Gallery, London SW8, Cambridge Contemporary Art, Cambridge, Castle Gallery, Inverness, and the Serena Hall Gallery, Suffolk.</p>
<p>Publications include, The Art World Directory, published by Art Review, Who's Who in Art, The Art Trade Press Ltd, and the Dictionary of International Biography, International Biographical Centre Cambridge.</p>
<p>This year her work has been selected for inclusion in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and the Contemporary Printmaking Exhibition 'Originals 06' at the Mall Galleries, at which she is a regular exhibitor.</p>
<p>Now living near Peckham Rye, she works in a converted stable building by the side of her house, producing etchings and paintings. The sources of her inspiration are varied- a walk in the country, animals, birds, a visit to a Museum, ancient artefacts, a piece of treen, an antique rug - filtered by her sub -concious mind, they evolve into richly textured, brightly coloured works functioning as the visual diary of a very lateral thinker, combining symbolism, humour and, sometimes, a dreamy, other-worldly quality.</p>

<p>Payam is a sleepy little village in the valley of Western Ghats, surrounded by river Bavali in Kannur district of northern Kerala. Though lying close to Iritty, the nerve centre of business in this hilly region, it lies isolated as there is no proper transport facilities to reach the village. Agriculture is the main occupation and it has a glorious history of farmers’ movement way back in 1948. As much as 11 farmers were shot dead at Salem Jail during the movement. Noted journalist Payam Sudhakaran hails from this lethargic hamlet. Even in this modern times, Payam remains like a fictional hamlet with its thousand-odd strong population still living a life far away from the growth.</p>

<p>Pollack's law targets the performance increase of a new microarchitecture in relation to a previous version. It states that a new generation microprocessor, which uses two times more devices (transistors) resulting in double the area on a chip, increases its performance only by factor 1.4.</p>
<p>Shortly, the performance increases by the square root of the area used.</p>

What's unique about this piece, is that there are no voice actors during the entire length, and instead, a light jazz piece plays.<br />
The piece begins with the view of a large penthouse to which Bruce Wayne is gazing out the window. He's pulled to the dance floor by three lovely young ladies (A group of young ladies stands in the background as well, one of the being <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canary_8568.html" title="Black Canary">Black Canary</a></i>). Each has thier turn before Alfred rescuses Bruce, who dives into a nearby elevator. When the doors open, none other then Catwoman it at the safe, stealing a bag of money. Catwoman pins an angry Bruce Wayne to the wall while she finishes and makes her escape. Bruce breaks free, and heads after her as Batman.<br />
<br />
He finds her on the rooftops, and the Chase begins!<br />
<br />
She dives several dozens stories below into busy traffic, breaking her fall with a banner and swinging onto a tour bus. She poses for some pictures and Batman arrives, taking most of the publicity away from her.<br />
<br />
They jump on a milk truck tanker and Catwoman blows the tires out. The truck spins off, and Batman persues after her, ignoring the truck dumping gallons of milk on a couple of stray cats, and Bullock.<br />
<br />
Then, they jump on a train, where, while going into a tunnel, batman looses Catwoman, only to see her trail leading into a zoo. E<br />
xpectedly, she had detoured through the Large Cats exibit and leaves Batman. He escapes through the sunroof while Catwoman runs into an aviary to be chased out by a flock of bats. She is then cornered by Batman against the gates of the zoo. She notices he was scratched earlier, and feels bad for it. She leans to kiss him and Batman pushes her away.<br />
<br />
She looks extremely dejected from this. Batman then sweeps her into his arms and gives her a very long kiss.<br />
<br />
The cops arrive, and Batman smiles at her. He takes the bag of money, and leaves. Catwoman smiles, thinking she's been let off the hook, only to find herself handcuffed to the fence. She hangs her head in dejection.<br />
<br />
You see Bruce Wayne sadly looking through the window at the party, again, watching the cop cars fly past. A woman grabs his arm and pulls him back to the party.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Alastairo was an ancient king's messenger, with slow speeds, who died in an accident while helping the tormented villages. It has been said that villagers hated Alastairo and the king and plotted to kill them. However, one betrayed them and a war raged between the king and the villages. Alastairo, returning from his task was happy to see the deplored state of his nation and decided to help the villagers. The villagers beat him up till he was near death. Alastairo then mustered all energy left and crawled toward the king to give the final and fatal blow but in his state of dillusion, killed the king's hamster instead. The king immediatley slayed off his head. Subsequently, Alastairo died. The villagers erected a gold statue of Alastairo in remembrance of his hamster-killing act and to remind themselves of the horrible mistake they had made of judging others. Good news is, the statue has been since destroyed by the Yersurians in 34BC.</p>

<p>I have a suggestion."Dormie" according to the OED the origin of "dormie is unknown. It is a term used applied only to golf. The condition is explained in the Wikipedia article on "match play". I thought it would be a good idea to give "dormie" its own space by exerpting the description from "match play". Most golfers are vague re the meaning.</p>

<p>HIMEX landed a lucrative deal to guide a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> film crew to the Everest summit in May 2006. On May 14th, the first HIMEX crew headed for the summit along with a number of other teams, including a loosely-affiliated group of indiviual climbers. Among them was British teacher <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sharp_97b4.html" title="David Sharp">David Sharp</a>, whose fate would forever be tied to Brice's subsequent decisions.</p>
<p>Sharp had attempted to summit Everest twice before and was determined to reach his goal this time...unfortunately, he quickly ran into trouble on the crowded mountain and collapsed near the summit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" class="external text" title="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" rel="nofollow">According to HIMEX team members</a>, Sharp's immobility was quickly known to Brice, who had chosen to observe his team's summit through a telescope from a base camp below. He subsequently took a number of radio calls from fellow guides and clients on the mountain, asking how they could help Sharp down the mountain.</p>
<p>One guide specifically recalls <a href="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=7953" class="external text" title="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=7953" rel="nofollow">"repeatedly asking in vain their expedition leader, Russell Brice, for help over radios"</a> with no response.</p>
<p>When he could be reached, Brice <a href="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" class="external text" title="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" rel="nofollow">replied</a> that HIMEX didn't have enough manpower to help a non-team member down the mountain.</p>
<p>Whether or not these communications ever happened is in dispute, as Brice <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" rel="nofollow">disagress with a number of his clients</a> and employees who all claim they made the gave the information to Brice on thier way up.</p>

<p>The crux of Brice's refusal to help is his lack of available resources and manpower. Reality however, was very different. The base camp had become aware of Sharp's prediciment and were actively trying to find a way to assist Sharp.</p>
<p>But when <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_Hutson_be49.html" title="Shaun Hutson">Shaun Hutson</a>, one of Brice's guides who was above Sharp on Everest, asked if there was time for him to personally summit, Brice replied with the now-infamous line, "Good on ya, mate. Go for the summit." Brice wanted his guide to "tag the summit", later justifying it to the media by explaining that Hutson was an excellent guide and that <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/feature/0608/everest.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mensjournal.com/feature/0608/everest.html" rel="nofollow">"(if) I can send a guide up to the top, hopefully he’ll work for us more in the future"</a>.</p>

<p>This obvious allegiance to commerce infuriated a number of fellow climbers around Brice at base camp, who have subsequently spoken out about his indifference towards Sharp.</p>
<p>HIMEX clients became visibly furious with Brice in front of other teams on the mountain. <a href="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" class="external text" title="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" rel="nofollow">Client Brett Merrell screamed curses at Brice</a> in front of Discovery Channel cameras after hearing Brice clear Hutson to personally summit instead of attempting a rescue of Sharp.</p>

<p>Claiming Inglis' early calls about Sharp still being alive simply didn't happen, Brice asserts he never told Inglis that <a href="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" class="external text" title="http://climb.mountainzone.com/2006/david_sharp/index.html" rel="nofollow">"you know, he's effectively dead"</a> when Chayas told Brice that Sharp was still alive and speaking.</p>
<p>Discovery Channel cameraman Mark Whetu gave an interview to a New Zealand-based magazine confirming that "he and his team passed David Sharp on ascent and radioed their 'sighting' back to base, <a href="http://www.humanedgetech.com/news.php?id=10086" class="external text" title="http://www.humanedgetech.com/news.php?id=10086" rel="nofollow">where expedition leader Russell Brice advised the team to carry on."</a></p>
<p>But perhaps the most damning moment came when HIMEX Sherpas &amp; Discovery Channel clients came upon David, who was still alive and speaking. The Sherpas radioed Brice <i>and were instructed to climb down</i>. That whole incident (including Sharp speaking) was recorded by cameras mounted on HIMEX member's helmets in what would turn out to be the last footage of Sharp alive.</p>
<p>David Sharp died later that day and his body still lies where the HIMEX team left him.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-29_3823.html" title="Edit section: Controversial Press Release">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversial Press Release</span></h4>
<p>The event received worldwide media coverage, sparking outrage around the globe towards Brice personally. His <a href="http://www.himex.com/c_pub/en/news/2006/reflections_on_everest.php" class="external text" title="http://www.himex.com/c_pub/en/news/2006/reflections_on_everest.php" rel="nofollow">response</a> came after <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" rel="nofollow">ignoring</a> the crushing demand for answers for more than a month.</p>
<p>In what <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a> described as a <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/2006-climbing-season-3.html" rel="nofollow">"curious document"</a>, Brice begins by complaining that HIMAX spent 32000 USD to fix ropes on Everest and goes on to list more than a dozen ways HIMEX (as the most well-equipped team) had helped other teams on the mountain during the season with necessities like power and oxygen.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sharp_97b4.html" title="David Sharp">David Sharp</a> is then addressed after an obtuse reference to climbers of "limited ability". Brice states that the rescue descent itself would have been impossible, even if Sharp could have been medically revived. And ultimately, he argues, the decision to save Price was up to HIMEX Sherpas on the mountain, stating that "The fact that Phurba did not ask for assistance confirmed to me that it was not possible to rescue David."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his concluding statement that "If I had known there was a problem on the way up...most certainly I would have investigated the chance of a rescue" directly contradicts <a href="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" class="external text" title="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" rel="nofollow">HIMEX client and employee statements</a> that they personally spoke to Brice about Sharp on their way up.</p>
<p>This would prove to be the most controversial statement Brice made, implying Sharp could have been saved had Brice received the calls that HIMEX clients and guides adamently maintain they made to him.</p>
<p>Brice then went on to recount his successful rescue of another climber, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Hall_a3cd.html" title="Lincoln Hall">Lincoln Hall</a>, one week later on Everest. The point seemed to be reassuring potential customers of his skill and care, but many saw it as an attempt at repairing HIMEX's damaged public profile.</p>
<p>That Brice pointedly <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/feature/0608/everest.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mensjournal.com/feature/0608/everest.html" rel="nofollow">noted the cost (20000 USD)</a> of Hall's rescue led <a href="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" class="external text" title="http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=10064" rel="nofollow">some in the climbing community</a> to dismiss its inclusion as disingenuous and self-serving.</p>
<p>This weariness towards Brice's motives was bolstered by the revelation that <a href="http://www.slope.ru/?p=world-news&amp;m=menu1&amp;l=en&amp;view=3473" class="external text" title="http://www.slope.ru/?p=world-news&amp;m=menu1&amp;l=en&amp;view=3473" rel="nofollow">the spot where Sharp died is 1000 ft closer to base camp</a> than the place where he had his own clients rescued five years prior.</p>
<p>Brice finished with a lament to his clients about how he is "sorry that their achievement has been overshadowed by the numerous deaths on Everest this year".</p>

<p>Brice endured tremendous criticism from the interntional community regarding his decisions on Everest in May 2006.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteable voice was <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Edmund_Hillary_194d.html" title="Sir Edmund Hillary">Sir Edmund Hillary</a>, the first man to ever summit Everest. He harshly derided HIMEX, stating that, "They don’t give a damn for anybody else who may be in distress and it doesn’t impress me at all that they leave someone lying under a rock to die."</p>

<p>Brice and HIMEX continue to solicit Everest clients and quote between 8,000-40,000 USD for support on the mountain.</p>

<p>"Dear Friend" was a song written by Paul McCartney, and appeared on the album Wild Life. The song is a response to John Lennon's song "How Do You Sleep?" which was a song attacking Paul McCartney in the years following the breakup of the Beatles.</p>
<p>The song itself is a very simple song, roughly 5:45 in length. The lyrics themselves are as follows:</p>
<p><i>Dear friend, whats the time?</i> Is this really the borderline? Does it really mean so much to you? Are you afraid, or is it true?</p>
<p>Dear friend, throw the wine, I'm in love with a friend of mine. Really truly, young and newly wed. Are you a fool, or is it true?</p>
<p>Are you afraid, or is it true?</p>
<p>The verse then repeats once. While the song does not go out to attack John Lennon, the song does show Paul McCartney's position on the whole disagreement between the friends/ex-band members.</p>

<p>From what I gather Methros is either a patron of shamans or a demon. Methors may be a force in and of itself. Methros is said to be the servant of Pelarsis, but I find the unlikely. There are many conflicting accounts of Methros both as a person and a force. As a person he is said to have a great black lion as a familiar.</p>

<p>San Francisco, CA's Angry Amputees were formed in 2000 in the city's seedy Tenderloin District. A couple of line up changes occurred and the band moved into a wherehouse together where they refined their sound and founded a screen printing operation called Camputee Press. The band now comprises vocalist/guitarist Stacey Dee, lead guitarist Eric Gonzales, bassist/vocalist John Dalton (aka Dalty -- an actual amputee, incidentally), and drummer Jen Kirk. Performing melodic power punk in the image of cross-the-Bay scenesters Green Day, the distinctly coed band appeared on the Warped Tour in 2001 and 2002, and was voted "best punk band in the Bay Area" at the SF Weekly Music Awards later that year. Teaming up with independent Dead Teenager Records and renowned producer Jack Endino the following year, the Angry Amputees recorded and released their debut album, Slut Bomb. They have also appeared on compilations such as "For Those About To Trip...A Tribute To RKL" on Malt Soda Records, "Death Rattle &amp; Roll, Volume 1" on Wondertaker Records (credited as The Amputees), and the song, "She Said" off of the album Slut Bomb made its way onto Activision's "Tony Hawks Underground" video game soundtrack. It's the only track on the game featuring a female vocalist. The game won a 2004 MTV Video Music Award for best video game soundtrack of the year. Also in 2004, the band headlined for the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas and then toured Britain and The Netherlands. The band has currently been on temporary hiatus from 2005-06 following singer Stacey Dee’s departure to live in London, but will regroup upon her return in late 2006.</p>

<p>Phaedra Thea (July 29th,1991-present) Is a typical american teenager. She eats junk food, goes to highschool,has a boyfriend,and despises her government. She also despises doing homework over the summer, when she would much rather be sleeping or updating her blog&#160;: Coldfish. However, do to the growing strain of oil,lessening of jobs as "freewriter", and sudden loss of childhood, she'd rather waste a mere minute or two of someone working for Wikipedia instead of finalizing her notes on Puritan peoples of the sixth and seventh centuries. She hopes that by now you have simply deleted this entry, because it really isn't worth your time. Hopefully, within a few weeks she will send in a proper Wikipedia worthy entry on herself, or her seldom seen alter-ego, The Bright Goddess. Either way, that article would be much more interesting, talking about her evil mother whom she hates and her insightfull father whom she has dissapointed in all aspects of life. I really hope they pay you well.</p>

<p>Justicia pectoralis (Acanthus family) is a herb known as tilo in Cuba and other Spanish speaking countries (e.g. Costa Rica, Dominican Rep., Venezuela) and chapantye in Haiti. In Cuba and other countiries from Brazil to the US it is used in folk medicine as a relaxant and general tonic. In recent years, with the US government's illegal blockade of the island intensified, it has been used extensively by Cuban health services: there is evidence of its antiinflamatory and relaxant effects. The name tilo could be by association with tilia, the linden tree whose flowers have similar relaxant properties but which is unrelated.</p>

<p>KIQQ-FM existed as an FM Top-40 format station in the Los Angeles market from 1973 to 1989 on FM frequency 100.3. KIQQ reached its broadest appeal during the early 1980's in Los Angeles during the 1980's "Pop Explosion," though it focused primarily on main stream artists (Michael Jacskson, Lionel Ritchie, Paul McCartney, Madonna, Culture Club and Duran Duran, to name a few), and rarely played alternative artists. Notable on-air talent included Bruce Chandler. As a whole, it suffered from lackluster ratings, changed to an adult contemporary format in 1986, and eventually sold to Scott Shannon, who renamed it Pirate 100.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKBT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKBT" rel="nofollow">KKBT Wikipedia entry</a></p>
<p>KIQQ was probably most notable during that time for its "General Hospital" updates each day at 1:50, ten minutes before the daily airing of the show. This practice began with the release of the novelty song by the same name in 1982, when the soap opera was at the height of its popularity.</p>

<p>The PistolMouse game mouse is an ergonomic computer mouse designed by MonsterGecko specifically for first person shooter (FPS) video games. The patented design provides innovative control placement and an offset optical sensor in the base. The offset sensor was key to providing an ergonomic design, but still provide for quick wrist actions for movement during gaming. Unlike traditional computer mice, the PistolMouse also places buttons and the scroll wheel under individual fingers to minimize user reaction times.</p>
