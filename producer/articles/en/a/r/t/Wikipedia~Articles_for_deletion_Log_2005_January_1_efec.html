<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Firstly, bad articles want fixing, NOT deleting. Yes, the existing article is awful but that's not a reason to delete it - the article has the potential to be encyclopedic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. David Johnson's argument that the list is linked to from the template is a good one, but it it not good enough. The subsection of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_metal.html" title="Black metal">Black metal</a>, as noted by Stormie, makes this article unnecessary. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue">‚ÜíI√±g≈çlemo‚Üê</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><font color="blue">(talk)</font></a> 03:38, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 4 clear delete votes, 4 clear votes to [m:transwiki|]] and 2 conditional votes. A quick review of the Google hits for the first four lines of the song all attribute the song to "Traditional". This leads me to reasonably believe that it is in the public domain and eligible for transwiki. I concur with the decision to transwiki and will put it in the queue. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:16, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe this can be a speedy. The article was made to make a point.

<ul>
<li>I don't understand why this was nominated for VfD. Simply make it a redirect to "The Scorpions" or do a cut-and-paste switch so that the main article is "Scorpions (band)" and "The Scorpions" is the redirect. I'd do it myself right now however that might place the legitimate article on the band in danger of being deleted. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 07:48, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A cut-and-paste move is not acceptable. If there is a concensus that the article needs to be moved (and I don't know that there is) then this article needs to be deleted and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scorpions_fa79.html" title="The Scorpions">The Scorpions</a> moved to this location. <a href="../../../d/c/e/User%7EDCEdwards1966_6213.html" title="User:DCEdwards1966">DCEdwards1966</a> 08:23, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why? I'm really at a loss to understand this, considering the page that is the subject for VfD has no content. If there is a Wikipedia policy about this, please send me the link via my talk page. Otherwise Andrewa below probably has the best comment on this subject. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:33, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason a cut and paste move is unacceptable is that it would lose all of the edit history for the article being moved. The correct way to move an article is to use the "move" button. <a href="../../../d/c/e/User%7EDCEdwards1966_6213.html" title="User:DCEdwards1966">DCEdwards1966</a> 22:14, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The name, which ought to be Henry the Short Lived, or perhaps more appropriately Henry, Prince of Wales (1511) or something. The title <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a> has to be created, and is not automatic and the Prince of Wales page does not record it being created in this case (but neither does it for Henry's other son <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>), so this needs expert attention really. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">‚ò∫</a> 12:29, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's a very strange one. Henry staged a huge bash for this kid's arrival, and there was major hype surrounding the birth. That should be a fun one to track down, whether or not the formalities of creating him were completed.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a> makes pretty clear which ones were and weren't; perhaps Prince Henry of England might be a more appropriate title.

<li>This is why the bureaucratic details (or lack thereof) would need to be confirmed. If the creation was never formally undertaken, his coolest title would be Duke of Cornwall.

The result of the debate was unclear. The general concensus was to [m:transwiki|]] this to Wiktionary. However, the last vote posted to redirect is the most compelling to me since this term already was defined in the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guadalajara%2C_Jalisco_68c9.html" title="Guadalajara, Jalisco">Guadalajara, Jalisco</a> article - proving the logical connection. I am choosing to exercise discretion on this one and redirect rather than transwiki. (I doubt there would be any objections if someone created the definition in Wiktionary independently.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:26, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

(The purpose of VfD is voting, so votes and their sigs must be left clear; an entry with a sig states that the words are those of the signer, so changing them and leaving the sig is forgery.) As to the etiquette aspects, VfD work is onerous, and IMO those who do it regularly (more regularly than i!) deserve some slack when they try to relieve the drone with some purple prose, as long as personal attacks are avoided. "Horrid" and "Worthless ... rubbish" are value judgements, and VfD can't be done without value judgements; my harshest criticism would be that quality is primarily a question for cleanup, and low quality per se is not a ground for VfD. Quality should not be complained about, IMO, without at least lip service to the issue of whether the low quality (in terms of WP's standards of what an article should be and do) is irremediable bcz it is inherant in the concept of the article. But a vote is a vote in any case; it stands despite any bad etiquette, and the remeid is in the hands of the result-caller for this VfD, who is encouraged to take quality of arguments into account, and may slight a vote for low quality of the reasoning, just as they may discard a registered user's vote for apparent sock-puppethood, and should normally discard IP votes (tho listening to IP arguments).</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand. Merely including a URL isn't advertising ‚Äî having an article that consists of almost nothing but a URL is, or more generally, an article with information coming only from one source, which happens to be the subject. I agree that some votes could be worded more tactfully. Finally: arguments of the form "we have this and therefore we should have this" are not valid; we can't be everywhere at once. Maybe some of those articles should indeed be deleted ‚Äî or expanded. Unless some of them went through VfD already and created precedent, that has no bearing on this particular vote.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The good news; the article has some content now, and it looks like the original author, or a friend, has signed up as <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbrahams_c48b.html" title="User:Abrahams">User:Abrahams</a> (by the way those images need GFDL or similar copyright tags to avoid deletion). From comments on the article's talk page I was half way convinced that this artist might be notable and despite a shakey start the article could become useful. The bad news; I've been persuaded to do some digging and I can find no evidence of notability. In a Google search on 'Marco of Alexandria', the top three results are all self authored gallery pages - for a notable artist you should be able to find at least one independent reference. www.artfacts.net tends to be pretty inclusive and has plenty of Marco's but no results for Alexandria, similarly www.artcyclopedia.com. The list of international collectors was plausible, but really these could all just be friends from college. The editing behaviour of a number of anon users with very similar IPs doesn't help. I don't know, but without some independent evidence of notability, I'm going to have to go with 'delete'. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 19:15, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I checked artfacts.com and it is nothing like wikipedia and does not provide FREE INFORMATION for the sake of Information. No, it is a sponsored site, sponsored by the galleries that are listed on its pages and its main purpose is to promote the works owned by those galleries, and that is why when you check someone like Picasso, you will find that they only show a few unknown pieces of his, simply because there are the pieces available for sale in the sponsoring galleries. They also rank artists according to their value to them!! i.e. which artists have more work shown in sponsoring galleries and thus more dollars into artfacts.com's pockets. The site immediately lost its credibility when i discovered that they didnt rank Vincent Van Gogh among the TOP 100 Artists!!!! but the answer was clear there were only 3 pieces in the sponsoring galleries.

<li>Borderline <b>Delete</b>. As far as I can understand, notability is the issue here. Progress towards establishing notability on the article's talk page has not satisfied me that the artist is notable: I would like to see further proof (ie references) to show the artist's notability. I managed to find <a href="http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html" class="external free" title="http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexmarco.com/ex.html</a> but I don't see why one single exhibition renders an artist worthy of an article. The quote don't add much to the article in my opinion either. I have to say that the heated anonymous keep comments (which approach flaming) here do not help the case to keep. If the article is to be kept it needs NPOVing, expansion, distancing from the artist and further proof of notability ie with references. Having said that, the artist might be notable (at least from his own website). But this VfD discussion is about the article and in it's current state I am not satisfied that is is suitable for inclusion.

<li>Perhaps you would have more success in establishing notability via the internet if you understood Arabic.

<ul>
<li>I accept that might be true; perhaps you might like to provide links to Arabic sites for the purpose of verification/translations rather than nebulous assertions. Perhaps you might even agree to translate them for us or you could put them up for translation. I agree that web presence is not always proportional to notability however in my experience the two are directly proportional. Are there any books which mention Marco's art? If so, why don't we have ISBNs/titles/authors? That would help the keep case somewhat. Printed literature? Newspapers/art journals? Having said that, web presence is not the only thing that I am basing my delete vote on. Just because one company buys someone's art does not make them notable. Example: my friend's mum paints as a hobby and has been bought by BHP Billiton amongst others. Does that make her notable? No. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrox_0da4.html" title="User:Grox">Grox</a> 11:32, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know Arabic. I was not intending to make "nebulous assertions" but what I thought were quite significant points about the difference between developed/English speaking World articles and other articles. There are some people on here who seem to think that not being famous in America makes someone not notable. This guy is an established professional artist. IMO that makes him at least as notable as some actor in a trashy TV series that a few hundred thousand people watch. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 03:28, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your point about Wikipedia's English-speaking world bias is not a new one. I accept it as valid. A least the keep vote lobby could provide real proof that he is notable - even if it isn't online or in English. I do not accept that just being an "established professional artist" makes one notable. The people who chalk up pavements with beautiful pictures in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> are by your standard "established professional artists" but this does not make them notable or deserving of a Wikipedia entry.

<li><b>I can provide proof of Notability.</b> In The March 2004 issue of Al-Qahira Newspaper (translates to Cairo) which is the Leading (only as far as I know) cultural newspaper in Egypt, there was an article about Marco's one man show which was held in the same March! I dont think the paper is available online, but I could send xerox copies of the one I have to anyone who is interested. (its in Arabic of course) <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 04:30, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I mean can you believe that this "Encyclopedia" contains a full-length article on <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmo_Kramer_eef9.html" title="Cosmo Kramer">Cosmo Kramer</a> and that some voting is going on in Favor of Keeping Dogfart and you people here are actually considering deleting a notable artist like Marco, simple because you don't know whether or not he is notable since he comes from Faraway Land! Yet a Fictionous Character like Kramer is Notable and occupies a whole page on Wikipedia? I mean I love Cosmo, he is the only character on Seinfeld that makes me laugh; but Guess What?!!? He isn't real, Marco is!! And then the people fighting to keep Dogfart on Wikipedia, I don't see any of the names that voted to delete Marco voting to delete the porn entry of Dogfart!! I guess Porm means more to the Western WikiPedia, than an Artist from the Middle East! Oh or is it a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global.html" title="Global">Global</a> Wikipedia?

It's best to give the benefit of the doubt on notability when you don't know the subject area, and I doubt that any of the people who have voted to delete know enough about the Egyptian art scene to express a valid opinion on the issue. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> <i>[13:12 &amp; 13:13, 2005 Jan 5, as noted by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 09:43, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)]</i>

<li>I'd like to point out the fallacy of arguing that purchases by a major corporation (<i>with a market capitalisation of nearly $40 billion</i>, no less) says anything about this artist. Corporations will buy anything to put on the walls; indeed, the larger the art budget the more likely that they'll sweep up something truly insignificant. Next time you're in a corporate office take a look around. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 16:25, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I doubt that BAT sends its staff wandering through the back streets and garrets of third world countries in order to "sweep up" bad art for their boardrooms. They are likely to buy from galleries, and any artist whose work has been exhibited and sold in a gallery is notable.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 03:29, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>In real estate the rule is "there's no such thing as an unsaleable house, there are just overpriced houses." Although there <i>is</i> such a thing as unsalable art, the ability to sell your art if the price goes low enough does not make you notable. Especially since, as Rick notes, art is today a commodity where size and dominant color relative to the rest of the planned decor can easily trump artistic merit. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 10:46, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> i dont belive it would be a great ide to remove this post because i think an artist sould be able to express his information freely, and it souldnt matter if it where a painting other Pracket 01:08, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Actually I came here and started browsing Egypt sites and doing searches on names of Egyptian Towns, historical figures and contemporary artists! I did a search on Marco and was really glad I found him and then I was shocked that some people voted to delete his page!! I really don't understand why or what those people mean by Vanity!!!!!!!!! I see no vanity in that page, just neutral information about the Artist which is all accurate to the best of my knowledge. In fact after my vote I will try to refine the article a bit more, as I think that I might know another fact about Marco that isn't written in the article.

<li><b>Del</b>. May be, or turn into, a notable artist, but the standard is verifiability, and by no means "the benefit of the doubt" or a begged-for "break". If you can't prove it in a language we can easily get translated, your recourse is to work toward publicity in the languages we can use for verification. (But don't try to use WP for that publicity.) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 10:46, 2005 Jan 6 (UTC)

<li>This <i>is</i> a global encyclopedia. Everyone owes it to WP to use its resources in a reasonable way, or go start their own project with their own resources. Our monetary resources are limited, but generally adequate to cover our hardware needs and unable to cover hired personnel. Because en: is a volunteer English-language 'pedia, its human resources are generous in the line of English-speaking editors, limited in editors bilingual in English and the languages of industrialized countries, and near zero in editors bilingual in English and the languages of less-developed countries.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>WP is worthless if we don't limit our content to what is verifiable. That combined with our human-resource mix enforces some degree of undercoverage on our contents. If people who have skills we are short in don't want to provide them, that doesn't make them bad people. But people who want us to sacrifice verifiability in order to reduce undercoverage by sacrificing our verifiability criteria are doomed to frustration.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is <i>not</i> a genealogical entry as it doesn't even give details of his parents and children. Also the definition of "biographical dictionary entry" used on this site appears to be an Americanism, because in British English, "no biographical dictionary entries" means no general article about Churchill. What I think is meant is "no articles about people who are of no interest to people who don't know them". There is every chance that this a genuine historical figure and the article needs expansion, not deletion. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 03:18, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reasons for deletion:</p>
<p>This page is not written in the style of an encyclopedia. It is largely written in the first person and gives personal opinions about the outcome of a the investigation into the murder of said Francis Sant-Cassia, which makes it an opinion article.</p>
<p>Quote: <i>"Who and why he was murdered in such manner. Were there many high positioned peoples involved perhaps in Government and the Church who had been involved in a cover-up? The Courts of Malta and the Police, including Scotland Yard unable to pinpoint the real reason of his murder?</i></p>
<p><i>Those I have meet have all found the late Count to have been generous in all manner, so why and who murdered such a man of high privilege? Now Malta has joined the EU, should it be taken up to be resolved? His descendants and relatives still suffer to this day and I pity them tremendously. The Noble family of Sant-Cassia suffer not knowing who murdered their family member and why should it be left unknown. Bring to justice all of those associated to his death and those who had something to benefit from his painful death."</i></p>
<p><br />
The author also makes a personal plea for the beatification of this man, giving the article a lobbying slant in the bargain.</p>
<p>Quote: <i>"Lets promote the cause of Count Francis Sant-Cassia‚Äôs beatification. A SAINT of Malta‚Äôs 20th century should be remembered for his good deeds and honors then his horrible departure.</i> "</p>
<p>This page should be thus be deleted because, as is, it has little place in body of encyclopedic knowledge. --80.58.20.235 15:29, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Here we have the typical case in which the decision to put an article on VfD is influenced by the article's poor style. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Sant-Cassia_7ba8.html" title="Francis Sant-Cassia">Francis Sant-Cassia</a>, as it stands, is an essay and thus completely unacceptable as an encyclopedia article. However, I would argue that baron Sant-Cassia himself deserves an article. He has a certain importance... <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phils</a> 16:40, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've rewritten the article, and tried to distill the facts from the former version, although this made it basically a stub. Unfortunately, there were not many facts in the previous version. At this point, the notability of the subject seems to rest mainly on his being the heir to a major Maltese title of nobility who was the victim of an unsolved murder in 1988. The original article mentions unspecified philanthropic activities, and the author made an unsupported appeal for his beatification, which I removed. What remains probably amounts to sufficient notability for an article, although I don't look forward to edit wars with people determined to restore the former hagiography. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:18, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original writer and did this article in such a manner mainly because this Count/Baron left a mark in Maltese society. His murder yet unsolved. It was best to leave such record in that manner, as people need to be reminded of who he was and remind those of what they did. If we expanded on who might have been involved, then wikipedia can easily be summonds to court on what it knows. Thats not fair. Maybe the Count should be remembered for his good deeds to society and his untimely death. Just a thought. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Charles Said-Vassallo - www.maltagenealogy.com</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETancarville_c108.html" title="User:Tancarville">Charles Said-Vassallo</a> removed the VfD tag, and I have reinstated it. There is no policy against an anon editor submitting a n article to the VfD process. As I thought he would, he also reverted to his own version, which according to the Talk page, he considers to be "perfect". I won't change my vote here since VfD hinges on whether the subject is notable, and not on the writing style or demeanor of an article's author; however, I am quite concerned about the neutrality and encyclopedic style of all these articles on Maltese nobility. They need significant cleanup and NPOV work. --[[User:BM|BM] 21:07, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a>'s comment? He reinstated the VfD tag after it was removed, so that would make it "valid", no? More importantly, there is no policy that a nomination from an anon is "invalid", as far as I can tell: not on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, not on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Wikipedia:Deletion process</a> and not on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>. Why would anyone's nomination be "invalid" to begin with, if we have to judge the article on its own merits? If anons are disrupting VfD with obviously bad-faith nominations, that's another matter, but that's clearly not the case here. (It's true that the nomination was "invalid" in the sense that the original article was just heavily POV and nothing else, but I take it that's not what you're getting at). If anon nominations are a serious issue, then please make it explicit policy. I seriously object to all anons being "guilty by suspicion" on certain matters just because they're anons. You <i>might</i> have a case for claiming they can't <i>vote</i> here, though even that is iffy, but implying they can't even <i>nominate</i> here needs more justification. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 16:49, 2005 Jan 3 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "[...] <i>what is known about the Order (<b>the bulk of which is written here</b>) comes from <b>rumors</b> or from careless talk by the members. It is possible that the Order <b>intentionally starts rumors</b> about itself to confuse outsiders.</i>" (Emphasis mine.) The candor is appreciated. Curiously enough, this can't be an encyclopedia article <i>especially</i> if it's all true. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 01:21, 2005 Jan 2 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, unless verifiable sources are provided and verified prior to expiration of VfD discussion. Verifiability is non-negotiable. It means that Wikipedia cannot have articles on any secret societies that are serious about secrecy, but that's the price Wikipedia pays for being an encyclopedia. Is it just me or are we getting more "smells-like-a-hoax" articles lately? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:30, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>We've had some better-than-average trolls lately, IMO. They're still easy to ferret out, but no longer as obvious as some of the early attempts; we actually have to put some effort in (though I'd wager the editor-to-troll effort ratio is still close to 1, which means the trolls are still losing).<br />
However, the nice thing is that we don't have to be sure whether it's a troll or not ‚Äî we just apply our criteria as diligently as possible, and it'll all work out in the end. For example, this particular article, even if genuine (and I'm not making any judgement on that), defines <i>itself</i> as unverifiable. That more or less ends the discussion right there: pony up the sources, or else. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 02:42, 2005 Jan 2 (UTC)</dd>
