<li><b>Keep</b> I must disagree that this page is nonsense. There is infact such an organisation, see <a href="http://lom.4t.com/" class="external text" title="http://lom.4t.com/" rel="nofollow">link 1</a> and <a href="http://lom_site.tripod.com/" class="external text" title="http://lom_site.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">link 2</a>.

Whether or not this group is noteworthy enough for an encyclopedia article might be another topic of discussion, however I think it is unfair to call this nonsense. I have also taken the time to update the article some. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(talk)</a> 08:37, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please check the last page of your Google search and you'll see that, of those 3500 hits, only 60 are unique. The rest are multiple hits on the same page. Also, 4t.com is a free server, much like geocities, some real organization of this type would certainly have its own servers and domain. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:40, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for point out the flaws of my google search. You are right in stating that there aren't that many unique hits. There are plenty of organisations too cheap or unaware of the process of buying their own servers. And maybe that is an indicator of just how notable this group is. However, your nomination calls this nonsense. If that was the case, why not tag it with {{<a href="../../../n/o/n/Template%7ENonsense_9794.html" title="Template:Nonsense">nonsense</a>}}, and have it speedy deleted? I don't think this is a speedy canidate however I'm trying to make a point here. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(talk)</a> 19:04, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your point is wrong. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonsense" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nonsense">Nonsense</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a> are two different things. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Regardless of the differences between nonsense and patent nonsense, this article is neither. It is not an untrue statement, and (at least in my view) is not a completely absurd idea. I realize the nearly everyone else here sees it differently, but if this article is not nonsense, then the nomination under which it falls should be void. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(talk)</a> 01:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I checked it out and...oh dear this is funny! Yes it's hosted on a free server. "Join" is a main menu option. Here's an excerpt from their list of qualifications: "The League of Micronations does not accept applicants who do not have an Internet homepage, exist for purely commercial reasons, contain pornographic material, promote hacking or other illegal activities, or are racist or hate sites (League of Micronations Charter, Article 3d)." Even so it only has 35 member "states". <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 16:06, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wonder if you realise what a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> is, with some of the comments here. I used to live down the road from someone who created his own micronation. His house, the people that lived in it, a few of his friends and neighbours were all members of a country. There were 11 residents, and he printed his own currency and did the whole thing associated with being your own country. I never found out why he did it though. I think he disagreed with Australian laws or something like that. People who do this kind of thing have various reasons for it, but yeah, its legitimate. 203.122.218.47 17:11, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I do realize what a micronation is. Some users might not. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Family_Guy_3750.html" title="The Family Guy">The Family Guy</a></i> ran a hilarious episode about the premise. An association that cannot garner three dozen members or afford its own web hosting is not even notable enough to merge. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:24, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Northern_Forest_Archipelago_26e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Northern Forest Archipelago">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Northern Forest Archipelago</a> I wrote that notability generally involves some impact by a micronation upon the real world. Declaring a field to be an independent nation and telling only Wikipedia about it such as the Nation of Pogo (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nation_of_Pogo_6b35.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nation of Pogo">AfD discussion</a>), or setting up a club on a web site such as the Republic of Atlasia (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Republic_of_Atlasia_665a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Republic of Atlasia">AfD discussion</a>), do not impact the real world at all. Whereas <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladonia_%28micronation%29.html" title="Ladonia (micronation)">Ladonia</a>, in contrast, have elicited mainstream news coverage, and have involved real disputes, real territories, and real court cases. The same applies to purported organizations of micronations. Researching the League of Micronations, I can find no news coverage, no independently written articles about the League of Micronations, and indeed nothing (outside of what the League of Micronations claims about itself) except one-sentence mentions with hyperlinks. The article cites no sources at all, either. There is no evidence that the League of Micronations has impacted upon the real world in any way. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think you've made the best case thus far to have this article deleted. Basically because I think you are correct in so far that this league seems not to have had any impact upon the world. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">malo</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalo_a798.html" title="User talk:Malo">(talk)</a> 01:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Zoe and Uncle G. There are many, many, micronations. A tiny number of them are notable. The vast majority are, basically hobbyist social clubs. An association of non-notable clubs is, well, most likely a non-notable club itself. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 06:25, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
