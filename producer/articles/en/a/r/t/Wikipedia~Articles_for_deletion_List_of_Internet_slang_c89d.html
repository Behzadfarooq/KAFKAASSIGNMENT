In my opinion, this article needs a serious, chainsaw-massacre cull, some kind of sourcing, and a possible merge back into the "Internet slang" article, or some continual, heavy policing to prevent this from blowing back out into the massive, unsourced repository for any tripped-out acronym or "Look what I just created!"

<li><b>Comment.</b> If these dictionary definitions don't deserve a mention in individual articles in the first place, why should they suddenly deserve a mention in Wikipedia once they're clumped up together into this article? By combining the dictionary definitions into a single page, it just means that the user has to go through the trouble of scrolling to the term he/she is looking for, as opposed to having it show up in an article by itself. It also appears to have become a popular article for miscellaneous nonsense and vandalism. See in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> where it says: Wikipedia is not a dictionary, 1. Dictionary definitions. 2.

On a pure cost-benefit analysis, this article does not benefit the project. There's little or no encyclopedic value, and keeping it in any kind of reasonable shape is more effort than people have been willing to put in. Those that want to cut it down and merge it to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">Internet slang</a> have a reasonable idea, but they've forgotten to be practical.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Useful. Few of the slang terms on the list are noteworthy enough to be included singularly in an article, but grouped together and organized, they provide some insight into both the viral <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">memetic</a> qualities they have in spreading on the internet and the relation they have to one another.

I would support the creation of articles on chat room slang, instant messenger slang, Something Awful forum slang, Wikipedia jargon.. Those articles would at least be maintainable and verifiable. The internet is far too big and multilingual a place to have one set of slang.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> — I don't watch AfD. I just stumbled on this page doing a lookup (for <a href="../../../f/t/w/FTW_9483.html" title="FTW">FTW</a>). My rule is, if I go looking for something, and see it's got a VfD, then I vote strong keep, because the articles' existence has already assisted me as a <i>reader</i> of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 04:01, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
