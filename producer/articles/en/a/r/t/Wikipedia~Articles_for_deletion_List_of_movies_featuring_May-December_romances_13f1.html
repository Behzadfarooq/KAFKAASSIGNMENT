<li><b>Delete</b>. Set aside the issue of the slang in the title, the intro even says such romances are "ubiquitous" in pre-1950s movies... which makes the list nigh unmaintainable. Beyond that, there's the issue of "What positive contribution does this make to Wikipedia?" I believe the answer to that question is "none." <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 05:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> This type of list entry is of considerable value to screenwriters, aspiring screenwriters, critical theory students, film buffs, etc. The entry, however, could use some work, both in content and formatting. As far as "positive contributions to Wikipedia" -- Wiki is a <i>reference</i> tool. Wiki has at least 162 movie list entries, based on the category link in the article. How is this list entry less relevant than the other 161 film-list entries? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 05:32, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't believe any of the 162 film-list entries make a positive contribution. 162 <i>articles</i> that actually said something about 162 categorizations of movies would be a positive contribution. 162 lists, though, are just 162 wastes of server space. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree. Lists like this are valuable to film professionals. Comparative archetypes are very valuable, but it can take a long time to create such lists. There are actually books of "movie lists" used by film writers; however, those books are quickly outdated. A list of romantic comedies, for example, is arguably of greater value than a list of Oscar-winners. The latter is simply a laundry list. Wiki has episode lists for many popular television shows. Are they worthless or valuable? Wiki has lists of first basemen. Shortstops. Name the position in sports and there's a Wiki list for them. Is that worthless or valuable. Just because something may not be of interest or value to <i>you</i> doesn't mean it's not of value to someone else. I could care less about seeing a list of forty famous shortstops; however, that doesn't render the list of no value. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 06:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: For my part, I can't believe the eagerness of my learned friend Kappa (two votes above) to look on the bright side of any article. Look, if we're going to have an article like this with a metaphorical title, the need for an immediate explanation of that title should ring alarm bells -- a metaphor should <i>help</i> explanation, no? But OK, let's not argue against the notion of a year-cycle metaphor (or complain of "hemispherism"), but instead examine how it's applied. <i>December</i>: this isn't the coldest month in the northern hemisphere, but it's the one with the winter solstice, and all the leaves have been shed by many trees. When I think of a May-December romance, I think of the pneumatic Anna Nicole Smith and her wizened nonagenarian (Image:Anna_Nicole_and_hubby.JPG). In movie terms, I'll stretch that a bit and count <i>Harold and Maude</i>. But <i>Roman Holiday</i>? I suggest that one important issue might be whether the age difference is one that raises eyebrows (or worse) within the fantasy world of the movie itself: by contrast, when we coolly consider Cary Grant's late films, his successes with the chicks may seem somewhat surprising, but within the films, they don't. Lists of the usual are impossibly big; this must list the unusual. So what's the unusual factor here: age differences that raise other characters' hackles within the movies, or age differences that improbably don't even raise eyebrows within the movies, or something else again? At this point, I'm inclined to vote "delete", but I'd be happy to see and vote to keep a carefully rethought list. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 10:25, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: First, it violates the naming convention, as we must use the most common name. Second, it is a list that cannot be maintained. Third, it is <i>inherently POV,</i> which kills lists dead. Why inherently POV? Well, if I date a woman 10 years my junior, and I'm 40, is that May-December? What if it's 20 years, and I'm 50? What if it's 20, and I'm 30? At what point is this a May-December relationship? The metaphor refers to death's-edge and youth's-bloom (i.e. <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_and_Maude_ec2b.html" title="Harold and Maude">Harold and Maude</a></i>), and yet the list gleefully flops all over.

<li><b>Comment</b> re name. Googling to see if I could find the origin of the phrase "May-December," I found <a href="http://www.maydecember.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.maydecember.net/" rel="nofollow">www.maydecember.net</a>, a "dating service for individuals seeking age-gap relationships." The home page shows... what would you say? A man in his seventies and a woman in her fifties? The slogan is (gack) "Years apart, coming together." Well, the Internet is always educational. So should this be moved to List of movies featuring age-gap relationships?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: arguably "May-December romances" is more in the common vernacular than "age-gap relationships." The latter sounds like a rather contortionistic euphemism. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 15:25, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, wikipedia is not toilet paper. And I thought from the title that a "May-December romance" meant a romance that lasted 8 months. So this also has a stupid title, and therefore if it does (sadly) get kept (more listcruft), the title <i>has</i> to be changed. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:14, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
