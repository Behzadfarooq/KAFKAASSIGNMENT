<p>The result was <b>delete</b> Controlled-Demolition Theory (9/11 Conspiracy Theory), which is what is up for deletion. <b>Keep</b> (or at least no consensus, which is effectively the same thing) <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a>. The principle of splitting long articles up with short introductory paragraphs in the main article, linking to a fuller article on a sub-topic is well established (if people believe less detailed content needs to be included that needs to be decided editorially using article talk pages, not the blunt all or nothing afd result). However, here we have the trouble of two articles serving the same purpose. As this is the one up for deletion, I'm deleting this one.</p>
<p>As always articles need continual improvement, and it is clear that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_8913.html" title="Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center</a> needs to be made more neutral etc, but this is going way outside the area of AFD- time for you to get back to the article talk page to sort these things out. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 09:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>To the closing admin:</b> I cant really see how peephole can justify deleting something just because no consensus is found!? a) Its highly unlikely consensus will be found considering the widely differing views. b) Peephole, is very obviously biased, looking at his other posts, arguing the case very strongly against such conspiracy theories, hence has a vested interest that this article be deleted. c) A huge amount of detail/information is contained in this page because this is a key part/question over the offical version of events. I agree however it may well need to be edited however it is an invaluable resource and unfathomable why it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisp7_1f4f.html" title="User:Chrisp7">Chrisp7</a> 12:53, 20 September 2006 (GMT)</li>

<p><b>I disagree</b>; the 9/11 conspiracy theories page is over 120 kB in size and needs to be split up. This article is already 22kb, and probably should take other parts of the other article as well and will probably end up being about 30 kB in size. We have seperate pages for <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>; just because people are kooks doesn't mean that they aren't notable, and given how many people believe in the 9/11 conspiracy theories (especially regading WTC 7) I think it is relevant to Wikipedia. In any event, having a 120+ kB article is rather unreasonable; its just too long and deserves to be split up into a number of subarticles rather than just being a 40 page long mess. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 20:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, I added in the rest of the relevant sections having to do with this topic from the main article; once this vote is over and we decide to keep this subarticle, we should remove those sections from the main article and summarize them, with a link to this article.

<li>No. we are voting on a matter in a compartment. That is the continued existence of this separate article. It does not matter that the article has merit or has no merit, since it is <i>also</i> contained within the "parent article". Voting for a split is done on article talk pages. Where a split has already happened by virture of a '<i>bold edit</i> (and no harm in that) the original material must be removed and a short prćcis put in its place. Since this was not completed the article we are voting on is, by definition, a POV fork. So, let's get rid of it. Then, if it is the correct thing to do, let's have an editor who understands the issues split it properly and completely. I'm disappointed, because I view the concept of a split as correct. It is <i>this unfinished split</i> that must be ended. there was nothing to prevent the splitting editor from finishing the job, nomination or no nomination. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 19:39, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>C'mon, don't be a bureaucracy type&#160;:) The discussion on the Talk:9/11 Conspiracy theories had begun before TitaniumDragon created this page. 4 or 5 ppl were discussing this matter. There was no clear consensus - everyone stood with one's arguments. Then, sort of indenpendently, this page was created and the case went "public". I see it as a continuation of that discussion, I understand you may not. I know it does not follow "protocols" but since we're already here - don't let the bureaucracy machine got you between it's gears&#160;;) --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 22:15, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know it looks like bureaucracy. But this AfD has become so complex and so oddly political that it would genuinely behove us to delete the thing, and to do the split as a separate exercise. There is a huge danger of confusion otherwise, and the closing admin doesn't stand a chance of getting it right. There are times when a procedure is needed, and when things have become overcomplicated, such as here, I believe process is approriate. Note that <u>I am in favour of a proper split</u>. I just do not think that this is the discussion to do it in.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not a discussion forum. It has a role in documenting as an encyclopaedia the phenomena of the world. Thus articles which are notable, not original research and which have or strive to have a neutral POV should be created and survive deletion attempts. However, this AfD is not about any of that, since it is, or should be, discussing the clerical activity of splitting a lengthy article. Were this article about rabbits I doubt we would be having this AfD issue at all. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:45, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article will allow us to make the 9/11 CT article much more surveyable, i.e., easier to read and use, while affording editors a separate space to hash out the many tricky details of the WTC argument. It seems to me to be exactly what splitting articles is all about. Opponents might think of this as a temporary solution, a place where the WTC section of the CT article can be improved until it can be merged back into the CT article without causing undue clutter. It's way too early to suggest deleting this potentially very useful work-in-progress.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 08:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not see the logic in this argument from the encyclopaedia's perspective. I am not singling you out, here, but am really answering all such comments. As an encyclopaedia it is part of Wikipedia to document in an encyclopaedic manner the phenomena of the world. The various conspiracy theories, whether pseudo-science or founded on reality, are individually and collectively a phenomenon worthy of inclusion, the more so since they are properly cited. The article that has been split off and the parent article which spawned it have a place here. The rationale for the split is simply a matter of filing, not a matter of forking any point of view. We need to be very clear that this anniversary period of the atrocity is a period when clarity of thought about an article set to which many people have a huge emotional attachment is essential. Let us please look at editing standards, not at other issues. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 10:16, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tom, this is not a POV fork. This is not the article about "how did it happen" but "what common people (and some researchers) say about it" on the Internet. This could change your view on sources. As Thomas said(<a href="../../../9/2F/1/Talk%7E9_11_conspiracy_theories_b1d3.html" title="Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories">Talk:9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, the criticism would apply even stronger on the splitted page. I see it a bit like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a>. You must admit that CD became a very notable myth. It is a fact from the field of sociology that many people do not want to belive the official explanation of the collapse(with a variety of reasons for it - <i>looks</i>, CTism, <i>pseudoscience</i>, NIST report, WTC7, science(?Jones), etc..). The topic is definately worth it's own article. Titanium Dragon, Fiddle Faddle, Thomas Basboll made similiar remarks. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 17:10, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> This AfD is a strange phenomenon. As a general principle we split articles which are too long into articles which reference other articles.. Patently the parent article is too long. According to the author all that has been done is to split out and slightly reword for clarity the section suggesting CD, but that the new article is a verbatim (plus minor edits) version of the original text. Under those circumstances how can it be a fork? How can it be allowing conspiracy theories to grow, and how can it suddenly be non NPOV? Surely there can only can only be a fork if the original text has been left behind? I admit to not checking in detail if the text remains in the original article. If it does then the simple solution is to finish the split and discard this AfD? Perhaps the author would comment on this. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 13:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Maybe you don't tolerate it, Morton, but wikipedia is not about the tyranny of the majority. If the believers of the official story have a point to make then that is provided space on wikipedia. Alternate viewpoints are also provided space. This issue is not large, it is huge. Over 100 million Americans believe something fishy is going on with 9/11. And that's just Americans. Just because en.wikipedia.org is in English doesn't mean it is the "Voice of America." If wikipedia can have individual articles about and obscure <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haikouichthys.html" title="Haikouichthys">primitive fish-like animal from the Middle Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China</a> then it definitely has the space, in fact the imperative, for articles about the thesis that the collapse of the twin towers and building 7 on 911 due to fire, an unprecedented historical event, is untrue, and that the event is more consistent with controlled demolition. If you don't like the article, list points that refute it, but you may not delete it. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaimiddleton_a602.html" title="User:Kaimiddleton">Kaimiddleton</a> 20:50, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> WP: OR and WP: RS are very important, which is why this page is so well sourced. All research is original; OR bans users from doing original research then putting it into articles. However, this is not OR from readers, but external OR which is readily verifiable. As WP: RS points out, our job is to report facts and opinions; a lot of this article is about opinions of people, and as such the title of the page reflects this. Additionally it is pointed out who thinks these things and why, the sources of these opinions, and the sources they got their information from (such as video footage of the event). This article has very few things which are not sourced, and though it could certainly use some work making it read better and sound more professional, on the whole it is one of the better sourced articles on Wikipedia; it isn't like <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therianthropy.html" title="Therianthropy">Therianthropy</a>, other articles I try and deal with but which have severe problems with source material being unreliable as it makes sweeping claims but often does so without any actual basis for those claims, and as they are trying to describe a phenomenon rather than what otherkin.net says, it is a problem. This article doesn't have this problem as it is about what conspiracy theorists say and various theories they hold and why they hold them; the fact that they are conspiracy theorists doesn't matter as we want to know what they think and why, not what actually happened. This article describes one of their theories, and is, I think, pretty clear on the matter. It needs some work, and I'd be glad to have help cleaning it up. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 23:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Completely impertinent comment</b> - I'm wondering, if the Illuminati were trying to provoke the US into war, why didn't they just do a nasty UNCONTROLLED demolition? It would have done a hell of a lot more damage to nearby buildings, plus it wouldn't have set off the radars of the <s>conspiracy nutbags</s> defenders of truth and justice. Furthermore, I think it was a poor decision to let the towers sit there smoking for so long before they collapsed, they could really have killed a lot more people if the collapse took place ~30 minutes earlier. Maybe someone here knows the answer to this. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 01:35, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Completely impertinent response</b>: Actually, the way the Towers were designed, pretty much any failure of its internal support structure, no matter how or where it was caused, would have let to a straight-down collapse. You might be able to have designed a way to "get lucky" and have the collapse tend to be directed a few hundred feet in one direction or the other, but that's about it. A lot of people think that if, say, you'd knock out all the ground supports on only one side of a building, that it would tend to tip over horizontally like someone knocking over a soda bottle. But that's just not the way physics works. (Okay, okay, if Godzilla came along - a really f---ing <b>gigantic</b> Godzilla - and yanked the towers right out of the ground with his mighty paws, I'm sure a lot more damage would have been caused in the immediate area. But that's the only way.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 03:05, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, one of the things I've heard about skyscrapers is that firefighters really fear this type of design that tends to "pancake" vertically (usually without much warning) in a chain reaction fashion. Anyway I still feel that the controlled-demolition theory forces us to conclude that the illuminati are both lazy and stupid. I predict that a new class of more clever evil overlords will soon unseat them. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 03:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Indeed, I thought at first it would likely tip over as well, but once I thought about it at length I realized that the physics I'd learned in HS pretty much showed that it would just pancake. The only way a building like that wouldn't is if it actually got hit hard by something which pushed the building a long ways horizontally without destroying enough of its veritcal integrity that it would just collapse straight down or near straight down. Of course, some of the local stuff might be ejected, but given the building stood up to the inital blow (a plane really doesn't weigh -that- much compared to something as big as the WTC towers) it should have pancaked. Of course, a lot of the basis of the argument is that the tower shouldn't have collapsed at all, given no other scyscraper had. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitanium_Dragon_94c6.html" title="User:Titanium Dragon">Titanium Dragon</a> 07:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
