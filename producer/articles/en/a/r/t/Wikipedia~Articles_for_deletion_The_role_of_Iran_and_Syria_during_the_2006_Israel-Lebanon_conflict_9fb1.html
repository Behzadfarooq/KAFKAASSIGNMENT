<p>The article, both the title and the body, is far too POV, original research, and reads like an op-ed piece. It's clear that this was written to prove a specific POV. All the major statements are unsourced (To wit, the entire opening section: "<i>Iran and Syria are the two main powers who support during that conflict the Hizbollah. An intellgence officer said, the true leaders of the operation are in Tehran and Damascus. Iran and Syria had supported the Hizbollah in the past. ... Although Iran has welcomed the fall of two of its historical enemies ... the presence of U.S. troops in two of Iran's immediate neighbors is seen as a threat.</i>"). Some minor points are sourced, but not from particularly well-known news agencies. I have no history editing the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, but this is obviously a POV fork from that article. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 14:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi am against the deletion. It should be important to point out what's the role of Syria and Iran in the conflict. The reason is many even president bush and the israelian gouverment say Iran and Syria tried to make use the crisis for their own goals. So it should be clear, which reasons could the two countries have to make such a strategy and what is their role in the conflict. U can't put all of that in the main article cause if will be too much of it. I had <font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font>just started the article. And in the german wikipedia is also such an artcile. I think such an article is important so u can point out what US and Israel say why these countries are part of the problem and it is also important because when Israel is going to attack Syria and later we will ask why they had done it, so we have sucn an article and find out why this was happen and so on. There was a fast deletion and it was failed. Now that entry. I think it would be better to work on the article.&#160;:( It's also sad that the person doesn't wrote a reason why the article should be deleted. So please <b>keep</b> it! i know there can be much better. But this is a wikipedia, so I had hope the others will help me.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan01_f443.html" title="User:Japan01">Japan01</a> 14:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please note, "<i>the person doesn't wrote a reason why the article should be deleted</i>" was because you jumped the gun a little: I hadn't finished nominating this page for deletion. "<i>There was a fast deletion and it was failed</i>": Someone nominated this for {db-attack}, but it wasn't. The person who removed the deletion noted it was AFD-able. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 14:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Original research. Bad English.

<li>The reason why the German wikipedia has an article about this is because <a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan01_f443.html" title="User:Japan01">User:Japan01</a> made it there too. I note it is also up for deletion on the German wikipedia too. If we were to write an article, it would need rewriting effectively from scratch, as the present article doesn't actually make any sense and violates innumerable policies and guidelines. I'm not expressing an opinion on whether we should have an article about it, but the present article is not it and should be nuked. In any case this is also a terrible name for the article. Many of the reasons given by <a href="../../../j/a/p/User%7EJapan01_f443.html" title="User:Japan01">User:Japan01</a> are bogus with respect to Wikipedia: "it should be important to point out things" - this is <i>not</i> our mission, we are reporting on what secondary sources say. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 14:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Anyone who thinks that title is POV may not understand much of the conflict and geo-political issues going on. The title is about as POV as it gets, neither country has ever denied funding Hezbollah, so they obviously have a role in the conflict. To delete this article because of a lack of other countries having articles is kind of silly, we do not remove content because we do not have equal content on all portions. However the article needs moer information and possibly a rewrite, I think a PROD / Cleanup was more in order then a AfD. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:18, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I disagree. The article, begining with the title, is POV, OR, and a bazillion other stuff that ill let wikicounsels get on with, but its main wrong is that it excludes the role of other non-combatant countries in the conflict. For example, it excludes the role the USA in the conflict which, to paraphrase you, anyone who "understand much of the conflict and geo-political issues going on" is aware of.</dd>

<dd>An alternative that the existence of this page raises is that there might be a need for a page on the role of non-combatant nation states in the conflict, not just Iran and Syria in particular. Althought I don't know if this is really neccesary considering there is an "International reactions" page, which could be re-tasked. Dunno, ill raise it talk in the main article.--<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerejota_902d.html" title="User:Cerejota">Cerejota</a> 19:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This article wasn't nominated because of "a lack of other countries having articles is kind", it was nominated because all of the most important statements in the article are entirely unsourced original research written from a single point of view.

<li>I didnt say you nominated it for those reasons. As for my WP:PROD error, I thought it would still be clear but, what I am saying is a call for sources should have been made before a call for delete. I think a cleanup and asking for sources would be in order unless you find it to be a POV fork, which there is no POV, these countries do support Hezbollah, or factually false information. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> it deffinetly needs to be rewritten but this is an important article which is not strictly POV since numerous news agencies report on it and it is a key factor that is driving political moves on the conflict.

<li>Because we don't need an entire article to point that out. That could be mentioned in the main article, properly sourced. Creating an entire article with this title gives the appearance of WP having a POV. And sure enough, when I go to read the article, it's full of POV all over as explained above.

<li>No I dont think that helped, however I appreciate the attempt. The question is, what is this POV everyone keeps talking about? The countries who support Hezbollah do it openly and proudly, the countries who do not like this, despise it openly. What is this POV that is being enforced if the article stays with a rewrite? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you see POV and I don't there's a chance there is some there, and vice versa. If you and a LOT of other people see POV and I don't there's a really GOOD chance there is POV there. A LOT of people see POV in how this current article is written. So it's almost certainly (not 100% certain, I guess, but almost certainly) there even if you don't see it.

<li>No it doesnt as you didnt actually say anything. I am sure if there is a POV in the article title, someone can surely say what it is instead of just stating there is POV. Its ok however since Vjam was nice enough to point out a misunderstanding I had.

<li><b>Delete</b>, unless someone is able to do the subject justice PDQ. It's too much of an eyesore to wait around for that to happen. On the POV question raised by Zer0faults, I think it very likely that Damascus and Iran support and even, to some extent, direct Hezbollah. However that is my POV. I'm pretty sure there is no evidence for this. Iran and Syria certinly deny it (where do you get your information to the contrary?). There are some claims coming out of Washington that its a well known fact, certainly, but that's not evidence. Remember where you were when you found out there were no WMD in Iraq? --<a href="../../../v/j/a/User%7EVjam_1a2c.html" title="User:Vjam">Vjam</a> 20:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>What is this mystical POV when Syria and Iran both admit to funding Hezbollah? and proudly I might add, supporting them. Everyone keep stating its POV, but what is this POV? They deny running Hezbollah, I never seen them deny funding them, do you haev a source of this denial? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I take this was in trply to me so I moved it up. Again I am not stating they are fighting there, they support the group diplomatically and financially. The article states <b>"no Iranian Revolutionary Guards fighting alongside Hezbollah in Lebanon."</b> If that is the impression I gave, that I am stating Iran is at war or giving troops that was not what was meant. Again Iran and Syria openly support this group, so what is the POV? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:54, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Syria article denies sending weapons, not funding or supporting. Furthermore it goes on to state <b>"Syria says it does have influence it could exert on Hezbollah. But it's also telling Washington: Play ball with us and we'll help you; don’t, and we won't. "</b> But anything taken from that would be OR. Again both countries openly support Hezbollah, so where is the POV? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>There's support as in "side with" and support as in "help". We're concerned with the latter here. The article on Iran says: <i>"Iran claims it gives only moral support to Hezbollah. On Saturday Abbas Ali Kadkhodai, spokesman for Iran's powerful Guardian Council, reiterated Iran's assertion that it has no influence over the group"</i>. The Syria article, you are right, only has them denying shipping weapons, but, since a negative apparently needs proving, here's another which is more explicit: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060719/19syria.htm?s_cid=rss:site1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060719/19syria.htm?s_cid=rss:site1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <i>"We do not provide Hezbollah with arms," Moustapha insisted in a conversation at Syria's embassy in Washington. He also denied charges that Syria had provided Hezbollah with financial support or that Syria enjoyed decisive influence with Hezbolla.</i> Now, I don't really believe any of that, but it doesn't seem there is any evidence to say otherwise (although there are statements made in Washington etc which get repeated in the media, and people end up believing that some evidence must exist. But it doesn't seem to).--<a href="../../../v/j/a/User%7EVjam_1a2c.html" title="User:Vjam">Vjam</a> 21:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
