<li>It is not a registered organisation in any country.</li>
<li>It does not publish accounts.</li>
<li>It shows no evidence that it even exists outside cyberspace.</li>
<li>It was written by the organisation itself.</li>
<li>It does not provide any evidence that it is 'notable' or 'remarkable' in any way.</li>
<li>Wikipedia should not be used to 'recruit' members to an organisation.</li>
<li>There organisation website does not provide an address or contact details other than email and the address of a canadian condo.</li>
<li>When I tried to contact them regarding this issue on their website's forum, Several (although admitadly not all) provided responses which were very worrying, and used explicit insulting and vulgar language.</li>
<li>The article provides no outside or neutral viewpoints.</li>
<li>There are no outside or neutral references.</li>
<li>This organisation has either roughly 200 or roughly 50 members(sources vary). This in my opinion is too few for a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepublicUK_7ada.html" title="User:RepublicUK">RepublicUK</a> 09:38, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In answer to the points you made:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a private address, It is not registered to any organisation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Without publishing its accounts it is not an official organisation, I do not have to prove that it is not publishing accounts, YOU have to prove that it IS publishing accounts.</dd>
<dd>It is not registered with the electoral authorities in any of the nations that it professes to be active in, all political organisations and not just political parties have to be registered.</dd>
<dd>Google is a search engine and so can't be used for referencing.</dd>
<dd>The only reference for it on the BBC website is in the 'action network' section and was written by the organisation itself and has not been updated for almost 3 years. The 'action network' section can be written by anyone and needs no proof or evidence that what has been written is true. <a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepublicUK_7ada.html" title="User:RepublicUK">RepublicUK</a> 10:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How on earth do you know it is a private address, have you been there? "Suite 1003" sounds like an office to me. You have proposed it for deletion, you prove it doens't publish accounts. And yes, I too believe the proposal for deletion was in bad faith.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouter-revolutionary_5112.html" title="User:Couter-revolutionary">Couter-revolutionary</a> 12:11, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>You clearly don't understand how this works, I nominated it for deletion and <b>you</b> have to <b>prove</b> that it shouldn't be. I know it doesn't publish accounts by their own admission.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an organisation worthy of an article, particularly if one were to compare with the hundreds of far less notable articles on websites, etc. currently on wikipedia. I also get the impression that this nomination may have been in bad faith. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Edwardian_Sunday_a820.html" title="User:An Edwardian Sunday">An Edwardian Sunday</a> 11:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What proof have you to say that "This is an organisation worthy of an article", it is not good enough to just state that, you must provide evidence, also on of the arguements to avoid during an AfD is "particularly if one were to compare with the hundreds of far less notable articles on websites" - provide evidence to prove notablility or else these words will just sound pretty hollow.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 11:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The organization has been noted in other online 'news' sources (generally unfavorably) including rumormillnews, irishunionism, and themonarchist.

<li><b>Comment</b> It has been mentioned that the address is a residential address, I would just like to point out that that isn't true. There are many businesses resident in the same building as the provided address, and it appears on the satellite images, and internet research to be an office building of some sort. Also the claim it only has 50 members is shot down by the graph at the bottom of the main page that clearly shows exactly how many members it has, looks to be around 200 members. Not a lot I'll agree, but more than 50. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Important Comment</b>. I find it interesting to note that the OP's very first edit on Wikipedia was to this article, to add something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. A couple of days later he added more information on it being controversial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. This was then deleted by an anon user, but RepublicUK then altered the article again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, seemingly knowing something going on about the organisation. The following day he nominated the article for deletion. I'm sorry but I feel there is something else going on here, the OP expands the article, adds some bits that are removed and then nominates it for deletion. Almost all the OPs edits are to this article. Call me old fashioned but there could be something else going on here with this nomination, I think someone may be trying to make a point and this nomination is in bad faith and singleminded against his declared membership of Republic (whatever that may be). His contribs also seem to show a singleminded push against the organisation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no references in the article and there is no indication that there has been any notice taken of this organisation by media or official bodies to signify its notability. Simple "keep" statements without verification are discountable. The BBC mention is not a news item but a post from the organisation itself by the look of it. If editors want this article kept, I suggest they get to work on it very quickly. At the moment there is no justification <i>in the article itself</i> for not deleting it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. After much comment on this page I'm going to call for a delete on this. I can find no notability on the net for it outside of bits the organisation itself has posted or comments on forums. Even the webpage for the organisation seems confused as to what it is calling itself the "United Commonwealth Society" in most places rather than "Federal Commonwealth Society," and "United Commonwealth Society" receives exactly 0 Google hits which is damningly low (oddly enough doesn't even pick up the main site). Even the threads on the forums seem concerned more with less serious issues (not in itself damning) and seems more like a collection of like minded people (for the most part) hanging out rather than trying to achieve anything. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Really, I think your attitude towards other users is outrageous and wrong. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 09:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is my take (and MrDarcy may have something different to say): editors often turn up on the same AfDs because they have the same interests. The problem occurs when those editors merely express biased opinions based on whether they approve of the subject or not, without attempting to objectively apply non-negotiable policies such as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, or guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. No one attempting to do this could possibly argue for the retention of this article. This does become a matter of concern and needs to be addressed. MrDarcy and I have taken the same stance on this article, because any non-biased editor would have to&#160;!vote delete, if they were following policy. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well said. The only thing that I would add is that I was pointing out that when those editors are expressing the SAME biased opinions, using the SAME flawed justifications, it looks like users are acting in concert to sway Wikipedia in one direction. And that, to me, is unacceptable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 01:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Folks don't forget that some of us that 'voted KEEP' have actually posted material that we thought supported the position (the Africa Crises one where someone was making fun of the FCS as a racist organization that would support an "white" South Africa in particular looked 'good' to me at the time I added to this discussion), I have of course after review conceeded that the blog in question doesn't pass the 'reliable' test...

<dd>It's obviously not directed at you, because you are doing what should be done, namely searching to see if references are available to justify the article, not just saying keep based only on personal preference. However, as none of the refs are in the article to substantiate it, maybe you should reconsider your position now. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 04:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> in general agreement with MrDarcy and also per my comment previously. I am disappointed that those wishing to retain the article do not seem to understand that this cannot be achieved merely by expressing an opinion, but only by providing proof through verifiable sources that substantiate notability. Otherwise the comments might just as well not have been written. I would ask the closing admin also to comment on this, if s/he feels it appropriate, for the benefit of contributing editors, as the problem is not restricted to this AfD. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment on comments</b> This bickering is quite irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether it is in accord with anyone's views or in conflict with them. All that matters is whether it meets wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, namely whether <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> can be established with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.
