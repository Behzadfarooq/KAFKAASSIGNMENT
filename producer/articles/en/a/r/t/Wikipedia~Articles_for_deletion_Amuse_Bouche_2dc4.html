In the end, however, the wine is not notable enough for inclusion. In order to be included the subject should be the subject of multiple articles in media. The article asserts three mentions, reviews in The Wine Advocate, The Wine Spectator, and The Washington Post. The issue is whether being the subject of a review should count as being the subject of an article. If it were to count, Wikipedia would have a lot of articles on wines as the first two publications review hundreds, even thousands of wines a year. So a review of a wine in one of these publications cannot count as the wine being the subject of an article for purposes of notability. The Washington Post publishes fewer reviews and has a broader circulation, but even if this review were to count as being the subject of an article, this would not satisfy the multiple articles requirement. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 23:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is offensive and outrageous. We have enough to contend with--now we have people being paid to do nothing but spam, and probably in more and more sophisticated (i.e. sneaky) ways. I think this type of activity may be legally actionable if taken to certain heights, some area or tort law could apply such as intentional interference with business. I am changing my vote given the insidious basis for the edits and suggest that User:Kimcray be <b>permanently banned</b> as acting with the ultimate in bad faith, with goals that are fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of Wikipedia and as a precedent that should be set at the earliest possible time. I do not suggest this lightly but with sober reflection--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Although I agree with you about this being offensive and outrageous, I do not think she is all that sneaky or sophisticated. She mentioned on the new user help page that this is what she was doing. Hell, the article didn't even mention the Robert Parker review in The Wine Advocate until Idp added it. How incompetent do you have to be to try to promote a wine and not mention a postive review from Parker? Ultimately, though, I do not believe that the conduct of an editor is dispositive on whether an article should be kept. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 00:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't implying that she was sneaky, quite the opposite; a person who admits the activity she did is about as far from sneaky as it gets. I was suggesting (admittedly without perfect clarity) that once we have not isolated incidents but a cottage industry of people being paid to do this, it will become ever more sophisticated. While I agree that intent behind edits should not often be used as a basis for deletion, you'll note, for instance, that WP:AUTO is applicable regardless of how NPOV seeming a self-written article is. In this case, the nature of the edits so taints the material that I would vote to delete it if it was sourced to the teeth.

<li><b>Kill</b>, what a pernicious idea. And the article is <i>still</i> a blatant ad. The only way to clean it up to Wikjipedia's quality standards would be to remove the advertising bits, and that operation would leave it about six words long. "Tastemaker"? "Complexity and finesse"? "Unbridled intensity and power"? Gaaah. After the work users are said to have put in to NPOV this, the bland promospeak and the drainingly uninteresting information is <i>still</i>as ill-conceived as the user's scheme for putting ads on Wikipedia. Don't clean it up, just delete it. And I also agree about permablocking a user who's only here for such a misuse of the project. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:09, 11 July 2006 (UTC).

<li><b>Comment</b> The quotes were all from third party wine reviewers, all of whom do serious reviews that are frequently noncomplimentary when wines deserve it. A 92 is high and these phrases are often used to describe wines that score like this. So it's not like this is a case of compiling "I loved it; it was much better than Cats" type promotional blurbs. If something sucks, we can describe it accurately without it being an attack page. If something's good, as this wine seems to be, we can describe that accurately as well without the article being an ad. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 05:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Whilst my instinct when previously editing the article (and I thank those who have commented kindly on my edits) was that Amuse Bouche had the potential to be considered notable, I'm now a little more reticent about the article. User:Zirka1 refers to a number of articles concerning wine producers, but the one which strikes me as most comparable is <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penfolds_Grange_8f07.html" title="Penfolds Grange">Penfolds Grange</a>, an Australian producer also dubbed a 'cult wine' - however, whilst the Grange line is responsible for a number of decades worth of notable vintages, the praise for Amuse Bouche (however illustrious, and obviously, Parker is the ultimate in this field) centres on a single, very recent vintage. As <a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhgettaboutit</a> said, google searches are probably lacking as barometers for notability of wine. I'd view a more accurate barometer as being a clear record of consistent mention in both the mainstream press and the wine press. Though the 2003 vintage of Amuse Bouche garnered some serious praise from some very influential sources, the lack of a more extensive track record means that, discarding the blatant advertisements of User:Kimcray, the only admissible material in the article is the brief but intense praise for one vintage. That's just not enough to merit an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/d/p/User%7EIdp_61da.html" title="User:Idp">Idp</a> 21:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
