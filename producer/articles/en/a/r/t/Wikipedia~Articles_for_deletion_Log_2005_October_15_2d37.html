<li>I did not create the article for advertising purposes, <a href="../../../k/2E/_/K._Sandra_Fuhr_cd27.html" title="K. Sandra Fuhr">K. Sandra Fuhr</a> only recently unveiled the project, which is why Alexa doesn't register the page, as it's 3 days old. My intent in creating it was the same as that for any other author, to credit their works. If you all feel that it would be better served to list this and ANY other project that Ms. Fuhr has created on the web, I don't object to it. I do re-iterate, <b>this was not created as an advertisement.</b> If it is the consensus to delete, I vote instead that this and any other pages for Ms. Fuhr's creations be made into one page with her biography, as I've seen with many other authors. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBoLingua_e27f.html" title="User:BoLingua">Bo-Lingua</a> 23:24, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I have discounted the opinion of one "voter" whose contributions so far have almost exclusively been to AFD discussions and VfU discussions. I continue to find it improbable that a new user will so quickly find AFD and consider it more likely than not that this may be evidence of sockpuppetry.</p>
<p>The author of the webcomic raised several arguments in favor of the article but failed to persuade the other participants in the discussion. While the Alexa rank was not reported in this debate, my own research shows it to be very high. See <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=www.lucastds.com/webcomic/#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=www.lucastds.com/webcomic/#top" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "delete" decision but without prejudice against recreation if/when the webcomic achieves the recommended level of notability. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 16:29, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

The article states no assertion of notability and google also gives hardly any relevent links to "8 1/2 by eleven", certainly no valid notability claims. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:05, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a comment... I agree with you that this comic is not particularly notable, unless you're looking at Alexa rankings as the only sign of notability (which is a big if, given past votes in this community). However, one thing I'd like to point out is the following (and keep it in mind that I am not asking this in a confrontational way, despite the tone of the question... I am simply curious): since when are articles supposed to establish or prove notability? Articles should document a notable subject, but they should not exist simply to prove that subject is notable. Check out <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_and_Monkey_6a81.html" title="Joe and Monkey">this particularly pathetic webcomics stub</a> for example. Now, I think this comic is notable, but the article certainly doesn't do a very good job "establishing" it. Should the stub be deleted just because of that? No. The article should be left and added to over time. Anyways, just a thought. I'd be interested in your response if you want to reply on my talk page or here (although here might clutter up the AfD a bit). --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 06:44, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a>! Just wandering around the deletion pages and noticed my comic was up for deletion. I didn't know an article had been created about my comic at all. As it's my comic, I'm not going to vote or defend it vehemenently. I will, however, make the following points for others to consider. Please note that these points will argue both <b>for</b> and <b>against</b> the notability of this comic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is notable</b>: The assertion by the nominator that Google does not give any relevant links to "8 1/2 by Eleven" is incorrect. The first hit on a Google search for "8 1/2 by Eleven" results in this comic appearing, a search for "8 1/2 by Eleven comic" shows several pages of relevant hits, and a search for "Lucas Teodoro da Silva" (in quote marks) returns three pages of links about this author. The search "8 1/2 x 11" points to the US standard paper size.</li>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is notable</b>: the Alexa rating for this site is 346,728. While this is below <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>'s required rating of 200,000, it is better than recently deleted comics like <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> (Alexa:1,117,031) and Built for Comfort (Alexa:2,235,134) by a <i>significant</i> margin.</li>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is notable</b>: The author of this comic, Lucas TdS, is one of the administrators of Comixpedia.org, a growing online resource about webcomics. This site does have the an Alexa rating of better than 200,000.</li>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is not notable'<i>: The article</i> does</b> seem to have been created in response to a sarcastic comment I made in a deletion debate arguing that it would be difficult to delete this article based on this comic's popularity. The creation of this article probably violates <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Please note, however, that I had nothing to do with the creation of this article by its said author and did not instigate its creation on purpose!!!</li>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is notable</b>: Comic has a deep archive (219 strips) and a year-and-a-half publishing steady 5 days a week (it has not missed a day).</li>
<li>arguing that this comic <b>is not notable</b>: <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Molotov_fc5c.html" title="User:V. Molotov">Molotov's</a> assertion is probably the closest to fact -- the comic is <i>popular</i> in terms of raw readership numbers and Alexa numbers (more popular than some other <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>-documented <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomics.html" title="Webcomics">webcomics</a>, but <b>is not</b> mentioned by <i>any</i> comic critique sites, probably because of its relative newness to the comic scene (only a year in print). However, this <i>would</i> suggest a lack of notability within the webcomics community, despite its relatively high readership numbers on the net itself.</li>
<li><b>General Comment</b> regarding the idea to redirect to US standard paper size. As the comic title is written out half in numerical (8 1/2) and half in regular english (eleven). I would suggest that a redirect for this article to the article on US standard papersize is a bad idea for two reasons:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If someone came here looking for the comic and was redirected to the article on paper size, they may get confused.</li>
<li>No one is going to type in "8 1/2 by Eleven" when they are looking for "8 1/2 x 11"... would you suggest we create a redirect for "Eight and a half by Eleven?" No.</li>
<li>At some point in the future, this comic may gain notability. Its readership numbers and Alexa ranking are already almost high enough to warrant a Wikipedia entry. At that point, having a redirect would be terribly inconvenient and confusing.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>General Comment</b> regarding the article itself: except for the picture, this article is a copy of an article found at <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/8_1/2_by_Eleven" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/8_1/2_by_Eleven" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which may be a more appropriate venue for such an article.</li>
<li><b>General Comment</b> regarding the assertion that the article not giving links to the website is grounds for deletion: obviously the article would need to be improved if that was the case, however that hardly qualifies as a reason for deltion.</li>

<li>Tedzsee: <i>"However, this</i> would <i>suggest a lack of notability within the webcomics community, despite its relatively high readership numbers on the net itself."</i> This, I believe, is the key thing here -- it just hasn't made enough of an impact (not yet, anyway; obviously, I have nothing but good wishes on that front). <b>Delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:59, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The above comments seem to indicate that the comic is an up and comer on the webcomic scene. The article is factually sound and I am normally reluctant to vote delete on articles where notability is arguable. I agree with Tedzsee above that it is not the job of an article to prove notability; however, it is the job of supporters in an afd debate to do so. As such, Iwould like to see the arguments of an objective party for the notability of the subject. Until then, I, personally, can reach no decision. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 20:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> OK, I know I'm not neutral. This one's going quite well though, so I thought I'd better show my face! The fact is, there's no guidlines for webcomics on wiki other than Alexa, so this should probably be kept. -- <a href="../../../h/i/j/User%7EHijamiefans_b84c.html" title="User:Hijamiefans">Hijamiefans</a></li>

<li>Easy tiger. You need to put speech marks around it, or Google searches for every instance of each of the words "bored" "evil". It's not surprising that there are millions of such instances. It's not unreasonable to suppose that your reasoning is based on the Google search you conducted since you offer no other justification. If you were thinking other things but didn't write them down, people aren't going to be able to guess. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 21:00, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>please stop playing Devil's advocate every time I vote "keep" on an article. I am not trying to get into debate, I am only trying to address my opinion - which I think should be plausible without comments under what I am saying to tell me that I am wrong. I respect your opinions, but somethings are a little too serious. I vote delete on most articles, and I think I have enough decision making capacity to vote <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>. Again, thanks...but sometimes, no thanks. Plus that, I was concentrating more on Google hits that were obviously related to the topic...which I thought was others would obviously do because the rest are pretty irrelevant. Thanks. Also note that the first hits dealt with the topic at hand.<b><font color="#808000"><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Smilie.gif">Image:Smilie.gif</a><a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Molotov_fc5c.html" title="User:V.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand with what substancial evidence you back up your disrespectful and ineffectual qualms... I would be very interested to see what (if any) evidence demonstrates a lack of cogent content. For a holiday that I have several times participated in (and know my town is not the only), I find it disgraceful that you would throw such rag-tag nonsense about. The claim that this is a hoax is not just false, it's disrespectful and insulting. Mastab

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonsense hoax.

<li><b>Comment</b> Quite possibly yes. By the way, it is not a holiday in Mexican mythology as you have stated, though it now marks a new occurence within the mythological realm. I concur, that would be nonsensical garbage, as the Frito bandito wasn't around until the 1960's. However, it is a "holiday" that is celebrated every October the 13th in various homes across the country and in the wider global community in protest to the discontinuation of Frito Bandito. The mythological story that comes along with the holiday may be infactual, however, I don't see anyone providing better. As I have stated before, the contents of the pages "is a conglomeration of various beliefs, myths, and traditions observed by people both in my town and about the wider global community". I am now off to the library to gather about further resources to support my claim. I cannot believe I am spending so much time defending an article who's deletion would not affect me, but rather thoughs who feel they may gain something from the information provided. I will return shortly. Thanks by the way for the advice Anetode. Mastab 16:49, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Spanish or not, that translates to "this is a 'fuck of shit' ". I do not believe that kind of language and disrespect is in order in this setting. Regardless of the dialect in which it is spoken. I will cease posting/editing further articles to comply with the many complaints I have recieved as a result of my first (and last) contribution to Wikipedia. If you guys cannot appreciate the practices of another generation, then it's your loss. Whether it's a matter of faith or morals, the fact that you people would dare to critisize these practices is undermining to our society and the common good of the people (minority or not). Thanks.

<li>You refer (several entries above) to "Mexican Immigration &amp; Popular Culture" by David Maciel as your source which cites this holiday.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> from author... <b>this is not a POV Essay</b>. The critical commentary in the article is intended to <i>document</i> the creation of a webcomic encyclopedia and the reasons for such a creation, not to <i>argue a point</i>. In fact, the article is not critical in and of itself, but rather <b>documents criticisms</b> that have been raised. This documentation takes the form of both paraphrasing and quoting cited sources. At no point does the article itself make an argument about Wikipedia. If it is interpreted as doing so, that was not the idea and I apologize. However, actually reading the article should show that this is the case quite clearly. Many of the reasons the Comixpedia encyclopedia was created had to do with the feelings of failure that existed in some way or another by members of the Wikipedian community in regards to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a>.</li>

<dd>As for the idea of this site not meeting web standards of notability, please take into account the following:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>This comic encyclopedia is linked to by several pages in the Wikipedian webcomic project pages as an alternate venue for webcomic pages that are found to not be sufficiently notable for this encyclopedia.</li>
<li>This site is owned by Comixpedia.com, a site that is notable enough in the webcomic community to both have an Alexa rating of "181,818" and be listed in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The site has only been operational for 2 months, which serves to deter it from having a high Alexa rating.</li>
<li>The site was born out of criticisms raised by the writer <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Burns_704e.html" title="Eric Burns">Eric Burns</a> of the popular <a href="../../../w/e/b/Websnark.html" title="Websnark">Websnark</a> blog site. Both of which are listed in Wikipedia and are seen as notable in the webcomics community.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Additionally: As for the argument that this piece is "original research" article and fails to meet <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> standards, this is a baseless accussation. All the facts documented in the article are available at one of the following sources:

<p>These sources are cited in the article itself. Rather than hitting <i>delete</i> so early, why not suggest improvements to the article if you feel it is not adequate.</p>
<p>ALSO OF NOTE: the idea that this article is a copy should not be a problem under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. Obviously, I hope that this article will be added to by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">Wikipedian webcomics community</a>. Another idea: If you feel the article is not worthy on its own, it may be a good idea to <b>merge</b> the information contained in this article with that in Comixpedia.com's article, as the sites are owned by the same company... in fact, it appears someone has already created a section in that article for Comixpedia.org (not me), so perhaps this information can be <b>merged</b> and incorporated there if editors feel that this article is not worth its own page.</p>

<dd><b>Response</b>: Regarding your above comment... That has to do with the fact that the site has been up for only a short while. As the site grows, this will obviously (hopefully) be resolved. Also, as writing about the creation of the site would be undocumented-- THAT would certainly qualify as original research, and thus make this an unencyclopedic article. I tried to write the article using sourced material to avoid it being judged as original research and failing the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> provision.

Merge it into the comixpedia article as a separate section, having a .org and .com article, both run by the same company seems kind of superfluous.

<dd>I don't take anything personally. In fact, I didn't know that a .org section had been created in the Comixpedia entry when I created this article. Otherwise I simply would have added the info there. So, in fact, I agree that two articles aren't needed. What I do take personally is accusations that I tried to write a biased article or something. It certainly documents a bias, but I don't think the article itself is biased, and it does provide valid information about the reasons behind the creation of the WebcomicsWiki. Notice that the wikipedians who are real visitors of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> section of the site are the ones who are providing the most valid and knowledgeable discussion.

<li>I've replaced it with an NPOV-stub. Article space is emphatically not where we carry rants on Wikipedia guidelines. Do that either on the guideline's talk page or in your userspace.

<dd>Once again, I would suggest you read the article. You emphatically argue that the article is a rant, I emphatically argue the opposite. The site was formed because of disagreement with Wikipedia guidelines. The original article documents that disagreement with cited sources and points to 2 outside articles. The original article does not attempt to say who is RIGHT or WRONG in the dispute. Also, replacing the article with a stub does not allow voters to see the original article. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 23:36, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I did read the article. I don't participate in AfD without doing so. And rewriting the article has turned into something that is at least not s writing out of someone's disagreement with a Wikipedia policy. Everybody has a history button, and is able to use it with a click of a button. It is everyday practise to rewrite an article during AfD, and is positively encouraged. As I said, such commentary on one persons view of a formative guideline belongs either on that guideline's talk page or in userspace. We avoid self-references in article space, and even if we allowed this one, it would be a hopeless POV article since it wouldn't include any other POV. If it did, it would immediately duplicate the proposal's talk page, so we go full circle. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 03:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to Comixpedia. Regarding Tedzee's precedent below, I actually think it's better to just say something was founded by disaffected Wikipedia members. If you have criticisms of Wikipedia guidelines in an article, you can't make it NPOV without including the other side also. And Wikipedia articles are not the place to argue about Wikipedia guidelines. Therefore I can't really see how to include the original discussion of concerns while keeping the article in line with Wikipedia policy. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b> because I am personally involved. The argument I see in favor of "keep" is: Unlambda is definitely worth having a page (I certainly didn't expect it to be so popular when I created it, but there it is), and I generally find it good policy to have a page (if only a stub) for the author or inventor of any work of any kind mentioned in the Wikipedia itself. The argument I see in favor of "delete" is: the category "French mathematicians" (don't know how to link to this!), as it is, is utterly ridiculous (some people a zillion times more important than I am do not have a listing there). On the whole, I tend to think that the page shouldn't have been written but, now that it is, it might as well remain (basically, there were more important pages to write, and there are also more important pages to delete!). Just to clarify two points: I did not write the page (and I do not know who did), and <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> is indeed a friend of mine. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGro-Tsen_3600.html" title="User:Gro-Tsen">Gro-Tsen</a> 19:10, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article is about a religion whose holy books it states to be "the Duble, the Dorah, Dubdas and the Du'ran", one of whose tenets it states to be "There Is No Pie", and whose characters it states to include the "Muffins of Doom". This is an obvious parody. Furthermore its edit history shows that it is a parody being constructed here on Wikipedia directly. Ironically, the article appears unrelated to the fact that people who have ceased to be <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> refer to practitioners of that religion as "dubs" and the religion as "dubism". <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:35, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, much more needs to be written of course, but there is no reason not to have an article on an individual formation.

<li><b>comment</b> This may well be a good example to include in an article like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, but at the moment I'm unconvinced it's deserving of its own article. I'm also having trouble figuring out what it's saying, because it's lacking enough technical information (which means I'm having trouble believing for sure that it's factually correct information and this isn't a hoax/imaginary item). For instance, "weight" is just a description of the force due to gravity, so is this saying that the electron's had enough momentum imparted to it that it strikes a target and the impulse in the collision is five pounds of force, or is it saying that the electron's accelerated to such a speed that it has a relativistic mass with regards to the earth (I'm assuming this is going on on earth) that earth's gravity is able to impart 5 pounds of normal force on it? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 16:58, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article and would like to respond to criticisms: It is maintained that it should be in Wiktionary but the article is more than a definition, it explores at length the origin of the term and is as much a social study as a definition. It is certainly not local to Dublin as it is heard throughout Ireland. Nor is it ephemeral to the 1970s-80s. It is very much in use today. There are no references because I know of none: I went to the school in question where the phrase arose and witnessed its origin, development and growth personally. It was not in use prior to the 1960s. The link suggested by a critic to an alternative etymology offers no proof of its speculation about "yardarms", which were not an item in common conversation at the time the phrase arose, in the 1960s. Yardarms were common in antique conversation. The development of "Get up the yard" was something I witnessed personally: it is the only word or phrase I have seen from its inception.

<dd>Michigan has approx. 10 mill. inhabitants. The place where I come from (Sandnes, Norway) has approx. 55.000.

My point is that even if he is a local man, he should have been mentioned somewhere on the net, if not, the article is to be removed due to Wikipedias policy on verifiability and original research!

<li><b>Keep</b> This appears to be a legitimate topic in philosophy. It is poorly written as an encyclopedia article, however.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I do not understand why this is considered to be POV. If there is a player that has failed to succeed in the NFL and he was drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, There is no doubt that the player is considered to be a bust. Yes, I know that there a limits to the labeling of players as busts (for example, I won't label Daunte Culpepper as a bust because he is having the worst season of his career and it is a slight possibility that he succeeded because he had Randy Moss. However, there is no debate as to whether or not Ryan Leaf or Tim Couch are busts). I can understand that there is a opinion gap on who's a steal or not a steal.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the POV issue/arbitrary nature of the criteria is actually secondary to the main problem of the list just not belonging on Wikipedia, especially not as its own entry. That alone, to me, is reason to delete it; the concern that it is going to be perpetually POV/"fuzzy" on its inclusion/exclusion criteria is just icing on the cake. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:43, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I am the creator of this article (and the List of NHL Draft Steals, another disputed article, as well), and I understand that this may be POV to some people (due to the many definitions of a bust or a steal that people have). I am sorry that I haven't updated the NFL Draft Busts and Steals pages as of late... I really don't have the time to pour into making this list as I did with the NHL pages (I was in summer vacation then and add a part-time job (20-30 hours/week) to that as well). The lack of time for me to develop this page has allowed it to rot into this state. I will try to get some guidelines for an NFL Draft Steal and an NFL Draft Bust up soon. I know that this can be fixed... It just needs manhours and research. As an example, look at the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>. It was often debated whether it was legittimate or it was strictly POV, but the contributors to the list started to crack down on what could come in to the list. If I (and others) can crack down on what comes into these lists, I feel that this list can thrive in the Wikiverse. <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossmann_7782.html" title="User:Hossmann">Hossmann</a> 15:30, 15 October 2005

<p><b>Nomination</b>: For same reasons that List of NHL Draft Steals should be deleted (and for the sake of consistency), this should be deleted. Specifically, the very fact that the opening sentence admits the topic is by nature unencyclopedic makes, to me at least, a very compelling argument for excluding it from Wikipedia. Concerns regarding its seemingly arbitrary inclusion criteria are also influencing me. Finally, I'm not moved by the fact that it's part of a wikiproject, as I don't think the fact that an entry's editors have formally grouped themselves together with a collective name entitles them or their articles to a looser reading of WP:NOT, particularly section 1.7 and the overarching principle that Wikipedia is not to become an indiscriminate collection of information. This, I feel, is essentially cruft, and cruft is cruft, and being part of a wikiproject shouldn't be treated as some sort of imprimatur on cruft. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 18:31, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> While I agree that it can sometimes be difficult to determine which players belong on this list, there are plenty of players that can <i>only</i> be described as "Draft Busts". For example, can you really call Neil Brady any thing <i>but</i> a draft bust? While this article borders on POV, I feel that there are enough relevant players who belong on this list to make it NPOV. Is it possible to keep this if it was cleaned up and strong criteria was set for players to be included? I really think that this is a relevant list.

<li><b>comment</b> How on God's good green Earth is List of Sports Flops not up for deletion? How is it that Sports Flops are less POV than NHL Draft Busts? Let's compare: "List of Sports Flops": an incomplete simple list of players from many leagues with no stats or other information vs. "List of NHL Draft Busts": an almost complete list of which the players' stats are mentioned <i>and</i> a comparision to other players from the same year is made. I say clean-up the NHL draft busts article and keep it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: if the list of NHL (NFL) draft busts have to go, then so do <b>all</b> of these List of commercial failures, List of flops in entertainment, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_disasters.html" title="List of military disasters">List of military disasters</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_flops.html" title="List of political flops">List of political flops</a>, List of famous failures in science and engineering, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_commercial_failures_in_computer_and_video_gaming.html" title="List of commercial failures in computer and video gaming">List of commercial failures in computer and video gaming</a>. There is already a precendent set on Wikipedia for this kind of thing. Why are sports exempt? While the NFL list needs a lot of work, the NHL list is pretty good. With some criteria setting, I see no reason why this list can't be kept! The aforementioned lists are just as valid as a list of draft busts. A player drafted 2nd overall who plays only 10 games and scores nothing can't be anything but a bust. Let's be consistent and either keep all or delete all. If it isn't POV to list video game flops, then it <i>definately</i> isn't POV to list Draft Busts. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 17:00, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The very nature of sports involves superlatives that can be considered a matter of opinion, between players and teams widely believed to be "great" or "mediocre" and the subjectivity of performance in general. That being said, there is in fact a reasonable consensus opinion, undisputed in the discussions taking place concerning the article, and a similar consensus in the hockey community at large. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:04, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I understand that some of the busts on this list may be debatable, but I feel that this isn't POV because the definition of a bust is pretty much solidified. For example, everyone believes that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Lawton_a9ce.html" title="Brian Lawton">Brian Lawton</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Wickenheiser_61f7.html" title="Doug Wickenheiser">Doug Wickenheiser</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Daigle_7be3.html" title="Alexandre Daigle">Alexandre Daigle</a> are nothing but busts (although some could say that Daigle may be redeemed due to his comeback with Minnesota) and all of these players have had, in some cases, successful careers. Why are they busts? They are busts because, as the definition on the Draft Bust page says, they are <i>"A first-round draft pick who has failed to live up to the expectations levyed upon the player when their respective team drafted him"</i> At the same time, players like <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Bonsignore_55e6.html" title="Jason Bonsignore">Jason Bonsignore</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre_Volchkov_ee2f.html" title="Alexandre Volchkov">Alexandre Volchkov</a>, and Neil Brady are busts for obvious reasons (like failing to solidify a spot on an NHL roster at any time in his NHL career). As you can see, the bust is pretty much a solid definition and there isn't much of a range for POV. The steal, however, is a different story and has caused uproar on this site. I believe the first sentence of the paragraph is pretty misleading. If I have time, i'll change it. --<a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossmann_7782.html" title="User:Hossmann">Hossmann</a> 23:55, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> This page should be deleted for a few reasons. 1) It is a matter of opinion 2)It has no formula or clear, precise definition about the difference between what makes Player A a steal and Player B not 3)different users have different opinions on who should belong on the list and who shouldn't, and therefore this article is easily disputable.

<li><b>Delete</b> The very fact that the opening sentence admits the topic is by nature unencyclopedic makes, to me at least, a very compelling argument for excluding it from Wikipedia. Croat Canuck's concerns regarding its seemingly arbitrary inclusion criteria are also influencing me. Finally, I'm not moved by the fact that it's part of a wikiproject, as I don't think the fact that an entry's editors have formally grouped themselves together with a collective name entitles them or their articles to a looser reading of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, particularly section 1.7 and the <i>overarching principle</i> that Wikipedia is not to become an indiscriminate collection of information. Cruft is cruft, and being part of a wikiproject doesn't, or at least I believe <i>shouldn't</i> be treated as some sort of imprimatur on cruft. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:59, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think that this article will need to list verifiable sources saying that player A has performed much better than anticipated at a draft and is a steal. The criteria for determining who and who is not a steal also needs to be tightened up as it seems arbitrary at the moment. For example, players from the Soviet Union are excluded for reasons that don't seem obvious to me. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:04, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the NFL article, i'm putting it on AfD now. I'm somewhere between <b>Delete</b> and <b>Rewrite</b> on the NHL article. Alot of work was put into it, and it can be salvaged, but right now it reads like an essay, it has a POVish title, if it were shorter I think any decent content could be merged without much rancor.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> For those of you who just jumped in on the bandwagon to delete this page, I am the original author that Masterhatch talked about in his statement. Even though I have forseen this arguement about the whole POV factor, it seems that I was unprepared for the onslaught of *<b>Delete</b> statements on this discussion. Let me try to explain myself as clear as possible. I added this list onto wikipedia because I thought that this would be considered as an "educational tool" for the newer fans who did not know a bust from an apple or a steal from a pear. Yes, there are times where an addition to this list is debatable, but I personally feel that the ones I added were core components to successful teams (I'm talking about a playoff run... so don't add <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kudelski_8357.html" title="Bob Kudelski">Bob Kudelski</a> on this list) and were or are solid players at the NHL level. For an effort to fix this list (from disputable additions), I will find any players that I feel are debatable additions and will post them up on the discussion board for the people to vote upon (I will try to do several of these after I post this message). Hopefully, I explained this list's purpose on Wikipedia and persuaded a few people to change their minds about this list. I am surprised by the deletion or the list. Not because of why it's being deleted, but it about who is deleting this list. If you look at this list's history, you will see that Croat Canuck contributed to list a little less than a month ago. Seemingly ironic, he added a handful of extremely debatable steals himself (which I swiftly deleted, as I explained why I deleted them on my user discussion page). <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossmann_7782.html" title="User:Hossmann">Hossmann</a> 20:16, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>delete</b> all three of these song lists as trivia, topic(s) not encyclopedic and inclusion of some songs not verifiable. Apparently any song that mentions masturbation or contains allusions that someone thinks refer to masturbation can get listed, without verification of the songwriter's intent.

<li>Actually, it's a perfectly valid criterion. That said, this one looks like a keeper.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b> â there is no clear consensus (5 votes <i>keep</i>, 3 votes <i>delete</i>). However, the majority is for <i>keep</i>, and that's a failsafe stance. Some users noted that this might be a relevant stub from which an article might grow. I'll add <i>cleanup</i> though. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 19:23, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I know firsthand that it is fairly popular in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>. It is a form of predicting the future. The concept behind it is that the fate of everyone is already predicted many thousands of years ago. There are different branches of this based on predictions by different <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishi.html" title="Rishi">sages</a>, the one by <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agastyar.html" title="Agastyar">Agastya</a> being the most famous. The guys who make the prediction have these predictions written in dried palm leaves, one leaf for each individual. If you go there for consultation, they will ask you for your details and find a leaf which matches the things that have already happened in your life, and read out/interpret the rest of the contents of the leaf to predict your future. How scientific it is is anybody's guess. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 15:21, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Nadi Jothidam is the spelling preferred by google, and articles of either spelling refer to astrology, not palm leaf reading. This appears to be a real phenomenon, but I'm not certain how valid the article is as it stands.

<li><b>Keep</b> Even though, I wouldn't call it a <i>science</i>, there are a number of people who believe in these predictions and their accouns seem irrefutable (perhaps they're tricked).

Info about a 2006 event seems even more predictable than a 2008 event. Also, there is far more speculation in the US/2008 article. Obviously, a municipal election is less "notable" than a national one, but I haven't heard that as a reason for the nomination. Here's a quote from that US/2008 article <i>"Vince McMahon, owner and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, appeared on his 2005 SummerSlam event in a Presidential limo with a McMahon for President banner although it may have been simply a humorous sketch given the event's location in Washington, DC."</i>.

<li>An article expressing what's known or widely perceived about a future election isn't being a "crystal ball", it's being a resource for information about that election, which will get duly updated as more specifics become known. We already have <a href="../../../3/9/t/39th_Canadian_federal_election_0ff9.html" title="39th Canadian federal election">39th Canadian federal election</a>. We already have <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2008_b6e0.html" title="United States presidential election, 2008">United States presidential election, 2008</a>. Both of those are valid articles. This, too, is perfectly valid (albeit on a smaller scale, but we've done municipal election coverage before). If the article were predicting a <i>winner</i>, in advance of even knowing who the official candidates will be, <i>then</i> "crystal ball" would be a valid argument. As the article stands, however, it's just a snapshot of how a campaign that's only a year away is beginning to shape up (and how else would I have learned that <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Munter_d475.html" title="Alex Munter">Alex Munter</a> is currently the voting public's first choice for the mayoralty?) <b>Keep</b> it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:28, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: the term gets very few original Google results past the first page, except for irrelevant ones, like "right, socialism" or "right. Socialism". Also, there are no matches on Google News. It's probably a very non-notable neologism and/or original research.

<dd>This isn't a personal vendetta. Non-notable games aren't encyclopedic material, and players of those non-notable games are certainly not encyclopedic material. I used my administrative powers to speedily delete two articles on Stargate Wars players, per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Criteria for speedy deletion A7</a>, and I'm nominating the other things for deletion normally (which is something any user can do).<br />
While it isn't written in stone that a subject needs to be notable, in practice the vast majority of things (games included) need to have some evidence of notability, particularly if they're largely interchangable units in a homogenous whole (for example, Kings of Chaos clones). Efforts to write a notability guideline or policy have run into problems where people can't decide if notability applies to this or that sort of thing (places, towns, schools, roads, etc.) and there is a minority of users who don't feel notability should be a factor in these decisions, but the vast majority of Wikipedians require evidence of notability from the vast majority of things, web-based online games included. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I realise that characters/users need to be notable (and as such have even agreed with you on your deletion page for UNKNOWN, as I have now read said 'rules' and realise this requirement). However, it does not say anywhere that a subject (non-individual, i.e. a road, city, internet-game...) needs to be notable; I realise that it is expected, but it is not a necessary requirement of Wikipedia. If all encyclopaediae worked on this basis, small insignificant (not-notable) things like an 'Aardvark' or some extinct animal (other than those dinosaurs; they ARE notable) wouldn't even get into it! To quote <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>, an Encyclopaedia (such as Wikipedia) is a 'compendium of knowledge'. Thus, all knowledge, regardless of notability, should be included. I realise that some of the things that some users post on Wikipedia are absolutely wrong (i.e. making an article dedicated to the fact that the moon is made of cheese (and making an article dedicated to the theory that the moon is made of cheese)), but other articles that are made are actually genuine in its' validity - regardless of the subjects' notability - are being unjustly deleted based on their notability. Now I do believe that there needs to be better ways of proving that information is correct by Wikipedia and it's users/administrators. Perhaps we could discuss such methods on my talk pages (it'd take up too much space here, and would be irrelevant to the deletion process). <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterd_92e3.html" title="User:Hunterd">ZPMMaker</a> 08:19, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia does not catalog every person, every website, every toy, every intersection, every book, every song, every issue of every magazine, every model of computer, every day, or every building, nor should it.

<dd>Any information in this article will rot quickly and may very quickly become moot (and will indeed be forgotten) if the game goes out of business/is C&amp;D'ed, and, in the meantime, this game's impact is limited and influence nonexistent. Should it become notable in some way outside of a corner of the Stargate fandom (totally unscientific note: I've hit up several hardcore SG-1 fans and they've never heard of this game), then an article can be written, but until then, there's no need for this article. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 10:04, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine! Be like that! lol. All Stargate people who like this article (as well as the Stargate Wars article: I have copied the article onto my own <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/zpmmaker" class="external text" title="http://www.freewebs.com/zpmmaker" rel="nofollow">website</a> where this, and articles like this, are guarenteed acceptance (it must be Stargate though....). Also, what's "C&amp;D'ed" mean? Legally (by most national and international constitutions/laws/legislatures), all rules must be written for them to be acted upon/enforced. Why does this not apply here? I'm not saying that Wikipedia is stupid, so don't get the wrong idea; I think that these rules that newbies don't know about need to be written! <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterd_92e3.html" title="User:Hunterd">ZPMMaker</a> 07:41, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Make sure you give the authors credit, to satisfy the GFDL (the hippie granola open-source license Wikipedia licenses its content under).</dd>
<dd>C&amp;D = Cease and desist; Stargate Wars is one cease-and-desist letter from whoever owns Stargate from being shut down. (Someone mentioned "Foxing" in one of these AFDs - same thing.)</dd>
<dd>Lastly, welcome to Wikipedia, where, like many online communities, many of the rules of conduct are not written down, particularly in the case of some of the more esoteric background infrastructure processes such as AFD. I agree that they should all be written down (or as many as possible, anyway), but trying to write a notability guideline has been a difficult process that has yet to produce any fruit. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:47, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Since I actually do the comic, I doubt I would ask for it to be deleted. Here's a few of my points for it not to be deleted...

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> No harm in having it. As for the google search...how common a last name is Napierski anyway? And how common is it to be paired with "Steve"?

<ul>
<li><b>A Collective Reply</b> - It doesn't matter how well written or well drawn a comic is. There are many well written blogs out there, many well drawn personal art sites out there, that is not an instant assertion of notability. Just because a comic has x00 strips, also does not make it notable, a long running ignored website is the same as a new ignored website. It fails the Alexa ranking test, but I've not even been using them for a while, because barely mentioning it as circumstantial evidence leads a a horde of straw man arguments claiming Alexa is the only grounds. If a great man were to rise to power very quickly, he would have an article. Has the outer circle had a great rise to fame? I don't think so. And the whole point is, that "Steve Napierski" is a relatively unique name is where Google can help. If his name were John Doe, then the search would be absolutely useless. And to reply to the post on the author's site, no, I am not against webcomics being listed on Wikipedia, I am however, against every webcomic entity listed on the encyclopedia just because their fans think it deserves one. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 13:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>...and thus the Hahnchen did prowl the Wiki, looking for unworthy webcomics to delete, never giving a thought that he has too much free time on his hands mayhap. -<a href="http://www.lessthankate.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lessthankate.com/" rel="nofollow">Donny</a>

<li>Hahnchen is trying to maintain consistency of our standards for notable vs. non-notable websites in our encyclopedia. He has an area of focus, yes, but it's work somebody has to do. Your objections indicate that you don't really understand the purpose of Wikipedia, which means you might want to think twice before claiming experienced editors are wrongly nominating articles for deletion. In my vote above, I put a link to my thoughts on this issue that may help you understand what's going on, if you're interested. (Also, you might want to be aware that linking to your own commercial website in an AfD could be considered advertizing, although I imagine you're just using it for identification purposes.) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 23:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I suppose what I said was un-called for. Almost as uncalled for as implying that someone's Wiki entry is stupid. The problem with a webcomics area is that it comes down to a matter of opinion of what is and isn't notable. Is it hits? Money made? Popularity? Granted, it could be argued that the latter crieria goes hand in hand with hits but there are plenty of lousy sites that rake in tons of traffic. Likewise there are quality sites that haven't yet made it big. The outer circle is one of those sites, yet it IS on people's radars. Waiting until its at Penny Arcade's level of noteriety before its included is just wrong. - Donny
<ul>
<li>I have a list of reasons a webcomic might be notable at <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_Webcomics_fd3d.html" title="User:SCZenz/Webcomics">User:SCZenz/Webcomics</a>. We should use any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence of notability--but "on peoples' radars" is a little vague, as that goes. We need things that are quantifiable precisely <i>because</i> Wikipedia editors aren't qualified to judge the quality of webcomics!</li>
<li>The webcomic community seems to misunderstand what the Wikipedia community is about. We're now being insulted on webcomics' daily news, people are voting in AfD's without reading any of the relevant procedures, and webcomic-lovers are feeling hurt when we say that their website is non-encyclopediaic. When we say "non-notable" we don't mean that it's <i>not notable for a webcomic</i>; we mean that it isn't visible enough in <i>other sources</i> to be put in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> the place for webcomics (even high-quality ones that are underregarded on other pages) to increase their visibility. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 00:31, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think Hahnchen said that "someone's Wiki entry is stupid," at least not anywhere I've seen--he said a set of proposed guidelines were "stupidly lax," and you'll see above that I objected immediately. Please bear in mind, too, that a wikipedia article on a person, website, or anything else isn't <i>that person's entry</i>; it's the encyclopedia's entry <i>about that person</i>. (Maybe that's just a comment on imprecise wording, but it <i>is</i> and important idea.) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 01:01, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for that Donny, yet more character assassination from the lovable webcomic community. I just feel that webcomics should have some verifiable assertion of notability. Merely being on people's radar is just not a real point. The thing with webcomics, is that even the smallest have a core group of vocal loyal online fans, but just because of this it doesn't mean it's any more notable than any other website. The same is true for forums, websites and blogs. It's not that the Wiki entry is stupid, but I believe that wiki should not just be used as a collection of all information about anything that has ever existed. And the reaction from some parts of the webcomic community is quite frankly, ridiculous. Some seem to think that their webcomic inherently deserves a wikipedia article, just because it exists and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> has one. And that without a wikipedia article, it makes their comic look small, bad, and not as good as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangle_and_Robert_8b36.html" title="Triangle and Robert">Triangle and Robert</a>. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:16, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Official policy or not, this article is not relevant to the world at large. It's an extremely specific term from a game that already has an article of its own that <i>explains the term when describing the game mechanics</i>. The topic doesn't require an article of its own; there's no way somebody's going to start typing "tick" rather than "Fantasy Empires" into the search box when searching for information about the game. <b>Delete</b>. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:33, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's <b>very</b> possible that someone might type tick instead of Fantasy Empires. Not only that, but I'm sure I've heard this term applied to other games online, I just couldn't cite you which ones at the moment, unfortunately. Draggy 02:42, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, if somebody uses Wikipedia as a primary source of details about a game and refuses to use the game's name as a starting point, they get what they ask for. It's true that "tick" has been used as a measurement of time in other games (it's certainly been used in various pen-and-paper roleplaying games), but this article is specifically about <i>Fantasy Empires</i>. Its very title makes that clear. Even if you were to take a more general view of the suject, I'm not convinced that it deserves an article of its own. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 04:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You might be surprised. I've picked up alot of info about games from browsing interconnected Wikipedia pages involving the game. Perhaps if nothing else, merge this article with the main article about FE or edit it into the main page instead of simply deleting it. I would suggest making it a sub-page except that if I understand correctly only certain things may have sub-pages? I'm not to clear on that. Draggy 09:03, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But there's nothing to merge! Like I said, the <i>FE</i> article already contains all relevant information about the topic. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 10:43, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no such thing and the page has very little content. The volleyball officials are the first and second referee, and two or four line judges; see the rules at <a href="http://www.fivb.org/EN/Volleyball/Rules/Rules.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fivb.org/EN/Volleyball/Rules/Rules.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fivb.org/EN/Volleyball/Rules/Rules.htm</a>. However, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">Volleyball</a> lacks a section about officials, so the little content that exists could be moved there instead. - Magnus Holmgren &lt;magho@home.se&gt; (I'll create an account momentarily)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Volleyball does not have umpires, and so I do not see how any of the content here can be ported elsewhere. The second sentence of the article is a statement of the obvious regarding any refereeing in any endeavour and has no particular bearing on volleyball. The first is factually incorrect and, even though we're not paper, we don't collect factually incorrect information. If <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">Volleyball</a> needs an "officials" section, that's fine, but it should not come from this article. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:13, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hunh?! Not only shouldn't the degree that you are impressed by our web traffic be a standard for inclusion in Wikipedia, but what does this ranking mean? If you noted, you didn't get a ranking for yoism.org. For some reason, you got one for yoism.net (at least that is what I get when I go to Alexa). Yoism.net doesn't even exist, and hasn't for many months. Secondly, our Google hits went from around 9000 when searching for "yoism" a month ago to 770 today. So, if this is a current ranking, and similar factors affect it as the Google hit number, despite the fact that it isn't even for yoism.org, what does it mean? (If it is a delayed ranking based on six month to one year old data (which is what Alexa donates to public projects and goes back to a time when yoism.net may have existed), then that figure would be a fraction of what we were getting a few weeks ago.) The traffic and interest I was referring to developed over this past summer. Prior to that interest was steady but much lower. But what ranking would we have to achieve to have a Yoism article in the Wikipedia? Why is this relevant? <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 01:24, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It means that alexa thinks there are 723,390 websites that get more vists than your. In practice it means that you are off the bottem of the scale as far as alexa are concernded. The ranking are made up of the vists to yoism.org and twiki.yoism.org. The figure is the average for the last 3 months. However you look at your stats even your peak vists hardly show a strong world responce.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:44, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be serious about this and may be trying to be impartial. Assuming you just didn't read the parts where I clarified what I meant by a strong response (after all this is getting lengthy), by "strong world response" I have now clarified that I meant that each day we were getting thousands of hits and about one (1, uno) response from a new person who showed an interest in pursuing Yoism further, and that our Google hits had grown from under 2000 to around 9000 in a few months. Given the rate of growth we experienced in the past and that other religions experience early on, this was "a strong response." That's all I meant by strong response on our redirected "We were hacked page."</dd>

<dd>In addition to 6 or 7 people showing some lasting interest each week, every couple of weeks we would get a threatening response from one or two people who were angered/threatened by our claims that traditional religions were misguided fantasies left over from humanity's childhood. I don't know who hacked our site. But I suspected that it was no coincidence that our site was hacked shortly after we started getting thousands of hits along with such negative responses. Rob, our new webmaster, thinks it was coincidence. But this is what I meant on that redirected page by a strong world response, nothing more. As far as I understand, the Alexa stats could be consistent with this, especially since the last three weeks have had zero or near zero hits on the yoism.org or twiki.yoism.org sites.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 04:54, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Note: From the WayBackMachine FAQ: "Why are there no recent archives in the Wayback Machine? We do not add pages less than 6 months after they are collected, because of the time delayed donation from Alexa. Updates can take up to 12 months in some cases." Because of this, there are no Yoism pages archived from 2005.)</p>
<p>And indeed, "Right." In August and September, we were getting over 2,000 hits/day. That may not be much by some standards, but for us it was a very strong and steady response. We were getting emails from all over the world from people looking for Yoan meetings and/or interested in setting up chapters of Yoism other than in Boston, where it originated.</p>
<p>Our site, that has been up for four years nonstop, was, indeed, hacked by someone who began to send out spam using our dedicated webserver. Our webmaster closed down the site a few weeks ago <i>even though it functioned fine and visitors would never know it was being used for spam!</i> It is against Yoan principles to allow our server to be used for destructive purposes.</p>
<p>The problem was that we hadn't secured our site sufficiently against such hackers. Since securing it further would take expertise our webmaster hadn't developed, we decided to move it to a hosting service that would be responsible for security (instead of running our own dedicated server). The service we chose is www.gaiahost.net and we are setting up our site as I write. I set up the "We've been hacked" message on my personal web pages at my comcast account and had www.yoism.org traffic redirected to that page until we get our site back up. Meanwhile, for choosing to do the right thing---closing down our dedicated server that was being used for nefarioius purposes, instead of letting it run while we set up our new site---the article about Yoism is being proposed for deletion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was extensive discussion of deletion when the Yoism article was first created. After a great deal of debate and modification of the article in 2003 the issue was apparently settled.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies the apparent problem with the article. I hope it seems reasonable to wait a few weeks to see what the links refer to when the Yoism site is back up. Or if it is necessary, I can recreate the specific pages (except our home page which is too complex for me) that the Yoism article links to at the same Comcast site where the "We were hacked" message is hosted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I would propose that the article be removed from pages for deletion and the banner removed from the article. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 02:25, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. Hello -</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who was active in the Yoan community for a number of years (starting in 1998), I can assure you that it in no ways resembles the "micronations" you describe (defined in Wikipedia as "entities that resemble independent nations or states, but for the most part exist only on paper, on the Internet, or in the minds of their creators.") The Yoan community was an actual group of people who met weekly at gatherings in Somerville and Cambridge, Massachusetts, many of which I attended. Its participants was crucially active in volunteer efforts for a nonprofit project for human rights in mental health located in Whitman, Massachusetts. Furthermore, the ideas of Yoism have provided the basis for vibrant discussions about the nature of religion and truth for not only its immediate members, but many others around the world by way of the internet. These discussions continue today from far corners of the planet.</p>
<p>Knowing first-hand the webmaster of the Yoism web site, I can verify that their server indeed been hijacked recently and is undergoing security improvements.</p>
<p>Whether or not the links listed on Wikipedia are currently inactive or not, Yoism is alive and well as a concept in the world, and I strongly object to the article being removed.</p>
<p>Sincerely, R. Hull</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>. I know the people in charge of yoism.org, and so I know that the server was hacked around the beginning of October and is currently being restored.

I spoke to Dan in person just hours after the hacking occurred. Zac was able to reestablish the page, but the offenders who had gained accessed we soon learned were using the server for sending spam. We had no other choice but to shut down the server. If you ask me, the reason why we were attacked has absolutely nothing to do with ideology or religious contentiousness-- it's because our server had lousy security and some industrious hacker exploited that for their own selfish purposes. I think Yo is a significant enough to warrant having a wikipedia entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: For readability purposes I also tagged Brendan Miller's, Rich Hull's, and Dan K.'s posts with "do not delete" because this page is for voting and they are clearly voting by posting these comments on this page. I wanted to make this clearer by putting the uniform heading on their entries.</p>
<p>But I want to know: what counts as vanity? What is the criterion for something being worthy of inclusion? Admittedly it is a relatively small thing at this point. But why should wikipedia rule out inclusion of smaller scale phenomena? If there is such a rule (for example a rock band on a tiny record label that is only known in non-commercial contexts and small distribution magazines does not exist but a rock band that is featured in big time magazines does exist) than what is the actual criterion for scale-- and why ever should wikipedia be against grassroots non-commercial culture??</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. We don't have specific criteria for religions, I think we should, but existing for only ten years and having only 100 members would no doubt be below them. Wikipedia is not used for groups to establish themselves, it is for describing groups already sufficiently notable. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:09, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response to Kjkolb:</b> After modifying the article greatly in response to NPOV and presenting independent evidence of Yoism's existence, this became the sole and main issue in the lengthy discussion that occurred in 2003. Given that paper space is not an issue in the Wikipedia, the issue of number of members or notoriety need not be considered rigidly in establishing a Wikipedia article. Membership in a religion is a rather large step and for every person that joins/identifies as a member of a religion there are hundreds who are aware of it. Indeed, there are thousands of people who have engaged in discussions of Yoism, much of which can be found in Google searches. Having 100 participants in the Boston area was deemed sufficient in 2003. Since then the number has grown with most of that growth occurring outside of Boston and being impossible to count. We have received numerous emails that begin something like, "I have considered myself a Yoist for years now and was wondering . . ." from people we have never heard from before. I believe a legitimate claim could be made that the number of Yoans easily exceeds 1,000. But I have not edited the Wikipedia article with the more accurate new numbers because I had no external source with which to verify them. Despite wanting to change the numbers (nothing makes something more popular than seeing it become popular with other people), I have become more of a Wikipedian since 2003 and, beyond understanding the rules, without some independent reference I didn't even consider such a revision possible. I figured that that can wait until there is some other independent source for the new numbers. I never thought, that after more than doubling in size, we would have to re-debate the size issue or see the Wikipedia article deleted. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 14:12, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point to add, there is no way possible that inclusion in the Wikipedia could mislead a reader into thinking that Yoism is more substantial a phenomenon than it is. The reader is presented at the very beginning with a statement (actually an understatement, but that just reinforces this point) about the size of membership. I believe that was put into the article up front back in 2003 for precisely this reason, i.e., to make sure that inclusion in the Wikipedia did not suggest something about the magnitude of this phenomenon that was not so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it is presumptuous to then suggest that around phenomenon where signficance based on sufficient size is debatable, if presented with the necessary information, readers cannot evaluate the importance of the phenomena for themselves. If presented with the information for an accurate picture of this issue, I see no need to protect readers form being exposed to information that some people feel is of insufficient importance while others disagree (as was well established in 2003). Nobody is being misled. Furthermore, the article has existed with these low numbers being presented up front for over two years. Clearly readers of this article have not felt that the numbers issue was a sufficient problem to make an issue of it, until the links stopped working and some erroneous assumptions were made about what the temporary redirect of those links indicated about Yoism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And many, many people have found the article to be of importance; it is often cited as a reason for their further investigation of Yoism. Despite the fact that this last point is of interest to me as one who wants to see Yoism spread, consider that fact carefully: After being told that there are 100 or so participants in Yoism (understatement or not), numerous individuals have found the information in the article to be of sufficient siginificance to spend their time investigating Yoism further. If you accept the fact that this has occurred (and while I acknowledge that I have not proved it, if you don't believe me, then just consider this a hypothetical illustration [a thought experiment] of why a specific numerical definition may be misleading), I think this would be evidence that the "size" issue should not be set according to some subjective notion that doesn't match real world behavior in which people are finding the description of this phenomenon to be of sufficient significance to spend their own life energy in researching further. Surely, that would be evidence of more significance than many, many Wikipedia articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, regarding the 10 year figure as insufficient. Why would religious phenomena need to exist longer than other cultural phenomena before they can be included in the Wikipedia? If we had a ten year rule (or even a five year rule, or even a two year rule) for sociocultural phenomena, many thousands of Wikipedia articles would have to be deleted. There are an enormous number of cultural phenomena that---especially in our information age---achieve significance in far less than 10 years. Consider for example, Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 14:57, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see no need for deletion. If they have been active since 1998 and got abused by criminal hackers then I get that some of you find the page confusing. I say wait wait at least until they set up the new server so everybody commenting could do it on the real thing. Compared to many other texts Yoism belong here. I would feel let down if wiki didn't have the text it has now. I saw it as very informative. It is no hoax at all.</p>

<p>Considering we've already had this discussion a few years back and decided not to delete, and considering there are at least a couple news paper articles about Yoism (indicating that people do find it relavent), I think this is a pretty clear case. It relevant. People find it interesting. It doesn't detract from the rest of the Wikipedia in anyway. Its only a net positive, and it has been cited a few times in paper media, so it belongs.</p>

<p>I don't think the website being down matters at all. The yoism website is still not a source other than Dan Kriegman, its just another vehicle for him. Why should Wikipedia be the sole supporter and host of this religious philosophy? This has nothing to do with knowledge, just advertising and proselytizing. Dan Kriegman needs to pay for his own commercial airtime. (Kriegman's already told us he has incorporated and can legally receive moneys from supporters...) It seems to me any Yoism page on Wiki should be focused on the way the "group" is trying to expand, by exploiting the "open source" philosophy of Wikipedia *specifically* - this is the only thing we really know these "Yoans" are actually doing. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilgrimZ_cce6.html" title="User:PilgrimZ">PilgrimZ</a> 21:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Even if Yoism were one (its not) this is no good reason to delete the entry.

<b>Do Not Delete</b></p>
<p>If somebody hacking a website all of a sudden makes something not exist, then Wikipedia is in a sad state of affairs. I am a Yoan and have been involved with them for some time. You should be able to see from previous discussions of whether or not Yoism's wikipedia entry should stay or go (when the site was up and running) that this bridge has already been crossed and it was decided that it should stay.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines religion as " In its broadest sense some have defined it as the sum total of answers given to explain humankind's relationship with the universe." So regardless of how few follow the faith, it's existence (which is clear from the people voting for it to stay) and differentiation from any other faith means that it should stay as it adds to the encyclopedic knowledge of religion.</p>
<p>You know Christianity was once a cult as well. If you would like more information about the existence of Yoism you can check [<a href="http://www.yoism.org.au" class="external text" title="http://www.yoism.org.au" rel="nofollow">here</a>], the australian branch of the religion which is currently still under web development (as there are currently only 2 Australian Yoans)</p>

<p>I've edited a few wikipdedia articles from different IP addresses (mainly in the topic of Global Governance, Global Democracy, Global Citizens, etc), but admittedly have not been very involved (although, I probably will become more involved over time). I am a Yoan. The article on Yoism clearly promotes Yoism, but it is also an article in good faith reporting a newish phenomena re: a specific Open Source Religion. Yoism is real, the number of Yoans uncounted but an estimate of 1,000 or so seems plausible. It is an independently verified group (definitely not a micronation, definitely in existence beyond Dan Kriegman and the website). I understand the concerns Wikipedians have about the misuse of wikipedia, and I understand the requirements for no new research, NPOV, no micronations, etc. -- to be a resepcted and established source of information it is important to take these concerns very seriously. Wikipedia is under attack by academics and others for being too loose in its criteria of inclusion, yet the backlash effect of this attack is stressful and annoying on the open source culture. Articles exist because of interest in them, this is true on all topics, and they evolve over time by the participation of many people from around the world -- i.e., they improve continuously (this is what makes Wikipedia special--a bad article, of which there are many, is most often simply a new article remaining to be edited, other encycolpedia publish only edited version, so those who critique wikipedia on this point are simply ignorant of the process). Anyhow, imho, wikipedians should have more confidence in the validity of their project, its methods, and principles -- and it would betray all of these to delete the Yoism page.

<p>I am <b>not</b> a Yoan -- and wouldn't be because of their hot-under-the-collar anti-monotheism -- but I find their idea fascinating and much of their work very creative. I think they are modelling something -- the co-creation of religious ideas and rituals -- that is useful for all of us to consider. It is too bad that their site has been taken down temporarily. While it was up, I spent several hours exploring it, and am discussing the collaborative formation of religions now with some other people, in other contexts. The fact that Yoism arose out of the cooperative movement fascinates me. I now use Wiki as my default source for looking up things (even before Google half the time), and I would be very disappointed if because something is new, it was dropped from the Wikipedia regardless of how substantive it is. Wikipedia is not a stale record of the past, but a living representation of reality as it is emerging.

<dd>Umm no the article was always that size.

<dd>This is not a fair representation of reality. When a church has attendance of 30 (which is what was reported in the <i>Boston Globe</i> article), is the membership likely to be 30? And, of course, sarcasm aside, we don't need to break verifiability records to be in the Wikipedia. And experienced Wikipedians, who had access to our temporarily down web site two years ago, did feel a NPOV article could be written about Yoism. And they mostly rewrote it to make sure it was NPOV!

<p>There is a claim that there are sock puppets in this discussion and that the votes of folks with no or few previous edits should be discarded. There are two separate issues raised by this: (1) are they sock puppets and (2) if not, should their votes be treated as such under the meat puppet extension to the sock puppet rule.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Sock Puppets</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>To address the first issue we can look at the official "sock puppet" policy, which states:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it appears that sock puppets are being used as part of an edit war or to distort the outcome of a vote or survey, one possible rule of thumb is the 100-edit guideline. This suggests that any account with more than 100 edits is presumed not to be a sock puppet. If there are unusually many accounts with few edits participating, you may want to check if they are sockpuppets, by looking at IP addresses or times that edits were made. However, simply having made few edits is not evidence of sockpuppetry on its own, and if you call a new user a sockpuppet without justification, they will probably be insulted and get a negative impression of Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Keep in mind there can be multiple users who are driven to start participating in Wikipedia for the same reason, particularly in controversial areas such as articles about the conflict in the Middle East, cult figures, or Wikipedia:Articles for deletion. Some have suggested applying the 100-edit guideline more strongly in such cases, assuming that all accounts with fewer than 100 edits are sock puppets. Generally, such beliefs have been shown not to be well founded.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If there is doubt, a developer can easily check to see whether accounts are related. Experience has shown that on article talk pages, including polls, the linkage is usually not supported by the information available to developers, so self-restraint in making such accusations is usually the right course.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, the rule advocates caution and points out that the assumption of sock puppetry is usually wrong. Yet two very experienced Wikipedians have suggested sock puppetry is rampant here (and/or that we are dealing with meat puppets, discussed below) and have issued delete votes with no sign they they engaged in any close consideration of this particular vote (and, I admit, no sign of a lack of such either, just a "quick" vote).</p>
<p>I can assure the administrator closing this that there are few, if any sock puppets involved on the "do not delete" side. This is NOT because I know all or most of the do not deleters. It is because the do not deleters who are first timers or have few edits and have a vested interest in Yoism have either (1) used their real names (and could thus be contacted to verify their identities and votes) or (2) self-identified themselves as Yoans and/or as people who know Yoans and have some relationship with them. This latter action would totally undermine any gain sought by sock puppetry.</p>
<p>In addition, some votes can be counted as evidence from real people even if their vote may be discounted relative to more active Wikipedians. While statements from Rich Hull, B Miller, and Todd DeLuca may not be considered authoritative enough to support an article or a statement in an article, in this case they can be used for something else. They are evidence that the fact that "our site is down" is not some bogus claim for a non-existent phenomenon. Actually, they serve as reminders that there is another source of verification of this: two years ago in a similar process, concerned Wikipedians repeatedly visited our web site and then suggested changes to the article to make it NPOV, to limit its claims (one of them edited the article to make sure it noted the small known number of active Yoans at the very beginning), and to suggest specific verification that could be added to the article (like the incorporation documents as the more authoritative <a href="../../../5/0/1/501%28c%293.html" title="501(c)3">501(c)3</a> status didn't exist then).</p>
<p>The vote from Tom Atlee, provides evidence (that can be verified because he has identified himself) of the utility of the article from a real non-Yoan who is a regular user of the Wikipedia. I know of many others who have found the article useful in that way, but Tom Atlee's vote is independent evidence of such. I don't know how often you have such information in a VfD process and so there may be no "official policy" about how to use it. But surely it should not be ignored.</p>
<p>But in some cases, when there are no or very few previous edits, we could be dealing with meat puppets. So let's turn to that issue.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Cursory votes from experienced Wikipedians versus possible meat puppets</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously, votes can be stacked by a call to a community of non-Wikipedians to participate in a Wikipedia vote. So, there is a reason to discount first time participants and to weigh the votes of experienced Wikipedians more strongly than those who have made very few edits. There are two things to consider in this regard when looking at this particular vote.</p>
<p>First, part of the reasoning for applying this rule <i>when there are at least some other unrelated prior edits by the voter</i> is to counter the sock puppet possibility. In this case, where genuine sock puppetry is probably minor to nonexistent, I think this concern should be disregarded and we should only be concerned with meat puppets. So, in the cases of users who made at least one unrelated edit <b>prior</b> to this VfD, it would be unreasonable to ignore their votes (as they are unlikely to be sock puppets) and the question remains should they be discounted relative to the votes of experienced Wikipedians.</p>
<p>I believe there is also a strong reason to be careful about invoking this aspect of policy, and/or to temper the degree to which it is used. If you look at the earlier vote two years ago, the VfD process resulted in numerous editing changes to the article. In the course of the VfD, numerous <b>non-Yoan Wikipedians</b> went to the web site to see what this Yoism thing is. They came back to the discussion and suggested and made changes to the Yoism article. Ultimately, it was decided to keep it.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It is important because there is another standard at play in almost every Wikipedia article about topics that are not subject to careful debate and publication in peer review journals. Some artiicles are allowed to stand on this other standard alone that may include no reference whatsoever to printed articles in authoritative sources. Other articles include large segments that stand on this other standard alone. And most articles have <b>some segments</b> that are only based on this standard.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Face validity: The "Apple Pie" standard found in, at least, segments of many, if not most, Wikipedia articles</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>By "face validity," I mean "when an article makes descriptive claims that are easily verifiable by any reasonable adult" (taken from the No Original Research policy). This standard is invoked when editors look at a phenomenon directly and see if the article reflects it accurately. Indeed, face validity is always employed. And this is true even when references from peer reviewed research are the basis for the article: different editors can then go and look at the peer reviewed publication and see if the description in the Wikipedia article comports with it. That is, all Wikipedia articles are ultimately based on "convergent face validity," i.e., wording that converges on an agreed upon description of some phenomenon outside of the Wikipedia that editors each experience directly. When there is peer reviewed research, convergent face validity is the standard by which the article is judged to accurately reflect that research. When there is only convergent face validity---i.e., the apple pie standard "when an article makes descriptive claims that are easily verifiable by any reasonable adult"---editors ensure that the article comports with what they as a group have directly experienced and, by logical extension, assume that "any reasonable adult" could also verify.</p>
<p>In applying face validity---whether there are external publications to support the article (and the face validity is used to judge whether the article accurately desciribes what can be found there) or when only the face validity of the apple pie standard is in play---the editors must always be able to directly experience some external phenomenon and then edit an article so that the words comport with their collective experience of the external phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition to whatever publications may be referenced to support an article, I would suggest that many if not most legitimate Wikipedia articles are at least partly dependent on the apple pie standard. For one example, consider the many <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> articles, where you can easily spot thousands of theories/beliefs/statements that are unsubstantiated by any references beyond the editors' opinions (and it may be ages before there are published references addressing more than a handful of these cultural theories/beliefs). Here are five examples, taken from one small section of the main <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> article):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cartman is "often the funniest" (I agree.)</li>
<li>Kyle is the "most easily persuadable" (Most easily of who? Certainly not Butters.)</li>
<li>Butters is "repressed by his overbearing and oppressive parents" (I agree)</li>
<li>Barbrady is "incompetent" (I agree)</li>
<li>Satan is "insecure" (I agree)</li>
</ul>
<p>But, some people would claim, my agreement (or yours, or other editors) is not to be the measure of whether a claim should be in the article; that's "the Sin of Original Research" (pun intended). After all, we are only editors. But where will you find "peer reviewed" articles to support the zillions of such cultural claims/judgments/descriptions that can be found in these articles? Nowhere. The idiosyncratic inaccuracies in such claims are corrected by other editors based on their examination of the evidence (i.e., their experience viewing South Park).</p>
<p>Now some of the specific statements above can probably actually be found in published external works. Yet the South Park articles are filled with many thousands of such claims, the vast majority of which have not been verified and will never be verified by specific citations in published works. It is simply clear that despite the fact that South Park has a healty "External links" section, not more than a <b>tiny, tiny</b> fraction of the thousands of specific claims made in the main and related South Park articles can be verified by its external links.</p>
<p>It is the face validity of these innumerable, unreferenced claims that can be and ultimately is judged by the Apple Pie standard, i.e., easily discernable, community agreement about the face validity of the statements or what any reasonable adult can verify by, in this case, watching South Park. Indeed, I edited one of the descriptions of an aspect of South Park using my judgment and participated in the process of moving the article's descriptions closer and closer to one the community of editors can agree on and thus what a "reasonable adult could be expected to be able to verify." It is not <b>my judgment</b> (which would be original research) that is the standard, but rather the face validity that is established by the judgments of many editors input that ensure that the wording "evolves" into something agreed upon, and is thus likely to be something that could be verified by any reasonable adult.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Back to Yoism</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>One of the reasons that deletion was suggested for the Yoism article two years ago was that some editors thought it might be a hoax or a joke. Editors then went to the Yoism website and easily discerned that it was not a hoax or joke (though some may have found it to be laughable, that's not the point). That is, they were able to use face validity to ensure that any reasonable adult could verify that it was not a hoax or a joke and thus eliminated that concern.</p>
<p>This is the point. They were able to determine directly that any reasonable adult could be expected to verify that Yoism is a fairly well developed religious belief system that has undergone considerable development and is sufficiently different enough from other religions to demonstrate the existence of a phenomenon that may be of interest to Wikipedia readers. They still insisted on having some independent basis upon which to conclude that the phenomenon described in the article was not simply vanity and that it existed in the awareness of a discernable segment of the human population, not just in the Wikipedia. They got this from the incorporation documents, eventually from the Boston Globe article, and, in part, from the web site itself, which referenced events that had occurred in specific locations and times, such as meetings and presentations at Brown University (which was also documented in the Globe article in the interview segment with Rich Hull).</p>
<p>Thus, the article was kept because there was a combination of external verification AND apple pie face validity of the phenomenon. This combination is employed, in part, in almost all Wikipedia articles that are not about topics that are typically researched and/or described in print publications or topics for which that process has just begun, including many new cultural developments affecting only a subsection of society.</p>
<p>In this regard, please reconsider the "cursory" votes of the experienced Wikipedians versus those who have made fewer edits. Though some do not delete votes come from fairly experienced Wikipedians, a few highly experienced Wikipedians have voted for deletion. Yet, none of those highly experienced voters have had the ability to visit the web site and see what the phenomenon described briefly in the artilce refers to. All of the Wikipedians---including non-Yoans---who have voted on this page to keep the article have done so. I am suggesting that an important source of a type of external verification (of the apple pie sort) was available to all Wikipedians two years ago (albeit in a more primitive form) and is currently temporarily unavailable because of the activity of a hacker.</p>
<p>This leads me back to my original concern: that this repeat VfD process was not deemed necessary for two years until shortly after our site went down and the ability to take a closer look at what Yoism is was missing. That is, regardless of the limited nature of the external verification, others who came across our article could easily verify that Yoism:</p>
<ul>
<li>has significant (though limited) external validation including at least: incorporation, an independent article in a major newspaper, 501(c)3 status that requires rigorous extensive documentation (and did not exist two years ago), and (up until the hacker caused us to close our site) a significant web presence of many thousands of hits in response to a Google search</li>
<li>has a well-developed religious belief system that has undergone considerable development</li>
<li>is sufficiently different enough from other religions to demonstrate the existence of a phenomenon that may be of interest to Wikipedia readers</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the current context, the unexplained, brief (which is what I mean by "quick" or cursory) deletion votes by very experienced Wikipedians should be seen in the light that they could not employ this very simple process to add any face validity apple pie to their decision. Would they have visited our web site if they could? I would hope they would have a least taken a brief peek. But one thing we do know: When the web site was available and we went through this process before, the experienced Wikipedians did take a look and were satisfied that there was something there. When experienced Wikipedians could visit our site PLUS they could examine some external evidence (now with the 501c3 status and a much more signficant web presence that should account for at least something) they reached a decision to keep.</p>
<p><b>In Summary</b></p>
<p>When counting or discounting votes based on experience, please keep in mind that <b>all of the votes to delete</b> (including those by a few very experienced Wikipedians) were made without benefit of the data that, two years ago led experienced Wikipedians to a decision to keep. Thus, we must bear in mind the following two points (which are true as the five day period for this VfD nears an end):</p>
<p><b>One: All (100%) of the "Delete" votes that come from folks with ANY edits, come from folks with more than 2,000 edits, and these same folks are also folks who have never visited the web site that was a crucial factor in the decision to keep made two years ago, which also involved experienced Wikipedians.</b></p>
<p><b>Two:</b> Wikipedia administrators and folks with over 2,000 edits are not your average Wikipedia user or even your average Wikipedian. Though administrators are a varied lot and often disagree about many things, there must be ways in which such a high level of commitment and participation introduces some bias into what an encyclopedia should be. And surely, as an open source enclyclopedia for the world, input from non-editor users and editors who are not highly involved editors of the administrator degree must not be ignored. <b>In this VfD, all (100%) of the votes that come from editors with at least one and less than 2000 PRIOR, UNRELATED edits are "Do Not Delete."</b></p>
<p>Based on these facts, a final decision to delete would mean that, even if you are an editor, if you do not have a huge number of prior edits---even if you have access to information that those with more than 2,000 edits do not have and which, in the past, Wikipedians much more experienced than you found to be important in making this decision, and even if you spell out your reasoning in detail---your vote may be ignored in favor of the votes of super-experienced users who give little or no justification for their votes (other than invoking a rule), and thus showed no sign of careful investigation of this particular article. It would be a message that we have created a new elite in which only those with an extraordinarily high level of participation will have their voices heard in what is ostensibly an open source project that invites all users to participate.<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKriegman_fe46.html" title="User:Kriegman">Kriegman</a> 17:55, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. Zoids Zero is an actual anime series, part of the <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids">Zoids</a> franchise. The series would be better known in Western viewing circles as simply "Zoids". The article does require a hell of a lot of work, but could be made into a workable article. Worst case scenario, merge it with the main <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids">Zoids</a> article <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 04:59, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>On second thoughts...</b> the article should be at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Zoids%7E_New_Century_Zero_a593.html" title="Zoids: New Century Zero">Zoids: New Century Zero</a>, with a redirect from Zoids Zero to this article. I will continue to edit the article at its current location, and once this debate is closed, I will move the article to the new location. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 05:09, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As soon as a result for this AfD comes in, and some of my other commitments clear up, I plan to give <a href="../../../c/h/a/Zoids%7E_Chaotic_Century_90e3.html" title="Zoids: Chaotic Century">Zoids: Chaotic Century</a> a good overhaul <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 09:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
