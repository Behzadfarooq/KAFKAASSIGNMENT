<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> to delete these, and no compelling policy reason to delete despite the lack of consensus.

<li>Well, not every asteroid that exists has an article yet (with 100K+ and counting, it obviously takes time).

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Let me address the concerns one by one:
<ul>
<li>«&#160;These are simply placeholder articles with no actual information.&#160;» Wrong: the fact that these asteroids have as yet no permanent names *is* information (to quote Einstein, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).</li>
<li>«&#160;Asteroids 100000 to 140000 could probably stand to all be merged into one article.&#160;» Perhaps, but eventually they will become large enough (see the first few of the list, such as <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names_%281-1000%29.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names (1-1000)">Meanings of asteroid names (1-1000)</a>) that they'll need to be split again. Managing such a large list with a varying chunk size would be a major pain.</li>
<li>«&#160;All of this information (for asteroids that actually exist) can be found in the articles on those asteroids.&#160;» It is extremely unlikely (and certainly unnecessary) that *each* asteroid will ever get an article. The overwhelming majority of minor planets are just uninteresting chunks of rock, which don't deserve more than an entry in one or more master lists such as this one. Suggesting that individual articles be created systematically would lead to much more clutter than keeping the current arrangement of lists.</li>
<li>«&#160;A link to the relevant external database would be the correct way to handle this kind of information.&#160;» Bull. The {{<a href="../../../m/p/c/Template%7EMPCit_JPL_4f35.html" title="Template:MPCit JPL">MPCit_JPL</a>}} database is as yet incomplete, with no guarantee of ever including the "citations" preceding the time (roughly, mid-1940s) when the MPC citation procedure was put into place. Furthermore, there is no way to see the meanings together (MPCit_JPL lists only one asteroid at a time). And you never know when it will break (see {{<a href="../../../m/p/c/Template%7EMPCit_MPES_e1e3.html" title="Template:MPCit MPES">MPCit_MPES</a>}} for a current example). The Wiki entries in this list are also usually more complete than the raw citations (links to Wiki content, miscellaneous precisions added, and so forth), not to mention that they've been reworked in order to avoid any copyright issues.</li>
<li>«&#160;Delete the ones that say 'There are as yet no named asteroids in this span of numbers'. They'll be redlinks in <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names">Meanings of asteroid names</a>, which won't do any harm.&#160;» Neither would keeping these short articles, so why delete 'em, just to be forced to re-create them when the next batch of namings comes out of the Minor Planet Center? Leaving red links does do harm, because it leaves the reader with a doubt: are these articles missing because there are no names to explain, or because they haven't been written yet?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To summarise, I understand the temptation to collapse the shorter articles into broader-spanned ones, but I must insist on the logistic nightmare this would represent. I suspect none of the 'deleters' that have piped up above have contributed one iota to the enormous amount of on-going work these pages represent. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 18:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The first articles in this series only represent 500 asteroids, it is only after #5000 that they are in groups of a thousand. What I am merely suggesting is that at a certain point, the articles start being group by, say, five or ten thousands. As it stands, even someone interested in the subject will find themselves very frustrated to think they're getting information when they're not. A redlink simply says "sorry, put we don't have any information on this yet", but a bluelink implies that there's information to be had. Empty bluelinks mislead and waste time.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 22:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - wikipedia is not paper. If they are meaningful articles to somebody who knows something about the topic, I assume they are verifiable and will be expanded. I trust the editor to have thought about the articles and the scheme for the articles and I support his efforts. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 19:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - The information is relevant and if deleted, cannot be found in any other articles (as of right now), therefore the above mentioned articles should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b> Urhixidur summed up my view on this matter quite well. The only possible variation I would add to this is the possiblity of adjusting the group sizes and although logistically a pain, readjusting them as more names are accepted and assigned. Note that there is a limit to the number of names per astronomer or group can submit, 2 per month. With some groups discovering 100's of SSSBs in a month, in many cases it is quite possible, many will never recieve names. The lack of name or more importantly when a SSSB recieves its name in comparison to when it was discovered, or if it is ever given a name, will help show the degree of importance that either the group or individual astronomy placed on it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../a/b/y/User%7EAbyssoft_07bf.html" title="User:Abyssoft">Abyssoft</a> 05:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small><b>Delete</b>. Lists like this <i>would</i> be useful and encyclopedic if they had something in them. But for all the articles currently listed the main content as "There are as yet no named asteroids in this span of numbers." In other words, there is nothing here to describe the meaning of. No prejudice whatsoever against recreation once we get at least one named asteroid in the span of numbers so that there is something to put here. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, because there are no asteroids with those numbers. They will soon be some asteroids in the near future, but in the meantime, they have no use, so I don't have a reason why they should be kept for now.

<li><b>keep</b>There surely will be content for all in time, and some have it already. Given the prior pages in the series, it should be continued, and I can not see why anyone would object to setting up this small number of pages in advance.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Urhixidur and DGG. See how out of about 140 such lists of largely mundane asteroids, there's only 14 which have not yet acquired links, and they're mostly the newest numbered asteroids. Names will certainly come. Merging them to make less articles but with huuuge lists of many thousands in each is too cumbersome. Imagine looking for asteroid 123456 in a list from 100 to 140 thousand. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 18:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> — I'm all for keeping even relatively obscure astronomy articles, but these pages have no value in my mind. There are an infinite number of asteroid numbers with no names assigned.

<li><b>A proposal</b> - Some good points were raised in this discussion, albeit in cavalier fashion by the "deletist camp". I'm thinking now that we should rework the entire <i>Meanings of asteroid names</i> series in a way similar to what has been done with the <i>List of asteroids</i> itself: parcel the meanings out into blocks of 100 entries in sub-pages, which would in turn be displayed within "holder pages". The difference from the <i>List of asteroids</i> pages lies in their varying size. As has been noted, the early pages are pretty much topped off, whereas the pages at the bottom of the list are very thin indeed. Because of the required flexibility (which must not complicate the logistics, I insist), this will require some preparatory thinking on my part. What I'd like to know, before I expend my grey matter in this way, is whether this seems like the right way to go? <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 03:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about just merging the information from the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meanings_of_asteroid_names.html" title="Meanings of asteroid names">Meanings of asteroid names</a> lists into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> lists? It seems the original lists of asteroid have room to spare.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 07:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here's why I think such a merge would not work. I've tried to keep the "List of asteroids" as language-neutral as possible: about the only language-sensitive column is the "Location" one, and I've tried to use the local name as far as possible (since they're redirected to the English entries anyway). Such language-neutrality is, obviously, impossible with the "Meanings" explanations. The unstated goal was to make the "List of asteroids" a sort of Wikisource set, or at least something which could be, very nearly, cut and pasted into other-language Wikipedias. Once you understand this perspective, the organisation of the lists (and the heavy use of templates) should make a lot more sense. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 22:35, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
