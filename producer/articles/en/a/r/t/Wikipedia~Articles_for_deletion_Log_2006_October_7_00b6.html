<dd><b>Comment about the 17th</b> I would like to call to your attention that Cleveland is a city with high-rise buildings, and a 17th tallest building there is a landmark that would stand out in the vast majority of the cities in this world. When I came up with this 17th tallest building argument it was not my intention to assert the notability on the grounds of that particular number but in the fact that it's a big building in a city with big buildings.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 04:17, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> now this is actually a half-decent argument for notability but before I'd change my vote I'd want an argument why the first streetlight makes the building notable as opposed to it making the city of Cleveland notable (since streetlights are located, er, on the street). If McGinney's questions below regarding architectural uniqueness (or at least interest) could arrive at a real answer, I'd consider changing my vote based on that + it having first streetlight in front of it, but I think it NEEDS an argument for architectural or historical interest on it's own, not just because of what's on the sidewalk outside. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 13:33, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1. Non-notable building,

<dd>Firstly it can be seen in an architectural context of skyscraper building being built in the same year as the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seagram_building.html" title="Seagram building">Seagram building</a>. "The Seagram building (and virtually all large buildings of the time) was built of a steel frame" - this building is notable at least because according to emporis "The first 10 floors are framed in steel, the upper 12 floors are reinforced concrete." - I wonder why? (Fire code for the bottom floors? Structural rationale? Environmental control? Impact upon the urban environment - were old street patterns destroyed by the building) - What place does this building play in the developing work of Carson Lundin &amp; Shaw's architecture - this article has interesting questions that could be addressed - It's just the article isn't doing it yet.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at WP:BIO, and given his profession and activities, the relevant clause seems to be "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person."

So the article has no info on that, and given the evidence, I would vote to delete. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article subject is a very minor actress who has had various bit parts - only some of which were notable enough for IMDB (e.g. "Girl No.1" in the movie Tootsie). Theatre career details contain no claims about notability and no verification. Claims that she wrote two books are based on nothing - zero hits for the two book titles with her name (trying both Millett and Danaher) on google and amazon<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=danaher+%22So+Many+Detours%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=danaher+%22So+Many+Detours%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mallory+millett+%22Fatherless+Child%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mallory+millett+%22Fatherless+Child%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mallory+millett+%22So+Many+Detours%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mallory+millett+%22So+Many+Detours%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=danaher+%22Fatherless+Child%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=danaher+%22Fatherless+Child%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/103-0704999-1879805?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=mallory+millett&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/103-0704999-1879805?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=mallory+millett&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[17]</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-0704999-1879805?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mallory+danaher&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-0704999-1879805?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mallory+danaher&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

(And I'm sorry but I have to say that the photos on the photo website linked in the article are quite nice but not believably of a professional gallery exhibition standard in terms of content or theme).

The other was an insurance industry magazine obituary about Mallory's <i>mother</i>, who was one of the first female insurance agents (does not seem to be encyclopedically notable).

<li><b>Comment</b> For what its worth, she writes (and does photography) under the name of Mallory Jones, which is why you couldn't find any record of her works under the name of Millet or Danaher (one of them does show up at Amazon, which is why I added to the article. For what it's worth, I'm not a strong advocate of keeping it, I'm just an editor who likes to try to improve articles I come across while new page patrolling, rather than automatically deleting them. I'm a little bit bothered, though, by putting so much emphasis on Ghits...that's not even remotely a criteria for notability, although being a published author is. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 01:34, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>While I understand the wariness about the google test, I would also emphasize that being a "published author" is <i>not</i> sufficient grounds in itself for encyclopedic notability. Also a listing on Amazon or an ISBN does not guarantee that a book is published by a legit publisher or even if it exists. (Its not that hard to get an ISBN or an Amazon listing... its probably even easier than getting on IMDB.) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:03, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I checked out the <a href="http://www.malloryjones.com" class="external text" title="http://www.malloryjones.com" rel="nofollow">Mallory Jones photo</a> site. Sorry again but this is just not believable professional photographic art - the website is very amateurish and the photos, while nice, are all of themes like sunset, sunrise, flowers and animals (e.g. "Ducks" - a set which includes several birds which are, well... not ducks) and vacation snaps ("Spring Break '06", "Montana Trip 2005"). She labels one set of quite standard sunset photos "Armageddon" and that's about as edgy as it gets.

<p>Removed prod on this, mainly because it has been an article for a long time, and the group seems like it might be notable. I can't tell quickly if the group really isn't notable, or if the article just isn't giving them a proper treatment in that area. Looking for community input.

These are hoaxes, some of which have lain here undetected since May 2006. They claim to be plot elements from a book entitled <i>The Chronicles of Zalfos</i>. Searching Amazon turns up no books by that or any similar title. Google Web turns up nothing, either. The articles link to a web page on a free web page site that tells us that the title is in fact <i>The Serpent of Zalfos</i>. Amazon doesn't have that, either, or indeed any books by M. Gremillion at all. Most tellingly, <i>even the purported vanity press</i>, Inkwater Press (a.k.a. First Books), that the web page claims publishes these books, comes back empty handed when asked for these titles.

<dd><b>Keep</b>, this appears to be a section split off from the original article. Almost all articles on TV series and movies where there have been multiple releases of the media have a section exactly on this topic. As <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellsing.html" title="Hellsing">Hellsing</a> is a very popular anime and manga series both in Japan and in the United States, there are all sorts of various releases of it, including all the volumes of the manga and various formats and versions of the TV series and movies. Thus, it was split into a second article to be more reader-friendly rather than covering the original article with this list-like information. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 03:47, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>"Lists of episode titles, manga volumes, voice actors, theme songs, etc., should be placed towards the end of the article. If these lists take up a large amount of space, consider moving them to a separate page titled List of (series) media. Other list-type information (such as soundtracks that do not merit individual articles) should also be placed on this page. For an example implementation see Cowboy Bebop and List of Cowboy Bebop media."</p>
<p>It states that we should have a seperate page for the Hellsing media rather than having it take up all that room on the main page. So what's the problem? --- <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod-Emperor_985d.html" title="User:God-Emperor">Hellspawn</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, like a discography for an artist or an episode list for a series, it's a nice index of related material.

<li><b>Keep</b> for all the reasons stated above. Many TV series articles have episode listings, and many manga series have chapter listings.

Furthermore, this statement "it provides no useful information to readers, as it as absolutely zero prose." is pretty ridiculous. I know from browsing forums that many people find the list useful.

<p>This article was previously deleted as a prod, and was recreated, which seems to mean someone disputes it; so I'm taking it to AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe it's too early for Foe Pa to have its own article, but I also believe it's too early to claim that they are not notable enough for Wikipedia. They seem like a local improv group who have just branched out to an internet show. I watched it, and it certainly has potential, but it's not yet at the point to have its own article. Since it just started this last week, it needs time to build an audience (how much of an audience did <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestar_Runner_f289.html" title="Homestar Runner">Homestar Runner</a> have when it started?). Once it builds an audience and gets some outside sources talking about it, then I hope someone will be able to recreate this article. - <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperlex_32b0.html" title="User:Superlex">Lex</a> 03:47, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all it's (Flag Football) sponsored by the NFL at many levels! Secondly the bulk of our players played NCAA college football, as have teams who compete competitively nation wide. Winning the longest game in USFTL "United States Flag &amp; Touch Football League" history is why I believe it truly deserves retention. I see other teams &amp; sports listed as well. Most cities across the USA have competitive teams &amp; frankly after playing 4 years of Division I-AA College ball, Flag is more dangerous. Guys often suffer more injuries because you fly around full speed with no pads &amp; defenders collide, linemen physically "strong arm" each other on full speed pass rushes and so on! So you can push for deletion, but one should respect the game &amp; those who play it I guess. Save the girly touch and tennis lessons - It's physical. Just being honest and friendly, but if we need to add more flag football (how to play) detail about the game, then certainly we can do that too!</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Article is currently tagged as a copyvio, so probably should be processed through that means rather than here (two parallel processes can muck up the works). However, if the copyright issues can be resolved, keep, as subject is notable, both as an author published by a major publishing house and as a film producer. If article is deleted under the copyvio process, it should be able to be recreated as original text appropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 04:16, 7 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether del or keep, two parallel processes are desirable despite the effort of keeping them from being mucked up (and perhaps i should have facilitated coordination, tho those closing either will see on the article page, and be aware of, the other):
<ol>
<li>Copyvio processing of the individual article is a legal obligation of WP. It is also a Good Thing for WP in the long run, as part of a pattern of overall care re copyright issues. Both of these remain true even if AfD's lopsided presumption of retention results in keeping.</li>
<li>Copyvio deletion is deletion w/o prejudice, while AfD deleteion is with prejudice &amp; impedes re-creation if the copyvio issues are resolvable. (Which is in fact likely, altho not so certain that we can ignore the damage to WP's copyvio reputation that accepting the slipshod efforts to (irrelevantly) "grant permission" would do.) In light of the perhaps clueless and in any case <s>nasty</s> misbehaving IP, AfD deletion will get this sick puppy off our front door step more effectively than simple copyvio deletion.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have no opinion re: this article, but keeping it because two notable musicians confer notability is fallacious. One could still pick an article in which to house the information, such as is done with articles like Suri Holmes Cruise - a collaboration between two notable individuals if ever there was one.

<li><b>Comment</b> We may have a copyvio problem. The article is mostly copied from <a href="http://www.waningmoon.com/gothica/articles/6660103.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.waningmoon.com/gothica/articles/6660103.shtml" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Gothica</a>. That's not a GFDL-licensed site. It says "Contributed by Summer Bowman" at the bottom, so it's self-promotion. This is probably a problem that can be fixed with more editing; the article has already started to diverge from the copied text. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:14, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Firstly, in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it is stated that an artist should release <i>two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable)</i>. It fails to meet this criteria (and other criterias as well) as the artist in question has only released one album so far and the other two albums are just singles. Secondly, a <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Rob64&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Rob64&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=title&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">google search</a> provides almost no links to the subject in question (correct me if I am wrong about this).

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. We have 4 delete/1 merge/1 keep/1 comment which has arguments for the retention, so this is in discretion area. I am calling this a delete decision, although evidence is sufficient to show that it is not a neologism invented here on Wikipedia, there is no evidence that this law or phrase has any widespread or popular use. As such, I cannot see that sufficient evidence for the term's notability has been provided. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_values.html" title="News values">news values</a>. I've heard the "law" mentioned here in Australia in a journalism context, though not as "McLurg's Law", and with different proportions to those mentioned. "McLurg" might just be a journalism student who started the article. Or perhaps it was an editor who decided to convince some new underlings that he was particularly insightful.

<li>It's unlikely that the name of the law has anything at all to do with Wikipedia editors, given that the documents mentioning the law, cited in the references section of the article, pre-date the very existence of Wikipedia by several years. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, the name does seem to appear in an independent article.

<li><b>Keep with modifications if necessary</b>. At least for a while. This is a touchy area, particularly for indexing. At least three index labels seem to apply to the entire area with plenty of conflict between "trade" and "academic" applications.
<ul>
<li><i>News Values</i> From a journalist or editors prospective - sifting through potential news stories and rejecting most based on low news value. Selecting only stories that offer high “news values” improves circulation/audience. Since the profit to the media comes from monetizing that circulation/audience base there is a strong motivation to select content that maximizes News Value.</li>
<li><i>Gatekeeping</i> - perhaps a broader, more academic topic.</li>
<li><i>Journalism – Objectivity</i> This an index entry applied to the main academic article used to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_value" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_value" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_value</a>. Again, this may be broader in the “objectivity” sense but more narrow or more “professional/trade” in the “journalism” sense.</li>
<li>To further complicate maters most of the content on the News Values page is from cognitive psychology/perception/mind-brain research, etc. The "street smart" application of which is called, in the news trade, "news value."<a href="../../../r/j/l/User%7ERjlabs_97b2.html" title="User:Rjlabs">Rick</a> 16:24, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This seems like one of those situations where someone could be quite notable and google wouldn't be that helpful.

I checked <a href="http://www.lulu.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.lulu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/</a> and it's a "self-publishing" company specialising in "print-on-demand". There is no sales rank and there are no reviews, so it's even possible, with print-on-demand, that only a few review copies of this novel have ever been printed. The page was created by a user called "crommers", which name makes me think that this was the author himself. He has made no other edits to Wikipedia.

<p>Angela Beesley is not a notable individual, especially since she left the Foundation. On its own this would not be enough to justify renomination for deletion (as it has failed several other listings under this reasoning}, but the double standard inherent in creating a bio of a non-notable person has allowed very close patrolling of this article to prevent addition of material perceived as negative (for Angela Beesley or Wikipedia) using the argument that it is not notable, while maintaining wikicruft (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;diff=78493997&amp;oldid=78486450" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angela_Beesley&amp;diff=78493997&amp;oldid=78486450" rel="nofollow">here</a>). This has made editing the article unworkable and it would be best to just accept the non-notability of Angela Beesley and delete it. Coroebus 11:16, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The argument is that the double standards in having an article for someone who isn't really notable makes maintaining the page impossible - no reasoned arguments can be had as to what aspects of the individuals biography are worth including (notable) because the subject isn't notable in the first place. --Coroebus 14:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am listing it again now as I feel that the content dispute is a direct result of the non-notability of the article subject, and is an additional reason to delete (i.e. not only is she non-notable, but that non-notability makes sourcing the article and resolving what should and shouldn't be in it impossible).

<p>As the article says: "These figures are not authoritative", "self-selected group of web users", and "may not accurately represent internet users as a whole". In any case, the date given is 6 August 2006, so it is already out-of-date. Is there an intention or possibility of updating?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can understand the interest in this actually-performed song. However WP:MUSIC/SONG appears to tie our hands. Unless perhaps it is frequently discussed in the press, that could save it. Curiously, you can hear the song at <a href="http://finefinemusic.com/media/radiohead15step090506.mp3" class="external autonumber" title="http://finefinemusic.com/media/radiohead15step090506.mp3" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> which appears to be a 'quasi-legal' download because a connection between the site and Radiohead is hinted. However, since the song is not in a released album we don't normally make an article for it, and even then, perhaps only for the album. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 16:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I initially prodded this article based on non-notability. The Prod tag failed because someone thought Casey Treat was notable. He had a local radio show in the 70s. He started a redlinked Christian Center in the 80s that had a 30 person congregation, some redlinked local Christian schools, and a redlinked lecture series. He also has authored a dozen books and audiotapes (all redlinked I presume). Maybe I am missing the notable part, so I am taking this to vote.

<p>I have expanded the article to include sections on handling and the history of asphyxiant gases. As can be seen, the article is about much more than simple asphyxia and would simply not be appropriate as a subsection of that article, which should have much more accurate information than it does now. The recognition and identification of asphyxiant gases goes hand in hand with the history of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Respirators.html" title="Respirators">respirators</a>, mine safety, and OSHA regulation of industry. There is still quite a bit that can be added to each section and I invite everyone to add what they can! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 03:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. It's still stupid. An article whose subject includes every single gas in the universe but one is too broad. If the definition of asphyxiant gas in the first sentence is wrong, then by all means, fix it so we can end this stupid debate. But if it isn't, any information in this article belongs <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">Gas</a>. We do not need a page for gases not called oxygen. What's next, List of Asphyxiant Gases? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 04:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's my take on things - first of all, it sounds like we need a rewrite of the definition if you are coming away with this understanding. Many gases that are not oxygen are toxic to humans and are not the subject of this article. The number of gases which truly are asphyxiant risks is actually quite small - in practical terms, only gases which occur naturally or are concentrated and used in industrial/scientific purposes have a chance to cause asphyxia. No one is asking for a list of asphxiant gases, so let's please avoid straw men. And, whether it makes sense to everyone or not, asphyxiant gas is a medical and industrial concept which is the subject of both medical research and industrial oversight. Opposition to an article on such an established concept should automatically, IMHO, lead to opposition to many of the pages linked to the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> main page such as <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic_asphyxia.html" title="Erotic asphyxia">erotic asphyxia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positional_asphyxia.html" title="Positional asphyxia">positional asphyxia</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing_gas.html" title="Breathing gas">breathing gas</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulmonary_agent.html" title="Pulmonary agent">pulmonary agent</a>, etc. Take a look at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathing_gas.html" title="Breathing gas">breathing gas</a> - it is the exact opposite of this article. In essence, the definition is simply a mixture of gas which contains oxygen and inert gas. The same arguments could be used in its deletion. Yet, as you can see, a nice article discussing the common breathing gases (as opposed to every single possible combination in list form) and their uses. I believe that the expansion of this to include governmental policy vis a vis asphyxiant gases and the history of asphyxiant gases now added to the article are not likely to fit well into either the <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas.html" title="Gas">gas</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> article. In short, I think that redirection/deletion is misguided. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 10:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please <i>do not rewrite the definition</i>. That definition is the best one I've seen, combining partial definitions from a handful of sources (encyclopaedias, gas suppliers, dictionaries). In the end, the article has no merit in itself - <b>It is just a gas that causes <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>!</b> but has merit in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> - <b>Some non-oxygen gases will kill you before that, so it is not all gases but 1!</b> <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 12:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will just use <i>italic</i> today! block-capitals = shouting (per norm), and emphasis vital (for brevity) - see the line below this text box as example. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a>'s new definition is fine, although the toxicity is a distraction (but correct in term of a verifiable definition). <i>I bet there's a load of toxic gases that kill you slower than Asphyxiation!</i> That's why it's such a bad article - <i>it has asphyxia at it's core</i>. As to the number of gases, you're not narrowing it down by saying natural or man-made! So, just because you've got me going now, is a vacuum an asphyxia gas? (or part-vacuum) it's non-toxic, not enough oxygen. See what I mean, it's not a property, but more a lack of life-supporting property. There's a borderline case which is interesting that I don't know the answer to - exhaled breath - does that count? <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> - you included a ref about this - about avalanches - and directing exhaled breath away from separate air intake pocket. There wasn't enough info in the online ref, and I wasn't sure if that counts, so I removed it as discussed before. Surely it's asphyxia (not gas), because it's using the oxygen, not displacing/replacing the atmosphere. I'd like to know the answer. OK, back to your comments above... as to the other articles, I'll check them tomorrow. You've done a good job justifying it, but you must know yourself it's a bit speculative, what with the overlap. regards <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 02:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really see that there's much overlap in the subjects. <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxia.html" title="Asphyxia">Asphyxia</a> is about the medical condition, and this article is about the gases which cause it. I mean, the article on asphyxia would have no buisness mentioning handling procedures for asphyxiant gases. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 04:13, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exhaled breath in a closed space actually creates a gas mixture which can be considered an asphyxiant gas. The same is true of other chemical processes in an enclosed space (such as rusting!) I'm going to be adding references soon about the oxygen and carbon dioxide amounts which are inherently dangerous in gas mixtures. I have a different (and more to the point) reference on avalanches that I was looking to add back into the article. As for a vacuum - no it causes trauma in a separate way. There are obviously always gas molecules in any vacuum, so I can see where it might be confusing. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 09:50, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(exhaled air) - sure creation, but it's also using the oxygen up (same as a fire), so it's not a displacement or dilution of the air, but a selective processing of it, hence not fitting the wording of definition (or the spirit of it), and is a borderline case. There's 2 separate cases - 1. using up the oxygen (asphyxia) vs. 2. displacement of air due to gas flow in situation (CO2 from a. fire sinking into a basement one may be sheltering in, b. porous (snow with small breathing holes) with the exhaled gas. This 10% CO2 ref I put in also comes into it - not sure why 10% lethal as logically if CO2 is an asphyxiant gas the % is irrelevant (cf. Nitrogen 78%!). This is a question for the interaction of CO2 with body that is not for me. <a href="../../../w/i/d/User%7EWidefox_7e44.html" title="User:Widefox">Widefox</a> 13:44, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Change to <b>Keep</b> and re-write with references citing the article and books this concept is used in (I see it is already going in that direction). I did some research and this energy dispersal theory was conceived by Oxford physical chemist <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Atkins_8a4f.html" title="Peter Atkins">Peter Atkins</a> sometime before 1984. His 1984 very popular book the Second Law is entirely devoted to the non-mathematical interpretation of entropy in terms of “energy dispersion.” I saw this book referenced at least five times in other books before I actually bought this book. The book is written assuming the reader has no scientific background; thus the theory is based on verbal conjectures. He conceives of a intelligent being called “Boltzmann’s Demon” who relentlessly runs around re-organizing and dispersing energy and then goes on to show how Boltzmann’s “W” from his probability equation relates to energy dispersion, which transmits via atomic vibrations and collisions and other verbal arguments. Atkins restates the second law as: “energy tends to disperse”. He states: “each atom carries kinetic energy, and the spreading of the atoms spreads the energy…the Boltzmann equation therefore captures the aspect of dispersal: the dispersal of the entities that are carrying the energy.” This is all I can add for the moment. My internet service will be down for two weeks due to phone-line rewiring issues. I’ll put a good presentation of Atkins’ theory into the article when I’m back. To summarize, I suggest we keep this article; although the concept is not mainstream and although it is only a verbal approximation, skipping over any mathematical details, I think it needs to be kept so that the novice or new student to the subject knows who started this idea. --<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 16:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, I can't see any use for this particular viewpoint except <i>perhaps</i> a couple sentences in another article: "One can roughly imagine a system's entropy as a measure of the degree to which its energy is 'spread out' or not available for useful work," etc. Unless I see evidence that this viewpoint has been adopted as the <i>primary</i> definition of entropy in a <i>significant number</i> of textbooks by <i>different authors</i> then I say we spread this article out itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> Special or General? The point is <i>not</i> that the theory of 2LOT, or of entropy, is wrong, but that it has been <u>taught</u> incorrectly (the same has been true of both theories of relativity). Entropy is taught as equaling (an increase in) chaos and disorder -- and <i>that</i> definition is patent nonsense.</li>
<li>As an aside, relativity never became what Eistein had hoped -- the great theory of everything. Within a generation, relativity was in a battle with quantum theories, with Einstein strongly opposing these theories for quite some time. Today they live side-by-side in relative (no pun) peace, although string and M-theory cast some additional doubts. (Oh, BTW, less than 120 years ago the mantra would have been, "that's like someone saying Newton was wrong about his three laws". Well, in a sense he was -- relativity better explains the same phenomena -- and yet his formulae are still used today because they are close enough for general purposes.) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 17:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- the viewpoint is worthy of note, and not OR (in the WP sense). It has been presented in journal articles, taken up as a general gloss by some chemistry textbooks, and is widespread on the web. ("Entropy can be roughly understood as disorder; or as dispersal of energy"). <i>Both</i> of these rough understandings are worth a short discussion of their usefulness, applicability and limits, and/or a discussion of how a more sophisticated understanding of entropy may require words to be specifically defined in perhaps rather non-intuitive ways. However, the place for that discussion is in the main article on entropy, and it should be possible to summarise it well in a few lines. Devoting a whole article to it here is inappropriate overkill; equally inappropriate would be to try to ghettoise all discussion of it to here.

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<p>This AfD debate has been rushed through on the basis of a new article cobbled together by "Sadi Carnot", an opponent of the ideas presented. He included extracts from the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a> article including a wildy innaccurate statement presented as though it represented the "dispersal" view which had actually been introduced to the entropy article at 03:13, 6 October 2006 by 172.129.75.141.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778159&amp;oldid=79654989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778159&amp;oldid=79654989" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778750&amp;oldid=79778159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entropy&amp;diff=79778750&amp;oldid=79778159" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> He also included an unsourced biographical claim about Lambert conceiving "of a new view" which contradicts the presentation made by Lambert on his website, so I have commented it out. I've revised the intro to give a more neutral description in line with the cited sources: this is just a start on the revision work needed to make this an accurate well sourced article. I would hope that those who based their comments on the previous article will examine the evidence and reconsider. ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:44, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Undecided</b> - First of all, I am not a Wikipedia lawyer. The only thing that interests me is the validity of the theory. As it is presented in the web pages and the peer-reviewed journal articles, "energy dispersal" is never precisely, quantitatively defined and so its relationship to entropy change is never precisely described, at least for the entropy of mixing case, which presents the deepest problem for the theory. If energy dispersal could be defined satisfactorily, the question of whether it would give the theory a more solid grounding or less, I don't know right now. If I had to bet, I would say it would not (forgive me Frank Lambert).</p>
<p>As to the question of whether to keep the article or delete it, this is a lawyers question. In my mind, if the theory has gained as much currency as some have suggested, it would be worth keeping. If not, it should be deleted. If 70 percent of the people doubt the theory of evolution, that is enough to warrant a Wikipedia article discussing their doubts, whether those doubts are well founded or not. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 04:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of notability - I've spent years studying entropy and never run into this vague notion of "entropy as energy dispersal". There are reasons why. One is that entropy is a fundamental notion that does not presuppose any concept of energy for its definition; the concept of "energy" or "Hamiltonian" applies to classical or quantum systems with time translation invariance", while "entropy" applies to <b>all</b> classical and quantum systems. So, no complete definition of entropy can refer to energy. Another is that no way of quantifying "energy dispersal" is given (at least not here), and entropy is above all a quantitative concept! In short, the explanation of entropy doesn't really explain the concept, so few people use it. I see only references to a few poorly known texts. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Baez_eb76.html" title="User:John Baez">John Baez</a> 04:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The long-standing gloss of explaining entropy as a measure of "disorder" has been used so often by proponents of ID to confuse or mislead (eg:life shows so much order, there must have been a designer, otherwise it would conflict with the second law), that it is understandable if heartfelt opponents of ID are attracted to discussions of entropy that promote a focus on the "dispersal of energy" instead. Because life (and evolution) certainly disperses energy - so it's much more obvious that if ID people try to run this argument they don't have a leg to stand on. That I think is why ID opponents are so strong about wanting to see dispersion of energy as <i>the</i> way to roughly understand entropy (and it does seem much more tangible, too). But for all the reasons discussed in Talk:Entropy:Archive4 and elsewhere, IMO the "dispersal of energy" talk is a shortcut too far. Instead, IMO the thing to stress is that the (spatial) dispersal of energy by living things far outweighs the apparent increase in their internal order as they grow. Both contribute to the accounting for the second law. "Disorder" (or "disorderedness"), if used as a gloss for entropy, has a very specific meaning, namely "the total number of microstates compatible with the macroscopic description", the microstates reflecting not only the internal orderedness, but also a single state of the external arrangement of energy too. So to anti-ID crusaders I say: you don't actually require a definition of entropy as "dispersal of energy" to knock this particular ID-sponsored confusion down. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheald_bb56.html" title="User:Jheald">Jheald</a> 23:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to be blunt, deal with it. Strawman? Red Herring? Whatever it is, it's bullshit. If you think my life revolves around the fucking crap IDists spew and that I want to find some way to explain entropy in a way that does not fit in with their delusions, then you yourself are deluded. The two discussions have nothing to do with each other (other than the strawmen erected by IDists, and apparently feared by others. Perhaps you lack the sufficient intellect to see that, but it is the case nonetheless. And quite frankly, even if the elementary teaching of entropy deals with energy dispersal, and even if this "plays" into the hands of the IDists, so fucking what? Their arguments are still wrong. One cannot simply decide that because a definition might inconveniently be used by someone else to further their inane gibberish is <i>not</i> a reason to exclude the defiition. Idiots will always find some succor for their stupidity in any theory, concept, idea, etc., you propose. Frankly, I'm tired of reading all this ooh-i'm-afraid-of-id shit.

<dd>It's a fair point that the need for a clear and accessible explanation arises when, for example, at <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_Archive_016_6cbd.html#Kinds" title="Talk:Evolution/Archive 016">Talk:Evolution/Archive 016#Kinds</a>, 22:04, 14 May 2006, <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangil_7eeb.html" title="User:Sangil">User:Sangil</a> drew on his degree in Bioinformatics to advise us that <i>"It is true the 2nd law deals mainly with energy. However, many other types of systems have used the 2nd law as a "guiding principle", since many natural phenomena appear to behave in a similiar way (i.e. that with time the disorder in a system increases). It is in this broader sense, and note in the strict energetical sense, that I refer to it."</i> In trying to improve the Evolution article to deal with such reasoning I revisited the entropy and 2nd Law articles and found that they no longer provided a useful explanation. (see <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_Archive_016_6cbd.html#Self-organization_and_entropy" title="Talk:Evolution/Archive 016">Self-organization and entropy</a> for my proposed explanation) It's certainly important that articles should be fully correct at an advanced level, but the evidence is that "energy dispersal" is a recent but well established way of introducing the topic to beginners, something which Wikipedia also needs to achieve.

<p><b>Comment:</b> Some further remarks on entropy versus energy dispersal:</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the concept of entropy is useful even in systems where energy is completely irrelevant. The concept of entropy does not logically depend on concept of energy. So, one can't explain entropy very well using "energy dispersal".</p>
<p>Conversely, one can't understand the tendency of systems towards "energy dispersal" unless one understands something called <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmholtz_free_energy.html" title="Helmholtz free energy">free energy</a>. This quantity is related to entropy, but it's not the same: it's the energy minus the temperature times the entropy.</p>
<p>If you want to know why water is a crystal (low entropy) at low temperatures, but a gas (high entropy) at high temperatures, you need to realize that the water is not maximizing its entropy. It's minimizing its free energy. So, free energy is very important in chemistry.</p>
<p>And, to see why energy tends to disperse, you need to see that this process is how a system moves towards a lower free energy.</p>
<p>So, energy dispersal might be a good way to explain <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmholtz_free_energy.html" title="Helmholtz free energy">free energy</a>, but not entropy. If some textbooks are using it to explain entropy, and this therefore merits a Wikipedia article, then I pray that the article say why this is a poor explanation, and point the reader to a better one. I can also suggest a lot of other articles on lousy explanations I've seen in textbooks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Baez_eb76.html" title="User:John Baez">John Baez</a> 15:12, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- it might be a good idea to think this all the way through: <i>If you want to know why water is a crystal (low entropy) at low temperatures, but a gas (high entropy) at high temperatures, you need to realize that the water is not maximizing its entropy. It's minimizing its free energy.</i> If at its freezing point water has low entropy, and at boiling it has high entropy, and if the issue is the difference between minimization and maximization of potential energy, then it would seem to follow that at minimum little energy is being dispersed, and at maximum much energy is being dispersed. (Of course there's a chicken and egg argument in here, I just happen to think you have them reversed, especially as external energy is required to move from min to max). In any case, this method of teaching entropy is quiter sound, a good bit moreso than an argument that an <i>attempt to measure</i> distance more accurately than at the Plank length would <i>cause</i> a black hole. &#160;;) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 23:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The claim that it comes from Entropy#Ice melting example presumably relates to a "main article" link there added by "Sadi Carnot" when he set this up as a POV fork to denigrate the approach. I've removed that link and have considerably revised this article: your suggestion of moving an improved article to another title has merit, though "pedagogical approaches" seems rather clumsy. Evidently a number of eminent authors providing textbooks for those beginning to learn about entropy don't feel that it's claptrap, though the talk here is evidence that those educated in other systems can find it hard to accept. ...<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 14:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> I would, but I'm kind of busy with academics right now... I don't forsee being able to write an article on UCR CHASS in the immediate future. I don't object in principle to an article on CHASS, but I don't think the current itteration provides an adequate starting point. However, as deleting the article might send an inappropriate signal that the subject is outlawed for future WP articles, and as the information provided would probably be replicated in some fashion in a future article anyway, I'll reluctantly support keeping it.

<li><b>Delete</b> it's hard to imagine that just last year an Alexa rank of 140,000 was enough to get a webcomic article kept. But so it was, I guess.

The article still has no references unless we count the absurd number of links to the official site (5 links to the cast page alone!). Doesn't seem to pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or our general standards today... frankly, I'm surprised it squeaked by last year. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as per Starblind. Very bad wikipedia article. Unencyclopedic, crufty, full of OR, and no real definition of what Slashdot "subculture" actually is, beyond "like internet forums in general, but more so".

<li><b>Neutral</b>: one article listing Slashdot "memes" may be useful to keep the main text clean, like the "... in popular culture" articles do.

<li>I think you're right that the local press coverage is enough for WP:BIO here. Above, I suppose though I was typing the right criterion to apply to local politicians--"significant press coverage"-- I had in my mind the more stringent standard we apply to non-politicians, viz. "The person has been the <i>primary subject</i> of multiple non-trivial published works..." (my emphasis). Though I don't think she meets that standard, I suppose the coverage of her as mayor counts as "significant" per the criterion for local politicians.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "speedy" that erased this page declared it failed "WP:WEB." However, "WP:WEB" is not a criteria for speedy deletion. The majority of negative commentators on it's overturning simply said they didn't like the site because it was negative, or because it was (they asserted) created by a banned user. However, like them or hate them, whether they were started by a banned user or by Jesus Christ, the fact remains that killing the messenger doesn't change the message. The bottom line is that Wikitruth meets all criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. One of Wikitrith's largest criticisms of Wikipedia is that pages can (and very often are) deleted without warning and leaving no trace, despite the GFDL.

<li>Websites that fail to assert notability per WP:WEB <i>are</i> subject to CSD A7 these days. However, this was introduced very recently and applying it to <i>old</i> articles with considerable history and would likely to cause debate if unilaterally removed is iffy at best, dubious at worst. CSD is primarily intended to remove <i>new</i> articles in case where it's <i>entirely</i> uncontroversial (as in "every user should know that it doesn't help to <i>create</i> articles that fail CSD, because those get deleted"). If there's even tad bit of possibility the site is at all notable, it's an AfD case. I wouldn't go enforcing the "new" A7 on old articles unless it's extremely clear-cut and there's not been significant improvement since creation.

One of the criticisms against Wikipedia centers on Jimbo Wales and the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Wikipedia%7EOffice_Actions_5803.html" title="Wikipedia:Office Actions">Wikipedia:Office Actions</a> page which deals with certain legal issues. Ted Wilkes claimed to have much legal knowledge and used this knowledge in his mud-throwing campaign against arbcom member Fred Bauder. Wilkes, who plumed himself on being one of the best and most active contributors to Wikipedia, was blocked by arbcom ruling on 19 March 2006 for one year. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ted_Wilkes#Blocked_per_arbcom_ruling" rel="nofollow">[82]</a>. Is it just mere coincidence that Wikitruth was started shortly after that date, on 20 March 2006? His alias NightCrawler had much trouble with administrator <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>, ironically wishing Angie "WikiLove," etc. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Angela/Archive1&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1751029" rel="nofollow">[83]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NightCrawler" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>. Significantly, Angela Beesley is attacked on the Wikitruth pages. Furthermore, administrator FCYTravis is one of Wikitruth's whipping boys, perhaps because Ted Wilkes had some trouble with this administrator on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENick_Adams_3fe6.html" title="Talk:Nick Adams">Talk:Nick Adams</a> page.

Wikitruth also frequently claims that too many vandals and trolls "game the system" on Wikipedia. Is it just by chance that Wilkes and his supporter <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">User:Wyss</a> frequently accused user Onefortyone of gaming the system, being a troll, the "most dangerous vandal", etc., falsely claiming that this user's edits were fabricated, unfounded, or unwarranted and therefore must be removed.

<dd>As usual, this depends on how we read multiple and non-trivial. Orlowski's piece is merely repeating the arguments he made on the Reg for the benefit of the sandal-wearing lentil-eating Grauniad readers. Wikitruth is merely a hook on which to hang this (and if you get paid by the word, it's a pretty good idea to recycle earlier work). Ebiz just regurgitates Orlowski, so that can't qualify towards multiple. The Village Voice piece is independent, and presumably non-trivial, and an unbalanced rant into the bargain. No doubt you see this as meeting WP:WEB's requirements, but I don't. So we disagree, no surprise there. However, the impossibility of this ever being NPOV means that we'll be back here again, after a decent interval, repeating exactly the same arguments. "Avoid writing or editing articles about [Wikipedia], since we all find objectivity especially difficult when we ourselves are concerned."

<dd>Tawker, I think that speedy deleting it, speedy deleting the redirects, salting the article, and especially speedy deleting the talk page and then remaining silent about it on wiki until it was restored really hurt this AFD. Before you did that, not that many people were paying attention to the artcle and then suddenly the news of what you did spread everywhere and lots of people came to vote to keep it. So the actions hurt your cause and you would have done better by AFDing it through process.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 11:31, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Full of original research with poor sourcing (seems to be using slashdot posts and spinoff slashdot troll sites only). <u>The article does not show how the "Slashdot trolling phenomena" (such as "crapflooding" (I'm sure far more of this happens on wikipedia than slashdot), anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, plagiarism, flamewars, "karma whores" (many web forums/communities have a comment scoring system)) described here are substantively unique and distinct from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">trolling</a> phenomena elsewhere</u>. Claim that Slashdot has particularly "bizarre and complex" subculture is ungrounded (and incidentally compared to what? <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birder.html" title="Birder">Birdwatching</a>?) Memes described are ephemeral in content and unsourced ("Hot grits", "Stephen King is dead"). There is no claim for encyclopedic notability here.</p>

It received nearly unanimous <b>Keep</b> votes, roughly in the range of 95% with extremely high voter turnout. Please consider this precedent and the fact that the Wikipedia community considered it poor form to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_Nigger_Association_of_America_f69d.html" title="Talk:Gay Nigger Association of America">list articles on AFD multiple times</a>. Furthermore, if a person <i>does</i> insist on skirting this guideline by re-AFDing an article that had a strong <b>Keep</b> consensus, it's expected that he will at least link to the previous AFD so it doesn't appear he's trying to sneakily cover up the previous AFD. 4.253.43.8 17:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>1) I did check through the talk page (too hastily) and did not see the previous VfD (the general practice now is to highlight these in a colour shaded box - I was looking for one of those; also the link to the afd nomination screen from the afd tag led to a blank screen rather than the first AfD, so this also led me to assume there were no previous ones.). My bad. 2) Please see <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> - which is an actual official policy as opposed to the made-up "guideline that I'm skirting" which you suggest is implied by the GNAA talk page (I disagree than such notion is implied, and certainly not as a guideline). Please also see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Also, I don't consider a second nomination "multiple times" (I also think GNAA (which has been nominated 18 times or something) should continue to be open to afds). It's also been more than 2 years since the vfd, so its not like we haven't given the article time to improve or people haven't been adding to the article (there's actually been a few hundred edits since then).

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to come clean why I feel we should keep this article: plain and simple, its just a fun and fascinating read. Honestly, this kind of article is a great example of why I love wikipedia - we don't mind a page of subculture munitiae. As more and more of our lives and interactions move online, the history and culture of our experiences become depressingly ephemeral and temporary. I ran into this recently with an obscure opensource game I've played for a few years (MAngband) - I decided it was time for an article about it (its been around for coming up on a decade) and was saddened to find that old archives of the early-days-development mailing lists had eventually been deleted and the site they were on closed. Is it obscure? Yes. Does the Greater Populace really care? Nope. But it was and is a small but persisting phenomena that has had an impact on a small, quite group. How sad it would be to think that so many of these things, on a larger scale, suddenly vanish from all lasting knowledge with the click of a mouse button at a webhost. Is the article clunky and messy? Then let's commit to cleaning it up! The quirky, funny, and oddly interesting subculture that arose in a community of hundreds of thousands of people is certainly worth keeping with us. <a href="../../../d/x/c/User%7EDxco_460c.html" title="User:Dxco">Dxco</a> 03:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is kind of depressing to me.

<dd>Yes, you can go to Slashdot and see that people are trolling this way. But here's the thing: Slashdot postings are basically unrelated instances of random happenstances. They don't necessarily interrelate with the bigger picture. Anyone could post a couple of postings there over a time, come here, and claim it's a "minor trolling phenomenon". Thus, we can't really use Slashdot itself because <i>correlation doesn't mean causality:</i> To determine whether the trolling phenomenon is <i>notable</i> and <i>specific to Slashdot</i>, we'd need to draw <i>educated, weighted conclusions</i> based on a lot of Slashdot comments, which is <i><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></i>. In Wikipedia we don't draw educated, assertive conclusions, just simple deductive conclusions based on <i>already</i> published research. You could probably do this if the body of work was entirely available in simple form (as in "a moderate amount of postings that aren't edited, purged, and made disappear automatically by most peoples' browsing settings"), and drew only simple conclusions ("there's 2000 articles that have the GNAA spam, as anyone can plainly see"), but in current form, this demands too much from the reader who wants valid, easily verifiable information. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Keeping information on trolling is very difficult. Websites go down, links get lost, troll posts get deleted. Regardless if you read any of the trolltalk archives it is pretty apparent that trolling slashdot is definately a phenomenon and definately occurs. With trolling you can't really hope for external sources from the community being trolled because people documenting the trolling usually are heavily involved in the communities. In this case much of the trolling is immediately verifiable via trolltalk.

Even leaving aside the questionable acceptance of information from self-proclaimed trollers, this counts as unreliable original research which is not verifiable because of its unreliablity.

<dd>Yes, yes, if a group of people get together, think up an imbecile name for their group and then insist on behaving like idiots as much as possible and as long as possible and go out of their way to irritate as many other people as possible, at some point they may be "successful" enough to get some media coverage for being a minor irritating pop culture phenomenon thats marginally and debatably notable enough for a wikipedia article.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The precedent for TV episode articles is generally to keep them. The reason this is a weak keep is that the current article is a sub-sub-stub and could use more information, such as at least a plot outline. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:24, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Needs a little work, like a Trivia section and possibly a screenshot later on, but should be kept as pretty much every other major drama series has individual episode pages.--<a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodenamecuckoo_7488.html" title="User:Codenamecuckoo">Codenamecuckoo</a> 10:57, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Many other TV shows that were on primetime BBC One, like Doctor Who etc. had their own episode pages, and it is a very popular television programme, with millions of viewers. The article has also grown now, and has a lot more detail, including a photo and plot information. So, I think we should keep this article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidone_161a.html" title="User:Davidone">David</a> 15:08, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There's a good start and room for improvement.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article is developed, and it would be unfair to remove this but not other articles for individual episodes of popular television series'. I agree with <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> that a better naming convention for TV shows would be preferable. Most, if not all individual episode entries for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">Stargate SG-1</a> follow a convention, with the name of the series in parentheses appearing after the name of the episode. --Sparked1985 02:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is nothing there. And, I already have an issue with articles about individual episodes of television shows unless they have a significant importance. Regardless, the article title ("The Best Day Ever") seems quite misleading. I'm certain almost anyone looking for an article entitled "The Best Day Ever" would not be looking for an article on a Spongebob episode, but rather an article about the best calendar day ever (not that I think there should be such an article). If the episode does indeed air and has some level of significance, the article can be re-created at that time. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 21:47, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Should be relocated to a wikiproject or talk page as it is a good reference list for investigating articles to be written about notable graffiti crews/posses. Someone should start a graffiti crews category sorted by nationality just as there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graffiti_artists" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graffiti_artists" rel="nofollow">graffiti artists category</a> functioning properly on wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMediaClemz_b947.html" title="User:MediaClemz">MediaClemz</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Should be merged with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_graffiti_artists.html" title="List of graffiti artists">List of graffiti artists</a>, under the new title 'list of graffiti artists and graffiti groups. A very similar debate arose over the artists page, the result was no consensus (keep). I feel most of the arguments for that page would be very similar for this page... <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterPartyOn_f48c.html" title="User:PeterPartyOn">PeterPartyOn</a> 05:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Furthermore, pages such as these with many red links should not be seen as a waste of space, but as an opportunity for growth. I understand the need to delete articles, however I think some people are very hasty when it comes to deletion, especially towards graffiti articles for some reason. Instead of deleting like mad men... try and turn some of the red links into the blue links, that's what we're here for...<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterPartyOn_f48c.html" title="User:PeterPartyOn">PeterPartyOn</a> 06:04, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's part of the problem, though. The red links encourage people to create these articles, when in reality the articles, if they existed, would be deleted for sure. Creating them would just waste time on both ends, as Wikipedia would have to go through the deletion process, not to mention the time wasted by some poor sap writing the article. That's why articles with massive amounts of redlinks aren't generally a good thing. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:28, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what you're saying is no article on graffiti posses deserves to exist? Anyone creating one would be a sap? And by extension an article on say the CIA or Chrome Angelz (both of which are currently redlinked) is less deserving than say one on <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_Puss_e3cf.html" title="Cookie Puss">Cookie Puss</a>? Doesn't that display <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>?--<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">duncan</a> 18:15, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, let's grab three random redlinks off the list:
<ul>
<li>"<i>Cold Minded Killas</i>" or "<i>Chicago Mind Kontrol</i>" = no Google hits at all for the former, one hit for the latter, and it's a forum thread. No Google news hits fo either. No Google Books hits for either.</li>
<li>"<i>Time 4 Some Krime</i>" = one Google hit, and it's a mirror of this article. No Google news hits. No Google Books hits.</li>
<li>"<i>Yoghurt Culture Kids</i>" = one Google hit, and it's this article. No Google news hits. No Google Books hits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>None of the above meet our current standards for verifiability using <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as far as I can tell, and none would be likely to survive an AfD. Can I make the authoritative statement that "<i>no article on graffiti posses deserves to exist</i>"? No, I cannot. But anybody going through that list and writing articles on all the redlinks is likely wasting their time. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no conspiracy to remove or delete graffiti art articles. I imagine most Wiki editors are in full support of having graffiti art properly covered. But with the emphasis on 'properly'. This article - as is the other - is just a frequently abused spam magnet. Much better to let each posse have an article on their own merits. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 19:58, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm not suggesting a 'conspiracy', but more of widespread attitudes and misconceptions. Also, as I've argued repeatedly, google hits are a poor measure of graffiti artist's notability as many high profile graffiti artists avoid any publication of their identities...
<ul>
<li>I know what you mean. You want to further the cause of graffiti art on Wikipedia and change people's negative attitudes? Fine. I'd support that. But you can't and won't succeed by bending the rules or setting-up special criteria by which the 'worth' of a posse or artist is to be judged. Sure google is the not the best judge of these things, and graffti art is harder to substantiate - but that's all the more reason you need to dig deep and provide proper sources. If you don't, then time and time again graffiti articles will be up for AfD. In the meantime this article should go. You need to recreate all/any/most of the posse articles with proper sources. Once that is done this article could be recreated - so long as it is then properly maintained to keep the spam out. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 08:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>COMMENT!</b>This is what I have to say. If people can have personal pages, then why can't an entity that represents 6000 users? Personally I think that the editors here don't want to put it on because they themselves don't like wrestling. I don't like anime, so could we then say to delete all the anime pages?

<li><b>Comment</b> Because it just doesn't work that way. There are tens of thousands of websites that have several thousand regular users. If we listed all of them and all the "garage bands" that record a CD and sell it on their own website and a few other such things, WP will be totally useless. To be included in WP a website has to have some special "claim to fame", such as being the first at something. (For instance, Altavista.com was the first Internet search engine.) <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 08:13, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many things being overlooked about this article, that seem to be overlooked due to the bias nature of the those who oppose it, and the lack of knowledge on the details by the people who posted this. This has been up for less than 24 hours and already it looks like it will be deleted solely because some feel it is not notable. However the site in question exceeds the popularity of notible entries on this site, which serve as a brief bio and advertisement plug for paid services set up by wrestling journalists. Now this arguement is abvout notablity from everything I read and that is the issue stopping the people who should be updating things here from doing so. First off, Prowrestling.com as seen by it's name was one of the first wrestling websites, dating back to 1997 or even earlier. A rapid change in ownership and issues with the early site gives little info on the pre 97 state of the site. Now the reasons this site is important enough and deserves to stay here as an asset to many of the wrestling pages listed here. First off, we have an active columnist community both on the main page and the forums. These people provide up to date indepth commentary, as well as orignal research such as the quarter hour draw power of stars. Second, we are slowly becoming on the best places for independant wrestling federations to gain exposure. The main site on PW.com gets about 250k unique hits a day at last count, so that means a regional wrestling federation can expose themselves to a variety of people, with minimal effort on their part. Also in this area, we are bringing in interviews with wrestlers in a unique and detailed manner in the forums. Much of the content we seek to share with the people here, and moreso the wrestling network here, would be these features, and help link up people and regional feds through our page to help them self-promote, and help would be columnists find a place to expand there work. Since we do not charge for these services or limit who can do them, along with provide a possible change to get their work or promo stuff seen by 100k or more people, I feel this offers a source of infomation that will be very helpful to people have do not know were else to turn for these services, much as pages about programs help people who do not know where to term for file sharing infomation. Well that is my arguement for this. Not sure if it will matter or not in the end, since alot of the complaints come from one or two people and the rest are just delete comments claiming the site is not notable, although through the very own notable section on this site, it will show the problems of claiming if this site is notable or not in the wrestling community, which would be the group who would edit and update the information here. Also sorry about the wall of text. One of the reasons I never edit pages although this account is older is because I never know the exact format stuff should be in so I do not wish to ruin a page through faulty formatting.

<li><b>Keep</b> To elaborate on what Engel has to say, I believe this is worth a shot most definitely. This is not near as bad as some stuff. I mean come on. Personal pages? How is a website around since 1997, that has gained 6000 members in 4 months and that is the 4th most popular search result on Google when 'wrestling' is entered (the first sole Internet company) less worthy than 'personal pages'?

<li><b>Comment</b> You know if the true way of finding justice here is by considering valuable, objective, factual responses more useful than tons of 'non notable'/'spam'/'not valid' crap, then we wouldn't even be arguing this right now. Like I said. Go to Google. Type in wrestling. See the fourth result. It's pretty simple. Lithborne is the only guy making an argument and even he is losing all credibility by ignoring the FACTS. You want a discussion on this then you got it. But right now we're the only ones not taking it as a vote. ThePWGod 16:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>While I forgot to mention it above, since for many notability needs a unique or big fact, the domain name for the is the single most hit one in the wrestling world, even higher than WWE on most search engines when people look for pro wrestling. As for it being adverting spam, the precedent was already set for these pages to be allowed to exist when the PW Torch page was allowed. That page is not notable as it was not the first, not the most read, nor is the wiki link anything more than an ad for the website and paper sheets that Keller sells. I know we do not yet have alot of content, but within hours of trying to set this up, we got the call for it to be deleted which as I mentioned above encourages people not to spent a few hours to get a detailed list of the site and it's history up, only to have it deleted anyway. Also not to mention during those first few hours the page was heavily sabotaged repeatedly. While the first people to edit this up were misguided, more people have shown interest in this that know how wiki does work and we are slowly adding to it, but cautiously, as why would anyone waste time editing an article that a non-democratic site may delete based on a democratic opinion?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This is not about the content of the article, it's about the website/forum not being notable enough to have an article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The forum information was non notable and thus I removed it. The content of the article can be verified by going to the home page. The new covered and information on the page can be verified by following the required source citations provided for all news coverage, in the forums or on the main page. Using Google's back links currently 800 back links to the site and forum. This is on par with the 1000 found backlined to the <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Keller_0240.html" title="Wade Keller">Wade Keller</a> PW Torch page which we used as out president in creating this site. Using www.linkpopularity.com we have over 2000 redirects back to our site that is active now. Neither of the site have won an award, and while Keller claims national exposure, it is only in the products or services he personally sells, which only reaches a small group. Much of the current content will be seeing reprint on other wrestling websites, mostly the interviews and the quarter hour power ratings. I do not personally know at this time were they are reprinted, as I do not personally deal with the power ratings, nor is the girl who promotes the interviews online at this time. We have notable people providing information to the site, namely <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dory_Funk_Jr_c6dc.html" title="Dory Funk Jr">Dory Funk Jr</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Prazak_f954.html" title="Dave Prazak">Dave Prazak</a> who do work on the main page and forums respectively, along with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Clark_06e1.html" title="Vincent Clark">Vincent Clark</a> providing information from time to time. Since there is little precedent information I could find via wiki pages on what makes a wrestling site notable and what does not as it is randomish it appears what can and cannot be allowed here, a list of what exactly you are looking for given the sub genre of websites would be needed, so we know what exactly to provide you with. It is confusing when some articles are deemed notable when they are in regards to professional wrestling in general, which they are listed under, while this one is considered not. Also the guideline is very vague and hard to apply to this sort of site, as there is no community to give wrestling site awards, and we assumed the site would be notable due it to being the most desired name for all wrestling websites as well being hte first site that returned when typing pro wrestling into most search engines.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the "This Date In Baseball" pages are worth keeping. Baseball more than any other sports has interesting and unique feats that have happened on a complete spread of the calandar. This is an excellent place to document that history. Plus, I have a feeling if we don't put this information on the "This Date In Baseball" that a lot of the baseball information will appear on the normal date pages like April 12 in baseball will all get thrown on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a>. This will only lead to annoying non-baseball fans and people will argue over what is notable.

<li><b>STRONG DELETE. WP policy is absolutely clear on this type of situation.</b>
<ul>
<li>Articles <b>must</b> be sourced. It is one thing to not cite sources on things like "William Jefferson Clinton was a President of the United States" that are common knowledge and can easily be confirmed either by checking the Internet, a library, a map, or other common research tools. It is another thing to not cite <b>reliable, credible</b> sources for this kind of material that is virtually unknown.</li>
<li>Almost everything about this on the Web is copied from this article.</li>
<li>There are all sorts of psychologists, sociologists, etc., who come up with all sorts of "new" illnesses, syndromes, etc., that <b>never</b> wind up recognized by their field. The fact that <b>one</b> or <b>two</b> books may mention an idea does not make it "recognized".</li>
<li><b>Verifiability is not the sole criterion.</b> Even if something is true <b>and</b> verifiable--even with sources--that does not automatically make it <b>notable</b> and "encyclopedic" under WP policy. If there is virtually nothing about this on the Internet, most likely that disqualifies it from being "notable" enough to meet WP policy--<i>even assuming it is true</i>.</li>
<li>The Yahoo link is to their "Inflatables" directory, <b>not</b> "inflation fetishism". (I changed the description.) No one disputes that blow-up dolls, etc., constitute a fetish. But that does not qualify as "inflation" fetishism. There is already an article on Inflatable fetishism.</li>

<li><b>Merge, splice and delete</b>. There is quite a bit of material in the nominated article that is not reproduced in the far newer article and the page histories should be maintained. So I suggest a merge, splicing the histories,and then deleting. It doesn't really matter which direction, but if the splice should start with the older [nominated] article, then the better named, newer article can be deleted and this one moved to that name.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 07:53, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.The nominated article doesn't even have the real author or publishing company. Just a comment.<a href="../../../e/n/e/User%7EEnergie_372c.html" title="User:Energie">ЄИЄЯפЇЄ</a> 18:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Redirect</b>. I don't really see the "quite a bit of material", but if there is anything worth saving I guess moving it over to the other article.

<p>A nn housing estate.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've had a go at it; in my opinion, the location is now clear, it has been cleaned up, is less advert-ish, and the notability is somewhat established. (An Emirati could probably do a better job, but I tried.) After all, three quarters of a million google hits for something outside the English speaking world? Sounds notable enough for this deletionist. (And on another note, why didn't you try a prod, Grutness?) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 01:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>I didn't prod because - unless it's clearly never going to get beyond a deletable stub - it may have been saveable. I didn't know where this was, so there was no way of me checking whether it was any more notable than had been written. It was quite possible that someone who knew more about the subject could have rescued it - and I'm far happier to see an article rescued and made encyclopedic than deleted out of hand. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 04:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
