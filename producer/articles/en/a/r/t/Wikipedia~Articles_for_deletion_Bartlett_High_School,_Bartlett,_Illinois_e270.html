<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). I came to about 36 delete votes and a bit more than 20 merge or keep votes. At any rate the article, while stile a very short stub which could probably be merged somewhere unless more information is forthcoming, is not a yellow pages entry anymore. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:25, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. Yes, I know it's about a school. This isn't an article. Listed on cleanup for two months. Nothing more than basic contact info. Same user kept posting an even more sparse entry for the school district earlier today. - Lucky 6.9 03:29, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Pardon me, but the understanding I had, from earlier (VfD, so the criteria may have changed under AFd) discussions, was that schools were inherently worthy of an article unless they were closed and unhistorical.

<dd>Some people believe schools are inherently notable, but it's by no means concensus. This was offered for deletion because it was not an article but just basic contact info and on cleanup for 2 months without any improvement. Any article in such a state should be deleted regardless of whether they are about schools or not. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:57, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hear hear! There are <i>no</i> blanket exceptions to the rules that govern all other articles on Wikipedia. No one has ever said that all schools are not notable, and yet some have not only <i>said</i> that all schools are notable (and inviolate) but that they cannot be nominated for VfD. That is absurd. In this case, a Clean-up article that didn't get cleaned up is a deletion candidate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:41, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right that continuing to repeat "schools are inherently notable" is completely pointless. I certainly don't believe that all schools are notable but, you know what, I also don't think all schools are <i>non</i>-notable. I don't think pursuing either extreme is a good idea. If I can agree that there are indeed some notable schools (this isn't one of them, by the way) why can't you agree that there are some non-notable ones? <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 22:32, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This is my problem with the <i><b>keep at all costs</b></i> stance too. Worse they are aggressively attempting to keep elementary schools and it will only be a matter of time before day care is in there too. Why are you (Nicodemus75) so unwilling to compromise? There are other ways to do this. The use of lists comes to mind.

<li>Kappa, I do not find your repeated accusations against anyone who nominates a school for VfD civil or productive, so we're even. However, let's get to the fallacy of your position. In fact, all universities and towns are inherently suitable as <i>topics</i> for articles, but not all articles on towns or universities are valid Wikipedia entries. There is no consensus that secondary schools are in the same class as colleges and universities and towns, but the point here is that <i>no one is voting to delete this because it's a school</i>: people are voting delete because the article is uninformative, does not establish (bring forth/explain/celebrate) the notability that you believe is inherent in the institution. It is being voted to delete because it's not a valid article, not because it's an article on a school. Please read the nomination before you encourage people to blindly block vote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:55, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Um, isn't that an argument for leaving it around for a few decades to mellow?

<li>To expand this, a look at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> shows that since the start of the month some 120, ONE-HUNDRED-AND-TWENTY new school articles have been created. Many of them are very brief stubs similar to the one we have at this article now. Only the most obviously silly ones get speedied--articles created to attack, those giving no context, and so on. Over the past six months, only about 280 articles have been listed for deletion. Of this small number, only a tiny proportion--currently around 40, have been deleted. A few more articles are deleted because they're copyright violations. Just deleting school articles isn't a realistic method of dealing with perceived systemic problems with Wikipedia, such as the belief that there are too many articles about non-notable schools, too many school stubs (or substubs, if you prefer), or too many articles that fail to provide us with an interesting read. The rate of creation and retention of school articles has far outstripped the rate at which this growth can be controlled simply by deleting them. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:07, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>A school can achieve notability by producing notable alumni, introducing a novel program, or being involved in a major historical or newsworthy event. The oldest Bartlett High School grads are all under 25 years old, and--as far as we know--none of them are notable. No school program is mentioned in the article, and no link to a news event is provided. Under these conditions, I don't think we should just let it sit for "a few decades" until it becomes notable. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 04:23, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I've just demonstrated, it's no longer possible to restrict school articles to "notable" schools. In the past eight months AfD has deleted only around 40 school articles, and in the past <i>eight days</i> the new content of Wikipedia has increased (after discounting speedy deletions) by a total of 120 school articles. Copyvio deletions also account for a small number of deletions, but after all that it appears to me that the current rate of growth of school articles on Wikipedia exceeds many times over the rate at which they're deleted.</li>
<li>Even if we all agreed, every one of us, that non-notability of schools was a good reason for deleting the articles, we'd have to delete about 15 school articles every day just to keep up with the rate of creation. In the current circumstances, where it's actually quite rare for a school listed on AfD actually to be deleted, this just isn't going to happen. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:14, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are right, the current school AfD mechanism is doomed. I propose a new Speedy Deletion category: {{nn-school}}. Any school not meeting the notability criteria described above should be speedy-deleted. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 05:36, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well look at it this way: if we can't get consensus to delete more than three or four school articles a month, we're not likely to arrive at consensus on a speedy policy for school articles. However desirable you may feel it would be, it's an unattainable goal in the present climate of opinion on school articles. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:40, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Worst rational ever.</b> So now the argument to keep schools is that they are being created faster than they can be deleted?

<li>Read it again. Far from a <i>rationale</i>, it's an analysis that shows that school articles cannot be controlled by AfD. Your energies are thus misspent. Also I notice that you again raise the false claim that schools are given special treatment on AfD. They are not. They are listed in precisely the same manner as other articles and editors are permitted to state their opinion on whether the articles are to be deleted, and finally a sysop comes a long, determines whether there is a consensus, and closes the debate. The article is then deleted if there is a consensus to delete it. AfD debates almost invariably result in the school article being kept, especially if the article is about a high school. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:40, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You want an executive summary?</li>
<li>1) some people find the proposition that a high school is not notable every bit as baffling as you appear to find the proposition that it is</li>
<li>2) these articles are battle-tested. 269 nominations processed to day since January 1, 2005. 37 deletions. Deletion rate less than 15% of those nominated. Meanwhile I can tell you as a fact that 158 school articles were created on Wikipedia in the seven days from September 5th to September 11th. That is more than four times, in one week, the number of articles, articles <i>created</i>, that AfD has <i>deleted</i> in eight months.</li>
<li>You may think there is a problem. Clearly listing perfectly good articles for deletion on grounds like "not notable" is not the solution, because school articles are being created at such a vastly greater rate than they can be deleted. Notability cannot be anything but an excuse for deletion. All you're doing is venting your anger at the fact that there will always exist articles on Wikipedia that you cannot control. AfD is not a quality control tool, it cannot possibly perform that task. Only editors can do that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:44, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>My response to this is: clearly they <i>are</i> being held to the same standard and passing the test with flying colors, and what other word do you use for the mood of someone who continues to complain that there is a problem with schools when Wikipedia tells him loud and clear, over a period of some months, that there is not? Fact: several times more school articles will be created by the end of this month than have been listed for deletion during the eight months January to August of this year.

<li>Tony while <i><a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">schoolwatch</a></i> has been very effective at preventing school article deletions, and to your credit, doing a lot of good work trying to improve those articles who will be improving the 158 that got written last week? Are these <i>articles</i> all a couple of lines or are some actually informative? I don't think the fact that people start these article <i>en mass</i> is an indication that they are useful articles' it's more of an indication that they don't have any other useful articles to contribute. If they cared they would do a good job. The strongest argument I have seen for schools, to date, is that it helps wikipedians learn to be productive. School articles are like a 'live' sandbox for developing skills and knowledge about wikipedia itself. I will support that argument. But to say these articles are useful just seems silly. There are much better resources online for this type of information. More to the point such databases do not get vandalised. How often are school articles vandalised and no ones notices? Would anyone even question if I changed stats in a school article. Say '73% of students passed' vandalised to '63% of students passed' a particular assessment exam? It would make a huge difference to prosepective students or parents and worse, when noticed, will reinforce the idea that wikipedia itself is an unreliable source for information.

<li>What an awful straw man this is. Delete articles because they are subject to vandalism? Are you even remotely serious in proposing that because an article might be a target for vandalism that it ought to be deleted? I have read some whoppers in these debates, but this is the single-most absurd proposition I have yet encountered from those that want to delete or otherwise remove school articles. I am so flabbergasted at this argument that I am not even sure I should bother with a detailed refutation of why this argument is such patent nonsense. If proclivity to vandalism is a valid critera for article deletion, <b>any</b> controversial topic on Wikipedia should be deleted for fear that it might be vandalized.

<dd>You're making a compelling argument for putting those articles on your watchlist and helping maintain them, but none at all for deleting them.

<dd>I have no problem with that but I can't watch all the schools. Also my argument would not be deletion but to maintain the two liner schools in lists with their peer local schools. At least then we get some context. Even if i have them on my watchlist it does not mean I will see a vandals edit, especially if I'm away for a while. Each school needs many people to watch. My sense is there are not many who do it; I could be wrong. Also it would not be my first choice to monitor school articles, I'd rather spend my time trying to catch the misinformed edits in the science pages, as well as improving the pages that need work. I'm happy to help with schools and I'm willing to hear the arguments but knee jerk 'keep' does not seem to be a wise use of limited resources (I know, wiki is not paper, but every page needs user hours and those ARE limited). <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 06:00, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think the problem you're having is in your assumption that you must take personal responsibility for the whole encyclopaedia and that it somehow reflects on you if you do not. But you don't. It's a wiki. Suggest a project, why not? Perhaps one of the more geeky types would make us a program that showed only school articles that changed, if we were to feed them in. Does Crypto whatsit's thing do that? Although I don't agree that vandalism of school pages is any more a problem than vandalism of other pages (a bewildering variety do get vandalised, usually in a very noticeable way that is caught by RC fiends -- I catch plenty when I'm in the mood), it's no solution to suggest they should not be allowed. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 05:06, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Vandalism is always visible in the history,even if you don't catch it at the time. Remember that our articles are only supposed to contain verifiable references, so if you encounter a figure that isn't referenced, delete the figure from the article. This is a Wiki, after all. On spotting edits to school articles, it's easy to do this by making a list of school articles and then linking to the "related changes" special page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:42, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with Nicodemus, and I think most editors would, that the "vandalism" argument is unworthy of a response. Oh let's just delete the whole encyclopedia in case somebody vandalizes it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:19, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This is almost as absurd as the proposition in the first place. So now the argument is if an article might have what you subjectively have defined for us as a <b>"high chance"</b> of vandalism that goes unnoticed, an article should be deleted???

<li>So misinformation is a good thing? Especially when the same data is easily available at other sites? Almost every one of the articles up for deletion have nothing that is not availabale in the public databases. Have any well written and researched school article ever being put up for deletion? If not then there is no conspiracy against schools as you seem to think.

However Aaron, to answer your frequently-answered questions (*cough* talk about "canards" *cough*) yet again. A) School articles are not judged any differently from other articles such as towns, cities, battleships, crusiers, destroyers, submarines, firearms, television shows, movies, religious denominations, video games, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. What you and other deletionists want, is to hold schools to the same policy standards as vanity pages about non-notable PEOPLE (which do not constitute all other articles). B)Insofar as creation of stub articles is "encouraged" (*cough* canard *cough*), it is for the same reason that stubs of all other types are created and "encouraged" such as stubs for towns, cities, battleships, crusiers, destroyers, submarines, firearms, television shows, movies, religious denominations, video games, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. To be filled in at a later date, not to be AfD nominated within 3 days of their creation. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 03:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It says that the number of people who hold a view is material when deciding whether that viewpoint should be represented when writing a neutral article. For instance one wouldn't need to represent the flat earth viewpoint in an article on the curvature of the earth. But you seem to be mistaking it for a statement about whether the number of people <i>interested in a subject</i> is material when deciding whether an article should be included in an encyclopedia. That's a different argument. You may well be able to make a case and I may well be persuaded by it, but citing the neutrality guideline isn't going to persuade me because it obviously doesn't say what you think it says. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've started a new Project sub-page to summarize one of the points raised in this discussion: <s>Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Sidaway ratio</s>. Since the debate here is no longer about Bartlett High School specifically, maybe we should move our discussion to the Talk page. If this is redundant, I'll remove the new page. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 16:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. I can get all this information from Google, so why replicate it here&#160;? <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 21:01, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because that's what encyclopedias do. They collect public information into a single article. Should we delete all the Hollywood actor, director and writer articles? That information is all available elsewhere. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:45, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, it's a heated issue. Thanks for giving your reasoning. I think it really does behoove us all to try to remember this is meant to be a civilised discussion.

<dd>Well, that's new! Would you mind explaining? It clearly isn't "obvious" that it requires deleting, and it's less than obvious why that particular policy applies. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:00, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
