<dd>Sociologists do not define OBC,SC,ST,FC etc.They use these concepts for analysis.

Nichalp has provided proof for Government defining these words.

<dd>Phps you are not aware most of these terms are well defined by noted sociologist srinivasan, and govt has only bought his ideas on these caste issues.Infact it was to his credit that has simplified caste based study.But he didn't define this term.<span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 07:33, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your arguments are unique and interesting.If we show news articles as citations then you say Indian news papers lack journalistic standards.If we show government sources then you say it is not valid source.If we show sociologists,politicians,prime minister using these words then you keep mum.If sociologists don't back up the term then why they are using these words.You can see Yogendra yadav defining the term in one of the FAQ.<a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/5704._.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/5704._.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.You can also see that he has estimated upper caste population as 33%.If there is no definition and there is no basis for classification then how sociologists like him have estimated population?Even if we assume Indian news papers lack journalistic standards,why others are using the word frequently.You are also agreeing that sociologists like srinivasan have used these words. Why does he use it if he does not back up the term. How words used for many decades will become neology?</dd>

<dd>I did not say that.

<dd>Quite clearly upper caste would be the more appropriate name for the title. The term "exists" and is defined.

<dd>I'm sorry if you feel that Indian newspapers lack journalistic standards.

<dd>Do you notice <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> invalidates sources which may have proven motives behind them, and do you wonder why sociologists do not entertain this term.<span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 10:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The above comment of yours is of course your own personal opinion about me and has nothing to do with the debate.Had these been facts it would have been defined by experts in the field , the only FACt about it is its a fiction used by propagandist journolists having no or very poor knowledge of sociological terms.

<dd>I'm not making a personal opinion about you, rather the fact that you are debunking newspaper reports as not credible since they lack "subject matter experts".

<dd>I don't think this is the case with Indian newspapers specially, had it been true the term would not have found usage in the first place.Yes, they are credible when you talk of incidents but not when you talk of concepts.Can you identify Forward Castes????? <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 11:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first link gives vague reference at one place that there are houses of Brahmins nd other upper caste(But who it does not tell, might be motivated to call these ppl upper without creating furore on who they are, as is normal in indian psyche).But next link is what sd open ur eyes, the data given doesn't use this term. <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 12:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you for the suggestion that "I should open my eyes". Look at the pdf sourced from the Ministry of Minority affairs. Browse to page 5 (26 of the pdf), where it is mentioned in the second point of the third bullet of B: <i>Hindu â€” General Category/Hindu-Upper Castes (these two terms are used interchangeably)</i>. Now this pdf is a report by the Prime Ministerâ€™s High Level Committee, in other words the credibility of the source cannot be disputed. It satisfies the verifiable clause, and the meaning of "upper caste" is clearly and unambigiously defined there. I don't find any other fault with the article, as you claim. I am now completely convinced that this nomination is <u>in bad faith</u>. I won't waste my time justifying a well known and supported fact.

<dd>Forward caste or Upper caste definition is nothing to do with varna system. Why do you confuse with the word Shudra which is part of varna system.There are forward castes from all four hierarchies. There are backward classes from all hierarchies except brahmins.(West Bengal govt. has declared Tyagi caste as OBC which is supposed to be Brahmins.??) Basis of classification is all recognisable Indian castes which are not part of OBC,SC/ST list.This is clearly mentioned in the articles.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 12:40, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename or delete</b> In the 21st century it seems inapproptiate to label the disadvantaged and discriminated-against half of the population of a country as "Backward" which Wiktionary defines as "Reluctant or unable to advance," "undeveloped or unsophisticated" leaving the top 1/3 labelled as "Forward."

<dd>That may be true, but the labelling of previously socially disadvantageous castes as "backward" has little to do with the current status, but rather politics, and political lobby groups. So, in India today, if you are born into a caste that used to be once oppressed, you are labelled as belonging to the "backward caste", even though you may be financially and socially well off (called the "creamy layer"). The wiktionary defination needs to be updated. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">Â«TalkÂ»=</font></a> 16:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh yes, the sources you have cited are not reliable because they are <i>loosely</i> connecting General category ppl to Forward caste.<i>No theory exists</i> which calls these gen. catagory ppl as Forward or upper in any sense.Media sources are not relied upon in any reserach work, infact it will surprise you to know that very same ppl whom you have quoted will loathe from using this word in their research work.BTW Yogendra Yadav is not a sociologist he is a statiscian, who formulates theory on quota and reservation for govt and also does trend analysis during elections, playing with stats.So what makes him notable is data and its analysis not sociological concepts, even though he boasts of being a senior fellow in centre for developing societies, his role is that only.<span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkonoblast_af21.html" title="User:Ikonoblast"><font style="background:white" color="black"><b>&#160;Ikon&#160;</b></font></a></span>|<a href="../../../i/k/o/User_talk%7EIkonoblast_7131.html" title="User talk:Ikonoblast">no-blast</a> 11:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One more interesting argument.Prime Minister's high level committee report is not reliable!!.Sathish deshpande along with Yogendra yadav pioneered research paper given by me is working as professor of sociology in Delhi universiy.(Citation quotes that).Why Oxford university's department of sociology is inviting Yogendra yadav for its research work?<a href="http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/research.html#crest" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/research.html#crest" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.Beyond this,I don't want to argue whether Yogendra yadav is sociologist or not?</dd>
