<p>then please make sure that NEWSWEEK and TIME and the other publications listed on Wikipedia are also deleted in order to remove ALL publications. Gary Dunn 11:50, Mar 22, 2005</p>
<p>I didn't say all publications were non-notable. You're comparing apples and oranges.

<li><b>Landmark Keep</b>. A landmark case is something more than a mere precedent-setter - it is a case that sets forth a new direction in the law, or which explains the law in such a clear, concise, and convincing manner that it becomes <i>the</i> case cited in support of that principle. There are plenty of Supreme Court decisions that rely on a particular previous "landmark case", so in that sense, <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> is absolutely correct to analogize this to a <a href="../../../c/a/u/Cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre.html" title="Cause célèbre">cause célèbre</a>.

<ul>
<li>A student of the U.S. laws must study some "landmark decisions" to know anything about the law. A Supreme Court justice does not say "Hey mom, were're setting up a landmark today!" But the fact is, most case books select their cases from an unofficial pool of the so-called "landmark cases". For example: when you talk about personal jurisdiction, you let your students study <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>. That's it! A case book may also cite some other less important cases. But they usually only cite a few paragraphs at most.

<li>A "landmark decision" is like a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_movie.html" title="Cult movie">cult movie</a>. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_04d4.html" title="The Rocky Horror Picture Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></i> is a cult movie. <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_9_From_Outer_Space_7ec9.html" title="Plan 9 From Outer Space">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a></i> is another one. <i><a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_d14a.html" title="Jurassic Park">Jurassic Park</a></i> is not a cult movie.

<li>The point about those films, certainly Rocky Horror, is that it is not just a landmark case for the United States, as it is one in the UK as well and I think I'm right in saying other places as well. All the cases cited in this article and this VfD have been landmark cases in the USA, which affect USA case law only. If this article is to stand it must either be split into sections or sub-artciles for each country (potentially one for every common law jurisdiction), or renamed to reflect its limited scope. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 08:09, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am a Chinese living in Taiwan. Our legal system is nearly 100% <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29.html" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a>. However, when we talk about due process, you know what ... we talk about the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and some cases such as <i>Goldberg v. Kelly</i> 397 U.S. 254, and possibly, many other related German and Japanese legal principles. Law scholars in Beijing and Shanghai do the same thing all the time. I think it is a good idea that we rename this article to fit its U.S.-centric nature and only keep a dozen really undisputed cases that are truly ground-breaking and influential such as <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, <i>Marbury v. Madison</i> and <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> (Modify) While it is US centric, it is a useful article on showing the growth of America in the courts, and how the courts can be used to create major changes in society. Added examples from history, like in Great Britian, Canada, or other countries, may be useful in showing that 'landmark cases' is not a US-only thing. This could help create an NPOV situation.

<li>To talk about stare decisis, a "landmark decision" changes the law and is binding to later cases. That's why it is influential and different from other cases. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 08:21, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep <s>after</s> follwing major reorganisation</b>. As it stands this is highly US-centric, and arguably POV. I would expand the definition at the top, rewording it be be a general discussion and add sections for other common law jurisdictions (e.g. UK, Canada, Australia, etc), with each giving a sentence or two of text relating to the specific meaning in relation to that country (e.g. in the US they're Supreme Court decisions, in the UK they're House of Lords decisions). Each section would also have a link to a list of landmark cases in that country, e.g. List of landmark cases in the United States (or United States legal precedents or United States landmark cases).

<li><b>Comment</b> to the above discussion:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In the U.S., there are plenty of landmark cases that are not from the Supreme Court, just as there are many (probably most) U.S. Supreme Court cases that are not landmark cases.</li>
<li>There are plenty of landmark cases that are no longer precedent - <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dred_Scott_9031.html" title="Dred Scott">Dred Scott</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plessy_v._Ferguson_f5e2.html" title="Plessy v. Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> spring to mind. They were massively important for their time, and are still studied today so students can understand the later rejection of the decisions (Scott by a Constitutional Amendment, Plessy by a later Court).</li>
<li>As <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> noted before, there are some fairly universal landmark cases in common law countries - I'm sure <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torts.html" title="Torts">torts</a> students all around the world contrast Palsgraf, decided in New York, with the Wagon Mound cases out of Australia, and every <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contracts.html" title="Contracts">contracts</a> course covers the British case of <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadley_v._Baxendale_1bf5.html" title="Hadley v. Baxendale">Hadley v. Baxendale</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I'd say there should be a category for universal landmark cases, and one for those specific to each country that has a common law system, and perhaps one for the EU, which has a common court that has come down with some remarkable things. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 00:32, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think landmark cases need not to be "right" it only needs to change the law's direction. <i>Roe v. Wade</i> is not 100% right. At least pro-lifers hate it. Anyway, that case changed lots of things. <i>Plessy v, Ferguson</i> is absolutely important even until today. But that case changed nearly nothing. The "separate but equal" doctrine did not change the law, it upheld the fact. If I were a former slave-owner at that time, I'll be happy. That case is important but hardly a landmark. If the U.S. Supreme Court says the Earth is flat today, that decision is surely a landmark. A landmark decision does not need to be "right". It only needs to make a huge difference in the law. <i>Dumb v. Dumber</i>: 1+1=3; <i>Moe v. Curly v. Larry</i>: <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">George W.

<dd>Another example:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>Eldred v. Ashcroft</i>: The 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act is constitutional. -&gt; This is not ground-breaking. I don't think anyone will call it a landmark decision. But how about ...
<ul>
<li><i>RIAA v. MPAA</i>: Copyright shall last forever.</li>
<li><i>Copycat v. Constitution</i>: Copyright is illegal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Both cases change the law. The former: forever v. limited period of time; the latter: not at all v. limited protection. I think the former can hardly be a landmark case because today's copyright is already nearly forever. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 04:08, Mar 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>After the rewrites, I'm on the verge of changing my mind, but please change it to "landmark decision" instead of "landmark case"—it's the court decision <i>within</i> a case that changes the law—"case" just refers to the legal conflict as a whole. Plus the Black's definition is for a "landmark decision". <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 06:29, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A landmark decision must be an outstanding decision. A boring case (no sex, no violence, no busty husband-killing defendants) may lead to a jaw-dropping decision and vice versa. I am not sure, but the original 17th century French <i>causes célèbres</i> could have been some juicy and spicy tabloid-style cases.

<p>IMHO, the term "<a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_law.html" title="Case law">case law</a>" is fatally imprecise. We are talking about issues and decisions (<a href="../../../i/r/a/IRAC_e719.html" title="IRAC">IRAC</a> sans R &amp; A). You may cite a case for your own case. But you're not citing the <i>whole</i> case. You only cite the issue that's relevant to your case (actually, a decision that's most friendly to you).

<li>It is the proper term, however. <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>, 7th Ed. "<b>caselaw</b>. The collection of reported cases that form the body of law within a given jurisdiction. —Also written <i>case law</i>; <i>case-law</i>. —Also termed <i>decisional law</i>; <i>adjudicative law</i>; <i>jurisprudence</i>; <i>organic law</i>." "Decisional law" in <i>Black's</i> is just a redirect to "caselaw" (and a term I have <i>never</i> heard nor seen in use). It may not be a sensibly crafted term, but it is the right term.

<li>The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwikification process</a> makes no distinction between speedy deletion and normal deletion. (There isn't such a distinction in other WikiMedia projects.) This is the source of the problem. The processes form a loop. The Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">deletion process</a> places transwikification as one possible end result of the normal deletion process. The transwikification process places a deletion request, per the source project's deletion mechanism, as the end result of transwikification. There are several ways to fix this, including making the end of the transwikification process be speedy deletion instead of normal deletion. However, thanks to the recent spate of exactly that being done, we've seen the problems that that incurs, with large numbers of articles having to be unspeedied. (It's also an abuse of the speedy deletion process. Being a dictionary definiton is <i>not</i> a criterion for speedy deletion. Abusing speedy deletion is not something to be encouraged.) Putting the (unencyclopaedic) articles through the normal deletion process a second time, but explicitly excluding "Transwiki" as a choice, is another option. But that's also problematic, as demonstrated by <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> above. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:09, 2005 Mar 22 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The number of conditional comments makes this one very hard to count. I can say that a clear majority voted to delete this article. Several people argued that the article should be converted into a disambiguation page. Unfortunately, I could not convince myself that any of the suggested meanings were significant enough for encyclopedia articles. Disambiguation pages should be a navigational aid between articles we already have (or clearly want), not mere lists of every possible use of a name or phrase. The possible exception for significance is the John Lee Hooker song but, in that case, I believe that a redlink will be more likely to result in a quality article than a disambiguation page with no content. In any case, the current page history would be of no help to writing the desired article.</p>
<p>4 people clearly voted to "merge" this article (one of those discounted as a probable troll). Looking at the content of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Super_Mario_characters_2215.html" title="List of Super Mario characters">List of Super Mario characters</a> article, I can not convince myself that the content of this article fits or would be accepted for a merge.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one as a "delete". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 19:52, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>As the original author of the page I think I will comment on this subject. I oppose deletion, since the claim that none of the magazines have pages in Wikipedia is false. There is a page for <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_Journal_4eb0.html" title="Linux Journal">Linux Journal</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_Format_27fc.html" title="Linux Format">Linux Format</a> but the links were typoed, and hence it looked as if there was no such page. I am not a US citizen, so merging with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_magazines_5df9.html" title="List of United States magazines">List_of_United_States_magazines</a> would be wrong, since some of the magazines listed are not printed in the US but you can still subscribe to them anywhere in the world. The reason why I started that page was because I was looking for what Linux Magazine to subscribe to but couldn't find any list of what magazines exist and what the magazines focus on. <i>(anon edit from 193.64.14.2)</i>

<p>ROYAL HAWAIIAN MINT: Founded in 1974 by Bernard von NotHaus.&#160;?Almost from the very beginning of the Mint, von NotHaus was drawn to create a new currency for Hawaii.? This initial aim was to include paper money. At its operational height, the Mint had seven different locations, with a main branch in Honolulu. In my personal communications with him, von NotHaus stated that he eventually&#160;?did over 700 issues in 25 years as Mintmaster?. During his longstanding quest, he conducted extensive reviews of various economic models, currencies, and financial systems, interspersed with a series of pecuniary experiments. His design process, development, and research continued until 1997, culminating in&#160;?a pet project? called the Hawaiian Sovereign Currency; this was a full-fledged proposal which was meant to exemplify a law-abiding, value-backed currency. But shortly thereafter, he devised NORFED and his blueprints&#160;?morphed? into a new undertaking, the Liberty Dollar. Though von NotHaus retired from the Mint in 1998, this is not to say he left the numismatic scene altogether (far from it! He now heads the aforementioned NORFED, as detailed in one of my foregoing listings, in which the story picks up where this one leaves off).</p>

<p>Non-notable card game invented recently. Subject of a promotional campaign by its creator, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">User:Mike Church</a>, who is also <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudocrat_73a3.html" title="User:Ludocrat">User:Ludocrat</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">User:EventHorizon</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/0/User%7E160.html" title="User:160">User:160</a>, and others. The article (at the more appropriate title Ambition (card game) has been previously deleted. Previous deletion debates for that article are at <a href="../../../a/m/b/Talk%7EAmbition_%28card_game%29_Delete_c6a7.html" title="Talk:Ambition (card game)/Delete">Talk:Ambition (card game)/Delete</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Talk%7EAmbition_%28card_game%29_d721.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Ambition (card game)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Ambition (card game)</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/b/Talk%7EAmbition_%28card_game%29_December_talk_bbbf.html" title="Talk:Ambition (card game)/December talk">Talk:Ambition (card game)/December talk</a>.

Also note the <b>Philosophy of Self-Promotion</b> segment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike_Church&amp;oldid=3431865" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike_Church&amp;oldid=3431865" rel="nofollow">this previous version of his user page</a>.

<li>Ok, just-plain <b>Delete.</b> Non-notable; advertising and self-promotion; and borderline speedy because very similar content was previously and properly voted for deletion.

Ludocrat at this point swore up and down that he wasn't Mike Church, and then turned the former redirect into a disambig page with a short, unlinked mention of this game.

<li><b>Delete</b>. My reasoning is explained <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_ambition_findings_cbbe.html" title="User:EventHorizon/ambition findings">here</a> and I will not give it again in great detail; you can read it at that page. This accusation that I am Mike Church, Ludocrat, etc. is just idiotic axe-grinding by users, a part of a larger politically-motivated effort by "anonymous" Internet users, several of whom who have been offline identified and some have even been connected to neo-Nazi groups. I have researched this thoroughly and verified the facts. They seek to launch a personal attack on Mr. Church based on an unfounded fear that he wrote Ambition to become politically influential; there is no indication that he has or ever had this ambition, and the concept seems ludicrous; how would a card game lend a person political clout? Mike Church would have to be a seriously deluded individual to make such a misplaced effort, but it seems more likely that his attackers merely wish to paint him with these sinister motives. The politically-motivated attack surrounding Ambition, however, will not cease and is an embarrassment to Wikipedia. This represents cause to delete Ambition (cards). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 06:12, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> The claims about the "non-notability" of the game should be ignored: an article on it (written by Mike Church) was published in the March, 2005 issue of <i>The Games Journal</i> <a href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and Ambition has been a matter of discussion on both Finnish and Japanese blogs. <a href="http://www.melankolia.net/gameblog/archives/2005/02/ambition.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.melankolia.net/gameblog/archives/2005/02/ambition.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Finally, there's an entry on it at the BoardGameGeek. <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/16043" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/16043" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I don't think this is enough to make the article worth the liability of potentially ugly political warfare, but all the claims to the game's notability are verified. So while I support deleting the article on practical grounds, the game itself is definitely notable and growing. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 06:25, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right. Because we all know that neo-Nazis are really interested in making sure that non-notable card games don't get publicized. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 06:28, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not all the people voting to delete the article(s) who have been connected to these groups, but many of the people making the "sock puppet" accusations. I should have made that more clear: not everyone voting to delete the article is a participant in the politically-motivated personal attack on this individual. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 06:34, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is only one allegation of sockpuppetry in this thread, and lots of delete votes without personal attacks. That would suggest that it is not a personal attack, but that people simply consider the game not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Another suggestion:</b> Let's ban all mention of Ambition from Wikipedia for all eternity; delete the article and no user may write on the topic at all. Let's make it the first topic to be banned from Wikipedia and all Wikimedia projects. Next, let's make a rule that no user can play Ambition and contribute to Wikipedia at the same time. Either you are with us, or you are with the Wiki-terrorists (Ambition players). Finally, let's discourage young children from playing Ambition because it's the next tobacco, because it encourages truancy, liberal politics, and sodomy! Let's get Bush to declare war on Ambition.

The Columbine High School's "famous" alumni mentioned in the article: "<i>country songwriter/artist <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skip_Ewing_5057.html" title="Skip Ewing">Skip Ewing</a>, melancholy pop band <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Head_Todd_and_the_Monsters_1a76.html" title="Big Head Todd and the Monsters">Big Head Todd and the Monsters</a> (all three members), and 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist Melanie Palenik</i>" don't even have an article yet. The last paragraph "<i>the order Columbiformes includes the 308 species of doves</i>" is also a joke. A high school is a high school. Unless it actually becomes something such as an elite high school, it's no more than a human butcher shop. Is there an article dealing with the garage at 2122 N. Clark Street, Chicago? Certainly not. Just because some people were killed over there on February 14, 1929, does not earn that lousy garage an article in an encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToytoy_34ee.html" title="User:Toytoy">Toytoy</a> 06:55, Mar 23, 2005 (UTC)

<p>I count 5 "delete" votes and 4 "merge" or "redirect" votes. No one voted to keep as is. Despite a majority to delete, there is not the overwhelming concensus necessary.

<li>Of your two examples, the first (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jick_1d88.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jick">Jick</a> was deleted only because the claim that they created something notable came to late to survive a mountain of delete votes.

<li>The second one got merged to one of the two notable things he did. Why should this article stand on its own?

<li><b>Comment</b>, OK... but who/what is "Shuker" and when/where in 1988 did he make the statement attributed to him in this article? Maybe this is just a case of very lousy sourcing and citation... but personally I don's see a (sur?)name and a year as sourcing.

<li>It's a standard citation style. While I'd never let a good article or featured article get away with it, it does cut the mustard at AfD, as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:11, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is quibbling at this point, but it's only standard when you have a bibliography at some point in your work... regardless, I made the sourcing clear. That should take care of some of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problems.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, the sourcing is definitely much better now. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>No. As <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> points out it is not a citation. It's just <i>a pointer to</i> the actual citation, which in that style is located in a bibliography (or, in Wikipedia parlance, "References") section. See <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarvard_referencing_e866.html" title="Wikipedia:Harvard referencing">Wikipedia:Harvard referencing</a> for how this works. To cut the mustard at AFD the source must be locatable. "Shuker (1998)" really provides no information to someone who doesn't already know what the source is, because it's just a pointer to the actual citation, rather than the actual citation itself. It's only enough to locate the citation itself, not enough to locate what is actually being cited. The actual citation, giving the name of the author, title of the work, publisher, and so forth, was never added to the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone is arguing deletion based on sourcing anymore, but a "citation" that doesn't actually tell you the source is more than "poorly written"... it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>.

The result of the debate was delete.</p>
<p>I count 5 clear "delete" votes and 3 "keep" votes. However, one of the keep votes is discounted as anonymous (and based on contribution history, there is a reasonable probability that the edit was made as a sockpuppet). Another "keep" vote was made by an editor with a very short contribution history prior to this vote. Since the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Local_politicians_0d4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Local politicians">Local politicians</a> discussion did not achieve concensus, we are left to decide these cases individually.

<li><s><b>del</b></s>. (vote changed after recent change.) Neologism. A handful of google links, vast majority of which refer to the <s>book</s> article by <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hayden_White_a64e.html" title="Hayden White">Hayden White</a> which introduces the word.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. The phrase in the article is a direct passage taken from Hayden White, it is very correct. Even if Hayden White were to invent the word, why would it not deserve an article? Hayden White is a leader in the field of Historiography and a highly notable author. There are 192 hits on Google. Over 10 references in published books (see A9.com). If deserves an entry. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 23:30, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is correct, then our "<a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">Historiography</a>" article is incorrect or requires disambiguation. 192 word usages for such a broad notion means just this: neologism that didn't find its way into the mainstream yet. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 00:21, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>What is wrong with you? I am speaking about the term <b><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">Historiography</a></b>, not "-photy". I am saying the wikipedia definition of h-graphy is not how it is defined in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiophoty.html" title="Historiophoty">Historiophoty</a> article. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 02:54, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Look if you want to harp on "neologism" hang out in "recent articles" there are a few posted every hour. This term has legitimate notability, if for no other reason that Hayden White coined it, there is no reason it should not have an article, even if its new to you. If you object to it being one persons term and not widely known or used or whatever, you should address that in the text of the article like a normal editor, instead of pushing your POV through the VfD process. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 01:11, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please read wikipedia policies before giving advices. Precisely because of "being one persons term and not widely known or used or whatever" the article is fair game for VfD. Since it is also quite possible that my opinion is wrong, the deletion is a voted process. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 01:19, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please dont lecture me I know the rules. Hayden White is a very well known professional scholar. The term and the paper he wrote about it in is referenced in no less than 10 published books (see A9.com). As for "fair game", is this a game for you to delete peoples articles? Looking at your contributions it seems to be. I try to build Wikipedia, certain people try to tear it down, as a game. Edit the article if you dont like it. Thats the game. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 01:28, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>the expression "fair game" refers to "<a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_%28food%29.html" title="Game (food)">Game (food)</a>". I am sorry I have to lecture you in English, not on only in rules. The fact the term is mentioned in several books doesn't prove that it is in the mainstream use. And in half of books it is in cautious phrases, kind of <i>...historiophoty, using the term of Professor Hayden White...</i>, confirming this is a neologism. As for "seems to be", yes, from time to time I switch from the contributing work to the cleanup one. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 03:06, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Then edit the article</b> to reflect that. The fact it has 190+ google hits, is a term created by a well known and influential professional academic, and is referenced in no less than 10 published books makes it a term worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. The time and energy of this discussion should have been spent expanding the stub. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 03:35, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The straight votes below are 2 "delete" and 2 "redirect". No one is arguing to keep the current article as is. Conducting my own review, I find sufficient independent and reputable Google hits to conclude that this buzz-word is no longer a neologism. Arguably, it is a trivial elaboration on the old "field trip" but that is not a sufficient reason for deletion.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and call it as a "keep". Further, I am going to override the recommendation of the other voters and keep it as an independent article for now. (That is, however, a decision that any future editor/reader can <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and change.)

<p>I agree with the nominator that this was a mere dictionary definition. Frankly, even with Kappa's expansion, I believe this still is a dicdef. But I believe it may be possible for this to expand into a full article. If, however, it has not been expanded in a reasonable amount of time, it may become appropriate to renominate the article.</p>
<p>Comment: The article itself was never tagged with {{vfd}}. It is therefore reasonable to assume that this discussion did not get the visibility it needed.
