<p>The result was <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">War crime</a>. There wasn't a consensus to keep this article- the decision was between merge and delete. A lot of people said delete/merge, which is not possible. To preserve authorship history a merged article shouldn't be deleted. As some sections have already been merged a redirect is more appropriate. If this was a merger into one article a redirect to that article would be obvious, but in this case I'm redirecting to <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crime.html" title="War crime">War crime</a>, which contains links to the other articles per comment by Nihonjoe below. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 21:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page was created with the sole attempt to try to attack Japan by comparing it unfavourably to Germany's post war attitude. Although it has been later changed, the article remains highly POV with no hope of later improvement. This is because it compares only Germany and Japan. It would be like creating an article comparing US and Swedish foreign policy. You could try to make it neutral, but because the choices were originally made to look the US look bad, the US will always be portrayed especially unfairly.</p>
<p>If the article had a general scope to look at how the Axis powers reacted to the war, or all the major powers on both sides, maybe it could work. But I don't think such an arbitrary comparison should be allowed to stay on wikipedia. No one is willing to put the effort in to change the slant, only minor edits. So hope of change would be vain. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 11:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> so would you then be happy if it were moved to Responses of Axis Powers to World War II war crimes? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Moving it wouldn't be sufficient, because the entire slant of it is to compare Germany and Japan. Although some parts could be used, it would need to be completely re-written from scratch. And no one is going to do that - they won't even try to improve the current format. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:00, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I realise the article has huge <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problems, but they're not irredeemable. Which means this isn't an article for deletion, really, but an article for improvement. Unfortunately there's no WP:AfI. Hmmm.... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:09, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the article were deleted, but the content saved/archived somewhere, it would actually provide motivation to write a better, more balanced article about all the Axis powers. Or indeed one about all the WWII powers - I think the latter would be better. Keeping it as it is with the tags won't make anyone sort it out. Sometimes you have to force people to do what is necessary.
<p>And if no one actually does write another article, it will show that they were never going to improve the current one, nor that it actually matters to them. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There's <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a>, which is exactly that. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:21, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why would that make a difference? The article has been tagged for ages. Besides if I move it, someone will just revert it. I think a clean start with a new article would be better and this one being deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, roughly speaking "Needs improvement" is not really accepted as a criterion for deletion, unless "but can't be improved" follows. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I already pointed out, the entire premise of the article is POV and thus against wikipedia policy. Why not have an article comparing George Bush to Ghandi? Or the US' consumption of oil to Sri Lanka's? If those articles were created, they'd be deleted very fast, even if valid points were made. So why should this one get special treatment? If someone said, "well the points are valid and it could be expanded" that would not cut any ice. The call to expand/improve the article has been made many times. It has been ignored at every turn.</li>
<li>If someone wants to start a new article, they can go right ahead. But this will never be improved. It is completely POV and designed to attack Japan's "failure" to account for its past actions. Thus it should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 13:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both of those analogies fail because you're trying to relate unconnected things, rather than related things - see, for example <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_politics_compared_32b9.html" title="Canadian and American politics compared">Canadian and American politics compared</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_health_care_systems_compared_eb0c.html" title="Canadian and American health care systems compared">Canadian and American health care systems compared</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_and_American_economies_compared_e255.html" title="Canadian and American economies compared">Canadian and American economies compared</a>, or generally <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComparisons_a516.html" title="Category:Comparisons">Category:Comparisons</a> for some examples. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The comparisons you mention are not like the one we're talking about here. They're on domestic issues which are fairly uncontroversial. Certainly looking at the start pages, there was no malice intended when they were created. I know the comparisons I made were arbitrary, but I'm having difficulty in finding an unacceptable comparison where you can understand how it's unfair. I don't know, what about comparing Catholicism to Buddhism in terms of sexual child abuse claims? They're both global religions, so why not make a comparison? If you can't see what I'm getting at, I'm not sure what to say. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly (and mostly as an aside) I'll say: <i>If you think comparing the Canadian and American Health Care systems is fairly uncontraversial, then you have been toking too much, and passing too little</i>. But while your point is okay, there is a very strong grounds for a comparison in the germany/japan response to World War II dealies - specifically, that they're allies in WWII (and really, the only important ones), and we're comparing their actions during a time in which they (marginally in practice, but very much in theory) acted together. An article like Comparison of Canadian Internment and American Internment of Japanese during WWII would be pretty reasonable, I think - if the Buddhists and Cathlics teamed up to molest children, then such a comparison might be appropriate. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but there needs to be a "connectedness" for comparisons, not just a "relatedness" <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that the US-Canada comparisons are more fair, because there are good and bad things to say about both sides. HOWEVER, if someone picked an area where Canada or the US appeared completely and utterly disgraceful compared to the other, and it was virtually impossible to argue against it because people had got it into their heads that was the case, would that be fair? No, it wouldn't. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see no reason to believe its unfair based on the <i>outcome</i> of the comparison. If the comparison is appropriate, then it'll be appropriate whether the two parties come out looking equivilent or one comes up roses and one comes up pig shit, it doesn't matter. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh? With that logic, you're saying it's ok to use wikipedia to attack things/people if they're hidden in a comparison. That's ridiculous! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that's not true at all, and it really applies apart from comparisons. Our article on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Douglas_1bb5.html" title="Tommy Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a> is far more flattering than our article on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pol_Pot_2322.html" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a>, but this isn't a problem. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pol Pot was an individual, so that isn't relevant. His page also discusses his entire life. This is a comparison between entire nations on a <b>specific issue</b>. Now you're making improper comparisons. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was responding to your very specific point that because an article makes one person/group look bad and another look good, it's untenable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:46, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You did not respond properly then. Those two people are not compared. I am talking about where someone makes an article to compare things purely to attack one party. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 14:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You said <i>if someone picked an area where Canada or the US appeared completely and utterly disgraceful compared to the other, and it was virtually impossible to argue against it because people had got it into their heads that was the case, would that be fair? No, it wouldn't</i> - which I took to imply that the outcome of the comparison is relevent to whether it's an appropriate comparison to make - an idea that's false. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I've already explained, I'm talking about where a comparison is made purely to discredit/attack/belittle/etc one of the parties in the comparison. Move on now, please. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:27, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If your point is only that the article needs to be cleaned up, I think we've already discussed that at reasonable length. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:30, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, that isn't my point! Look, I've tried to make you understand. You can't/won't. Just leave it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you're making an unclear point, its worth expounding it. I'm not the only one reading this discussion. Other people will attempt to help the discussion come to concensus, and they're also likely to consider your arguments if they're well presented. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I'm going to explain it one more time. You have already made your points, so if you feel I am repeating what I have said, please do not try to confuse readers by complaining again - let them make up their own minds.</li>
<li>The article is too biased in its remit. The comparison was crafted to purely attack Japan by making an unfavourable comparison with Germany. It is not possible to make the article NPOV, because it focuses on this specific comparison which is automatically squeued against Japan. Also the points are mostly discussed elsewhere already - there is no need to repeat what has already been said. No one knows how to actually address and improve this article because however they do it, the squeued nature of it keeps making it NPOV. So it has to be deleted, with the content merged/moved elsewhere if necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 16:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge/Rename</b> — There's already a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_war_crimes.html" title="Japanese war crimes">Japanese war crimes</a> which covers part of this topic. For some reason I can't fathom, there's no corresponding <i>German war crimes</i> or <i>Nazi war crimes</i> page or redirect. (Although there is a <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> page.) The German-specific material could be used to seed a corresponding war crimes page.

<li><b>Comment</b> — Yes, it is true that the Japanese bit repeats a lot of things that are said elsewhere.

<li><b>Merge</b> per John Smith's and RJH into the articles on the war crimes perpetrated by each country. It is hard to see exactly what this article provides that separate articles could not, and the numerous controversies relating to Japan's attitude to the atrocities it has committed are already discussed to death in dozens of other POV-magnet, revert-war-ridden articles. There's no need to waste time cleaning this up when doing so would merely be duplicating effort that is already going on elsewhere. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>To that, it also follows along the line of <b>original paper</b>. Wikipedia as an encycolpedia should chronical what we see as conclusions reported, not what "we" think.

Nonetheless, the article should stay, perhaps being expanded to include all Axis powers (Bulgaria, anyone?) <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcegikmo1_4637.html" title="User:Acegikmo1">Acegikmo1</a> 21:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>"Aren't these two sources comparing the responses of the two countries?"</i> As Endroit points out below, they're only two sources - I said "generally", not all. Besides I didn't make the point until recently, so your complaint is irrelevant.

<dd>But there are 8 OTHER sources which have been introduced. Those 8 other sources and the contents of the article itself are NOT true to these 2 sources just mentioned. Hence the added material being used to compare Germany versus Japan amount to <i>original research</i>, in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Since the added material (80% of the source) is central to the article, we are voting to delete the whole article as proposed. There are other problems relating to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which I clarified above, and that alone is enough to vote for deletion as well.--<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndroit_9764.html" title="User:Endroit">Endroit</a> 08:40, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No need to have an independent article for comparison. It suffices to write on the two issues on the articles of Japanese history and German history respectively. Comparison with Germany may be mentioned on Japan's WW2 article as it's a common criticism of post-war Japan, but presenting it as if it's a legitimate and objective topic is not npov since the way it presents the issues itself is highly politicized. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaintjust_103b.html" title="User:Saintjust">Saintjust</a> 08:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Poorly written, POV nonsense. L0b0t 17:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> per Endroit. World War II and postwar crimes and responses and Category:World War II and postwar crimes which also include the Allies, such as US, UK, China, Dutch, France, and especially USSR in addition to the Axes will be a nice summarization, and comparison within the context is pretty fine but picking up just two countries out of them from a view point that the Allies always have the justice is enough POV. --Jjok 14:05, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The only link between German and Japanese war crimes is that they happened to take place at roughly the same time. Japan and Germany did not fight side-by-side; the war crimes took place completely independently of each other, in different parts of the world, against different victims, while other countries were also committing war crimes (Soviets?) Furthermore, the type of crimes committed is completely different. So a comparison is as relevant as comparing Russia in Chechnya to Israel in Gaza today. Also, counting Japan's crimes against Korea under "WWII War Crimes" is simply incorrect as A) Japan and Korea were not at war, it was colonial rule, which B) started in 1910, long before WWII. Responses of Japan to colonial rule and war crimes is a notable topic worthy of an article but is lost here in an attempt at meaningless comparison. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhonemonkey_dc65.html" title="User:Phonemonkey">Phonemonkey</a> 14:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
