Otherwise, it simply needs cleanup, and while this article does need cleanup, it is certainly notable and sources should be very easy to find. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> 13:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The topic is an encyclopedic idea, but I don't often hear the idiom expressed in this manner. Is a user really going to search for a question, or can we come up with a better name (or place) for the article? (My <i>weak</i> keep doesn't imply I think the content should be deleted, it's just that I haven't ruled out the possibility of a move or merge.) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 14:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am very disappointed that people keep throwing around "bad-faith nomination". I was serious when I listed this at AfD, and am still convinced it does not belong, not solely for content being POV, but because this is simply not encyclopedic. If you disagree with that assessment, then say so...don't tell me I'm listing it in bad-faith. For what reason would I have to do this? This is my first AfD listing, and I tried to follow all of the steps. To <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a>, in edit mode it says "&lt;!-- Add new entries below this line --&gt;", not "Add entries at the bottom of the list. "(Oh, and please add new AfD at the bottom of this page next time)" is a little uncivil. Just one request to the rest of the people who comment here. Please don't throw degrading remarks about me around, just because I nominated an article that you think should stay, or because I'm relatively new (and for the record, I've been around for over a year with a different username before this). <b><a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewnam_d975.html" title="User:Newnam">Newnam</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewnam_f2ce.html" title="User talk:Newnam">(talk)</a></sup></b> 20:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being unverifiable because there are no sources is one of the <i>primary</i> reasons for deleting an article. If the article cites no sources and you cannot find any sources when you do your best to find some, then the article is unverifiable. Whether an article is well-written or not simply doesn't enter into it. It's up to the editor supplying the content (or someone else) to cite sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>In response to Kinu's verdict</b>; This animation is more notable then the bulk of animation articles daily on wikipedia because it is on lifepoint1.com, which gets tens of thousands of uniques per day, Vice faction is a partner animation which shares space with the legendary <a href="../../../x/i/n/Xin.html" title="Xin">Xin</a> flash animation series, its popularity is compareable to it. You cannot tell me this is just a normal shitty flash webcomic, this animation has a notable fan basis. Unlike the normal flash articles you see on here, this flash series plot has been weaved; thought out if you will. This is a major project which spans a major fan appeal, per request we created an article on wikipedia. This article has potential to be added to in the future as more information comes forth, wikipedia is a database for notable information correct? Well this is information, my kind sir. --JLJeremiah 04:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

I was under the impression (maybe mistakenly) that articles about one's self or one's own work should not be created by that person, but by an outside source.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> There are plenty less relevent bands with live articles on Wikipedia. It fits several caveats of WP:Music not limited to major radio play in both Chicago (the #3 market in the country), allmusic, MTV, and just a fairly large underground internet following. They're not quite mc chris but behind mc chris and mc frontalot, they're probably the next biggest thing in nerdcore. Just because a bunch of you haven't heard of them doesn't really make a vaild reason to delete. I've never heard of Shar Jackson and she's got a Wikipedia page that somehow fits WP:Music. mcchrisfan

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is still new and has content that needs refining. Infomation and screenshots were taken from the main website, or from what has been said by developers on the forum (the information is publically available for use), so no, its not original content, but I find acurate information from reliable resources much more important, don't you? As for player base (I think this means the ammount of players it gets), the game has many 1000's of players. According to the developer, it was recorded that the game got around 172 new account sign ups in less than 12 hours! As for Vainity issue, it is no different from any other games page I have seen. The title, screenshots, infomation about the game, links to fan sites etc.... Theres no text such as "greatest game", "best game", "you'll die if you dont play" etc. I've tried to keep it as neutral as possible. So my vote goes with "dont delete". If you want something changed, leave a note on the talk page, or do it yourself. --K776 19:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>"Thousands" of accounts is really not all that many. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 06:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to a dev on the forum, 172 or so new members signed up in a matter of hours. 172 (users per 12 hours) * 2 (2 lots of 12 in 24&#160;:P) * 7 = 2400+ in only a week. Now those wont be the exact figures obviously because on/off peak signups, but it should give some idea that when I said thousands, I obviously understated. --K776 20:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That still isn't very much. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, for example, had around six million players in February 2006. The US release was in November 2004, so, assuming that players signed up at a constant rate, that comes out to roughly a hundred thousand new players per week. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thats not a good comparison. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> is not shockwave based, and it's made by a big company with funding, not an individual in his/her spare time. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> also had a prevous player base, from its 3 predecessors (Warcraft I, II, and III), starting with Warcraft in 1994 (12 years ago). <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> is also finished.

<li>Point is, 172 users in a 12-hour period isn't all that many. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This game - and this comment may be biased, note - is quite good, and still in the beta stages (I am a tester, myself). To delete this page would not accomplish anything, that I can tell, except to upset the programmers, testers, etc. There are 438 software companies listed on this site, and I recognize a few as being in on gaming (RealNetworks among them). I did not see any of the high-profile companies (such as THQ, but it is in the database of WP). To conclude: do not delete the QL page, as it is just as valid as the page for <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freespace.html" title="Freespace">Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War</a></i>, and other games.--Bigfootti 20:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well then, change it so it suits the guidelines or tell people what to do to make sure it doesn't get deleted. --K776
<ul>
<li>The first question we have to consider is whether Quantum Legacy is a worthy subject for an article in Wikipedia at all. The criteria we use to determine that can be found at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. If the game doesn't meet any of the criteria there, changing the article won't help. But if you think the game <i>does</i> meet at least one of the criteria at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, then clearly indicate in the article how it meets those criteria, and cite reliable sources to help prove that. Then come back here and explain that you have edited the article and how the game satisfies <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. I will offer a <b>neutral</b> recommendation for now to encourage you to do that. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, QL comes under number 2. It is innovative and significant, being the first Shockwave based, browser or downloadable based, multiplayer game of its kind to offer concepts such as multi-time and multi-sector. --K776 20:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This page is not spam it is just trying to get more people to join with the game theres nothing wrong with that another thing is there are other articles just like it here on wikipedia and you are not deleting them it doesnt seem fair or even make sense to delete this page because its trying to get people to try out this game. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sk8ter823 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sk8ter823_9336.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sk8ter823">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This game is unique in that it is a full-version game that runs directly in your browser. I think that this fact satisfies part 2 of <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> well enough. And I don't think that it can be called advertising because it was not written by anyone affiliated with Four Thirty One Interactive, it was written by a group of players of the game. As someone has already said, it is just as valid as the article about <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freespace.html" title="Freespace">Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War</a></i>. That is why I vote to keep the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.109.27.115 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.109.27.115_0e0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.109.27.115">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Looking at all the delete votes, they cite <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as reasons why this article should be deleted. I believe the reason QL is fine under Software has been stated clearly enough already, the article is not vain, as it has been written and edited by players of the game who weren't involved in the programming, design or promotion of it, and it is not original research, all statements made in the article are either clearly labelled as opinion/speculation or can be verified by four-thirty one. --Jabor 04:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question isn't whether the statements can be verified by the game publisher/developer, but whether the statements can be verified by independent reliable sources. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 14:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verify independently? 2 things: (One) Play it yourself, and offer judgement; (Two) recruit people from WP, and ask them to play and offer judgement. --Bigfootti 16:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I played the game myself, or other editors played the game themselves, that would still be original research. Furthermore, if the goal is to prove that the game is unique because it is a full-version game that runs directly in your browser, or because it's the first Shockwave based, browser or downloadable based, multiplayer game of its kind to offer concepts such as multi-time and multi-sector, just playing the game would not prove that, since other games might meet those criteria too without my knowing it. On the other hand, if reviewers for, say, <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Gaming_World_5490.html" title="Computer Gaming World">Computer Gaming World</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../p/c/_/PC_Gamer_a838.html" title="PC Gamer">PC Gamer</a></i> confirmed those claims, that would be independent verification. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Metro90, it is hard to get a game from an up-and-coming company into the limelight for such a review. WP may be the best way to do so.&#160;:) --Bigfootti 16:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Metropolitan90, are you saying that if I got it listed somewhere in say NetGuide (a NZ (and I think Au also) publication, then the page could stay? Or does it need to be in a US magazine? --K776 03:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/t/NetGuide_4de4.html" title="NetGuide">NetGuide</a> looks like a legitimate reliable source at first glance, although I personally am not familiar enough with it to say so definitively, and of course other editors may disagree. But, in general, there is no requirement that a reliable source be from any particular country. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Trouble is, even if NetGuide decided to publish it in their next issue, thats still two weeks away, and dont these types of debates only last 5 days? How would someone go about suspending the page (or archiving it) till its published? Cause a lot of work has been put into the article and deleting it would be a waste. --K776 04:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Who said it was for promoting the game? The game already has more than enough players. And it is notable. As said above, "According to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, QL comes under number 2. It is innovative and significant, being the first Shockwave based, browser or downloadable based, multiplayer game of its kind to offer concepts such as multi-time and multi-sector." --K776 03:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Whatever. Point is, I don't think there's anything it's doing that hasn't been done before in some way, shape, or form. The mere combination of pre-existing concepts (like "multi-time" and "multi-sector", whatever those mean) doesn't really add up to something really "innovative and significant", particularly as there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> confirming that this combination of features is indeed unique. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s> Weak Delete</b> (revoted, see comment below) - Wow, the sock puppetry. You really should have brought only one person in here to argue for keeping it, since you're all saying the same thing, and none of the arguments are grounded in wikipedia policy. QL does NOT pass point 2 of the software guidlines - read the last clause of that sentence and you'll understand. You and I do not qualify as reliable sources. Basically, wikipedia is not free advertising. You've stated that you're not trying to advertise, but then encourage people to try it out for themselves. That's blatant advertising. Wikipedia is here to report the findings of *other* peer-reviewed publications, that's why verifiability and no original research are so important. Advertise elsewhere and let someone else not affiliated with the game make the article AFTER it becomes famous (and yes, testers are affiliated).129.61.46.16 13:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh
<ul>
<li>The edits address the Vanity and NPOV problems in the original version, which certainly helps and shows good faith on the creators' part. I still don't think it passes the verifiability and original research policies (which are two of the most important policies here), since no independent peer reviewed publications have been shown to cover the game to date. And that is not Wikipedia's job. The edits are making it into a useful article, one that would be acceptable if it becomes notable enough without wikipedia's help. 68.106.198.28 00:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh
<ul>
<li>If I've read it correctly, original research means information that isn't reliable/doesn't have a reliable source, right? Well, everything on that page has been said by the developer of the game, Miles. How much more reliable can you get? --K776 00:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, not exactly. Let me give you an example - if <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawkings_06b5.html" title="Stephen Hawkings">Stephen Hawkings</a> were to come to me and say that his theory on <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a> was patent nonsense, then that would not be acceptable to be put on wikipedia, even if I could provide proof of the email. If the New York Times reported that he said it, it would be reported that "in 2006, Stephen Hawkings raised objections about..." on a wikinews article, and might get a mention on the Hawking radiation page in a controversy section. However, until he published his findings in a peer reviewed scientific publication, the article would retain the incorrect information, as it is the most verifiable. I realize that it's difficult to draw analogies between hard science and small online games, but similar standards apply. If the game developer has publicly stated the design intentions of the game in a press release (or equivalent), then it can be mentioned that they said that - but one man's personal opinion, no matter how intimately he knows his subject, is Original Research until it has been peer reviewed. Ok, this is getting long, but I hope that helped clarify the policy as I understand it. 68.106.198.28 01:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Even more wow as I try to edit the article to remove the worst of the advertising and to tag all of the things that <b>might not</b> be advertising if they can find sources to back them up...the article uses the word "you" in reference to you as a player so many times that I'm not going to bother trying to remove it. That's blatant and terribly bad encyclopedic style, and wonderful advertisement style. Rewrite the article with an emphasis on how independent publications have reported on the game, instead of why someone should sign up. Otherwise, it is an advertisement and has no place in an encyclopedia. 129.61.46.16 14:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh

<li>^ Pointless comment above. ^ I checked the 'under developement' category page, and there are a large number of games on there which have had little to no large-scale publicity. This article has just enough information to get a reader interested, and has a full web site to back it up. I looked up some other UD games, and found Galaxylife, whose release date is marked as 'soon'. QL, on the other hand, is in open beta, and is arguably full-featured, compared to some post-release games. The largest obstacle to the release of QL is thhe fact that some bugs still need ironing out, and somewhere around half the (SP) storyline is unpublished (to the testers).--Bigfootti 19:43, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In the case of "under development" games, those articles are (or should be) nothing more than stubs, placeholders that give information in a press release (usually circulated in peer-reviewed publications) about expected release information. If the article is basically blanked and says that QL is an upcoming MMORPG with X release date, will be set in X world, and will run in the X environment, then that's all the article needs. The fact that other articles don't do that just means that other game developers are abusing wikipedia as well. The current article does nothing more than gush about how great it is and how you should sign up and play. Wikipedia covers a wide range of topics that a paper encyclopedia wouldn't because of space constraints, but it is still an encyclopedia, not free advertising space. 129.61.46.16 20:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Josh
<ul>
<li>This discussion could go on until QL is oficially released, and we'd still not have a satisfactory solution. QL is a free and open beta, effectively released, and being upgraded and bug-checked regularly. As such, it coincides with both full-release and UD game headings.-Bigfootti 22:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Josh, if say 99% of the page was to be deleted out then, would that means the actual article could stay there until it is notable, then be reverted back to the revision atm? Or is that againsr wiki policy? --K776 05:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Am I missing something? The article, while it very much needs a ton of work, has the essentials for a CVG article. Lots of stuff should be moved around , citations are needed, as well as the "game under dev" tag, but it seems that it's a very valid article in and of itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> This debate is admittedly somewhat confusing at this point, and for good reason. Since the beginning of the AFD, the article has been edited heavily - most of the earlier discussion was about a version of the article that would indeed never be acceptable on Wikipedia. Since then, it's really turned into a debate over notability, which is more subjective. Just hope that clarifies. JoshWook 18:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Although not as well known as Bailey and the like, he is relatively well known within the fashion photography business for his work in wedding fashion. I heard him interviewed by the BBC on radio around three years ago and he has featured in one or two documentaries over the last few years that I know of. I'm inclined to agree with Griss that maybe his name should be removed from the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion_photography.html" title="Fashion photography">Fashion photography</a> article, but left in the general list of well known and less well known <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographers.html" title="Photographers">Photographers</a>.

- The article still isn't needed.

<li><b>original research</b> as CAN defines term for a new paradigm in relation to virtual computing. Current grid models apportion compute cycles/resource elastically to a single problem / defined set of problems across multiple physical nodes and interconnected software resources. The CAN concept avoids the multiple physical execution environment scheduling required by such concepts by dynamically creating appropriately sized software execution environments (SEEs) (i.e. single OS instances in a statically defined environment) and moving virtual images (files) between differently sized virtual 'physical' environments. The limits of the solution are the maximum sizes of virtual machines used in the hardware 'pool' used to create the CAN. Until this <b>neologism</b> is endorsed by community/industry players, it must, by wikipedia rules, be excluded. --Boiledfrog 23:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> All of the above and in particular the last comment from TechTarget would seem to re-inforce my suggestion that the Term should be renamed to Compute Pool. To re-iterate my earlier comments whilst the phrase Compute Area Network in itself is a neologism/protologism, the concept it is trying to define is not. Under the aforementioned <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22compute+resource%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22compute+resource%22" rel="nofollow">google test</a> (apologies not sure of the syntax to allow AND Virtualization into the Google URL, Googlers will need to do this manually) searching for the Term Compute Resource and Virtualization returns many more hits than Compute Area Network, so again my comment to the Wiki community is would it be an acceptable option to rename as Compute Resource with the same definition?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Concerned from Edinburgh. Virtualization with an S or Z (Z...sigh....) is not a "real" word so any real words, acronyms, abbreviations etc are preferred in a Google society which dilutes the English language. Edinburgh 11:43, 02 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> A site doesn't have to be popular to be important (and the converse is true: popularity does not necessarily mean a site is important).

In addition, they now have a series of DVDs that they collaborate on with Eureka (an indiciation of how seriously their site is taken), which, while not exactly rivalling <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Criterion_Collection_4163.html" title="The Criterion Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> in popularity, do rival them in how seriously they are taken amongs collectors of both obscure and canonical artefacts of cinematic history. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 15:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> However, the whole point is that MoC is <i>not</i> merely an "impressive sized list of links". Look in the top right hand corner of the <a href="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/" rel="nofollow">MoC site</a>. They have (in addition to their own <i>cinephile</i> DVD Series) four distinctive branch sites (painstakingly crafted over the last 8 years by the MoC creators themselves) all of which contain unique (i.e., not found anywhere else — where else can you find a decent photo of the reclusive <a href="http://www.nostalghia.com/ThePhotos/T20.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.nostalghia.com/ThePhotos/T20.jpg" rel="nofollow">Chris Marker</a>?) content. The four sites are well-known to cinephiles world-wide: <a href="http://www.nostalghia.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nostalghia.com/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Tarkovsky Site</a>, <a href="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/bresson/" class="external text" title="http://www.mastersofcinema.org/bresson/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Bresson Site</a>, <a href="http://www.ozuyasujiro.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ozuyasujiro.com/" rel="nofollow">The MoC Ozu Site</a>, and the <a href="http://www.carldreyer.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.carldreyer.com/" rel="nofollow">MoC Dreyer Site</a>. These all have original content written by, among others, family and close friends of these four filmmakers, and they consistitute an invaluable resource to researchers (i.e., users of wikipedia). I think most of the drive-by shootings in this debate (does not apply to author Allen3) stem from a lack of (or a mere cursory) understanding of the whole MoC concept. The MoC Wikipedia page will obviously need to clarify things better, once it becomes a proper stub.--Stalker63 03:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>KEEP.</b> This is one of the most valuable sources for cinema on the web. It offers not only intelligent, thoughtful analysis of great directors (such as Tarkovsky, Dreyer, Ozu, and Bresson), but also is a invaluable source of DVD information. This site talks about discs from all around the globe, not just releases in North America. As cited before, Bright Lights Film Journal and the Chicago Reader have linked this website because of its very well researched information. I really don't understand why this website is scheduled for deletion. It's a real website that has been in existence for years, dedicated to those who take film/cinema seriously. I think that Wikipedia can save itself a lot of time by leaving this page alone, when there are much more egregious violations out there. I was at a comedy club recently, and a comic told a story about how he created his own page here (which, Wikipedia decided to delete). The Masters of Cinema website contributes a great deal to the world of film. If people really wish for things to delete, perhaps they should delete people like <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a>, the godawful <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a> contestant who has no artistic value whatsoever, and has made no contribution to society at all.

Chicago Sun-Times resident film critic <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> (of <i>Siskel &amp; Ebert</i> fame) has also provided fascinating input especially written for this MoC site (see their Topics' section).

Surely there are better things you people could be doing than going around and trying to get every article under some arbitrary alexa rating deleted?

<dd>Well, it seems to me that the citations listed above and below already qualify it under those criteria. At the very least, nobody has really tried to counter them. Given that everyone seems to be ignoring them, I wonder what the point in continuing further is? In any case, given that we have at least four distinct people supporting the article's continuing existence, what happens next? Do we delete it because we could fail to build a consensus for keeping it, or do we keep it because the <s>delete-happy</s> users <b>in favor of deleting</b> failed to drum up enough support against the article? I've never involved myself this much in the deletion process, so I'm curious to see where it goes. <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a> 00:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>, for sake of clarity, let me just state I'm not an administrator here or anything and I'm merely stating my own opinion. If you are refering to the list of links Msbailey provided, <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a> basically answered why that does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The first criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states <i>"the content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."</i> a link to a site, or including the site in a list of seminal sites does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Stalker63 also provided some links, but these were largely either links to sections of the Masters of Cinema site, or were external links to articles where Masters of Cinema were mentioned in passing, but the articles were not about Masters of Cinema. There has also been a claim made that MoC meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but again meeting <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requires <i>"multiple non-trivial published works</i>" and I only see one external cite provided that has non-trivial coverage of one of their products. Where this goes from here depends on the closing admin. This is not a numerical vote, so the closing admin has to decide if there is consensus to keep, delete, or no consensus either way (no consensus defaults to keep). Generally, newly registered users and those who render opinions from IPs without creating a user have their opinions weighed less unless they make an actual argument based on the accepted guidelines and policies at Wikipedia. Basically, the admin is looking for a consensus, though I've seen cases where numerically the consensus was split, but the result was either outright keep or delete because one side did not make a compelling argument. Usually the whole process takes roughly 5 days from nomination. Hope that clears it up. Also <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJun-Dai_fdd3.html" title="User:Jun-Dai">Jun-Dai</a>, please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> Thank you, Isotope23, that does help. If one looks at MoC as a DVD label (not just as a website), one will see that they are, in fact, highly notable. Several of their DVDs have been featured as 'DVD of the Month' in <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sight_%26_Sound_49c3.html" title="Sight &amp; Sound">Sight &amp; Sound</a>, the film magazine published by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Film_Institute_c705.html" title="British Film Institute">British Film Institute</a>. Their DVDs often show up as 'DVD of the Month' and in best-of-year polls on DVD Beaver (a website with a low Alexa rating and no Wikipedia page but which has been cited numerous times in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>): <a href="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/feature.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/feature.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/feature.htm</a>.

<li><b>Apology</b> - I forgot in my haste to click the "sign it" button on my last entry, as I was responding directly to a response to my already signed entry. I was not aware that there is a limit of one "keep" per person. If "this is not a vote" (as stated in the box at the top), why was my "keep" overstricken, as if it was a vote? I believe, personally, that the <i>discussion itself</i> has established that there is no justifiable reason to delete the page from the encyclopaedia. There are many good, considered reasons brought forward for keeping it, and mostly (not exclusively) a few pat responses and glib formal comments brought against. --Stalker63 06:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, It's a courtesy consideration.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Agreed with Stalker63. Looking at all the comments on this page, it strikes me how sad it is that the Wiki-ites cannot <i>quickly</i> see the worth of both the Masters of Cinema Series of DVDs and this entry at Wikipedia from the information provided.

<li><b>Comment</b>, saying there are other DVD labels that justify inclusion of this one is a straw-man argument. Those DVD labels either meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria, or they too should be nominated for deletion. The presence of articles about similar items or entities does not condone inclusion of a specific item or entity. Each article has to stand on it's own, meet accepted policies, and be subject to accepted guidelines. The question isn't whether or not "Masters of Cinema" has "worth"; it is whether or not it meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. There are tons of websites out there that to me personally (and a like-minded group of enthusiasts) have an immense amount of worth... but if I saw an article written about them on Wikipedia, I would sadly have to opine deletion becuase they cannot be proven to meet Wikipedia's accepted guidelines for having an article about the topic.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 12:56, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Down the center of the page is a month-by-month calendar of upcoming DVD releases of major films. The site's growing library of recent articles on international cinema is evident on the right side of the home page; there are links to articles and a list of more than 100 directors also included with links to at least a biographical essay and, at most, a Web site devoted to that director. This section also offers useful links to dealers in everything from DVDs and video to film posters; critical reviews; online writing support for budding screenwriters; and film publications. The particular appeal of this site is its commitment to world cinema-there is a good balance of international film and US movies, with overall emphasis on the achievements of the filmmakers and the films themselves. Summing Up: Essential. All film collections. August 2005."--Msbailey 16:44, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b> I WOULD vote with my feet to keep this site. It is non-commercial in nature, maintained by the devotees of the Art known as Cinema and thus belongs to the general treasure of knowledge, rightfully here in wikipedia. I personally have seen entries in this encyclopedia with infinitely less content and shallow essence, so why the heck not a professional site (one of its kind) entirely devoted to the true masters of Cinema? IMO it would be a big loss to Wikipedia if you delete this article. Please consider keeping it. Thank u in advance.Eenspaaier 02:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I don't quite understand the reason for deletion of either the company page or the Film page, the purpose of both the Company's page (since we discovered it was added here) and the Film page was to allow for people to get information about our company. Being that we are a smaller company, not exactly fortune 500 stuff, our company has always followed a loose, internet based distribution system. This film in question, Thanatos's Memento, is our first major project that we believe deserved some attention before we released it to the internet. As such, the wikipedia page was added, on top of our blog having mention of the movie not being able to make it into the festival, but was being considered to be re-shot and later distributed. We are not trying to sell or push a product. The intention is to assist those who want information on our latest endevours yet cannot get access to our web page (as it is currently under heavy re-design, and being moved from our host as it seems to have a problem with us.</p>
<p>Quite simply, I vote <b>Keep</b>, although without the company page in existance I guess it'd be hard for people to find THIS page. Somehow, you all have. Zombi3 01:30, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I explained on the talk page of this article, the company page likely failed the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">guidelines for inclusion of companies</a> in the eyes of the deleting administrator. (This was the same criteria I used in the original proposal for deletion, just before it was speedied.) To be considered notable, this film would require verifiable sources - discussion of it in major publications, generally. With not even being released yet, and with that release planned for Internet only, it is quite likely not notable enough to be included in this encyclopedia. If you have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> that can be added to prove notability, please do so, and they will be considered by editors viewing this nomination. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(speak)</a></small> 02:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry, but this film is non-notable. No reviews, no awards, no distributor.

<dd><i>Comment to above</i>: I would recommend leaving the 'I've fallen and I can't get up' article where it is. It was created years ago as an example of a catch phrase, and the fact that one of these sorts of companies popularized the phrase was completely secondary to who said it, when, and examples of its use. I could certainly see 'Emergency response bracelets' being a 'See also' on that page, though. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkybunny_81fd.html" title="User:Skybunny">Skybunny</a> 17:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as advertising. if this were a real attempt at being encyclopedic, it'd be a generalized article about the devices in general. The one mention of consumer complaints (as an external link) doesn't come nearly to any sort of level of fairness or openness about the topic. Being "best known" (though this is as yet an undocumented claim) doesn't matter in terms of the article being pure advertisement. It's all about one company and its services. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 10:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have no doubt that this is a real phenomenon, but is this really a relevant topic? I mean, you can turn just about anything into a fetish, and that process is relevant (we already have an <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_fetish.html" title="Sexual fetish">article</a> about that, too), but surely the idea of having an article for every single thing someone has a sexual fixation on is counterproductive? Are we going to have a separate articles for hobbit fetishes? Ent fetishes? Highly specific food fetishes, like porridge fetishes? I mean, yeah, I exaggerate, but not that much. I just don't see any point in this. (Also, article cites no references and is probably original research, but that's kinda beside the point.) <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term SDIMBY is a valid term and has been in use, although for a relatively short time. "Smart Growth" and "Smart Development" are two terms easily found through Google. Those that encourage these approaches to development are known as SDIMBYs. The application of the acronym is usually associated not with the urban planners but rather with the communities and the grassroots activists that are seeking a balance between the interests of the community and the interests of the developers.</p>
<p>The term SDIMBY has been in use in Los Angeles for well over a year. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.118.248.77 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.118.248.77.html" title="User talk:71.118.248.77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.118.248.77_7677.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.118.248.77">contribs</a>) 01:50, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>SDIMBY is a needed term to help define the subtle but significant approaches made to development. There are nany terms like Yimby and NIABY that only recently appeared . SDIMBY is only the latest and shows a distinct difference between the others listed. There are other writers willing to expnd on this term, but only if it is not considered for deletion.Thanks for your diligent consideration. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.118.248.77 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.118.248.77.html" title="User talk:71.118.248.77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.118.248.77_7677.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.118.248.77">contribs</a>) 04:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Instead of leaping immediately to delete, I had proposed merging this article with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> (see the discussion about why and the results at the<a href="../../../h/i/n/Talk%7EHindi_2f78.html#Proposed_merge_of_Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_into_this_article" title="Talk:Hindi">Hindi talk page</a>). The consensus of was that this article ought not to be merged into the Hindi article. That brings me to this nomination. This article, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a>, is indiscriminate as it provides no basis for what words are to be included on the list and which are not. There is no similar article for any other language that I could find (other than a few pages about words English has borrowed from other languages). They might be out there, but I did not see any. There is also no article on Most common words in Hindustani for this article to support. Anything in this article is more than adequately covered in the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#History" title="Hindi">history</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#Vocabulary" title="Hindi">vocabulary</a> sections of the main Hindi article without any need to refer to this article. I am also concerned about this article being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Finally, I am wondering about proper copyright authorization because of the odd line in the article, "The derivations below are based on posts by Yashwant Malaiya, and are given here by his consent". No verification of this is provided anywhere. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 01:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is properly referenced to Dr. Yashwant Malaiya, Professor at Colorado State University,Fort Collins, CO, USA. as well as other sources (see the References section). He is also a Wikipedia editor. (see his userpage: <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalaiya_1119.html" title="User:Malaiya">User:Malaiya</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> What <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> forgot to mention was that the reason most people did not accept the merge is because they felt that it would be a good standalone article and main article for the Vocabulary section on the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> page. (Please see <a href="../../../h/i/n/Talk%7EHindi_2f78.html" title="Talk:Hindi">Talk:Hindi</a>) Three out of four individuals on the talk page wanted to keep the article as a sepate page! I think this should be acknowledged. The article is also well referenced and well written. Topics covered in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words_6b78.html" title="Origin of some common Hindustani words">Origin of some common Hindustani words</a> are not covered in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html#History" title="Hindi">history</a>. These articles deal with totally different things. This article is also the main article for the vocabulary sections of three pages: <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani.html" title="Hindustani">Hindustani</a>, and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>. Also, this article is being worked on currently by myslef and other Wikipedians. I would very much appreciate if you kept this worthy article. Patel24 07:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but <b>wants a better title</b>. An entire Hindustani etymological dictionary, or even a fairly representative subset of such a dictionary, probably is beyond the scope of the project, and unhelpful to users on the English encyclopedia. But move this to Sources of the Hindustani lexicon or some similar name, and it probably wouldn't be here. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> did not mention that Professor Yashwant Malaiya (the individual whom the article is referenced to) himslef is the author of the article (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Origin_of_some_common_Hindustani_words&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>)He used his other professional Hindi collegiate level sites as his source for the article. I took a look at the article and it was very lucid and interesting. I am going to help by developing this article even more so. It would be a shame if this article was deleted.

<li>Please re-read my nomination discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Sat Sri Akal. It seems like the wide consensus here is to keep the article. I, myself, looked over the article and feel that it is a good and worthy one. I also agree with the other opinions of those who wish to preserve the article. In the near future, I also hope to add to the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is well worth keeping. Yeah. 70.104.119.81 23:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but rename. The title is nonspecific, and should be an article on the evolution of Hindi words with some used as examples. The exmamples shouldn't define the article's name.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Regarding the notability issue, I get 12 distinct Google hits for "bachelor cottage" +movie, seven of which are IMDB pages, and a couple of blog mentions and showtimes.

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b></s> Back again for <i>keeps</i>. I choose to give it the benefit of the doubt. The Google and IMDB links are strong reason in favor of noteability. Why? I'm hearing a little bias in this discussion persuading the editors and possible admins from student films in general (and from Harvard in the nom), so I'm going to be <b>bold</b>, as Wiki asked when I joined up, and suggest we consider merit and not number of hits.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"Has anyone seen the film?"</i> That's exactly the point: practically nobody has. The movie has no distribution, which, barring an Oscar nomination or some other claim to fame, makes it inherently non-notable. Tens of thousands of student films are made, shown to other students and maybe an indy festival or two, and then are forgotten.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I saw the film. After my 7/31 <s><b>keep</b></s> and being an active NY film buff, I wanted to see for myself what this discussion was about. Yeah, doesn't sound like the short film is too well known. But I'm here to report that the film is pretty <i>notable</i>. Yesterday's screening was a small but excellent sample of new filmmaking. Very impressive and probably doesn't need a self-referential claim of notability to be what it is. Glad its on IMDB. Once again, for those who haven't seen it but enjoy an ever-evolving encyclopedia: <s><b>KEEP.</b></s> NYcine 6:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC) <small><b>Note</b>: Multiple recommendation from this user struck out per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>.</small></li>

<li>Thank you for your attention to this article and for taking it to AfD for further discussion.</li>

<p>Quoting from the WP:BIO, "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. <b>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted</b>". However, I do believe Michael does fall into at least two of these categories and if there is a dispute about this, I ask that the following be considered along with the previous statement from the WP:BIO.</p>
<p>Michael has "...made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their [his] specific field". Despite the fact that mainstream media will not cover alternative views on 9-11, its remarkable that he has gotten so much recognition, especially in Colorado. Two cover stories have been written in local, highly visible, alternative newspapers (The Rocky Mountain Bullhorn and the Boulder Weekly) as a result of Michael's work. One featured Michael and although he was not quoted in the second one, he was interviewed and appeared in the photograph that accompanied the cover story.</p>
<p>Michael is also well known for his radio appearences both locally in Colorado and nationally. He has made numerous appearances on several radio stations in Colorado and guest hosted many times for the program Words of Freedom with George Flynn.</p>
<p>Michael was recognized nationally when he was asked to serve on the board of directors with 911truth.org, which as noted previously, is a major component in the 9-11 truth movement.</p>
<p>Michael's work is also featured prominently on 9-11 related websites with great regularity.</p>
<p>I believe, as others do, that Michael has indeed made a "widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their [his] specific field".</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, I also believe that Michael is also a "Person[s] achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". Certainly, the events of September 11th are newsworthy and it is obvious that Michael has been recognized for his work.</p>
<p>By the way, yes, I do know Michael and I am the one who saw your huge section on 9-11 conspiracy theories. I think Michael should be included in the section with all the other <a href="../../../r/e/s/Researchers_questioning_the_official_account_of_9_11_872c.html" title="Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11">Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11</a>. If this is being viewed as a vanity article, please help me to re-write it or give me suggestions so that it conforms with the Wikipedia guidelines. Thank you. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisibility911_6c2c.html" title="User:Visibility911">Visibility911</a> 00:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Moreover, I just pointed to sources that say that it isn't just the same topic by another name. That editors have edited it into a duplicate of an article on a different topic is a byproduct of their <i>not working from sources</i>.

<li>While all your sources use the term "constitutional republic", <b>none of them explains the difference between a <i>constitutional</i> republic and a plain republic</b>. They seem more interested in differentiating a <i>democracy</i> from a republic.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I challenge your assertion that the article can ever be expanded in any meaningful way. The only thing that can really be said about a constitutional republic is that it is a republic governed according to a constitution. Then the article would have to launch into a discussion of what "republic" means, which would make it a content fork of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>. If you believe that it is possible to write even a stub about constitutional republics without duplicating material from the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> article, I invite you to <i>do it yourself</i> as a demonstration. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 21:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The CIA and the FBI classify countries as various kinds of republics, but <b>neither of them explains what a "constitutional republic" actually means</b>.

<li>And deletion is not the sole way to remedy vandalism, per <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>.

Firebug</a>, the problems relevant here are lack of cited sources and overemphasis of minority viewpoints. The notion of a constitutional republic is <i>far</i> from being a minority viewpoint, given that one can find reams of mainstream sources (only a very few of which I hyperlinked to above) explaining what one is, employing the concept, and explaining that it is not the same as a plain republic. The article didn't cite sources from the start, and so editors worked from memory and inference from the existing text and came up with a clone of another, different, concept. The solution to that is to <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" rel="nofollow">insist upon sources</a>.

<li>Again, the only difference between a constitutional republic and a plain "republic" is that a constitutional republic uses a constitution.

<li><b>Keep</b> Nikodemos is wrong to say that it is the identical definition to a liberal democracy. The United Kingdom is a liberal democracy but it is not a republic. It is a monarchy.

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> There is a substantial difference between a <i>republic</i> and a <i>democracy</i>. And yes, this extends to their sub-groups - there is a difference between a "liberal democracy" and any kind of "republic". This article should be expanded to be on par with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">Constitutional monarchy</a> another "split" from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a>. Further, I do not see any sources in either article supporting the AfD's contention that they are the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>An example of a difference would be noted early on in the liberal democracy article - liberal democracies are pluralistic and consider rights to be "created" by the government. Constitutional republics (and this isn't in its article yet only b/c it hasn't been expanded properly) <i>avoid</i> pluralism - the tyranny of the majority - and consider rights to be <i>inherent</i> to the person, regardless of what the law may say. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim4christ17_a2d0.html" title="User:Tim4christ17">Tim4christ17</a> 19:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>This would seem to be in disagreement with a number of existing Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">Liberal democracy</a> itself says "<i>There is general agreement that the states of the European Union, Japan, the United States, Canada... are liberal democracies</i>". The Freedom House survey methodology states "<i>all Free countries qualify as both electoral and liberal democracies</i>", and my assumption is that political science textbooks would generally classify the United States (and other potential "constitutional republics") as liberal democracies. Therefore I can't see how this article could successfully be expanded in the direction you suggest. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - while Nikodemos may not be fully correct that this is fully equivalent to "liberal democracy", certainly it would appear to be subset of it. In any case, the point would seem to be that a "constitutional republic" whatever it might be, is certainly a subset of "republic", and needs to be covered there in the first instance. Currently it isn't, which lends credence to the "fork" or "duplicate article" arguments. If that coverage at some point justifies breaking it out in "main article/sub article" format, it can be done then, but right now that certainly isn't the case. I've made further points in response to the "Uncle G" and "Tim4christ17" comments above. Finally, I note the problematic <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_democracy.html" title="Republican democracy">republican democracy</a> article, which covers similar ground.- <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Later Update: I further note the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a> article, which again covers similar territory. These all seem to be attempts to exclusively define variant (or overlapping) ground. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">Constitutional democracy</a> would seem to be inclusive of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_republic.html" title="Constitutional republic">constitutional republic</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_democracy.html" title="Republican democracy">republican democracy</a>. I now believe the best thing would be to upgrade <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a>, making the other two terms redirects. It would link from and refer to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> (and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>) as necessary. If the three terms are preferentially used in various cases for rhetorical or ideological effect, then this information can be included. Note that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a> currently has flaws of its own, which include contrasting (and implicitly opposing) to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_democracy.html" title="Parliamentary democracy">Parliamentary democracy</a> in the intro, yet including countries (Germany, Greece, etc.) from that article its own list, but this can be fixed. Since there appears to be little or no content in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_republic.html" title="Constitutional republic">constitutional republic</a> that can't be derived from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> this is still effectively a Delete vote, but if necessary the closing admin can consider it "Merge and Redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a>. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 23:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all, no, this isn't a "backyard wrestling article" as you so put it Kinu. Secondly, this isn't spam for a site that would fail. The site is anything but failing. We have new participants at a contant rate. By putting something on here, it allows more people to get an introduction to a game that is fun to play. I for one say <b>Do Not Delete</b> the article. Then again, what do I know. I'm simply a wrestling fan, a group of people who are looked down upon by the rest of civilization for watching "fake rasslin", and I'm also a gamer, yet another group of people who are looked down upon and considered "geeks" who live in their parent's basement. We're people, just like the rest of you, and we're simply trying to reach other people. --187inthe317
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems that many wrestling leagues have been posting articles recently, most likely out of sheer coincidence, and I apologize if my comment was somewhat coarse and based on that generalization. However, please note that AfD is not a debate as to the merits of wrestling, its fans, etc., but whether the article itself meets the "rough justice" Wikipedia criteria for inclusion. In this case, the guideline used by other editors is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and unfortunately no evidence from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> is presented that such is the case. You are more than welcome to address those issues so that the community may make a more informed decision.

<li>there is no message anywhere telling people to come here and say KPW should stay. KPW wont fail, it's still running and means alot to the people who are a part of it. Hell, they gave up time to write this long article. I say keep it. Introduce new people to a fun game, that anyone can do. And i have too much respect for wrestlers to attempt any backyard wrestling. KPW is electronic, not set up in someones garden.</li>

<p>Anyone who would bash Pastor Scott doesn't have a clue what a christian is. Just because someone might have a "shady" past doesn't mean jack squat now. This is present time, when you become a christian you are forgiven for all sins. Right? right. Therefore all of the people wanting to know if she was into pornographic this and that. They just want to know for their own perverted minds not because they care. Furthermore if she has in fact been in any pornographic films, etc. That was then, non of our business and just leave her alone. She is doing the Lords bidding now. Plus, FACT: She will tell you she was the last person to ever think that she could be saved. It goes to show that God really does work in mysterious ways. Those of you who bash her, he just hasn't got to you yet. God Bless!-a christian</p>

<li>You might take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and review the information regarding groups/clubs. Basically, the issue is your club needs to be notable to a broad range of people. If your club is only notable at school, or to a very narrow readership, it's unlikely to remain posted here.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Disclosure: I'm a UNSW student, but still a AFD regular, so I'll abstain from voting due to conflict-of-interest. I'd like to point out that your search techniquie was flawed since there is no combined "UNSW Revues" society or show for anyone online to refer to, hence the lack of Google hits for that term. Remember that this Wikipedia article is a combination article for all four shows. Here's a better breakdown:</li>

<p>This article is often used to justify deleting many anime/manga related pages that are disliked, with many votes for deletion being "delete, fancruft". It is being treated as a guideline and a rule when it is not and due to it many things that should be improved rather than deleted are removed.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's looking like the consensus is leaning towards keep. That being said, this is still highly unencyclopedic feels a bit thin, materialwise. I'd be willing to suggest a merge instead, if people would be behind that. Since everyone's here, would you rather merge it with the maps article per TKD, or with the main Halo 2 article?

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> AfD is not an appropriate place for merge requests. This isn't a guide and it is too long for the main article. Halo 2's popularity is largely based on the strength of its multiplayer, so this is notable. Why is it we can include plot summaries of a few hundred words and have dozens of pages for characters in popular games (hundreds in Pokemon's case), but can't include any information about gameplay? We're treating games as if they were movies with silly inconsequential interactive bits, which isn't right. This would be like if the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_card.html" title="Playing card">playing card</a> article gave the names and history of the cards, but never addressed what games you can play with them. Not all information about game play is a game guide. This isn't strategy advice nor fancruft speculation, it's merely an empirically verifiable list of the game types and explanations of what they are. There seems to be a move lately to call any video-game article cruft/game guide, which is sadly getting a lot of support. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 10:30, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd hardly call every video game article "cruft." I simply think that the articles I've nominated can be condensed and merged into the main articles for their games. It's really obvious in the case of List of Halo 2 changes, but this one qualifies, too. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoogie2K_5a8e.html" title="User:Doogie2K">Doogie2K</a> <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoogie2K_8e79.html" title="User talk:Doogie2K">(talk)</a> 16:46, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That wasn't so much aimed at you as certain voters who seem to just say delete on all these articles without reading eople's responses. Though it sounds like you wanted a merge, not a delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> The following is the entirety of the coverage of gametypes in the main Halo 2 article: <i>For example, the "Rumble Pit" playlist offers a variety of "every man for himself" game types, primarily Slayer or variations thereof; "Team Skirmish" offers a number of 4-on-4 team games, which are primarily objective-based games like Capture the Flag; "Big Team Battle" is similar to Team Skirmish but allows teams of up to 8 players.</i> Do you really think that's sufficient? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 10:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll throw yet another <b>Keep</b> per Ace of Sevens into the mix. I think that on AfD, for some reason, video game articles are more subject to deletion than other articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>: It's no doubt notable (multiplayer is huge part what Halo series is known for). Merging doesn't seem to be an option since the original article is too large.

<dd>The problem with that statement is that just because it is a new type of movement, does not make it notable. There are a multitude of "new movements" that begin and end all the time, yet they are not recorded on the site. Even if it becomes successful, it is uncertain whether it should still be included in the 'pedia. Even the famed campaign to bring back the original Star Trek series for a third season doesn't have it's own article; rather, it is included as a few mentions here and there on the main TOS articles. I don't see why this campaign should be any different. If and when the series comes about, then the information can be included as a footnote. -- <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHuntster_d403.html" title="User:Huntster"><span style="font-size:13px; font-variant:small-caps; text-decoration:none;"><b>Huntster</b></span></a> <sup style="font-size:10px;"><a href="../../../h/u/n/User_talk%7EHuntster_309e.html" title="User talk:Huntster"><b>T</b></a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Huntster_f26f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Huntster"><b>@</b></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Huntster_713b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Huntster"><b>C</b></a></sup> 09:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That really isn't a reasonable statement. To keep with the Star Trek theme I have going, historically, those TOS fans are fairly rabid about their favourite show. I fully expected to find an article that had been written about the campaign, and was surprised to not find one.

<li><b>Compromise proposal</b>&#160;: I'm quite sure I have seen this article a month before, it got deleted then. So before this devolves into yet <i>another</i> create-delete-create-delete bulls*** escapade, I propose to Delete this article, BUT: take the text presented here, shorten it to the more important parts(meaning: this is a fan campaign, there is a website, what efforts have been made up to now), and add it at the bottom of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charmed.html" title="Charmed">Charmed</a> main article under "Fan spin-off campaign".</li>

<dd><b>Advantages</b>:
<ul>
<li>The article, which might be not notably enough is gone.</li>
<li>The history of this campaign will be recorded and updated (since the Charmed main article is likely more frequented).</li>
<li>It's more topic oriented. The average Charmed fan will probably not have heard of The Charmed Sons, but if he/she has interest in a possible spin-off, he'll find the information where he/she will certainly look at (the Charmed main article).</li>
<li>If the campaign turns out to be nothing more of a dream, one simple edit, and it's gone.</li>
<li>If the campaign turns out to be more, and/or attracts more interest, then it warrants to be expanded into a whole article. <a href="../../../t/e/s/User%7ETeshik_178a.html" title="User:Teshik">Teshik</a> 10:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is about a campaign to get a new television show created. The website and message board are just tools to that end. Adam Dobay's own argument of why it should be deleted states that this is a "Fan Movement". There is nothing in the guidelines of Wikipedia that states that a fan movement cannot be listed as an article. Therefore, all the points about why this should be deleted do not hold water. This entry has a right to be listed, moreso than the seventy different entries I've seen on Wikipedia discussing different aspects of Charmed. The campaign is notable and does exist, and the article talks about that. Fan campaigns have been notable stories, starting back with the Save Designing Women campaign in the 1980s, and recently the Save Angel, Save Veronica Mars and Save Everwood campaigns. This campaign is especially notable because it's for a tv show that does not exist yet, but fans are campaigning for it. It just seems some people are jealous because they cannot do what others are and are trying to discredit this campaign. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Anonymous2004 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anonymous2004_b596.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anonymous2004">contribs</a>) 19:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Exactly. You can't have rules and regulations against something that is in it's own category. I have yet to even hear of another campaign, or even whispers of idea's of campaigns to get an entirely new TV show on the air. How can you apply rule for things that have been done before to something that, in it's right, is brand new? It hasn't been done before, there isn't any equal and fair etiquette to compare it too.

<p>Bafendo is large enough for an article on Wikipedia fore it is the small who will some day be the big company that it is meant to be. Bafendo is a force to be reckoned with. Bafendo is worthy and it is very important to the people it helps and to the people who love it! --Bafendo 09:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may not think it is not old enough but it is. We are an important company to our clients! We deserve a chance! We demand a chance! Bafendo may only be three years old but we are good at what we do and we will not be bullied into deletion. We deserve this and we're not giving it up without a fight! And anybody who thinks they can bully the small is a fool! Fore the small will one day grow big and crush the ones who tried to hold them back! We've struggled before but no more! This is it do not delete our archive we deserve to be here as much as Microsoft. Sure we aren't an international corporation but we have something they don't have... reliable products and affordable service! And I'd be a fool not to stop the deletion of our archive! So think about what I said and think about not being another barrier which a small business must face! As I said before... I will fight this!!! --Bafendo 09:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not that I'm doubting you, but would you mind citing a source for that?

Regardless, though, this particular article while nominally about a company is almost exclusively about the personal exploits of one Mr. Bryce Frier... and I wouldn't be surprised if he were the sole employee.

<li>Duly noted, and I'll keep that in mind for the future. Thanks. Seems a bit odd though that speedy covers bands ({{db-band}}) and clubs ({{db-club}}) but not companies... but I'm still relatively new at all this and if that's what the consensus was, that's what the consensus was&#160;:) But in this case, we're in AfD-land. Do you have an opinion on whether this article should be deleted?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, while I've got an administrator's attention, I want to make sure I've got the rules understood correctly. A {{prod}} <i>can</i> be removed by the article creator (or indeed anybody) for no other reason than disagreement with the proposed deletion, but a speedy tag should <i>not</i> be removed by anybody but an administrator and should only be objected to with {{hangon}} or on the article's talk page... is that correct? Also, yes, I'm happy to take your word on the suitability (or lack thereof) of non-notable companies for speedy deletion, but what exactly is the point of <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">Template:Db-reason</a>? <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 11:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>CSD is supposed to define a list of reasons for deletion so obvious that we can trust just one person to make the decision all on his sweeney; as a result, people tend to want to extend the list as little as possible. Bands (meant to cover high school garage bands who formed last week and haven't agreed on a name, sort of thing), clubs (e.g. the football team you and your mates organised for a muckaround after work), and so on were difficult enough to push through, without trying for corporations as well. As for {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}, yes, it can be removed by anyone at any time for any reason (or, indeed, no acknowedlged reason). Speedy tags can be removed by anyone, but should not be removed by the article's author; {{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}} exists for the article's author to contest the speedy deletion if he wants, but need not be used by anyone else. Administrators have no special status when it comes to removing speedy tags. {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">db-reason</a>}} exists mostly so that people don't have to remember all the other template names, and partly for when you have a reason for deletion that doesn't match existing templates perfectly (e.g. you want to note that it meets more than one of the CSD, or you've got a good reason that doesn't have a template yet — like Jimbo's statements on articles that run afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 11:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why doesn't anyone in the Wiki community like Bafendo? Sure I said small but that doesn't mean my company isn't important. We're big to our clients and we've had a few problems that have kept us small but we are finally growing. What we need right now is friends not enemys. Enemies make Bafendo look bad and a few of our clients have seen these "delete" comments and are now thinking of dropping Bafendo. Enemies we don't need! We need friends and allies. You don't want to kill Bafendo do you? Oh and by big I went giant like Microsoft ok Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)! And I may be new to Wikipedia but I do know what I am talking about! And you'll see how big Bafendo is when Western Digital markets LiquaDrive in a few years... just you wait! And just for the record; I will always fight for my company and I will never let anyone say it is not worthy and that I and/or Bafendo is arrogant and obnoxious! We are loved by many and we will never go away! --Bafendo 04:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Look, you. It has nothing to do with not "liking" Bafendo. You've already been pointed here, but here it is again: read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Does Bafendo meet these guidelines? Well, let's have a look. Been the subject of multiple independent non-trivial media articles? Nope. Listed on a well-known and independent ranking of important companies? Nope. Stock a component of a market index? Heck nope, I'd lay very long odds you don't even <i>have</i> publically-traded stock. These are the guidelines. These are the criteria. They are <i>objective</i>. If a company meets any one of them, it is considered notable by Wikipedia standards and merits an article. If a company meets none of them, it is not considered notable by Wikipedia standards and merits deletion. That's it.

<p>So you want to play that way do you? Fine I might as well delete it myself since you people hate us so much! I think i'll tell everyone I know to stop using Wikipedia. Sure it wont make a big impact at first but when word spreads especially through the media the wheels start turning on something big. You've made a very big mistake one you will regret! To hell with Wikipedia if all of you feel this way. I hope you don't destroy another company! Besides there's lots of alternatives to Wikipedia. One is webster. This is not the end Wikipedia! This is not the end at all! You've made a powerfull enemy and a big mistake! We don't have to take anyones crap not even precious Wikipedia! We will be back and you'll see just how "notable" we are! You've made our list! And it's not a good list! You've been warned! --Bafendo 09:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>keep.</b> The article was already nominated for deletion several weeks ago, but the previous result was no consensus with a suggestion to nominate again in several weeks.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Article has too great potential for unverified abuse. Already the article has an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> tag and eight "citation needed" tags. "Worst ever" is too subjective a criteria. Worst by who's criteria? Can I start a 'blog, complain about how I hate such-and-such-a-song, and then cite that as a source here? This category is far too prone to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> abuses. This subject is inherently non-encyclopedic. An encyclopedia should not have to post a disclaimer above articles saying, "Taste and judgment are subjective." Our role is to be <i>objective</i>, not subjective.

<li><b>Keep</b> it IS possible to make a good article out of this, and it's been kept every time it's been nominated before. Whoever said "<i>if at first you don't succeed, try and try again</i>" wasn't talking about AFDing articles. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this isn't an encyclopedic topic. "Worst ever" in this context is not measurable, it's just some random opinions. For a song to be labelled the worst ever, surely it should have the least number of sales, the most complaints to stations etc and not just be because someone decided that they didn't like it. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I don't know what your problem is with it Dori...this is a large corporation for the Sonoma County area, and their company is largely growing. It is far from a brochure.

Besides, the company is about dairy, so that's how I'm supposed to describe it as. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Kat_2996.html" title="User:Black Kat">Black Kat</a> 18:26, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It sounds to me just like how you described it on the talk page: you read their website, took their description, reworded it somewhat, copied their logo, and then posted it all here.

<li>If you look at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, it doesn't appear to meet any of WP's notability requirements. Which do you think it meets, and how?</li>
<li>It's an orphaned article -- no WP articles link to it.</li>
<li>Searching Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22clover+stornetta+inc.%22+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22clover+stornetta+inc.%22+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">using the name of the article</a> results in four pages. Again, notability?</li>

<dd>If you think it's a notable corporation, explain why -- I'm generally a WP inclusionist, but I don't see anything here, on the talk page, or most importantly, in the article itself that makes me see how it meets any of the criteria for corporations. Add the copyright questions, and this article really has a ways to go before it's encyclopedia quality. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 04:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The first part I wrote because it was very basic, and I tried to make it my own as much as possible, in hopes that it would be later changed by other people and myself to be more original, but this was all the reference I had for the moment.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I took their logo. It's their logo...am I supposed to make one up at say it's theirs? I said it's THEIR logo. I would think that one is quite obvious.</dd>
<dd>You're wrong with the links...I had it link in the Petaluma article, and the Sonoma County article. If they aren't there now, someone erased it. I had it link to an article than mentioned Clo, as well, whether it was one of those two or one I forgot. I also gave it categories.</dd>
<dd>It's notable because it's a very well-known company in the area, and it's expanding throughout the state. It's very popular for it's health code and, considering it's becoming state wide and eventually possibly national, it's important enough.

<p><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a>. The "black cop" is such a broad category of characters that I don't see it as an actual archetype.

<li><b>Keep</b> At least for now. This is not neccessarly OR, but certainly lacks references. Google is not holy, especially with difficult search terms like these. Especially in the context of "white cop" "black cop" partnerships, this can be considered a real character type in movies. Should be given the benefit of the doubt for now. <a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 09:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Respectfully, I disagree. This article is entirely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> (Wikispeak for "he made it all up!"). It appears to be nothing more than one writer who sat down one day and wrote about a trend he thinks he's personally noticed in films lately. Since Wikipedia is not a source for unpublished personal research, this isn't a practice we'd like to encourage. Additionally, since the trend itself is not particularly well-defined or (in my insufficiently humble opinion) worth remarking upon, I very much doubt we'll <i>ever</i> have anyone attempting the "serious scholarly homework" <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">Hateless</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/t/User_talk%7EHateless_a584.html" title="User talk:Hateless">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hateless_afa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hateless">contribs</a>) refers to.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> Original reasearch, no sources and most of all, ill-defined.

<li><b>Update</b> Source has been added. Will continue to search and verify everything in the article. Origin of the archetype has been added and verified. Wafulz, the difference between the Mexican gardener and the teenage pool boy is that the "Black Cop" archetype is one of the most used cliches in the "Cop Movie" genre. In the last two decades it's in almost every popular cop movie. I Robot, Die Hard, Miami Vice, Lethal Weapon, Exit Wounds, Red Dragon, etc. I can come up with an entire list if it will help change your view. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStukov_cb80.html" title="User:Stukov">Stukov</a> 16:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As long as the article is sourced, I see no reason to prevent its inclusion into the Wikipedia database. This IS an archetype I have witnessed commonly in "buddy cop" movies and television dramas. There always seems to be the one sergeant or superior who is African-American and plays a stereotypical "stern father" role so to speak. I've found several essays regarding it on the web as well.

<li><b>Comment</b> Does a black character being a cop automatically make him a character stereotype? Maybe the gruff black lieutenant or captain (<i><a href="../../../4/8/_/48_Hrs._8ab1.html" title="48 Hrs.">48 Hrs.</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starsky_and_Hutch_c4a1.html" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Homicide%7E_Life_on_the_Street_4b34.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i>) would qualify as a stereotype. The first two predate the example given as the "first" in the article. The pic on the page is of a character who was a sergeant, therefore not in charge, and was pretty nice. But just any cop who's black regardless of personality or rank is automatically a stereotype, huh?

<p><s>* Comment: I dont really know enough about it, but one album on killrockstars does not strike me as very significant. Neither does one internet review of the album.

<dd>Please put a little more effort into your nominations. A good nomination can be the starting-point of a worthwhile debate about the suitability or otherwise of a particular article; a poor nomination, by contrast, will often lead to Voting Hell. In addition, the author of this article (and a small but significant percentage of AfDed articles) put a decent amount of effort into writing the nominated article, and he deserves a worthwhile explanation from other Wikipedians as to why we want to delete it. As you can see, the author in this case didn't even know what "nn-corp" <i>meant</i> — and why should he?

<p>Frankly, it is time this went. I have waited a reasonable amount of time - over 3 months - before renominating this article to see if any multiple reliable sources would be forthcoming - they have note been. The article is <i>not</i> suitable for any reliable encyclopaedia, which Wikipedia should strive to be. As Wikipedia seems to finally have turned the corner on what we allow, and actually are applying policy and guideline (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) to internet meme garbage fanboy articles (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eon8_%282nd_nomination%29_5c3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eon8 (2nd nomination)">here</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica_%283rd_nomination%29_8050.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Encyclopædia Dramatica (3rd nomination)">here</a>, it may finally be time for this to go.</p>
<p>The article has 1 (one) even remotely verifiable source, which is a small article in a single edition of a fairly low circulation (53,860 or 1 in 150 Belgians) Flemish language newspaper that requires a subscription to read. This is nowhere near being sufficient for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (multiple reliable mainstream print journals), and the article is therefore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>. The article even says this, itself - <i>Despite its reported prevalence this is the only mainstream report of The Game.</i> All the other 'sources' provided are either bloglinks, or a website made up purely to ensure this cack was no consensus'd in a prior AFD.

<dd>The article has a source. The fact that this is the <i>fifth</i> nomination shows that, yes, it has been AfD'd over and over, and this is a borderline speedy keep because of it.

<dd>No, the consensus(es) from previous AFDs were keep, keep, delete, delete, no consensus. Please ensure you have your facts correct.

<dd>This is my enitre point. Some wikipedia editors decide this game looks silly to them.

Just rooting around on the internet I've seen a bunch of disconnected places where it shows up. Take a look at all the people who try to edit different variations and approaches they've seen into the article. This seems to me a sign that it is not an isolated thing for one or two groups of people.

Official policy excludes many kinds of information which would are obviously useful to many people such as recipes, how-tos and dictionary definitions, nevermind obscure internet memes like The Game. This is because Wikipedia is primarily intended to be an encyclopedia. It is crucial for the authority of encyclopedias that they uphold official standards of verification and reliable sourcing (and some would argue also for encyclopedic notability, but this is very controversial and not official policy, although it is the basis of a number of official guidelines).

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> Lacks multiple reliable sources for verification - even after very extended amount of time (8 months since first afd discussion) for new sources to arise and despite special initiative by Game fans to find sources<a href="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/Compiled_list_of_sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.savethegame.org/wiki/Compiled_list_of_sources" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> as well as despite their special deliberate initiative to plant mentions in the media. On this <a href="http://www.losethegame.com/strategies.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.losethegame.com/strategies.htm" rel="nofollow">page on losethegame.com</a>, planting mentions in the media is recommended as a game strategy. Sole "reliable source" media reference is, in fact, unreliable. The article is <u>trivial</u> in content - it is not a news report but a column (so not subject to news fact-checking). Furthermore, the writer does not substantiate his claims about the popularity of the game, and people should consider that the writer himself may be playing the game (since spreading word of the game is supposed to be "winning" behaviour). (I've lost the link that had the translation of the original article. I'll try and find it again) The writer is also wrong when he claims that readers who read his article have played the game and lost (though this is an indication that he himself is playing the game). One only loses by wanting to play the game (One can think about the game and not "lose" anything if one doesnt' want to play). <a href="../../../w/a/r/WarGames_1483.html" title="WarGames">This is a stupid game - the only way to win is, in fact, not to play</a>.

Notice that even this writer calls the game only "a modest hype" and fails to provide evidence that game has notable following. Also, as I mentioned his claim that "if you read this article, you just lost the game" is wrong, but also suggests that he is playing the game (using recommended strategy of planting mention in media to claim that readers are automatically losers) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Another mistake many <i>Delete</i> voters are making is the assumption that the 21st Feb deletion of the Lost (game) article is somehow relevant to whether or not <i>this</i> article should exist.

<dl>
<dd>*<b>Comment</b> I think what Whispering means is the experience or social act of playing the game is unverifiable if we accept the rules of the game, since playing the game involves not thinking about it. And as I said before, you only lose the game if you want to play. So verification does not in itself lead to losing, despite what the De Morgen column claims. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:58, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>* This has also been discussed before. You do not need to give consent to be a participant in a game. For example, I invent a new game called "Kernow's Game" and the rule is that the next person to edit this page will lose. By definition the next person to edit this page will lose Kernow's Game regardless of whether they want to play or were even aware that they were playing. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 22:13, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand your reply, but what I am saying is not irrational. The fact that I'm the only one aware of Kernow's game doesn't mean it doesn't exist. A game is an abstract concept with no physical existence. Therefore one only needs to conceive it for it to exist. Regardless of whether you want to play a different version where you don't lose, you have still lost my version of Kernow's game, and hence you have still lost a game without knowing you were playing it. For a less abstract example, what about the Roman gladiators? That was a type of sport/game and I'm fairly sure most of the participants did not want to play. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 23:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> [[WP:V] is policy. Consensus can not trump policy (if 1 in 4 AFDs keeping even is a consensus to keep). Absence of multiple reliable sources after an extended opportunity to generate them and multiple discussions is more than adequate evidence that such sources do not exist at the present time. Accordingly, the article should be deleted, and deletion review should not send it back again absent evidence of multiple reliable sources. Once we have multiple reliable sources, we can move on to the not yet adequately answered questions as to whether this is notable/encyclopedic.

<li><b>Already Voted</b> It seems to me people are mixing together the two separate objections:
<ul>
<li>Verifiability - The article contains only a small ammount of info: what the game is, where it is played, etc. The newspaper article, even if it is not pulitzer winning journalism substantiates these claims. Could anyone credibly claim between that article and a glut of internet sources that any of the information is wrong? Do you think the game does not exist or has other rules? The rules, variants, etc. of <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_%28game%29.html" title="Mao (game)">Mao (game)</a> are much more poorly sourced than this and no one is complaining about it's verifiability. What is it you feel isn't verified exactly?</li>
<li>Notability - Although the subject has to be notable, there is no rule saying that notability needs to be established through reliable sources. For example, there are lots of websites which have been affirmed in AfD as notable internet memes, despite having no printed sources about them at all (for example <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombo.com.html" title="Zombo.com">Zombo.com</a>). My point is that there is no universal requirement that Notability be established with print sources.</li>

<li>The Game isn't notable. Notability of The Game was established in the last AFD. Notability does not need to be proven by reliable sources, it is up to people to use their common sense. Try searching Google for "I just lost The Game" or "I lost The Game" and the majority of hits are in reference to this game. There is evidence that The Game exists in many countries. I would be willing to let someone check the IP addresses on the losethegame.com forum to confirm this.

Additionally, sourcing something called "The Game" that has the goal of not thinking about it is rather harder than usual. Kernow has repeatedly asked anyone to quote the policy - used as a basis in several 'delete' votes - that multiple RSs are required, and the best answer so far has been that it's a "healthy attitude". --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 04:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, if you look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, you'll note that in almost every instance 'reliable sources' is plural, and by implication most people interpret this as articles requiring more than a single source for an article to be retained. It's pretty hard to achieve a neutral point of view with only one source, too. In any case, it's clear that people dispute whether the single source provided is sufficient, so a good consensus would be the appropriate course of action. Seeing as we have apparently yet to reach a consensus on this, more discussion is the key, not less. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, what I'm saying is that one of the reasons we require more than one source is to ensure that NPOV is possible - if it's not possible (here I don't believe it is) then a tag is inappropriate. I personally don't like the concept of notability, so it's really reliability and neturality that are important here. While I also personally feel that there should be a baseline standard for how many reliable sources there are for an article to be included, that's a policy debate for another time.<a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although "reliable sources" is used in the plural, the only reference I can find which actually discusses whether they are required is "you shouldn't necessarily be satisfied with a single source". As for NPOV, can you point to which parts of the article might be considered biased? It is really just stating the rules of The Game and where it is played, there isn't really anything in the article which could be opinion or a biased point of view as far as I can see. I agree that the existence of multiple sources would be more important if the article's neutrality was being disputed, but as far as I am aware it isn't. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 16:52, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Matt Ottinger has been a popular celebrity in the mid-Michigan area for many, many years, and deserves a page on Wikipedia -- although as it exists now the page should be regarded as a stub, and could use at least the basics of his biographical data.

The information about his appearance on <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> also qualifies him under the "renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" criterion because he was one of the few contestants who gave <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a> a real run for his money during Jennings' widely publicized string of victories. His additional celebrity as a Michigan television host strengthens the case for notability.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The two keep votes sort of speak for themselves why this article should not be included.

He was a game show contestant, but Ken Jennings beat several hundred contestants, and that doesn't mean they all get pages. The above user is watering down WP:BIO to an embarrassing level.

<li>I have made a few changes to the article with the following commentary. This is clearly not a <b>vanity article</b>. After reading the section on this topic, it is clear that at worst, there was, toward the end, "...material that presents the appearance of being intended to in any way promote the personal notoriety of the author..." From this same article <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, there is a clear distinction between <b>vanity infromation</b> and a <b>vanity article</b>. The assertion that this is a vanity article is simply an exaggeration. I have removed the references to Michael, except for mention as the host, to avoid this appearence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I diliberately did not include the Revere Radio Network aspect because I wanted to keep it simple and avoid the appearence of "vanity". After reading the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I see that I should have included it. Quoting WP:WEB, "3. The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Revere Radio Network is both independent and well known with a current google search number of 10,900. They are very well known depending on who you talk to.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth mentioning that adding this show to Wikipedia in the 9-11 conspiracy theories section is very appropriate. The 9-11 section of Wikipedia is large. In fact, this article under consideration cites Wikipedia pages 9 times with regard to 9-11. Regardless of what you think about the 9-11 conspiracy theories, Michael has made a significant contribution in this area with this show. This show belongs in this section along with all the other researchers who are featured.</p>
<p>I believe that with the previously mentioned edit, and new information now provided, this article fits within the Wikipedia guidelines. If I am mistaken, please assist me in bringing this article within Wikipedia guidelines. Thank you for taking the time and for your careful consideration. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisibility911_6c2c.html" title="User:Visibility911">Visibility911</a> 22:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>WP:WEB clearly says: "Web specific-content is notable if it meets any <b>one</b> of the following criteria:" I believe I have shown that this program fits within criteria #3 cited above. Anyone who uses Google knows one cannot enter one set of key words when they are looking for something. Simply remove the word podcast from the above search and you will yeild 716 hits on Google, and the Yahoo search engine produced 2,360 using the same key words. I also find the above statement by Tychocat to be somewhat misleading if not erroneous. I tried the same search on Google. I got 23 hits, not a big enough difference that 14 to make a big deal about, however, "directories and self promotional sites"? Tychocat, would you please explain this statement for the discussion? Yes, the podcasting host site came up first with CO911V right behind but how are these "directories and self-promotional"? Additionally, I did not see anything else that could remotely fit this description. If I am so far off base in my reasoning, why doesn't an experienced Wikipedian clear up my misunderstanding?

<li><b>keep.</b> I'm afraid I disagree that the listing is a "blatant advert" Adam.</li>
<li>I note too that the AfD guidelines state "Companies directly reported as significant players in major news events are generally notable is a reason for a listing in wikipedia."
<p>The Pink Pound Conference in June 2006 UK featured Out Now Consulting MD as the Keynote Speaker.</p>
<p>Time magazine today covers the organisation. This year has seen Out Now Consulting covered in other media and in fact over 15 years Out Now Consulting has been frequently covered in news media in relation to the company's leading role in what is a new development in marketing - developing strategies to target gay consumers.</p>
<p>Some of these publications include: The Independent (UK) The Times (UK) The Guardian (UK) The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) The Australian (Australia) Business Review Weekly (Australia) Het Financieele Dagblad (Netherlands) De Morgen (Belgium)</p>
<p>TV appearances by Out Now Consulting staff have been many and include: BBC TV (UK) Jim TV (Belgium) TCN 9 (Australia) Nederland 1 (Netherlands).</p>
<p>There has been much other media coverage of Out Now Consulting's role in this development during this period.</p>
<p>In each case, Out Now Consulting is reported upon as a "significant player" in the "major news event" of - the emergence of a visible gay and lesbian consumer market. Perhaps to you that isn't a major news event but today's issue of Time magazine obviously does as the story about the emergence of gay advertising in Europe quoting Out Now Consulting's work is the one item from the current issue that Time magazine has chosen to highlight at the top of their homepage <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/europe/</a> and see also the article at <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060807-1220477,00.html</a></p>
<p>Other media events include the coverage in much UK media of the revelation that 49% of lesbian and gay people feel unable to come out at work. <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/53693" class="external free" title="http://www.sundayherald.com/53693" rel="nofollow">http://www.sundayherald.com/53693</a> (Scotland) and <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece" class="external free" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece" rel="nofollow">http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article341714.ece</a> - again media coverage of gay community research that Out Now Consulting was the significant player in.</p>

<p>I left this comment days ago when the article was much fuller, there is so little info on gay marketing available, that students like myself previously found this article of great use. It is not SPAM when it helps me do an assignment.</p>
<p>Original comment follows....</p>
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I am a mrketing student in the Netherlands, and have found the article on Out Now Consulting to be most helpful and of exceptional interest on the gay marketing phenomenon.</p>
<p>It was quite hard for me as well as other students to find the information that we needed, though there was plenty to say on the subject.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and it may be worthwhile keeping the article here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.87.154.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.87.154.90_e454.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.87.154.90">contribs</a>) 09:39, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The current version is a stub whose history suggests that a great deal of promotional cruft was stripped out of it, and which seems objective and verifiable enough. The niche market this business is in suggests that it may be unusual enough to be more interesting than other firms of similar size; whether being interesting is enough to pass an article that otherwise probably fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is not something I have strong opinions about. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have obviously followed the various input with great interest as the author of this article. Some observations. With respect to <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a>, Morgan it is not really so simple as your rule of thumb suggests. For example, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">if Out Now Consulting gets more Yahoo hits</a> than <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t500&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">you yourself do</a> and MSN search <a href="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" class="external text" title="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" rel="nofollow">which also has far more Out Now entries</a> than <a href="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" class="external text" title="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;srch_type=0&amp;FORM=QBHP" rel="nofollow">Morgan Wick entries</a> verifies this, then that seems to refute your logic for justifying deletion. 'Ask.com' also yields similar results - showing far more listings for <a href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" class="external text" title="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Out+Now+Consulting%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" rel="nofollow">Out Now Consulting</a> than for <a href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" class="external text" title="http://www.ask.com/web?q=%22Morgan+Wick%22&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" rel="nofollow">Morgan Wick</a>. Dare I say it, but this would, on your logic therefore seem to turn your 'delete' into a 'keep'. Without being disrespectful Morgan, I suspect that if you try applying that logic to much of what is in Wikipedia you could delete tens of thousands of entries right now. Many of the Morgan Wick entries that do come up actually seem not to relate to you, whereas all of the "Out Now Consulting" ones do seem to relate directly to the subject of this article. Even allowing all the Morgan Wick entries in these three main search engines to tally up towards you - we are left with a tally of just 834 listings for "Morgan Wick" (many of which seem not to actually be you), compared to 1368 web search entries in the four main search engines for "Out Now Consulting". That is just using the US engines. If we play the same game with other countries you see even more marked differences where your entries are much less. For example, in the UK web on Ask, there are no entries for Morgan Wick and 43 entries for Out Now Consulting, including entries from many of Britain's leading publications. For the record and for <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> too, some media coverage that results in much coverage of any organisation results from media releases put out by the organisation, that is hardly news to anyone. But much of the items deleted by him/her this morning should not have been as they fail to recognise several things. Out Now Consulting was established by Ian Johnson who is also the founder of the parent company Significant Others in Australia. As the firm's <a href="http://www.outnowconsulting.com/who.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.outnowconsulting.com/who.htm" rel="nofollow">own website</a> makes clear, the organisations function in concert and Out Now is a continuation of Significant Others work in non-Australian markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that Out Now is the only gay marketing agency with offices in more than one country is a fact unique to the entity and increases the organisation's notability.</p>
<p>The deletions by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> did far more than remove entries related to one survey. S/he removed many third party media reports of Out Now Consulting covering a range of issues, some related to Out Now's many different reports, some where the journalist sought Out Now Consulting as a notable source of expertise in its specific area. Given the extent to which s/he removed items and the little time it took for this user to do so I am somewhat concerned that s/he did not have time read through all these removed references sufficiently to see that they were clearly not just "a loosely related collection of references to brief mentions of [a single] survey". 37 minutes were spent deleting over 35 separate news articles, third party references and other citations from a range of sources. The article as left by this user this morning leaves only a single reference - to UK research from 2005 and removed everything else. There was also other research included previously. there was much more than reporting on research. For example, there were third party publications such as the Belgium Marketing Foundation, the Pink Pound Conference (UK), the Dutch marketing textbook "Principes van Marketing" (Principles of Marketing) also removed by this user - none of which was related to the British Gay Times and Diva research as s/he seemed to contend when removing it. On that point, where an esteemed newspaper such as the Sunday Independent - a leading national UK newspaper, devotes a double page spread feature article based primarily on, and extensively quoting research by, Out Now Consulting discussing a major workplace discrimination issue, which is also supported by remarks from other industry groups in the UK unrelated to Out Now Consulting, all commenting on the work of Out Now Consulting - does that not as <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a> says: show Out Now Consulting to be a "company with major-media news coverage and that stands out in its industry/segment"? That seems to fall squarely within the Wikipedia guidelines as to notability for article's on companies being included.</p>
<p>For that matter, why would <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,1220477,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/printout/0,13155,1220477,00.html" rel="nofollow">Time magazine this week</a> in Europe choose to quote Out Now Consulting's opinion about the state of gay advertising in Europe if the company is not notable for readers of Time? That seems to fall within Wikipedia guidelines. That comment had absolutely nothing to do with the British research mentioned above. We were relied upon by the journalist of Time as a notable authority in the area of gay marketing. The magazine includes a photo of Out Now Consulting's campaign for the German National Tourist Office in their print edition as an example of gay advertising.</p>
<p>I note also that the comment made by the student 86.87.154.90 talk is a relevant one. Each week we usually receive several inquiries from students wanting our help. I agree our article is not SPAM to these students. Just today we received the following email -</p>
<p>"My name is Katharina and I study in Germany and have to write en essay for my university on gay marketing.It would be really helpful for me if you could send me some information, because it is such a new and present topic and I could not find any books so far. I would be really pleased if you could help me. Thank you very much, Katharina"</p>
<p>That sort of thing is fairly common here - if any of the Wikipedia editors wishes to contact me direct I would welcome them doing so to obtain more information about the similar student emails we regularly receive requesting assistance from Out Now Consulting with research about the gay market and other gay social issues. There really is a uniqueness to what we do - which is why media, students and others contact us. It is also why we are noted in such a leading textbook as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kotler" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kotler" rel="nofollow">Kotler's</a> <a href="http://www.managementboek.nl/boekeninfo.asp?CODE=ochqcqmnqr&amp;ReferrerID=2" class="external text" title="http://www.managementboek.nl/boekeninfo.asp?CODE=ochqcqmnqr&amp;ReferrerID=2" rel="nofollow">Principles of Marketing</a> textbook in section 4 about niche marketing. That has nothing to do with our research - it features a full page discussion of advertising we created for Lufthansa and South African Tourism in the Dutch market. It also seems to fall squarely within Wikipedia guidelines for inclusion.</p>
<p>Any of the above factors taken alone should make you think our firm is notable but when taken in concert, - and in respect of so many third party citations about the company (removed today by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a>) I believe firmly that such a combination of factors renders this article well worth keeping and Out Now Consulting notable as per Wikipedia guidelines. To delete everything in the previous entries down to just what was left there this morning seems not in keeping with the Wikipedia principles. Finally, just in case you did not pick up on it above I am the author of the article and am the MD of the firm, so you might be tempted to discount all I say trying to believe that our article is SPAM however it is not just me saying it.</p>
<p>The search engines, the students such as 86.87.154.90, users such as <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgeo020_177d.html" title="User:Ageo020">Ageo020</a> and many media publications around the world seem to concur that our business has a unique industry position in a major new development in marketing. I would much prefer that there be restored some of what was deleted this morning from the article with a NPOV, and where third party items where the work of Out Now Consulting is the major aspect of the citation.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - To meet the notability criteria the the company should have been the <b>subject</b> of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. From what I saw yesterday the vast majority, if not all, of the included references were about other subjects with Out Now's research or comments being quoted for information.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. The largest piece of the text is "specialised gay marketing services to large companies by researching gay lifestyles and using the information to develop strategies to target gay consumers", which strikes me as a rather obvious or self-affirming statement and sounds like it was lifted directly from a PR or ad copy. Some arguments for keeping an article on this specific company don't compel me: they often speak of interest first in <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_marketing.html" title="Gay marketing">gay marketing</a> not specifically in this company, just that they happen ask this company directly for info about the general field. I see the existing page on the topic does have a section for listing of the major companies (a common and reasonable thing to have in such articles) and that does link to Out Now. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 16:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article, I freely admit, is a work of genius. It's funny and creative. Unfortunately, while Percy Nobby Norton does indeed appear to have been an Australian folk singer, he is entirely unnotable, and everything else here is made up. Among many other reasons to believe this are his alleged 1902 publication of "Calvin and Knobes", and the 1923 publication of "Desperate Househusbands". Good joke, but it's gone far enough. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:41, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong not delete</b>, Sorry to interfere yet I am a postgraduate student at Monash University in Australia and currently studying Australian and New Zealand Folklore. Last month I completed a reasearch assignment on two ballads called "The Fossicker's Song" and "The Raspberry Picker's Song". As a frequent user of WIKIPEDIA's excellent encyclopedia, I stumbled upon Percy Norton. This article provided me with so much laughs that I had to print it and show it to my Lecturer today! After reading that it would be deleted from WIKIPEDIA I felt quite shocked yet understanding. Perhaps if some explicit passages were ommited and proper facts added, then it would be very amusing yet informative article on a little-known Australian poet.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> If this is <a href="../../../n/o/n/WP%7ENONSENSE_9fee.html" title="WP:NONSENSE">WP:NONSENSE</a> then so are most of the Wikipedia articles on ideas in social science, pop music, works of art, psychological theories, religions, and political philosophies, among many other areas. The <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_rules.html" title="Business rules">business rules</a> page actually has a good definition of business logic: "Software packages automate Business rules using Business logic." Are you proposing that we delete the business rules article too? It's also clear from the business logic article that business logic models some of the behavior of traditional business processes such as "accounts, loans, itineraries, etc." What is nonsensical about that? I do think the introductory comments equating business logic to other kinds of functional logic are misleading, though. I suggest rewriting the top section, and I'd suggest adding links to the corresponding articles on those particular business processes (accounting, etc.), for those of you who don't understand what these business processes are about. Understanding the business process being modelled is crucial to understanding the business logic. BTW, you only need to thumb through a computer book section to see dozens of examples of business logic, so one can hardly argue that it's a new and untried idea. The proponents have also uncovered a large number of references. The term (as with its companion term, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_rules.html" title="Business rules">business rules</a>, which is less well defined than business logic but is not being challenged) in wide use. I get nearly 9 million hits on Google! There are obviously vast numbers of people who think the phrase is very important, even if some people around here happen to be put off by it. Even if it had no semantic meaning whatsoever it would still warrant an article as an important social phenomenon. Indeed the topic is quite a bit more important than the topic of the average Wikipedia article. If you still think the idea is vague, feel free to add a "criticism" section and say so, assuming you have appropriate sources for such a claim. Donagle 09:43, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The onus of proof is not an proving <i>vagueness</i>, but on proving <i>meaning</i>.

<dd>What part of the definition in the introduction is unclear? Do you understand that business automation software has to manipulate data that relate to the money-making activity of that business? that manipulation can be directed from various user interfaces? that it is good engineering to separate the manipulation from the interfaces for that reason? I want to make the article clearer, but people blithely dismissing this extensively documented term as "dilbert-esque" (whatever that means) doesn't help. <i>Dilbert</i> may portray people who deal with business organization as idiots, but that doesn't make it true, and in any case the term is used by the <i>developers</i> as well. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 17:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dilbert-esque refers to writing that sounds impressive but actually means nothing, and is used (in the archetype at least) by IT consultants to bamboozle tech-illiterate business owners. My comments referred specifically to this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_logic&amp;oldid=63260213" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_logic&amp;oldid=63260213" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>, which opened with this gem: <b>Business logic is business logspecific capabilities or processing which that software system embodies</b>. None of that was explained or cross-linked to anything else. If that means anything at all, it doesn't to me, and I'd consider myself at least as smart and well read as the average Wikipedia reader. To be fair, the article has been explanded and improved since.

<li>Cool. Let's be clear: the ideal situation is a <b>better</b> article, not <b>no</b> article. As it stood, it was a bad article. The threat of deletion has spurred appropriate editors into action. That's how the system should work, so I'm pleased. My only concern now is that the article should probably reflect that the term has multiple meanings, and though widely used, can mean different things in different industries and/or in different situations. Perhaps it should even be said that some people consider the term vague and meaningless.

<li><b><strike>Delete</strike></b> <b>Keep</b>. Business Logic is a term with no meaning. Although purported to be software terminology, it does not represent a concrete concept of system engineering or database theory. Arguably Business Logic is noteable <i>precisely because</i> it is in (occasional) use yet represents no defined concept (that is to say it is <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">dilbert</a>-esque). I have observed that most attempts to retrospectively assign a concept to Business Logic tend to gravitate towards describing an <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction_layer.html" title="Abstraction layer">abstraction layer</a>, yet do not specify a meaningful difference between the two.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see any reason to get rid of this article now that it's been rewritten.

Even if the above user's disdain for the term is founded (er, tl;dr), it doesn't mean the term doesn't merit an article. If he wants to cite sources calling the term out as fluff, then it can be added to the article to educate people; removing the article would just make people <i>more</i> ignorant... -<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDividedByNegativeZero_aca4.html" title="User:DividedByNegativeZero">VJ</a> 20:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps too little emphasis has been put on concrete examples? One of the most prominent is calculation of taxation. Performing a sale in many cases requires a complex calculation of taxes owed to a number of parties. Not correctly performing this calculation may result in transactions that are illegal. The logic used to calculate sales taxes is not directly related to the amount of the sale or any method used to store information about the sale. A detailed description of the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process.html" title="Business process">business process</a> of sales tax calculation encapsulates the business logic of the transaction. The business process goes into further detail about what laws apply and what tax goes where and when, but the business logic for sales tax calculation is apart from the process for sales tax payment. That is what makes the business logic so valuable. All it does is specify how required rules are calculated. This may involve a complex formula including the location, time, agents, and content of the transaction. Before business logic became commonly used software for business transactions was monolithic such that any change to the business process or the the software such as the database that stored transaction amounts required the business logic to be rewritten at great cost. -- <a href="../../../m/0/l/User%7EM0llusk_26b6.html" title="User:M0llusk">M0llusk</a> 18:05, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: There really should be an article about this term in an encyclopedia, since it is used quite often in software engineering. This term might be difficult to describe but this article makes a good job. And maybe it will be improved. There is no need to delete an article because someone does not like the term that is decribed by the article. -- jvd 15:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Maybe it was useful as a threat to goad people into improving a poorly written article, but I find the continued proposals to delete this article very disturbing. Are we supposed to be like the rewriters of history in Orwell's 1984 and pretend the idea of business logic does not exist? Wikipedia is full of articles on ideas that are utter nonsense, quite contradictory, evil, or so hopelessly vague that they couldn't possibly be properly described. That's because human society is full of such ideas. Many such ideas are important to many people. Where these ideas are important, they deserve a Wikipedia article. They also deserve to be criticized. Too many articles on Wikipedia seem to be written by fans of the bad idea described and give short shrift to criticism. The proper response is to insist that cited criticism be included in the article, often prominently, and to insist that all important definitions of an idea, not just the definition preferred by most fans of the idea, should be discussed.CatNoir 16:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I know that would be true for highly similar articles, but this article does not even look like the one before (with regard to content, but it had the same subject and title). Speedy deletion is a powerful tool here on Wikipedia, but, for a good reason, the use of it is restricted. I voted delete on the two previous AfDs and relisted it here myself. I just strongly feel that speedy deletion should be according to policy, not to feeling.

Speedy delete should be used sparingly, and not in the case of articles with substantially different content. This is still bad, but it's a *different* bad article with little hope of salvage, and must go through the process again. Of course, if it's a copyvio, then that would warrant speedy delete, but otherwise he's right. In some cases AFD is used because a full rewrite from scratch is preferable to a current mangled article. That should be respected, and articles rewritten in good faith should go through the AFD process again, in full. 129.61.46.16 13:08, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would request deletion to be withheld for a while. The article is currently serving as an outlet of an otherwise unsolvable revert war in the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a> article. As it is a stub and only a few hours old it would be advisable to let it mature for at least a few days. Also, the Great Flamewar is a significant internet event that has involved hundreds of thousands of particiapans and bystanders. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikademus_7048.html" title="User:Mikademus">Mikademus</a> 16:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are sources. Though is is unorthodox to provide an "unfinished" article, as the one discussed here, the article-to-be is under heavy construction and intentional left largely open with a skeleton header-structure as an invitation to the conflicting parties in the revert and edit war to collaborate. One of the major causes of the revert war is just the verifiability and appropriateness of sources, so I fully expect this article to be unusually well annotated. In any way, I would again recommend postponing deletion of this article until we see whether (1) the article will have stand-alone value or (2) solves the current conflict. Also, it is not yet linked from any other article (except from a talk page). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikademus_7048.html" title="User:Mikademus">Mikademus</a> 16:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>These would appear to be music charts for the Washington, DC area, as apparently announced on a couple of the radio stations. They appear to be specific to the area, and don't seem to be notable and encyclopedic, to me. I asked for clarification on the talk page a couple of days ago, and got none, so felt it would be worthwhile to get further discussion on the topic. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 16:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, a bigger problem than "notability" of what appears to be a locally compiled music ranking chart for a subgenre of Funk in the Washington D.C. area is the fact that this article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and appears to be largely based on <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have edited the PR and unverifiable hype out of the article, and stuck with the facts. The facts show that the band meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for having two releases on a major label (or, at the least, a major indie with major distribution). It may only meet one criteria, but that's all it needs to meet to establish notability, and I am sure the article can be expanded upon. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 16:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article will be expanded on, we are working on a list of facts and will have it up soon. Ripped was signed with EMI distribution and put out 2 cd's with a major indie label. Their music has been in several films including Ghostwatchers 2 and Insight of Evil. Their music is available worldwide. They have had airplay on major radio in Canada and video rotation on a nationwide video channel. <small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Rippedmusic<sup>(<a href="../../../r/i/p/User_talk%7ERippedmusic_e083.html" title="User talk:Rippedmusic"><b>t</b></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rippedmusic_bc53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rippedmusic"><b>c</b></a>)</sup>

<li><b>Comment</b> This band <i>might</i> meet one criterion for <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> - however, meeting a single criterion <i>does not mean the band has to be included</i> (as per WP:BAND). There should be discussion regarding whether or not the indie label is significant enough to meet one of WP:BAND's criteria <i>and</i> whether or not (possibly) meeting one of the criteria for inclusion is sufficient. As a result, by no means does this article qualify for a speedy keep.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's too bad there aren't sources for this information, as it's good stuff. It appears to deal with zebrafish genetics. In this sense, the F-number denotes the generation: F0 for the original parents, F1 for the first offspring, F2 for the offspring's offspring, etc. If someone could clean this up and remove the unsourced bits I would change my vote to keep. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsopropyl_2165.html" title="User:Isopropyl">Isopropyl</a> 19:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wait, why are people under the impression that this is a hoax? Even vanity and original research are stretches, as this stuff is pretty basic biology.

<li>Actually, the more I think about this, the more I think it should be <b>Deleted</b>.

<p>This sourceless article has no encyclopedic value, for this topic is fundamentally unencyclopedic. Wikipedians have no right to label certain persons as being polymaths or not; We can't have this article for the same reason we can't have list of <i>smart</i> people. I have taken the liberty of adding a few names of what I thought to be quintessential polymaths to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article.

<dd>Sorry to be picky, as I'd prefer to see the article deleted, but, unlike many "list of X" articles in this case there <b>is</b> an article on X. Since <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> is an encyclopedic topic, it seems to me that a list of polymaths is encyclopedic. More correctly, a list of people who have been referred to as "polymaths" by sources meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is encyclopedic. I agree that the list should be in the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">Polymath</a> article and should not be broken out until it becomes unreasonably long. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. If kept, move the unsourced items—that is to say, <b>all of them</b>—to Talk, effectively blanking the article, then monitor list to make sure that they are not reinserted without sources. To avoid utter subjectivity, the cited source must of course actually use the word "polymath." Experience has shown that the argument that "the linked article will have the sources" doesn't hold up in practice. For example, literally picking one at random, the article on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Gell-Mann_e5d9.html" title="Murray Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> does not describe him as a polymath, let alone cite a source. We can have a list of people described as "polymaths" by reliable sources. We can't have a list of people who, in the opinion of Wikipedia editors, ought to be called "polymaths" based on a list of their fields of accomplishment. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for redundancy, amongst other things. I originally suggested a merge but the more I read, the more I'm in agreement with this instead - the Category:Polymaths does equally well, and this list has become little more than a populistic exercise for anyone who thinks their heroes deserving of additional recognition. A handful of names as polymathic examples in the Polymath article more than suffices. Gravelrash 14:44, 1 August 2006 (EST)</li>

<li>So is the question is whether those few names that can be verified deserve their own list...

<li><b>Delete</b> As I always say mainstream news sources, including serious mainstream news sources carry much trivial content of no encyclopedic notability every day - human interest stories, "funny thing happened to me other day" stories, "news of the weird" stories", "Those crazy geek kids! stories" etc etc etc. This is another example of MIT geek culture humour, which gives the MIT community its unique... uh, flavour as well as helping (perhaps) to keep the lid on the campus's suicidal tendencies. It's a geek stunt devoid (as demonstrated by the conspicious lack of actual time travellers arriving) of historical / encyclopedic notability, and not significant enough to have its own article.

<p>Looks like <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">autobiography</a>. I removed most of the POV, but what remains doesn't seem to assert notability. If he is in fact one of the top five earners in direct marketing, he might be notable, but that doesn't seem easily verifiable (and a seven figure income seems rather low in that context). I haven't checked all 892 google-results on "Clayton Makepeace", but if there are any reliable sources, they are drowned in the ads for seminars and books, so <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity</a> might also be a concern. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasmus_Faber_cecb.html" title="User:Rasmus Faber">Rasmus</a> <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasmus_Faber_a0f5.html" title="User talk:Rasmus Faber">(talk)</a> 19:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deprodded by creator with the rationale "article not complete. Content still being added. References to be added to support content once content more fleshed out and direction established." But I find it hard to believe that this article, given its title, will ever become anything other than a how-to guide (which <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a>). The article creator seems to be more concerned with my OR concerns, but the current version reads very much like an essay and sourcing it is not going to help with that, and I'm not seeing it going in the direction of <i>less</i> essay-like. As an added bonus, there appears to be plenty of POV ("Never use your pistol") and an "Acknowledgements" section where people are asked to sign the page. Apparently the creator mistakes us for some other wiki. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 19:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Still learning how to operate in the wiki world and what kind of comment goes where so please please bear with me. Apparently i've found the right place to type something for once. So, apparently there is a 5 day period for the notice then deletion happens automatically? What if the decision is to not delete automatically? Where is that decision made? By whom? Whose responsibility is it to remove the delete tag before the 5 days are up if the decision is to not delete? What if the decision is to not delete and nobody removes the tag? I really don't understand.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, I need to reference and make the article more factual, support the arguments and then i won't lose all my hard work? I need help understanding this. I've been pointed to the three cardinal rules for wiki and still am having some trouble. There are other wikis on my subject and they state opinions as well but they are accepted such as [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_Online#High_Learning_Curve" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_Online#High_Learning_Curve" rel="nofollow">[81]</a>] which reads similarly to mine. i do not see how my article is any different than that article once I add some links and references and in general make it look more professional.</dd>

<dd>I am really trying to understand. Please help me out.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/2/n/User%7E22ndmech.html" title="User:22ndmech">22ndmech</a> (<a href="../../../2/2/n/User_talk%7E22ndmech.html" title="User talk:22ndmech">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_22ndmech_039d.html" title="Special:Contributions/22ndmech">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li>No sweat, 22ndmech. Most of the information at AfD is linked from that tag, but you can just go to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> to find out more. In brief, there appear to be two related problems with the article you are writing. First, it does not cite any secondary or primary sources, as required by our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. Because wikipedia is an encyclopedia or a tertiary (third) source, it can only contain information that has already been published in a reliable source. Instead, it looks as though this article is based on your own experience, and so it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Whereas an academic journal or a gamers' magazine might contain someone else's original research, those publications contain peer-review, vetting, or fact-checking mechanisms that wikipedia lacks and is not in a position to provide. As it is, we only have your word for it that everything in this article is true, or at least verifiable. While I believe you, it's hard for the casual reader to verify any of this if it hasn't been published elsewhere, so articles like this usually get deleted. As to your point about that other article, I started a quick essay in response to this common point at <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> that will hopefully answer your question. The section you linked to may not belong in wikipedia either. Finally, I reformatted your comment above a bit (usually people don't do that when it's other people's comments, but I figured you wouldn't mind here) and added an unsigned tag. You can sign your comments on talk pages and AfD's with four tildes, like so: ~~~~.

(i'm slowly learning the formatting conventions... personally i had an easier time learning thai&#160;:). That sandbox comment is extremely helpful! I was dumbfounded that articles would get sandbagged before they had been completed and figured that there must be a place where you can work on something in peace first. Otherwise all wiki's would have to be complete in one attempt, like zeus jumping fully grown from his father's head (ie: possible, not probable). I'll do some work and figure out that sandbox thing. Can you define "userfied" as it seems to be local-lingo? Also, i'm with you for the video game guide rule, i understand &amp; agree that scans of manuals don't belong here. My goal is strictly factual information in a collaborative environment that my co-players can assist with as it is a huge topic and too big to tackle on my own. Give me a few and i'll surprise you. As for the content of the article and people's disbelief in it's eventual merit, hell, my dad didn't think i was going anywhere either&#160;;) <a href="../../../2/2/n/User%7E22ndmech.html" title="User:22ndmech">22ndmech</a> 02:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>(edit conflict) I took the liberty of creating a userpage for you at <a href="../../../2/2/n/User%7E22ndmech.html" title="User:22ndmech">User:22ndmech</a>. You can get to it quickly from a link at the very top of the browser window whenever you are logged in to wikipedia. There is also a link there to your sandbox, where I've copied the article under discussion. Again, normally wikipedians don't edit pages in each other's user space, but in this case, it seemed appropriate.

<p>Deficiencies can be corrected by additonial information: Specifically, alternate (commonly accepted) points of view may be presented. References obviously need to be added. Other "theories" are presented in Wikipedia as fact even without experimental reproducibility, so long as the argument is convincing (black holes, pulsars, neutron stars). So long as it's clear that it is a theory, and alternate points of view are added, I see no problem. It can be edited to be more neutrally presented. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 03:53, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: In terms of scale and implication, this entry is significantly different from the regular <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_discharge_machining.html" title="Electrical discharge machining">Electrical discharge machining</a> article and is a central tenet of the Electric Universe model, thus a full definition of the concept is necessary for the intelligent discussion of that model (this article was created due to the deficit of a sufficent article for reference in said article; the EDM article was insufficient in this regard). If necessary this could be integrated with the Electric Universe model, or portions of it used neutrally in the original EDM article, though I don't advocate that approach, as they're wholly separate concepts. I have added several fairly detailed articles by Ralph Juergens (electrical engineer) in support. And will add alternate viewpoints and attempt to edit for neutrality/balance. On another note, what is the timeline for discussion/deletion? IE, how much time does an article's author have to improve it before it is summarily deleted in reactionary fashion? I'm in the process of attempting to find additional references and flesh out the article. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 04:22, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update again: I have cleaned up a good portion of the article, though it may still need work. I have added a sesction discussion opposite (more traditional) points of view. I have also included references to sites with supporting arguments, and references to sites with opposing views (also put opposing viewpoint references first, so people can review the traditional view for comparison before reading the supporting views). I have also requested scholarly references from a friend. I *hope* they may be forthcoming shortly, but cannot guarantee it. If anyone know of resources for FINDING specifically topical references in scholarly publications, it would be appreciated if they could be noted. Finding ANY discussions PRO OR CON about the features and causation (rilles, Valles Marineris, Mamers Vallis, Chaos Terrain, Arachnoids) has been difficult/frusting to say the least. However, I have tried to point to some useful references pro and con, for the time being, and to better balance the article. More revision may be needed. I've tried to get to a modicum of neutrality while still laying out the theory. So, I'm hoping it's closer to meeting POV requirements/neutrality rules. I object to it being labeled "New Research", as the ideas have been around at least since <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Tesla_c53c.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>'s time, and definitely since Ralph Juergens proposed the Electric Sun model. It's been around, it's been discussed, this isn't a new concept, it's just a recently added one on wikipedia. If someone could find/add a few references, I'd be grateful. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 06:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd also not the following from NOR: "In some cases, there may be controversy or debate over what constitutes a legitimate or reputable authority or source. Where no agreement can be reached about this, the article should provide an account of the controversy and of the different authorities or sources. Such an account also helps ensure the article’s neutral point of view." As such I'll try to note the "controversy" over some of the sites referenced (specifically, thunderbolts.info is not technically regarded as a verifiable resource, despite the fact they cite laboratory experiments and even give photographic evidence to back up their claims, likewise, holoscience.com and plasmacosmology.net are regarded as <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> at worst, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> at best, by traditional physicists, despite those sites being authored by extremely bright plasma physicists and electrical engineers who work with similar materials and processes). This should satisfy NOR. As well as opposite viewpoints and references satisfying NPOV. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 06:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thunderbolts.com is not a reliable source. <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Geophysical_Research_b063.html" title="Journal of Geophysical Research">JGR-Planets</a> and similar, reputable refereed journals are reliable primary sources. I did a quick search of the ADS (What does it stand for, anyway?)<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu" class="external autonumber" title="http://adsabs.harvard.edu" rel="nofollow">[82]</a> and found zero mentions of electrical discharge machining in a planetary context. I conclude that the subject is non-notable, original research, and/or bollocks as described above. <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">zowie</a> 07:17, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahh, finally a useful post! Thanks for the link to the abstracts searcher. No clue what ADS stands for tho' sorry (Astrophysics Data System, apparently, hey maybe we need a new article on THAT! Hehe, j/k, apparently we have our hands full with this one...). Oh, and methinks maybe you don't know what it is you're looking for. Or they might not know what it is they're researching or how to properly phrase it. I looked under Electrical discharge and a whole bunch of other search terms and came up with the following: <a

accidentally duplicated any entries, it's been a grueling experience trying to decipher the astrobabble and physicsbabble; ask 10 physicists the same question and they all tell you 10 different ways

Shall I go on? I don't think any of this is "new research." Portions of it have been talked about in various articles that have been published to date. I don't know their specific terminologies of how they refer to things. Frankly I'm startign to think their naming schemes are arbitrary... =o\ In any even, electrical processes on planets in the solar system have been talked about for a while. More frequently on thuderbolts.info and plasmcosmology.net and holoscience.com. But there's current technobabble in "peer reviewed" journals relating to many of the processes listed in the EDM in Space entry. They might not use the exact same terms (EDM in space), but they're definitely researching how lightning works, how it's interacting with various surfaces on earth and in space. I'm sure that if Ikept digging I'd find more specific references. I just don't know how physicists who don't uderstand plasmna physics are terming what they're talking about. 4.242.183.170 10:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC) For some reason it logged me out. Go fig.

<p>I'm suddenly reminded of my folklore (more specific <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_anthropology.html" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a>) classes in college. Specifically the admonition to represent a piece of information as it is considered relative to the point of view of the one(s) conveying the knowledge. We can analyze this briefly: What information is being conveyed? Is it conveyed properly? Does it represent the body of knowledge and thoughts/feelings/meaning of that knowledge as the one conveying it understands it?</p>
<p>If nothing else we can consider the article in question a piece of folklore or cultural anthropology (as, really, is any article on here, it's knowledge of the people conveyed to other people).</p>
<p>How is the article presented? -It is presented as a theory espoused by Electric Universe propnents.</p>
<p>Is this actually a theory espoused by EU proponents? -According to their web sites, this is their theory. In that regard, this article is correct, this article summarizes their theories.</p>
<p>Are verifiable resources used regarding the article? -If you mean can we verify that this is in fact the position proferred by EU theorists, then yes, sufficient evidence has been listed to say that this is the view espoused by EU theorists.</p>
<p>Are we attempting to validate the underlying theory, or simply the presentation of a position? -According to Wikipedia, we're NOT concerned with truth, merely that articles presented are, NOR, NPOV and verifiable as written in the context they're intended. In this case, a theory or belief is presented as "a theory" and explained in the terms that those who share the belief "understand" it. As with Jormundgand or the axis mundi, we are not evaluating the premise, technically only that the *belief* that is espoused. The "belief" is supported by the evidence already presented in numerous links to several EU theorist sites, which appear to be internally consistent with each other. Straight from the verifiability entry: "'Verifiability' in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research ... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth." So, we're not looking at whether the underlying premise or process of EDM in Space is true. We're looking for whether it is true as presented. Is it a "theory?" Yes. Is it espoused by EU theorists? Consensus of EU proponents says yes. Does it present the theory and implications of said theory in the manner and understanding that it is epoused by proponents? Yes. Does it cite "authoritative" EU theorist websites? Yes (thunderbolts.info, plasmacosmology.net holoscience.com, kronia.com).The confidence with which we can say that EU theorists believe this in the way presented is fairly high considering the volume of works published by said theorists.</p>
<p>Do you need to agree with the specifics of the theory in order for it to be a well-written article on wikipedia? -According to Wikipedia, no... As long as it's fair, balanced, NPOV, verifiable, NOR, wikipedia isn't concerned with the "truth" of a position (hence there are plenty of articles on pseudoscience that paraphrase the specific beliefs in a neutral way), nor your *opinions* about an opinion, only that it acurately represents what it claims to represent. In this case it claims to represent a theory espoused by EU theorists, and it shows that EU theorists in fact do in fact hold this viewpoint. This is no different than listing articles about the World Tree or the World Serpent, or other "beliefs." In those articles bias (Norse Myth, Greek Myth, Atheism) are noted, beliefs are spelled out, and resources showing that the belief is held, who it is held by, etc. are spelled out. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 12:06, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>EDM-in-space as an idea is not particularly notable:it does not have enough mindshare to qualify as notable in itself (as does, say, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestine_Prophecy_18da.html" title="Celestine Prophecy">Celestine Prophecy</a> or the idea of the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminati.html" title="Illuminati">illuminati</a>). EDM-in-space as alleged fact or as a model of reality is not even on the radar of mainstream science and should not be treated as such in an encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I spot-checked the abstracts of some of the papers you referenced. Several are concerned with electrical discharge, but on much smaller scales than are described in the EDM-in-space article (from laboratory arcing through lighting-bolt-sized discharges, e.g. #2 is about dust-devil-excited lightning on Mars. Several others are concerned with origin of crater chains but do not even mention electrical discharge (e.g. #29 posits that crater chains on Phobos appear to be caused by secondary impacts due to debris thrown up from primary impact sites on Mars). None of the ones I looked at describe humongous electrical discharges as a potential mechanism for landscape formation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Don't get me wrong -- if EDM-in-space turns out to be "interesting" scientifically (in the sense of being published as an idea in a peer-reviewed journal and explaining something that other, simpler models cannot)) then we should definitely have an article about it. But it hasn't reached that level yet. The next step for that idea would be for a proponent to write it up and get it published in JGR or a similar journal, and join the scientific debate -- only then <i>might</i> it be suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">zowie</a> 15:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Understood. As I've said, finding spoecific references is tricky due to the myriad of wordings ivolved in uber-specific fields of research. However, Martian Dust Devils are certainly one form of EDM, albeit on a slightly smaller scale than larger bolts of lightning. But these electrical filamentary processes are at the heart of the EDM conception in the EU model. Granted, it hasn't been given extensive mindshare in primary scientific circles. But it is a fairly basica and central tent in the EU model. And in that model mindshare on EDM processes is significantly higher (it's one of the basic theoretical prcoesses behind planetary surface machining/formation; in the EU model, where its mindshare is pretty unanimous, granted the EU model is a minority opinion).</p>
<p>However, research in terrestrial dust devils have been going on likewise to understand the process of formation and of machining dust off the surface and INTO the air. Note the following article from Nasa: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" rel="nofollow">Phantoms From the Sand: Tracking Dust Devils Across Earth and Mars</a> I'm assuming Nasa releases are considered "credible." This article draws some parallels to and mentions Martian Dust devils. It also notes the interesting finding that "Some researchers think a dust devil may need dust to sustain itself, but here we recorded a very large one that was essentially free of dust for a substantial part of its lifetime" IE, dust movement is a secondary feature, not a primary feature. IE, dust motion does not create or sustain a devil, as the "devil" can be measured and remain active even WITHOUT any dust being excavated/lifted from the surface. Like I said, plenty of active research going on, you just need to find it.&#160;;o]</p>
<p>Anywho, my main point from the prior discussion was that active research is going on in related fields. Granted mainstream science hasn't made the same connections yet. But the EU model <i>has.</i> This article is presented as being a EU "belief" (and it is; you can find the same stuff on all the EU sites of any import) and alternate theories/explanations are presented, thus satisfying NPOV. NOR should be satisfied simply by the fact of the Velikovsky affair, Ralph Juergens' electric Sun model, etc. The concepts have been discussed for some time. Verifiability depends on *what* you're trying to verify, and is thus subjective. If you're trying as an editor to verify the underlying claim that in fact electrical processes are causative, wikipedia says YOU are doing original research and strongly cautions against even trying to do that. However, if you are simply verifying that a belief is held by a specific group, from a cultural anthropology standpoint, there is no conflict (EU websites all say basically the same thing about discharges in space, as modeled in the lab and tested on the small scale by spark machining, creation of electrical vortexes, etc.), so the fact that the belief is held by EU theorists is easily "verified." Thus the issue of "truth" of the claim is irrelevant, since it is essentially just a belief held by the group and in that group it has nearly universal (consensus) mindshare (though the group in itself is a minority in the scientific community, in order to understand their beliefs in a proper context it is necessary to understand EDM in Space [concept] which is central to their cosmological belief system). Guess that about sums it up, eh? 4.242.183.215 09:19, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calling Electric Universe concept advocates a minority in the scientific community is a bit of a stretch. (A) the advocates largely appear to not be scientists in the sense of following the scientific method; and (B) EU is itself complete bollocks, in the following senses:
<ul>
<li>it is not well enough formulated to make any quantitative physical predictions;</li>
<li>it appears to violate basic physical laws such as the conservation of energy.</li>

<dd>I contest the characterization of EU and PC proponents as mostly being non-scientists. I just added a rather large swath of "notable" sources to the EU model. There's been research and plenty of published papers (like I said, I was merely having a problem FINDING them; now I've found a bunch, and you may have a pleasant meal composed of your words *you know what I mean*).

<dd>Not to be ungrateful, of course, I thank you for pushing me past my initial limitation into the realm of trying to more adequately find NOTABLE sources that say basically the same things the not-as-notable- but-still-notable- within-the-EU-model's-proponents sites say... Hope that made sense.&#160;;o]</dd>
<dd>I think we can all move past the notability of the EU model (it appears that it DOES have mindshare and notability within the publishing and researching academic/theoretical research communities; confined thusfar mostly to the IEEE side of physics *where most of the initial ideas for PC/EU came from* than the astrophysics side) and get back to focussing on this page. Which is notable as a tenet of EU proponents. Most of the EU sites tend to say say similar things about their belief that planets in the solar system were machined in large scale electrical discharges between planets that were not in balance, or between the sun and the planets, etc. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 01:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The EU article itself survived a call for deletion only because the EU <i>advocacy community</i> notorious enough to be mildly notable (having appeared, for example, in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wired_magazine.html" title="Wired magazine">Wired magazine</a>, not because of intrinsic science value in the Electric Universe picture itself (check the archived Electric Universe concept discussions). If EDMiS depends for its own notability on the importance of EU, it is almost certainly not notable. If it is false (as it appears to be) then including it in its own article is confusing and deceptive.

<dd>Hmm, not a serious contender <i>in your opinion</i> (granted, that's an opinion shared by the majority, but an opinion nonetheless). In the opinion of a goodly chunk of scientists' opinions who submitted an <a href="http://www.cosmologystatement.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmologystatement.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Letter to the Scientific Community</a>, the current establishment's entrenched dogma of we're right and everyone else is wrong is conterproductive to even CONSIDERING new theories. In the opinion of those sponsoring the letter, this and potentially more explanatory theories have all but been ignored and not given equal time and mindshare, not due to merit, but simply due to entrenched dogma squashing any competing ideas. Nonetheless, research presses on in the IEEE world despite astronomers' reluctance to come to terms that they're surprised by just about everything that they see coming out of deep space observatories like Chandra, Hubble, etc. But, I guess that's neither here nor there. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 02:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>To the contrary</i>, a number of electrical engineers and plasma physicists (Wallace Thornhill, Ralph Juergens, Donald Scott and a number of others) are strong supporters (in fact are or have been its main proponents and commentators, specifically because their observations in the lab appeared to strongly correlate with observed stellar phenomena; anode glow and the sun, arc discharges and lightning, arc discharges and spherule generation in EDM in the lab) and have made quantitative and qualitative specific scientific predictions, which appear to better fit the actual data from subsequent observation than other contemporary interpretations.</p>
<p>EU model predicted that martian dust storms would demonstrate electrical characterization, despite the atmosphere being too thin and cold to support the standard convection model, and that similar mesurements of electrical processes in dust devils would be made in the terrestrial sphere. These predictions have been confirmed, not least of all by the article noted last night written by Nasa, and a number of others that have found electrical characterization of dust devils. <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" rel="nofollow">Phantoms From the Sand: Tracking Dust Devils Across Earth and Mars</a>, EU model similar characterizations: <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050322dustdevils.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050322dustdevils.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050916dustdevil.htm" class="external text" title="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050916dustdevil.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050721dustdevils.htm" class="external text" title="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050721dustdevils.htm" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050321electridevils.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050321electridevils.htm" rel="nofollow">4</a>, <a href="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050422somenew.htm" class="external text" title="http://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050422somenew.htm" rel="nofollow">5</a></p>

<p>Similarly, predictions were made about the so-called "volcanoes" of IO before probes imaged them. Predictions included that the "volcanoes" would demonstrate electrical characterization, would be hotter than any known volcano on earth and would exhibit features common to electrical arcing and not to volcanoes, that the "lava lakes" (large black spopts) would in fact be cool (because it's not flowing lava it's an electrically charred/machined surface), and that the "volcano(es)" would MOVE around the edges of the lava lake and NOT be stationary. <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041215io-series-2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041215io-series-2.htm" rel="nofollow">Predictions</a> <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/040728electric-io.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/040728electric-io.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/040804moon-io.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/040804moon-io.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041216io-series-3.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2004/arch/041216io-series-3.htm" rel="nofollow">3</a>. Initial accounts and images "appear" to fit the predictions.

And what causes auroras? According to Birkeland: charged particles involved in an electrical interaction. Hmm... Hence we get the term "Birkeland Currents" or field-aligned currents.</p>
<p>It is perfectly within the EU model's capabilities to make predictive statements that are borne out (or at the very least not contradicted) by facts and observations. In some cases, predictions which the standard models DID NOT make and are only now beginning to even investigate (and find a strong correlation to what the EU already said years ago). The model allows for falsifiability by making specific predictions and then observing results to note matches and/or contradictions, and welcomes critical discussion of its predictions.</p>
<p>Similar research is still ongoing: <a href="http://occult.mit.edu/publications/Fabian2000IEEE29.288.pdf" class="external text" title="http://occult.mit.edu/publications/Fabian2000IEEE29.288.pdf" rel="nofollow">Measurements of Electrical Discharges in Martian Regolith Simulant</a>. Researchers understand the need to know the causation and structural features associated with Mars' dust devils. The information will be useful for comparison to Earthly phenomena bearing similar structure as well.</p>
<p>The more I look, the more research in related fields I see going on around these very self-same concepts. The only difference is that the traditional researchers don't understand the causation. The EU model purports to (due to the plasma and electrical engineering understanding of its proponents <i>in the field</i>) and makes very specific predictions, many of which are being anecdotally verified as we speak.</p>
<p>But, again, this goes back to verifiability's ambiguity. Are we trying to verify the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">Physics</a> (causation) of the phenomenon the <i>belief</i> is based upon (that's a no-no), or the fact that the belief is held, what the belief is, and who believes it (<a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_anthropology.html" title="Cultural anthropology">Cultural anthropology</a>)?</p>
<p>I am arguing for the latter (cultural anthropology). The belief is held. That has been substatiated repeatedly. We know who believes it. We know who the authoritative sources <i>for the belief</i> are (people, web sites, specific documents and claims). Even beyond that, certain features of the belief are in process of being upheld by observation (auroras on Earth and other planets, electric dust devils, tornadoes, water spouts, chondrule {or was it Chondrite?} and fulgurite formation).</p>
<p>Perhaps the article needs to be amended to say "EDM in Space (concept)" to distinguish between concept (cultural anthropology) and verified physical phenomenon (physical process). I would classify this under cultural anthropology insofar as the belief goes (it is a central tenet of a pseudo-/proto-scientific belief system, much as the axis mundi, world tree, world serpent, gods, etc are the central tenets of a religious/mythological belief). Physical confirmation of "fact" of the underlying processes is another matter entirely. I believe that verifiability and NPOV and NOR have been satisfied for the <i>concept</i> interpretation and am not specifically advocating for classification as verified <i>physical fact</i>, though it is anecdotally supported on a number of fronts. Granted, it may be walking a fine line, but I think the distinction is justifiable (cultural anthropology vs physical process; granted this is a "belief" <i>about</i> a physical process, but it is still a belief and a central tenet of a belief system nonetheless and should in that regard be given consideration). If necessary the article can be amended with "(concept)" and a more definitive note about the <i>cultural anthropology</i> of it can be inserted to distinguish it from empirical physical <i>fact</i>. 64.122.15.114 18:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps my understading of the world notable is incorrect? From a cultural anthropology/mythology/folklore point of view, the central tenets of a belief system are the most notable part of it, or the part that should be understood first and foremost. That's pretty non-negotiable in cultural anthropology. You can't really talk about a culture without talking about its belief system and its motivations behind those beliefs. Or are you talking verifiability again? In which case, go to pretty much any of the forerunner sites of the EU model and read a few articles, they almost all talk about the same processes as being central to the model (concept). <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 21:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't recall if I mentioned before, but have edited the article significantly since initially nominated for deletion. Have added opposing viewpoints, recently added clarification regarding cultural anthropology and that the article is regarding an aspect of EU model belief, also added that the claims have not been substatiated, but are necessary basic tenet for understanding the EU model in cultural anthropological terms. Have also noted controversy over certain sources, per Wikipedia policy when "reputability" is in dispute. And have noted opposition and alternate theories of the evolution of the same processes by non-adherents (mainstream scientists). <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 21:44 (appx), 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And just for good measure, in case we're still wondering whether or not aspects of the EU model are being actively researched (regardless of by whom)? It appears so. There are a number of abstracts on electromagnetic field generation in the early universe, polarization of charge (charge separation) in the universe, electrical discharge within the solar system, the electrical conductivity and charging of Titan's atmosphere, research on modelling the global ionospheric electric fields to the solar wind, penetration of the interplanetary electric field to the low-latitude ionosphere during magnetic storms <a

<p>As we can see, this is an active field of research in astrophysics (the role of electricity in the universe). Many of these are questions which have been posed/proposed directly by the EU model. Though not specifically related to the EDM in Space entry, I felt inclusion was warranted due to general assailing of the EU model in general as not being notable. In fact there is a great body of research being done relating to electrical processes in the universe (not necessarily by adherents per se, but addressing the same issues of mechanisms/causation). So, anyway, there you have a bunch of research beig done on related fields... I'm sure I could find more if I took the time to look and sort through the jargon. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:25, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. It may be complete bollocks but it is, at least to some extent, sourced complete bollocks. On WP, it is not our role to evaluate theories but to record them so amyone seeking information on the topic will find it. The test of this AfD is whether this theory has, at least, some currency and it seems to have. The article needs a great deal of work to provide a NPOV. I am inclined to give it some time on the understanding that when it returns to AfD (as it surely will) it will need to be in pristine condition to survive. Meanwhile, I am putting an NPOV tag on it that should remain until all issues have been addressed (or it will come straight back here!). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 03:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to know what, specifically can be done in a constructive manner to improve NPOV issues (specific examples of what's poorly worded, keeping in mind we ARE conveying the meaning of a belief system; one could easily argue that portraying a belief system requires a certain level of POV, just the POV of the belief system, portrayed neutrally)? Perhaps we can discuss specifics of conveying the group's belief neutrally? If sources are needed for specific assertions about what the group believes, I can probably track them down. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 02:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, BlueValour. I thnk that was my basic point. EDM in Space may be complete bollocks (I agree it's possible, science is by nature falsifiable). But it may also not be (recent articles have given some credence to electricity as causation rather than effect in dust devils; IE dust devils as mid-scale EDM ejecting dust from the surface <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/2005_dust_devil.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>. See talk page on EU model page for more detailed info on the issue of effect vs causation.). Wikipedia's policy appears to state that opinions about people's point of view are not notable, only sourced documents. IE, whether or not you believe in EDM is irrelevant, only that someone does, who that someone is, and what it is that they believe. I think BlueValour said it better than I did, but basically says the same thing. Jormungand from Norse mythology may be bollocks (is there really a serpent that circles the earth and bites its own tail? Probably not... But the 'norse'/vikings believed it as part of their handed down mythology. We're not verifying that Jormungand existed, merely that the norse believed he existed.). <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:28, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand the deletionist point of view that the underlying concept may end up proven as false. I've cleaned up much biased sentiment that was originally made subconsciously (by me, I'll admit; I'm still learning about NPOV and a fe rules), and added NPOV counter-arguments on most if not all the points outlined in evidence. I've also tried to <i>out</i> (state) any bias and controversy, as well as make sure the article notes what it is and is not stating (the belief is held? yes. The belief is based on sound principle? Indeterminate/contentious/irrelevant. The belief is significant to those who hold it? Yes. Citable evidence that the belief is held and those who hold it? An abundance.). I hope that somewhat clears up my stance. I'm presenting a notable central tenet of a belief system, not a physical fact. It is presented as a theory, and the theory's points outlines with examples. I've attempted to note who the autoritative sources are for the [Electric Universe] theory (thunderbolts.info, plasmacosmology.net, holoscience.com, kronia.com), and document articles where the theory is espoused by those authoritative sources (for the belief sytem). I <i>think</i> this all amounts to meeting notability, NPOV guidelines, but a few folks still seem contentious on the issue. Hopefully these notes have helped allay some of that contentiousness <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:28, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ohh, and any help with NPOV issues would be appreciated, while still maintaining basic premises and document integrity (IE, no wholesale deleting of the tenets and useful information, just adding sources, pro and con arguments, removing or rewording statements that appear to show bias; not that I'd think <i>any one here</i> would do that). Of course keep in mind that people's beliefs are by nature from a specific POV. I guess anything that it opinion <i>about</i> the belief (meta-opinions if you will, or opinions about opinions) can go, but the main beliefs can be cleaned up. Anyway, anyone with NPOV resolution experience is encouraged to help with documentation, and making it "pristine" as BlueValour put it, is encouraged to help clean up the wordings. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:35, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Haven't had time to read all specific markup at this time. Here's my general thoughts on some NPOV issues related to POV of a specific group (IE belief systems). I may respond to individual comments at a later point as I have time... I don't right now.</p>
<p>I've been trying to clean up the NPOV issues over the last week, by putting in alternate explanations, taking out some of the more obvious biased statments which may have been initially worded too strongly in favor, attempting to add citations pro and con. I'll admit I'm still new here, but learning as much as I can about protocol as possible to get up to speed. Apologies on any foibles in the meanwhile. Constructive criticism is appreciated, constructive edits toward neutrality appreciated as well. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC) (Copied from my comments on Talk page.)</p>
<p>But, also, remember that this is presented as one of the central beliefs of a group/culture, so in some way, any "belief will be from the POV of that culture/group." Same gows when discussing the beliefs of any religion, pseudo-religion, scientific group, fringe group. When presenting the tenets of their belief system you are presenting their POV. In this case specifically getting at the heart of their cosmological view of the structure and nature of the universe. In some regards, POV should be accepting of presentation of a group's beliefs, so long as the presentation of those beliefs is neutral. If that hasn't yet been achieved here, let's discuss and come to concensus on how to better word things to be neutral POV, while still presenting the views in their entirety. What is wikipedia precedent on presenting a specific group's views? Obviously a belief us understanding from the POV of that group. How does that fit within the general POV / NPOV debate? Say for instance norse mythology's Jormungand (world serpent), this is their method of explaining a certain aspect of their cosmology. It's from their cultural POV. Yet, Wikipedia still allows it, yes? If so, why? Why is that POV acceptable but EU POV is not? Is this bias on the deletionists part? Playing favorites of one belief system over the other? Why should one groups' POV be promoted over another's? That in and of itself is not NPOV by way of selective suppression of information. <a href="../../../m/g/m/User%7EMgmirkin_558d.html" title="User:Mgmirkin">Mgmirkin</a> 23:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC) (Copied from my comments on Talk page.)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, despite the large number of links above, there appear to be no scientific articles in refereed journals that address the fundamental thesis being presented: that large landforms on extraterrestrial bodies were formed rapidly by electrical discharge rather than by impact. That makes the idea speculative at best, and places it under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> ("for ideas that someone made up in school one day"). Worse, the overuse of marginally relevant links is a kind of <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_job.html" title="Snow job">snow job</a> -- someone who doesn't take the time to sort through the references and/or who doesn't have the experience or patience to read the papers themselves might think that they lend authority, when in fact they do not (they are irrelevant to the premise of the article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NPOV has very specific limits -- it has to, in any document that purports to present truth. For example, in <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> we don't discuss the idea that the Sun's <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosphere.html" title="Photosphere">photosphere</a> is made of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a>, although that idea has very vocal advocates on the internet. That's because the photosphere is known to be made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Presenting a specific group's views as such is all well and good, but it's not at all clear that Electric Universe advocates are a large enough group to be notable in themselves. EDMiS has the "feel" of a vanity page - it is about someone's pet idea that is not notable beyond the fact that the author felt like writing about it. <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">zowie</a> 00:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your reservations, but I respectfully submit that the original authors of the <a href="http://www.cosmologystatement.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmologystatement.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Letter</a> to the Science Community would disagree. The majority if not all of the original signers are notable physicists aligned with notable institutions, some of whom you will note work in plasma physics research institutions, and have been identified with either Plasma Cosmology or the Electric Universe affiliation. Though not specifically mentioning PC or EU by name (due to their lightning-rod / witch hunt generating features), it's basically a note of disgust by members of the scientific and academic community about how closed-minded the peer review and funding system has become, effectively locking out alternate theories from even receving said funding or peer review. I know what you're thinking before you even say it: not notable, not the smoking gun you think it is, and so what. Am I right? My only point is that there is mindshare outside of "standard cosmology" and it is NOT strictly crackpots, laymen and people who have never been into a laboratory in their life. Fact of the matter is that PC and EU were initially given life BY people in the academic and research community who saw flaws in the "standard model" and saw parallels in existing research in the lab.</dd>

<dd>To be frank, to these folks it appears that there is more <i>good</i> research in astrophysics going on at the IEEE conferences and in plasma research labs than in the astrophysics community <a href="http://www.holoscience.com/news.php?article=88edua1k" class="external text" title="http://www.holoscience.com/news.php?article=88edua1k" rel="nofollow">1</a>. So, I suppose I have to respectfully disagree with you on this one. There is mindshare for EU / PC even within the scientific community. It may be minority and squeezed out of journals, but it's there &amp; research on related subjects is going on in related field, even as we speak. This isn't something some midleschooler thought up one day in class. This is stuff that plasma physicists have been thinking up for years. Since you're into notability: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3260985.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3260985.stm" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://epsppd.epfl.ch/Tarragona/pdf/P1_132.pdf" class="external text" title="http://epsppd.epfl.ch/Tarragona/pdf/P1_132.pdf" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9202&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9202&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20" rel="nofollow">3</a> it appears they've reproduced coronal ejections/solar flares in the plasma physics labs. And guess what, they look a lot like other stellar plasma phenomena. We've even managed to figure out how to prevent them (though whether the technique/technology for prevention would be possible to implement on the solar scale is dubious at best). Like I said, more and more research, more and more mounting evidence, and a stagnant astrophysics community that seems to not quite get it yet. But the day is coming.</dd>

<dd>So, what have we learned today? Probably nothing directly related to <i>this</i> article. *sigh* since it seems apparent that rather than attempting to fix POV issues on the belief system, we seem to keep chasing our tails about the EU model in general and mindshare of the paradigm as a whole. As we can see, creative mindshare (perhaps I should instead say "the minds that generated the PC / EU models") do not come from the layperson. They were generally proposed by plasma physicists and engineers who saw striking similarities to stellar phenomena in the lab. The fact that there is popular support <i>from the layman</i> isn't extraordinarily relevant. There is support within the physics community as well and active research that <i>appears</i> to validate some tenets of the EU / PC models. Granted it's anecdotal, and not a complete picture from any one source yet. Still... we seem to keep getting away from <i>this</i> article (granted they're <i>related</i>). We seem to be coming at this from opposite sides. You from the "nobody has proven the whole picture, so we can't publish any piece of it, despite the fact that we're merely presenting the views of one group/culture in the context of that culture." I'm coming at it from: "We know who the players are promoting the belief system, we kow the general theory, now let's discuss specifics of major tenets of their belief system." Isee little difference in cultural anthropological terms between one belif system and another, so long as they're presented neutrally. World tree, jormungand, the Virgin Mary, EDM in Space, black holes, peculiar beliefs of scientologists, etc. They're all just the beliefs. Some are based on myth, some on science, some on historical allusion, etc. But they're the beliefs held by a specific group, and used frequently by that group in their cosmology. People who wish to better understand the tenets of a belief system should have resources avaialble for better understanding who believes what, and why they believe it. Neutral to who believes it, or who supports/opposes it (lest you become non NPOV by suppression of sources of information relating to beliefs; let's not censor based on person feelings. I don't believe in Christian teachings, but I'm also not going to try deleting info about them that others may wish to better understand for posterity's sake).

<p>Completely OR and POV personal essay on ths non-notable subject. Only references given are to alleged and unverifiable obscure Scientology in-house publications. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 21:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> - looks OK to me. Though much in need of cleaning and better sourcing, the article does not seem to be a personal essay but rather a decent attempt at NPOV description of the system being described. The subject is notable in the sense that much of the controversy about <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> involves its byzantine structure and bizarre system of punishments and rewards. An article on the internal justice system definitely fits into that interest pattern. <a href="../../../z/o/w/User%7EZowie_174c.html" title="User:Zowie">zowie</a> 21:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see lots of "straw man" POV wherein a premise is set up which the author then deconstructs with unsourced debunking. ("In theory..." followed by "However....") ("In principle..." followed by "In practice"...) ("There is a method of appeal..." followed by "but...") Aside from that, anyway, the basic concept of the article is non-notable even by Scientology standards: the term yields only 823 hits, only a fraction of which are valid (non-spam, non-blog) ones. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 21:39, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How do I know they really exist? What stops anyone from making up their own "HCOPL" and sticking it into the text?

<li>Keep-The page was originally a reposted copy of web material. I completely changed it and think that given Lowery was interviewed on CNN and received significant blog mileage because of the death-threats from right-wing emailers, she is worth keeping an entry open for. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 23:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Keep--Ava Lowery is a relevant topic for an online encyclopedia. She's gained notoriety by being interviewed across the country by various radio and television programs. You can't delete her entry and keep entries for other people who have made the news. Ava has made the national and international news. I don't even understand why anyone should suggest this should be deleted unless they're just mad that Ava has gained notoriety.--Tracker1312 02:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Further comment</b> - Richardjames444 and I have hashed out the problems I had with the factual accuracy of the article, but this leads me to point out something. What small bit of notability Ava may have I believe is due mainly to the "controversial reaction" to her animation, rather than because of her animation work itself. As the article now properly points out, this "reaction" was overblown, and in the worst case, not even related to the piece in question. I believe the confusion over this "reaction" was used to increase her exposure. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:33, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The article lacks citations to multiple independent, reliable sources to establish any assertion of notability or to be verifiable. The "CNN interview" in Other Resources is a link to youtube. CNN would be a reliable source, youtube is not, and the citation is to youtube, not to CNN. (CNN does have a website, so if she was really covered in any significant way by CNN, there ought to be something on their web pages.) I don't know if Progressive magazine counts as a reliable source (how good are they at fact checking? some partisan magazines are good, some don't try, some are in between), but it is the best presently in the article. The only other source is a blog entry, so clearly not a reliable source. It is also at a site with "STUFF FOR PROGRESSIVES, FROM PROGRESSIVES", so does not help generate the sourcing needed to write a neutral, encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Comment</b>: Sorry that I haven't made any other comments. I often visit Wikipedia and read things. This is the first time that I have seen something that was up for deletion that I didn't think should be deleted so that's why I left a comment. Basically at least some of the people urging to delete this post are against what Ava stands for and it has nothing to do with whether or not she has received adaquate press coverage. For example, Jinxmchue who urges for deletion has been cited for vandalism on the Democratic Underground entry and personal attacks on their talk page. Crockspot has also been cited for vandalizing the Democratic Underground page. The fact that people across the planet have heard of Ava, that she is doing something political (her blog/forum) and artistic (her animations) at such a young age, and that she has been interviewed by multiple news sources should be enough that she have an entry on Wiki.--Tracker1312 05:02, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Before personally attacking other editors, I would think that one would have noticed that those warnings were deemed to be, and indeed were, unfounded, and made in bad faith. The warning editor was himself warned for posting those warnings. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have to agree with Crockspot. These accusations of vandalism to the DU page were made in bad faith by the same person and were never justified. As far as any personal attacks, I apologized for the ones I made and agreed to refrain from any more. I have stuck to that agreement despite other people not making the same agreement and continuing on in their personal attacks. Finally, there is no "fact that people across the planet have heard of Ava." That's a completely unprovable non-<a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> that would never be allowed to remain if it were put into the Wiki entry. I know of many children younger, more talented, more artistic and more publicly active than Ava and they don't have their own Wiki vanity pages. "Ava Lowery" is not a household name like "Cindy Sheehan" and the few media blurbs she's gotten hardly justify a Wiki entry. If she were to somehow keep her name in the "mainstream" news week after week, then perhaps you'd have some justification. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 18:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>. The point here is fairly obvious i would have thought, someone's notability is not based on the quality of the wikipedia article about them, nominating articles for deletion should not be used as a spur for upgrading current unsatisfactory articles but for removing inappropriate articles. There was, of course, nothing to stop either Yomangani or Erechtheus from working on the article themselves.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">Cardigan3000</a> 16:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>True, but the nomination wasn't just for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and since the content was a)a stub, b)duplicated, c)original research and d)didn't establish notability (the onus is on the editor here), I think a delete was in order. Since it is now neither a), b), or c) and notability is established by multiple references I changed my opinion. You could have course, also edited it yourself. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 17:02, 1 August 2006

<li>Why don't you just go through the whole of wikipedia deleting all stubs? Duplicated , no there was no mention of her death in the Archer account in fact she only gets one mention. Original research? again , no all the info was easily verifiable. Notability is established by her relationship to Archer. Once again , just because you have never heard of her doesnt mean she is not notable.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">Cardigan3000</a> 18:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only evidence for this concept is some guy's webpage, with no evidence of notability supplied either of the term "Neo-Gothism" (and only 77 Google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Neo-Gothism%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Neo-Gothism%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>), or The "Neo-Gothic Art Manifesto". Note, there do exist concepts such as "Neo-Gothic" and "Neo-Gothicism", and I've nothing against someone writing an article on those concepts - but this article appears to be on about something else (i.e., a new movement since the 1980s). <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 22:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it still fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> since it is only a borough council. There may be an argument for the leader of a County Council but I think borough councils are too far down the food chain. The US equivalent is leader of a city council and we have previously agreed that that is not notable. I have googled for '"Victoria Cook" councillor' and '"Victoria Cook" Brentwood' and got no independent returns so if we keep the article, as you say, it cannot be sourced. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 16:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am not sure I agree with the borough vs county argument in England. Here boroughs actually have a considerable amount of power and counties reduced to a rump providing rural education, transport and planning. Most metropolitan boroughs, including in London, have complete local authority with no county council at all as they are unitary authorities. My own 'borough', the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Croydon_a377.html" title="London Borough of Croydon">London Borough of Croydon</a>, has 350,000 residents and is larger than most counties. It's parish councils and town councils which are the non-executive, non-notable levels of authority here. In a UK context, we either would have to have no council leaders including counties, or allow counties, boroughs and districts. That said, I have no real objection in this case unless it sets a policy precedent. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtiedemann_f8b2.html" title="User:Mtiedemann">Martín</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/t/i/User_talk%7EMtiedemann_7f87.html" title="User talk:Mtiedemann">saying</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtiedemann_58d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtiedemann">doing</a>)</small> 16:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the huge difference is that the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Croydon_a377.html" title="London Borough of Croydon">London Borough of Croydon</a> has most of the broad powers of a unitary authority whereas a borough council doesn't have, most importantly, any responsibility for education. Brentwood is not a metropolitan borough (which Croydon is) (if it was I might well agree with you). I live in a similar borough (West Lancashire) and the leader of the council has low profile since the big decisions are made at Lancashire County Hall. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> two albums helps meet one criterion for WP:BAND - but it depends on the labels. Give me an afternoon, and I can produce two albums as well...

<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> - The article KIND OF said, but I have re-edited it to make more clear. Retard Disco is the label, a major indie. And if you REALLY can produce two albums in an afternoon, I know some musicians who might be able to use your services.&#160;;) <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 20:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Albums</b> I can produce said albums when needed. But I said nothing about quality - and that's the point. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:32, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Show us that Retard Disco is one of the more important indie labels. I visited their site prior to listing the band. They have eight acts signed. Let's compare them with Side One Dummy. That indie label has 19 acts, and I'm not even sure that they'd count as one of the more important ones out there. The criteria for this measure is spelled out in WP:MUSIC -- they'd need a history of more than a few years as a label and a lot of their artists would have to be notable. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 23:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
