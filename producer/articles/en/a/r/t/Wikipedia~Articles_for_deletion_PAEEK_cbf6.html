<li>It is A third division football club in Cyprus, so there non notability about this club. <a href="../../../k/r/b/User%7EKRBN_3818.html" title="User:KRBN">KRBN</a> 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I beg to differ on your opinion on this club, for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>PAEEK has a <b>basketball</b> division that has won the Cyprus top league on 3 occasions (See article for reference).</li>
<li>Through its local <b>basketball</b> success it has qualified on several occasions in European competitions (see article for reference).</li>
<li>If we model our coverage of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_football_league_system.html" title="Cyprus football league system">Cyprus football league system</a> on the (so far more developed) article covering the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> this is a team in level 3 football (as indicated by KRBN above). It certainly is more notable than teams such as <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowes_Sports_F.C._e9e3.html" title="Cowes Sports F.C.">Cowes Sports F.C.</a> which plays amateur football in level 17 <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_Saturday_Football_League_4475.html" title="Isle of Wight Saturday Football League">Isle of Wight Saturday Football League</a> (3rd division)!!! Or how about the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staveley_Miners_Welfare_F.C._b992.html" title="Staveley Miners Welfare F.C.">Staveley Miners Welfare F.C.</a> who play in the <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield_and_District_League_046a.html" title="Wakefield and District League">Wakefield and District League</a>. Both these teams have accepted Wiki articles and so do 100’s of other less notable clubs. So, are we saying that as this team comes from a small country hence it is not notable?</li>

<li>The Cowes Sports "A" Team play in the Isle of Wight League. That's their 3rd XI (after the First Team and the Reserve Team). You'd expect the 3rd XI to play at a significantly lower level than the first team, and in this instance they play eight levels lower.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 20:23, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well, I feel your point strengthens the argument of keeping PAEEK even further. If all three teams in Cowes Sports F.C.’s pecking order are included, the bottom at 17th level (the one identified by the links above) and the top at 9th level surely a team with PAEEK’s background (I won't repeat facts here) deserves a presence! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> 12:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I've never said they didn't, all I was pointing out was the actual level at which Cowes Sports play (BTW their 3rds play at level 15, not 17, as they are in the IOW League Division 1, not 3 as quoted above).... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This is becoming cumbersome and might be beyond the scope of this discussion page. However, wikipedia claims that one team of Cowies FC, be it 2nd 3rd 4th or whatever pecking order plays in the 17th level. Why don’t you just check it out here for yourself: <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> It’s in black and white. The point GeorgeG illustrates is that Cowies FC play in quite a low league, be it the 9th, 15th or 17th. I don’t think anyone here is too concerned which of Cowies FC’s multiple teams plays in which league (maybe in this case it is the Cowes FC Old Boys), however as is, one of their teams is listed in the 17th level. I suggest you went and amended the page on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> if you think the information there is wrong. And if you want to genuinely contribute in a constructive manner to this page, please add your opinion on whether the article should be <b>kept or deleted</b>, (as this it the topic of discussion here). I am not trying to be rude or pedantic but I honestly think we are digressing from the essence. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> 15:44, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>4. Furthermore, this is a team that has played top flight <b>football</b> in the past (will we be deleting <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_FC_6515.html" title="Chelsea FC">Chelsea FC</a> in 10 years time if they fell to the 3rd division of the EPL?)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a historic club that is a household name in Cyprus. The only argument I see in deleting this article would be the fact that it comes from a small country, which in my books is a weak thesis. I would argue that on the basis of point 3 (above) alone, teams that belong to even lower divisions of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_football_league_system.html" title="Cyprus football league system">Cyprus football league system</a> deserve to be included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further note: KRBN, you have interfered in a negative manner with this article twice in the past (first by erasing and redirecting the whole article to <a href="../../../k/y/r/Kyrenia.html" title="Kyrenia">Kyrenia</a> on the 4th of August 2006, which is inappropriate, and secondly by proposing its speedy deletion). I also note from your discussion pages that you have made a habit of such actions, most of which are overturned. I strongly suggest you try and do more reading before hastily tagging articles in the future.Georgeg 09:34, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The fact that has participated in European Cups in many years ago it does not make them notable club, since they did not go furthure but just participated as representer of Cyprus.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Do not compare Cypriot and English football league. Their difference is huge. Also there is global interest even for low divisions of English league. Don't forget also that is an english wikipedia. So english teams are in different case. If it was in Greek wikipedia, there would be no problem for me. I don't suppose teams from lower level of Cyprus deserve to be included because of the level of Cyprus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Chelsea, it is a historical club in England (famous in England and Cyprus not the same) with plenty of trophies, and great success in European Cups.</dd>

<dd>Also a not PAEEK has NEVER participated in Cypriot First Division.</dd>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>To clarify this KRBN, you are now arguing that an English amateur league team (17th division) should be included, whilst a Cypriot 3rd division team should be excluded on the basis of this being the Wikipedia version in the English language! I find this a ludicrous argument, not to be found in any Wikipedia guidelines. Had you read the guidelines, you would find that in the English Wikipedia there is no positive discrimination for clubs originating in English speaking countries.</li>
<li>Believe me, there is no international interest in the third division of the Isle of White Amateur league.</li>
<li><b>THREE</b> basketball titles of the top division (first or premiership or call it whatever you like) and <b>FIVE</b> Basketball Cup finals are not enough???? (All these claims are cross-referenced for verification in the article itself)</li>
