<li>I vote <b>Keep</b>. It is irrelevant if Millson is noteworthy. The article sheds light on the politics of his times, and it should stay as long as it if factually true. Edwin Hale</li>
<li>I'm going to vote <b>keep</b> here as well. As per the Lauder-Frost article, the content is pretty shabby but the subject is notable. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:02, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Millson is, in his way, a prominent political figure who has become a mouthpiece for a certain movement and way of seeing the world which feels that it has lost the other representation it once had. I don't think the article is biased; it is a reasonable and balanced description of the man's views. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinCarmody_3768.html" title="User:RobinCarmody">RobinCarmody</a>

<li>For those who are new to Wikipedia editing, I should explain that here on Wikipedia editors are often judged by their contribution history. That is, on the merits of their work here. People who don't create an account or sign in are often seen as novices or people unwilling to stand behind their edits. If that bothers you, the easy solution is to create an account. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 02:49, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>All that tells us is that there are a bunch of sad people around with nothing better to do than spend their time in front of a PC screen boosting their egos by pretending to be up there with the editors of the Britannica. Still, at least you have the courage to sign your posts unlike the anonymous malicious creep Homeontherange.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 06:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: As with Lauder-Frost and Smith Millson is clearly being targeted by people who want to hide the truth about the capitalist-far right alliance.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Millson is a significant figure in responsible, prudent and definitely well-supported current UK feelings on immigration, asylum, the dangers of Islam and the like; Wikipedia cannot be allowed to become a spineless regurgitation of 'liberal' opinion and prejudice.
