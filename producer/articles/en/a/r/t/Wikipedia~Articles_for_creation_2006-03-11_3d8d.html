<p>Farouk Mollah BANNA From Togo (west Africa) born on July 05th 1979 received his Master of Science in Civil engineering from university of Lome (Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingnieurs- ENSI). As a North Carolina A&amp;T Researcher he has co-published two famous environmental engineering papers "Uncertainty Analysis of Chloride Concentration in landfill leachate" in March 2006 and "uncertainty analysis in environmntal modeling" in May 2006. His achievement is unbilievable because Farouk did not speak english and also had not a background in environmental modeling in 2003 when he immigrated in United States . But he quickly became an expert researcher in environmental modeling. On August 3rd at Bowling Green, KY he was cheered by hundred of researchers for his achievement.</p>

<p>This text is only some words about Haitian Vodoo Culture Language.</p>
<p>Haitian Vodoo Culture Language is not currently spoken by the people of Haiti. However many of his words can be found in the currently spoken French creole language in Haiti. This language is mostly a lexicon used mostly during vodoo ceremonies. It cannot be classed as a living language and its most closed and western counterpart is Latin which is still used in catholic ceremony. The following link refers to a brief lexicon of Haitian Vodoo Culture Language: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5319/langaj.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5319/langaj.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5319/langaj.htm</a>.</p>
<p>This language is mostly of African origin and migt have come from Dahomey province. There might be some Ameridian words included in this language. However, in Haiti, the genocide of the Amerindians had been total and the two cultures barely mixed if not at all.</p>
<p>One of the most used word in this language is "wanga" which my link has forgotten to mention. It is the bad luck or spell thrown upon a body by another body upon performing certain rituals ordinary with natural means. However, it might well be poisonous things or contagious illness brought upon the spelled body by another body either directly or indirectly by means of contiguous insects or other beasts (animals). It may be also some kind of harassment with the intention of creating stress upon the other body in order to have him fell sick.</p>
<p>It is a crime, but it is often difficult to find the crime and the criminal. This mysterious language confers also some protection and some impunity to those people who use it.</p>
<p>While vodoo as a culture and as an art is desirable as part of the cultural diversity in our world, most of the vodoo practice has to be state regulated in Haiti in order for justice and democracy to progress overthere.</p>

<p>The real estate settlement procedures act, known as RESPA, was an act passed by the United States Congress in 1974. It was created because various companies associated with the buying and selling of real estate, such as lenders, realtors, and title insurance companies were often engaging in providing undisclosed kickbacks to each other, inflating the costs of real estate transactions and obscuring price competition by facilitating bait and switch tactics.</p>
<p>For example, a lender advertising a home loan might advertise the loan with a 5 percent interest rate, but then when one applies for the loan one is told that one must use the lender's affiliated title insurance company and pay 5000 dollars for the service (whereas the normal rate is 1000 dollars). The title company pays 4000 dollars to the lender.</p>
<p>The act prohibits kickbacks between different parties in the real estate settlement process, and also requires lenders to provide a good faith estimate for all the costs of a particular loan.</p>
<p>Critics say however that various kickbacks still occour. For example, lenders often provide captive reinsurance to the title insurance companies they work with. Others counter that economically the transaction is a zero sum game, where if the kickback were forbidden, a lender would simply charge higher prices. One of the core elements of the debate is the fact that customers overwelmingly go with the default service providers associated with a lender. Some say that if the profits of the service providers were truely exsessive or if the prices of the service were excessively inflated because of illegal or quasi-legal kickbacks, then at some point non affiliated service providers would attempt to target consumers with lower prices to entice them to choose the unafiliated provider.</p>

<p>Janko van Deventer is a dutch man born in the province of Utrecht. Son of a preacher man, his parents are from South-Africa.</p>
<p>Janko joined the band formation Blind Rights in 2005([www.blindrights.nl.tt]). He has a raspy, but smooth voice which I know I enjoy. Although his music style is a bit different from that of the band, he sure does enjoy singing. Janko says: "Our musical differences aren't a minus, but create our own style and own level of making music. Joining the band at an age of 14, started drinking smoking and blowing, then stopt blowing and smoking. All in one year.</p>
<p>A true fan, John Verbeek once said: "Janko is the last survivor of rock 'n' roll." John sees Janko as a true hero, but says he never wants to be like him, because there is only one Janko.</p>

<p>Harvey Perlman, J.D., Chancellor</p>
<p>Harvey Perlman was named the 19th Chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on April 1, 2001. He had served as Interim Chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln since July 16, 2000.</p>
<p>A former dean of the University of Nebraska College of Law (1983-1998), Perlman has also served as interim senior vice chancellor for academic affairs at UNL (1995-96).</p>
<p>Perlman, a Nebraska native, was raised in York, Neb., and earned a bachelor of arts in history and a juris doctorate from the University of Nebraska. During his law school years, he was editor in chief of the Nebraska Law Review and was elected to the Order of the Coif, a law honors society.</p>
<p>He joined the NU law faculty in 1967 after spending a year as a Bigelow Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School. He served on the Nebraska law faculty until 1974 when he joined the faculty at the University of Virginia Law School. He returned to Nebraska in 1983 when he accepted the deanship of the Nebraska Law College, a post he held until 1998 when he returned to the professoriate. He has also served as a visiting professor at Florida State University College of Law, the University of Puget Sound School of Law and the University of Iowa College of Law.</p>

<p>indian army Defence Security Corps The Defence Security Corps, with 31,000 personnel, provides security at Defence Ministry sites. The role of Defence Security Corps is to ensure the protection and security of designated Defence Installations against sabotage and pilferage. The Defence Department Constabulary Centre, now known as Defence Security Corps (DSC), was raised on 25th April 1947 at Muthura in Uttar Pradesh. The centre moved to Delhi on 3rd May 1947. It was formed in the form of a semi-police force with police title and badges of ranks. In 1948, military titles and badges of ranks were given to the DSC. In August 1958, the Corps was re-organised and redesignated as Defence Security Corps-DSC and brought under the control of Army Headquarters. The DSC and Records moved from Delhi to Chkrata in UP in April 1959 and then to Kannur on 21st November 1961. The centre imparts training to ex-service personnel of Army, Navy, Air Force and Territorial Army and recruits them to various agencies under the Army, Navy, Air Force and Territorial Army and to the Directorate General of Ordinance Factories and Directorate General of Research and Development. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Defence Security Corps (DSC) provide security at India's nuclear laboratories and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) establishments, respectively.

<p>High Sierra Music has been producing world-class music festivals since 1991. An independent production company based in Berkeley, CA, the organization was founded with the first High Sierra Music Festival, its cornerstone event that takes place every July 4th weekend in Northern California, and remains committed to its grassroots beginnings by drawing support from its loyal community of patrons, staff, volunteers and non-corporate sponsors. In addition to the High Sierra Music Festival, the organization has produced events in Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri and Las Vegas, and presents concerts in San Francisco and the Lake Tahoe area.</p>
<p>An intimate yet first-rate festival nestled in Northern California's majestic mountain range, the High Sierra Music Festival is a unique four-day music and camping festival that features an eclectic and boldly creative span of music from acoustic singer-songwriters and down-home bluegrass to high-energy funk and skillfully improvised jazz, rock and live electronica. Held in Quincy, CA and celebrating its 16th year, High Sierra launched as a roots-oriented festival with 20 artists on one main stage and has since evolved into to a 10,000 person event with nearly 80 performers on five day-time stages and five late-night venues. The Plumas-Sierra County Fairgrounds in Quincy provide on-site infrastructure with opportunities to swim, bike, fish, golf and hike in the vicinity of a quaint mountain town.</p>
<p>Each year High Sierra features a stellar line-up of national and international performers and is considered one of the finest showcases for emerging artists in the country. Past artists include Gov't Mule, Les Claypool, Leo Kottke and Mike Gordon, Bill Frisell, Michael Franti and Spearhead, Steve Winwood, Bruce Hornsby, Steve Earle, Bela Fleck &amp; the Flecktones, Hugh Masekela, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Karl Denson, Keller Williams, Steve Kimock, Mike Marshall and Chris Thile, Los Lobos, Ani Difranco, The String Cheese Incident, Richard Thompson, John Hiatt, Loudon Wainwright III, Son Volt, Widespread Panic, John Prine, Maceo Parker, Sam Bush, Michelle Shocked, David Grisman, JJ Cale and many more.</p>
<p>Other features that make the High Sierra Musical Festival unique include its signature Artist Playshops which give music lovers a chance to see both emerging and established artists in an intimate setting; epic Late Night shows that deliver memorable musical performances into the wee hours of the morning; Grizzly Radio, community radio for the festival which broadcasts live performances from multiple stages on multiple frequencies throughout the weekend; and the High Sierra Kidzone which features parades, arts and crafts, circus performances, special musical performances, activities and games. On-site vending offers a colorful array of quality clothing, jewelry, musical instruments and other items that vendors create and gather from all over the globe, a food court featuring a delicious variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options with an emphasis on organic options, and Camp Quench which offers bottled water, organic juices, teas, organic wines, and top-of-the-line microbrews. A non-profit area gives various environmental and social justice organizations the opportunity to educate and gain support. Educational Playshops give patrons an opportunity to learn more about the business side of music including management, marketing and publicity. Outdoor Playshops provide interactive instruction on Yoga, Pilates, dance and more. All the elements combined create an unforgettable weekend for everyone.</p>

His family moved from state to state for most of his early childhood before finally settling down in rural Enid, Ok, a modest town with about 55,000 population. This final move was the best for young Ben because this introduced him to the political scene.</p>

<p>71.115.151.184 17:34, 10 March 2006 (UTC)How to get Luigi on Mario 64 for Nintendo 64 1.Go outside the castle. 2.Go on top of the roof and get 100 lives from yoshi but don’t get the 3 other ones. 3.Then get red wing cap and go to the cannon. 4.Shoot yourself to the big princess peach picture and stay there don’t fall off the picture. 5.Now wait for the wing cap to disappear. 6.Remember the glitch in the stairs were you jump backwards and it goes really fast well do it there until it glitches and you go through the wall. You’ll get to grab the 3 lives I mentioned not to get. 7.You have to get the 3 lives or the game will freeze,after you get them,you will fall and lose almost your whole life meter 8.You will be in the glitch basement as I called it,in which its inside the castle but its all dark. 9.Now carefully walk foward but if you move it to the left you will fall in the nowhere and die. 10.After youve walked foward for a while,you will see a switch,press it and the music of pressing a switch will sound and a message saying “L is real*.” 11.Now walk foward and you will be glitched back outside the castle. 12.Go to the castle court yard were all the boos are and youll see Luigi jump out of the star statue saying “I’ve been looking for you Mario! Lets see if you still have the talent you used to have when we went on our adventures! Eliminate all the Boos and I’ll give you something special!” Switch music for the second time starts. 13. Kill the Boos then Luigi will say “You still got it bro! You deserve to get a mini adventure course!” and again the stepping a switch music will be heard and puff the star statue will fall down and a hole will be there. 14.Fall into the whole to access to the course called Milky Wave galaxy course. Here you dont get stars you get Luigi faces. After you do mission one which is a sliding mission luigi will be accesable any time you go there. If you want to change back to mario go back in that course and do the first mission. There are four other missions. Now you have Mario and Luigi! Congratulations!</p>

<p>Fracas has been playing their own brand of Horror themed Hardcore Punk since 1995. The band has gone through members many times. Their sound is old-fashioned, no-holds-barred Samhain worship. Exceptions is that they don't cover themselves in blood, or sport devil-locks. Joe's vocals have an eerie resemblance to a young Danzig, and also like Samhain, there are a few moments where some Metallic elements seem to creep in. Their songs are short, hectic, and delivered at high speed. But they are not completely influenced by just Samhain, they also have elements of classic Hardcore bands like the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Kennedys_1621.html" title="Dead Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> and Black-Flag.</p>

<p>This short story is in two parts, the first part is a science fiction account of speculation for a space-faring ship that travels to and from distant planets using a unique faster than light (FTL) engine technology. The second part is about the actual attempt at getting the science fiction out of the story and placing it into the real world, today! The theme of the second part is from a prospective of what is called Cosmo-theology. Complete with drawings of the spacecraft and various diagrams that show what needs to be done for FTL travel to be completed for a traveler to Tau-ceti. The unique vision of the story unfolds in the first chapter of the first part where the explanation of the FTL machine is given, which requires a telescope, a computer in 100 story a building, a nuclear fusion reactor on Earth, and a rotating magnetic ring in orbit near the moon all working together to allow a spaceship to travel FTL.</p>

<p>In 1909 Howard Hughes Sr. (father of the billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes Jr.) patented the twin cone drill bit, a new kind of bit that could bore through hard rock. Previous drill bits would be ground down when they hit hard rock surfaces. The twin cone bit featured two rotating cones with 166 cutting edges that effectively ground through the hard rock. Drillers at the time called it "the rock eater."</p>
<p>See US Patent Office patent number 930,758, and 930,759.</p>
<p>The Hughes bit revolutionized the oil drilling industry, allowing access to previously unreachable oil reserves. The invention also formed the foundation of the Hughes fortune. When Hughes Sr. died in 1924 his son, Hughes Jr, just 18 years old at the time, inherited the Hughes Tool Company, worth over a million dollars. Hughes Jr. used that capital to build his financial empire.</p>

<p>A Collection of space-oriented personages of varying abilities, with apparently enough charisma, time, and caffeine to be able to persuade people to give them money to chuck ten kilos of their personal 'stuff' at the moon. Sort of like ex-vitro fertiliztion, if it were the contents of someone's dead husbands frozen seed bank. Or more like littering on a grand scale if someone wanted to hide their old girlfriend's love letters up there. 'If only we could put our old fizzled out, ex-fissioned materials up there ( and the tons of contaminated earth, rocks, water, dirt, and people with which you would not touch with a ten foot lead pole such as most employees at the Fernald site near Cincinnati - Even if you were wearing lead pants and held your breath and made a wish as you did it. The painful truth of nuclear power is that as much energy that is released by it, it would take more than that in fossil fuels to clean it all up via digging up contaminated earth and sealing it by the trainload in tiny glass beads, or putting a big band-aid on it and hope the boo boo gets better if you can't look at it.) I would imagine it would be a wonderful place for tens of millions of 'Free AOL' disks.</p>

<p>On September 1st. 1981 in Baltimore, MD., [Heath Harris] <a href="http://www.HeathHarris.net" class="external text" title="http://www.HeathHarris.net" rel="nofollow">HeathHarris.net</a> a.k.a. [Epic Savier] <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">EpicSavier.com</a> was brought into this world. Yet, it wasn’t until 1994-1995 when Epic Savier began his ventures into the art of hip-hop. Living in various places, Epic Savier spent time learning about hip-hop from those older who were already far more experienced.</p>
<p>He stood close by watching corner freestyles and soon participated in schoolhall freestyle ciphers. In time, <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> became well-respected by his peers as a gifted emcee. Being a Native American emcee in a predominantly African-American neighborhood led to many physical altercations where Epic had to prove himself and his love for hip-hop. But still that did not stop him nor slow him down.</p>
<p>After moving several times within the state of Maryland and questioning his dedication to the art of hip-hop, Epic took a leap of faith and decided to record his own underground cassettes with borrowed equipment from his friends and a karoke set he received for Christmas. Creating everything from the instrumentals to the lyrics, <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> made a brand for himself by selling his music to classmates. This also opened doors for Epic to where he could now record at other local producer’s studios. The end result was a second underground CD which sold modestly thus building a reputation around town. It also gave him an invitation to join a 24-man rap group called “Grace Mob”.</p>
<p>After problems had arisen in the group, <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> realized that he was better off as a solo act and focused his goals on himself. On Christmas, he was given a computer which changed his future as he knew it. Discovering the hip-hop appeal over the internet, Epic Savier traveled from rap board to rap board establishing his presence as a battle rapper named “ILL Poppy”. Although these were text battles, Epic had gained notoriety as a Top 10 contender on each of these internet rap boards. After reaching unreal numbers in battle text wins, he decided it was time to go the extra step in battling...Audio.</p>
<p>This challenging tool allowed <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> to step into his true emcee form and allow an infinite amount of people witness his voice, style, and tactics; all in audio. One who took immediate notice was Brent “The Zodiac”Whiting of the four-man management company, Black InQ. After meeting in a battle, Zodiac and <a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> established a friendship and collaborated on several songs together. The end result led to Epic being signed to the management company in order to pursue a career in hip-hop and allow the rest of the world to view his talent; not only simply rhyme, but show the diversity in rap style like his influences, 2Pac and Rakim as well as his <a href="http://www.epicsavier.net" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.net" rel="nofollow">head-banging production skills</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epicsavier.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epicsavier.com" rel="nofollow">Epic Savier</a> is currently working on his Mix CDs which will be free to download and his debut CD which is yet to be titled. Keep an eye out for this gifted artist.</p>

<p>Emperor Ryan is a invincible supervillain created by me Ryan Boubelik, in my story good is corrupted By the Devil and must be purified so my character battles to save them and becomes a hero in the eyes of many people throughout the world. after a terrifying battle with the devil, my character triumphs in the end finally proving once and for all that evil is tougher than Pure Evil. My character is the leader of an evil but noble army of villains turned heroes who are undefeated called the Evil Alliance as the leader of the Evil Alliance my character has been known to be relentless and unstoppable as he marches into battle alongside good. even though my character is evil in a good way, he gets to fight alongside the heroes and villains of Nintendo, Disney, S.D. Gundam, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Turok, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Code Lyoko, James Bond, and many others to destroy the devil and his army of demons. When in battle alongside good my character will almost always use attacks that will Destroy, Ahnililate, Oblieterate, and eliminate the enemy that we are facing, such as unholy destroying nuke, corona, mega bomb, and lightning. While good is a powerful ally It is no match for the devil and his forces alone, so my character unites all the people of the world to pray and fight for us. In the end My character's mission proves that not all Evil is bad, and shows that it is the forces of Pure Evil such as the devil that are really and truly bad. People that are not Pure Evil my character will protect such as normal humans. Anyone who was formerly good or evil, {Like Stitch)or is good or evil my character will also protect. My character will not protect people who have sold their souls to the devil to become one of his demons, instead my character will destroy them. My character has the power to revive anyone who has died and make them good like the villains of James Bond, loved ones, or valued comrades. My character's main goal is to please Pure Good which is God, if god is pleased then my character's mission will finally be complete</p>

<p>Great guy!</p>
<p>Gary is a rich man from Boulder, Colorado, USA, that by his own money created and internet radio named Radio Free Colorado (RFC). Which used to play realy good music, 70's to 90's rock as he liked to say.</p>
<p>After getting popular he start to ask for donations and donatios for his radio and to get very angry for people that do not donate. After some time Gary stop begging for money and created a person named Aimee that asked for money as much as him.</p>
<p>Gary really didn't like people streamripping his radio, and everybody that download mp3 not paying anything. He could spend hours speaking about it and say how bad are people that streamrip his radio. He also never allowed anyone to argue with him in public as in the website forum.</p>
<p>Nowadays Gary might be thinking that to carry a internet radio it is too much work for little fun.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-11_3d8d.html" title="Edit section: Proofs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proofs</span></h4>
<p>First, we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/f/0/ef0154676e1b5721b83974ffc09cb79a.png" alt="a = a \lor (a \land b)" />. If we let <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/a/4/8a49779929bda6eed21269c72dbfeb28.png" alt="b = \lnot a" />, then we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/e/9/6e9340ff1c379640e82d0fe39bd6678c.png" alt="a = a \lor (a \land \lnot a) = a \lor 0" /> (by using <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/b/6/3b651b0e972d805ed6ec1710d2da4cbf.png" alt="a \land \lnot a = 0" /> ). Similarly, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/1/5/d15090067db93074ed5c9338de2bbca3.png" alt="a = a \land (a \lor \lnot a) = a \land 1" />.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/1/6/416f837a354ddd44b555d224f8fef871.png" alt="a \lor (b \land c) = (a \lor b) \land (a \lor c)" />. Letting <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/a/4/8a49779929bda6eed21269c72dbfeb28.png" alt="b = \lnot a" /> and <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i> = 1</span>, we have the following: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/8/7/d870c506bae2b0435af36660e8d4190e.png" alt="a \lor (\lnot a \land 1) = (a \lor \lnot a) \land (a \or 1) = 1 \land (a \or 1) = a \lor 1" />. On the other hand, we also have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/c/d/acddff07c44fa6c164b334937ee3478a.png" alt="a \lor (\lnot a \land 1) = a \lor \lnot a = 1" />, so <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/e/7/be7a7145eea43f394c92c4bf78a20f01.png" alt="a \lor 1 = 1" />.</p>
<p>Similarly, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/c/22c4f9d866732f9679cd2d770137c8fb.png" alt="0 = a \land \lnot a = a \land (\lnot a \lor 0) = (a \land \lnot a) \lor (a \land 0) = 0 \lor (a \land 0) = a \land 0" />.</p>
<p>From the boundedness, we can obtain the idempotence as follows: Letting <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i> = 1</span> in the absorption, we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/3/2/f32fc866781e20eff0443cf325e33b99.png" alt="a = a \lor (a \land 1) = a \lor a" />. Letting <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i> = 0</span> in the other absorption rule, we see that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/e/a/2ea36ca0a30046aed17203e606e76de2.png" alt="a = a \land (a \lor 0) = a \land a" />.</p>
<p>We can also use the boundedness to show that 0 and 1 are the negations of one another: we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/a/2/ea2d991f94ebba5449915b9c8f1af741.png" alt="a \lor \lnot a = 1" />; letting <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> = 0</span>, we have that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/9/6/d967528bfea0b74d76377f013d827453.png" alt="0 \lor \lnot 0 = 1" />, but <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/5/a/b5a284066b6807cbeae55461f0c6cb69.png" alt="0 \lor \lnot 0 = \lnot 0" />. Symmetrically, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/d/a/5da3b62ce91ed19efb311269b283c6be.png" alt="0 = 1 \land \lnot 1 = \lnot 1" /></p>
<p>Showing de Morgan's laws and the involution property of the negation is left as an exercise for the reader. If you prove them, please add them to this page.</p>
