<p>While The Colbert Report is a popular show in the cable universe (take note) it (or just about any other regular talk show) does not warrant its own episode guide. There have been 150 episodes done in the last year, and this page is now 99K. We don't have episode guides for nearly all game shows (like <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_of_Fortune_a6df.html" title="Wheel of Fortune">Wheel of Fortune</a>), the tonight show, letterman, the today show, maury, nightline and so forth, so why should a somewhat popular cable talk show get a guide? It also violates various parts of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, including Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought, Wikipedia is not a soapbox, Wikipedia is not a directory and Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.

Saying Similar articles don't exist is a lie. Saying this article is not useful is also a lie. This page is similar to many of these, most notably the "list of the simpsons" episodes. From which each episode has its own page, which in my opinion is less navigateable. This leaves us judging the article on "it takes up too much space". I'm not on WIKI an exceptional amount, but I didn't see any policy on "lists with many items not allowed" and if there is one, it should be respected. The simpsons list for instance; however, is twice the size of this one. Where is the threshold for too many items? Is it at exactly 154 episodes that a show has been on the air too often to have a wikipedia article? It's also <b>my opinion</b> that the submitter for deletion didn't do so in good faith and seems offended by the show itself being an "indiscriminate collection of facts" not the article.

<li>Normally I don't feed the socks, but I will give you one specific example simply to illustrate my point: In the comments for Episode 131, it states <i>"This is the first episode that has neither a Wørd nor an introductory phrase."</i> Has this fact every been previously published by credible, third-party sources? Obviously not. The only way for a Wikipedia editor to verify this fact is to sit down and watch all 131 episodes up to that point, which is not only completely impractical, but the very definition of "original research". That being said, however, if this article is kept, as now seems likely, I have the faith that editors with an interest in the subject will get the article up to standards.

<ul>
<li>Is it the definition of original research? I'm pretty sure that's not the spirit of the policy. The spirit is to have verifiable information.(although clearly one need merely scroll through the table to see that both boxes are empty there for the first time). As you said also anyone can sit down and watch the previous 130 episodes of the show (the show being a source). Won't every person that does sit down and watch it come to the same conclusion? You probably can't verify the colors of all the butterfly families without reading a portion of a probably large book. It is merely organized for use? P.S. not a sock just don't like registering for things when it's optional and wasn't aware it was unreasonable to post that way (69.76.206.124 06:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have a really hard time understanding some of this reasoning. There is a big difference between an episode guide for this and a network show like The Dukes of Hazzard. Dukes of Hazzard had like 25 episodes or so a season, and has much more established notability and ran on a network, meaning that more watched the show and recall it years later. This show has been on a year, is on cable, gets above average ratings, and with it's format, airs around 150-200 episodes a year, if it stays on the air. And that's just your opinion if the show is extremely popular, it averages around 1.5 million viewers, good for cable, but would be cancelled in days if on a network with those ratings. Just because you like the show or a few critics praise it doesn't assure that the show is massively popular. I'll stop, but there is just no reason for this page to be on here. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 18:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Firstly, I can't say if I like the show because it's not broadcast in the country where I live. Even if I did like it, that would be irrelevant. Just like your apparent dislike of the show does not matter either. There is no limitation at wikipedia to network shows. That sort of network/cable distinction is increasingly meaningless today. Secondly, the number of episodes broadcast is not a determining factor. We can not unfairly stigmatize the show for broadcasting a lot of episodes. However, given how often Colbert is in the news for one reason or another - certainly far more often than Barney or the stars of Dukes of Hazzard - I think we should be detailing his show's episodes. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:50, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I never said anything about hating the show, nominating this article had to do with that it just isn't suitable for Wikipedia, not that I think the show is overrated or such.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I wouldn't mind a list of episodes if it only had 13 episodes (or some other manageable number) in a season. The Colbert Report has so many episodes each year that this would be an immensely long list after only a couple of years.

<li><b>Keep</b> if only because I don't think individual episodes should get an article, yet it wouldn't be a good idea to not have the information. Using examples like game-shows is not using an equivalent media subject, as it doesn't make much sense to cover something that varies only by what puzzle is on and who is solving. Oh, and what they spend. And I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind a collection of who has been on the Tonight Show or the like. Sheer potential size isn't much of an issue, IMHO, since we've got things like the List of Playstation games (6000+ entries). Yeah, at some point, you might want to break things up by season, but that's a convenience issue. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:27, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't see how any of those lists you mentioned can be comparable to this one. Futurama is/was a weekly network series and had around 80 episodes. Even a low-rated episode of Futurama had its ratings several times more higher than the average episode of this show. I've said this before, if you want to keep using this guide and put it somewhere, why not make your own webpage for it? WP is not a webhost or a soapbox. I knew there were going to be a few hardcore fans of this show trying to clutter the vote just to get their show more attention, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.

<li><b>Keep</b>; I generally oppose listcruft, but this is not listcruft, and episode guides of notable television series with large audiences have wide support on Wikipedia, especially if (as here) they are treated encyclopedically.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: notable show with recurring elements and characters, much like a drama or comedy, for which we have tons of episode guides there. The argument against this article could have worked if the show was three or four weeks in and not likely to be successful, but as it is an extremely successful show and not a flash in the pan, the article must be kept. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. May eventually need trimming down or splitting (I'd suggest only having a summary for the "significant" episodes, where memorable phrases get coined or where important guests come on, but am not familiar enough with the show to get specific) but it's not like Wikipedia has limited space. Considering how much we've got on Pokemon or Gundams this doesn't seem overly large. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 06:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I haven't seen the show at all, and in fact I've never even seen an entire episode of <i>The Daily Show</i> (we don't get it over here where I live).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - No one is soapboxing here, and the show varies significantly on a day-to-day basis. If you question its notability, look at the amount of hits on Google for the Colbert Report vs. the kings of Wessex. Why shouldn't we have the first list if we have the second? <a href="../../../i/r/r/User%7EIrregulargalaxies_168c.html" title="User:Irregulargalaxies">Irregulargalaxies</a> 23:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> . If there are a lot of raw ghits for colbert-report, there are five (one, two, three, four, five) gbooks hits. For my randomly selected (and dead for over 1300 years) king of Wessex, there were around five hundred. See the difference&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 22:27, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference being that this king of Wessex has had 1300 years in which to have books written about him yet only has five hundred, whereas the Colbert Report has been on the air for roughly a year and already has five?&#160;:) Personally, I don't think benchmarks like Google hits or book numbers are very good means of comparing relative "prominence" of subjects, beyond a basic "yeah, other people have heard of this too" threshold. Too many confounding variables. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:52, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The reason of suggesting deletion has no ground. you claimed the guide violated various parts of WP:NOT and yet you failed to come up any evidence at all. 1)Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought - This article is not. 2) Wikipedia is not a soapbox - This articale's not. 3) Wikipedia is not a directory and Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information - This article's not, plus with at least 10 editors contribution this is hardly "indiscriminate collection of information". If any of the above claims is true, then by your definition every TV episode guide on WP should be deleted. The most pointless arguement of all, which is the number of episode, is simply irrelevant. Since when WP has a guideline states how "few" episodes of a program should be eligible for a guide of its own? Sorry your arbitral magic number doesn't work here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamic_2140.html" title="User:Samic">Samic</a> 07:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - The Colbert Report is not, at heart, a "talk show" like Letterman. It's fiction, with Colbert playing a fictional character. His interview subjects are more like "guest stars" in a situation comedy.

<li><b>Keep</b> You do have some good reasons for deletion but taht doesn't change the fact that this is a very useful page.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is clear that the Colbert Report Episode Lst is being singled out due to the episode frequency. Just because something happens often should not disqualify it from wikipedia. The episode blurbs are short and to the point. This has NOT become a fanpage. A lot of notable people appear on the Report and it covers many current events. This guide provides an efficient way to quickly reference who/what has been covered and when. This information is not only useful for fans, but also for those researching the relationship between the Report and the news media, current events, notable individuals, political events, etc. If such a guide were available for the O'Reilley Report it would be useful in the same way.Sturmovik 04:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
