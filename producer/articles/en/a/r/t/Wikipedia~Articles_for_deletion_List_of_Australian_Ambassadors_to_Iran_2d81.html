<li>Possibly "indiscriminate list of information". I don't think this list needs deleting, as ambassadors can be notable, but a list of links to non-entries doesn't really result in me knowing anything more than I did before reading it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 02:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Indiscriminate information is what I was thinking when I made the nom. In my opinion, as far as BIO goes these individuals are on par with "local officials" i.e. they need to be pretty notable to warrant a mention in an encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../p/d/h/User%7EPDH_bc7b.html" title="User:PDH">Peta</a> 05:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can we really apply <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here? These are lists, not biographies. If the people listed are deemed not notable for articles of their own, then just remove the internal links unless a sourced article about a notable subject does exist. That said, I'm sure that hundreds if not thousands of ambassadors <i>are</i> notable enough for articles due to other achievements or positions, and I don't think we can easily apply the "local official" designation so broadly to them. I do, however, agree with JRG, these articles would be better as a "Country A-Country B relations" article with these lists as subsets. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 14:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Senior diplomats are very often quoted as representatives of their own countries, referred to as taking part in various official events or treaties, and frequently cited as experts in the media of their own countries, especially after retirement. Still, every single ambassador may not be individually worth an article. But even if the ambassadors are not always individually notable, the positions are, and <i>lists</i> like these ones can be very useful for establishing context and chronology in other historical articles. There is in fact a major reference work with lists just like these ones, but covering the period 1648-1815, <i>Repertory of the diplomatic representatives of all countries since the peace of Westphalia (1648)</i>, published by an international committee of historians in three volumes 1936-1960. A review of the first volume called it a "[work] of immense value to historians as a book of reference" (Basil Williams in <i>The English Historical Review</i> 1937, p. 709), a review of the final volume summarized it as an "indispensible work of reference" (D. B. Horn in <i>The English Historical Review</i> 1968, p. 189). <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 14:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This nomination is not grounded in a sound understanding of any criteria for deletion. Ambassadors are highly notable, particularly in the arena of foreign relations. It's not necessarily of interest to everyone, but it's notable, verifiable, and most importantly: discriminate. Also, I don't think the nominator understands the role an ambassador fills in International Relations. The suggestion that an Ambassador is on par with a "local official" is not based on a reasonable assessment of the two jobs. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 04:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, these highly notable people, not one of which anyone has bothered to give their own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've noticed a trend I find disturbing of nominating almost any and every list on wikipedia for deletion. I see several arguments, from those wanting to delete the lists, that are fallacious and yet persistent. First, I gently encourage anyone who thinks this (and other lists on AFD, for that matter) is "indiscriminate" to actually go to wiktionary and look up the definition of the word. A muddled understanding of this word -- the notion that it refers to lists of minor importance or something -- is leading to a lot of unnecessary deletions. Second, I've seen numerous suggestions that if every item (or most) on a list does not contain a blue link, the list is invalid. This isn't the point of lists. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> explicitly states that lists can be used to develop articles that have not been written. But lists are also important that simply record chronology, etc. This list imparts useful, verifiable, notable information. The fact that the links are all red is completely irrelevant and should not be cited as a criteria for deletion. Many problematic lists will have red links, but this is not a valid reason to delete <i>all</i> lists that have red links. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 15:42, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The "disturbing trend" in this case is limited to a group of Australian editors who are in the process of tidying and pruning Australian lists into a manageable set for the limited effort available in that geography. Our focus is limited to the collection at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> and the discussion there. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:32, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Slf67, I didn't mean to suggest that the trend is the result of a cabal of editors. I didn't mean to imply that any individual is responsible for all the deletions. I sincerely apologize if that's how it was interpreted. I just meant that there's a lot of lists being nominated recently, and I repeatedly see several policies incorrectly cited. If the red links bother you, why not just remove the links? It's a useful timeline that satisfies all of wikipedia's policies. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 02:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Lack of inclusion in Wikipedia is not necessarily an indicator of non-notability, and vice versa. The lists can be kept as aiding in the development of articles on "people who are not currently covered by Wikipedia, but who should have their own articles". Please note, this may not apply to <i>all</i> of the persons on this list, but the determination of that is a matter for the talk page. If the articles are created and a better mechanism for aiding development is advanced, renominate for deletion. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 09:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Redlinks can be good because they encourage others to write an article there when they see it.
