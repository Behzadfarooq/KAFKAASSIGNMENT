<p><b>Withdraw nomination</b>. After considering the discussion below and considering recent changes made to the article by various editors including myself, I believe that there is enough notability and potential to warrant <b>keeping</b> the article. I still believe that the article needs expansion and that it needs to be reviewed to remove any hint of advertising and self-promotion but that can be addressed via the appropriate tags.</p>
<dl>
<dd>NB: For those who might be unfamiliar with the AFD process, my withdrawal of nomination of this article for AFD does NOT end this AFD debate. I cannot close the debate once it has started. The debate continues until a consensus for <b>speedy keep</b> is reached OR an admin closes the debate.</dd>

<p>Thanks to all who have contributed to this debate.</p>

<p><s>No assertion of notability</s> Failed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> when I nominated.

<dd>Lack of any assertion of notability <i>is a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion criterion</a>, that only applies to people, bands, and clubs/groups</i>. It is not a criterion for normal deletion, and it does not apply to other things. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. Notability is relevant to all subjects although the criteria for notability may differ from subject to subject.
<p>However, I am on the brink of withdrawing my nomination after looking at the references which were added subsequent to the nomination. To pass criterion #1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, some of the information in the references should be included in the article itself. Also important would be taking material from the references regarding the claims of unique pedagogical approach claimed by the school, thus satisfying criterion #4 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richardshusr</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichardshusr_7aa4.html" title="User talk:Richardshusr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Richardshusr_b77d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Richardshusr">contribs</a>) 2006-09-28 15:48:45 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li>You are disagreing with a straw man, not with what I actually wrote. You are conflating notability with <i>assertions of</i> notability. There is a difference between an article on a subject that is not notable and an article that doesn't assert the notability of its subject. The latter <i>only</i> applies to the speedy deletions of certain, specific, classes of articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:46, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not interested in mincing words and getting into a wide-ranging policy debate about notability and criteria for deletion. The bottom line is that, if the article doesn't explain why the school is notable and therefore encyclopedic, I'm keeping my vote at "Delete". The information that would satisfy me is in the two articles that are referenced. Stop arguing with me and improve the article to meet Wikipedia standards and I'll change my vote. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 21:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yet more straw men. This is not a policy debate about notability. This is you using a rationale for deletion that is <i>not a reason for deletion</i>, and your error being explained to you. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:39, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, since you seem intent on educating me, please do so. Let me jumpstart the dialogue by providing the Wikipedia sources I am relying on and you can show me the error of my reasoning. Admittedly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> is not policy; it's only a guideline. However, if you read it, there is nothing in it that limits it to "certain, specific classes of articles" while excluding schools. Also, if you look at criterion #1 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, what it's getting at essentially is notability even if it doesn't say so explicitly. Or, perhaps you're getting hung up on "notability" per se. The core may be about <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. You've got marginally reliable sources. They are marginal, because the source articles still sound like regurgitated press releases with thinly veiled promotional intent. Now, all I'm asking is that you lift the points made in these marginally reliable sources and put them in the article. Why is this so hard? --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Some apologies: On reflection, I understand <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a>'s point about "assertions of notability" vs. "notability". Apparently, some articles could be about notable subjects but still be candidates for speedy deletion if the article doesn't assert notability? Sounds crazy to me but that is apparently what the current policy means and what <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> has been trying to say. Note, however, that this is not a CSD debate but an AFD debate and, as I stated above, notability counts. I think Uncle G will agree with this. I am not convinced that this new school is notable or, skip "notable", the article does not pass <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> in its current form. Also, I still maintain that the article reads like an advertisement and therefore fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an advertising medium</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>.</li>

<dd>Also, I note that my responses above have addressed Uncle G as if he were the primary author of the article when, in fact, he has only added sources. Nonetheless, if he believes the article should be kept, then he should add text to raise it to Wikipedia quality. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 01:13, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
