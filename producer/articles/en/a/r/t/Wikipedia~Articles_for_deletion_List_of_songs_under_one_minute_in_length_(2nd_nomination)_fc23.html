<li>A <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minute.html" title="Minute">minute</a> is a very commonly used unit of time. 53.446 seconds is not.

<li>A block of thirty seconds is also a very commonly used chunk of time. Having songs under thirty seconds would be another way to list songs short enough to only be measured in seconds. We agree that what this list <i>actually is</i> is a "<i>list of short songs</i>". Where we disagree is that one definition of short is better than another. You believe that &lt;60 seconds "<i>seems like a perfectly resonable cut-off time for defining a song as being short</i>". I disagree, and I point out that your gut feeling on this amounts to nothing but a violation of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>, which is policy. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 08:08, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's a good question, Richard. Some numbers are natural, such as <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">pi</a> and <a href="../../../e/_/%28/E_%28mathematical_constant%29.html" title="E (mathematical constant)">e</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_ratio.html" title="Golden ratio">phi</a>. The number in question <i>here</i>, however, corresponds to <sup>1/</sup>1440 of an Earth revolution, and that is arbitrary. You're getting misled by the fact that this appears to be a simple whole number. It's not <i>which number</i> that is important so much as the idea that any particular number shall mean "short song", because this is indeed intended to be a <i>list of short songs</i>. The difference between this and a <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_10_list.html" title="Top 10 list">Top 10 list</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_500.html" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> list is that those numbers are chosen independently of Wikipedia, so we aren't endorsing them, rather we are merely <i>reporting them</i> from other sources, as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> requires. We aren't saying "a top ten list is a good way to see what's worth your time", or anything like that, we just report that another source has published a list and it has ten items. Same with Fortune 500. It's Fortune who decides on the number 500, not Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I disagree that it's unmaintainable, but it's clearly arbitrary. There are plenty of lists on Wikipedia that are neither arbitrary nor subjective, so <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a>'s argument that removing arbitrary lists will leave us only subjective ones clearly fails. And Fortune 500 is defined outside of Wikipedia, so it's not original synthesis (not that List of Fortune 500 companies exists anyway). I don't see any other keep arguments worth rebutting.

<li>I'm still not sure how this is supposed to be "arbitrary." For a list of very short songs, one minute or less seems a reasonable cut-off: it's based on a round figure of a standard measure. At any rate, whether it's arbitrary or not, claiming that this is "original research" or an "original synthesis" ignores and distorts the actual language and meaning of those policies beyond recognition. What we're left with instead is a list on a popular culture subject that's certain to draw hostile attention, that at least one editor found interesting or useful. The only policy I see applying here is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_paper.html" title="Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is <i><b>still</b></i> not paper</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:44, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sure, one minute is a nice round number, but it's still arbitrary. Why not one second? Or one hour? Or one year? Phrase your answer in the form of a citation to a reliable source, please. The question is, ultimately, who decided this was a worthy topic for a list? If the <i>only possible</i> answer is "some random Wikipedian", then that makes this a novel synthesis! Wikipedia, like any encyclopedia, is supposed to distill what other, reliable sources have written about. Yes, it's not paper, but it's still supposed to be an encyclopedia. I think this is a great list, and I hope it finds a home on the Internet somewhere. I just don't think Wikipedia is the place for it. Maybe Wikisource would be good. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:00, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, it doesn't. The policy about "original syntheses" you are referring to actually speaks about "analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor". This, by contrast, is a list of songs, and if there is some tendentious point to it, I haven't found it and no one else has pointed it out either. These policies lose meaning if they are extended so far beyond the things they were meant to cover. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">Lists on Wikipedia</a> serve a valuable indexing function, and they indeed <i>can</i> be about arranging facts in ways that some random user found useful or interesting. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:42, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

To me, this is <i>solely</i> an issue of content organisation. One minute (60 seconds) is a common cut-off point.
