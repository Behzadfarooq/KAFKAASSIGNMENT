<li><b>Keep</b> The Bible certainly talks about rape. And even if it's spoken of rarely, the very fact that rape is today considered such a heinous crime, it's nonpresence in the Bible is all the more noteworthy. I find it shocking that rape is not mentioned in the Ten Commandments. This article should exist if only to point out that the Bible says nothing about rape being bad. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 07:32, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: there are an infinite number of "The Bible and..." topics one can arbitrarily create.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Although I can't agree with everything <a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a> states, we do need to be careful about the proliferation of "The Bible and ..." articles. However, the Bible is a cultural artifact that has had an indelible impact upon western culture. This impact continues to this day in the Bible’s role as sacred <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">scripture</a> to various religious communities. As such, it is important to have an encyclopedic entry discussing the biblical description of rape, its varying interpretation (Jewish, Christian, Islamic), and the influence of this interpretation today (How does it effect the way modern societies view sex and violence?). <a href="../../../e/m/-/User%7EEm-jay-es_9812.html" title="User:Em-jay-es"><span style="background:#006400; size:2; color:#DCDCDC;"><i>Em-jay-es</i></span></a> 21:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is mentioned there and it is a subject. I do not see in which way it is related to Judaism. Why should it be on the 'Judaism-related AfD list'? Then it should be about the Jewish view on rape. This way, all you get is Christian 'bible scientists' who don't care about what Judaism says. So better make two pages, for example: Christian view on sexual assault and Jewish view on sexual assault. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel575_08a4.html" title="User talk:Daniel575">(talk)</a></i></small> 16:36, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Crazy Russian must be joking, as God obviously doesn't have a copywrite. The Bible is public domain. As for the whole Christian bias thing, the Bible is favored by Christians, but everyone agrees that it is a significant document. What I am trying to do is this: The Bible is often used to point a finger at homosexuals. It is rarely used to point a finger at rapists, because the God of the bible has no problem with rape. Because most Christians agree that rape is bad, this article can show that the Bible is not the basis for modern day morality. - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 23:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Although a rather poor source, the linked website demonstrates this isn't original research. Add that to the fact that anyone can pick up a Bible and confirm these verses. The article needs work, but that doesn't warrant deletion. Perhaps the references can be organized more along the lines of topic. Perhaps: Prominent incidences of rape, Punishment for rape, Forced marriage, and Rape as a spoil of war. More than just a list of verses is needed in the article, though it will be tough to not add POV. The verses could use some straightforward NPOV context. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 01:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One of the benefits of Wikipedia is the breadth of its content. Religion is an important component of people's lives and sets the context for how people behave in both religious and secular environments. If other articles on theology and interpretations of the Bible are worth including, then I don't see how this one is not. It is of significance that this informs worldviews, and therefore compiled information on the topic is of value to those who seek to understand such worldviews. The fact that you can make an article titled The Bible and X does not take away from the significance of this article, it only means that articles on those topics haven't been written yet. The Bible is a major force in the development of civilization in the West, and anything that adds to a context that helps in understanding it is of value. This can be especially noted in the development of legal systems through the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_of_hammurabi.html" title="Code of hammurabi">code of hammurabi</a> through the ancient laws of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_tribes_of_Israel_946b.html" title="Twelve tribes of Israel">twelve tribes of Israel</a> through to the codes of Rome, the Middle Ages, through today (this is a rather controversial argument in American society, the extent to which the founding fathers based the fledging democracy on views put forward in the Bible). Also, there are plenty of sources to support this article that would make it not original research. Because the article is inadequate now doesn't not mean that it'll remain inadequate in the future. Everything takes work, this is just a beginning, and we should work to add more information in an impartial way.</li>

<li>Evil Bible does not hold a copywrite on the bible. Those passages are from the public domain Bible. As for the research, I just didn't go through the Bible with a magnifying glass looking for mention of rape. EvilBible did. But anyone could have.

<li><b>Changed vote to Delete</b> See above strikethrough. The issues here seems to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>. A dry list of "Bible Passages Referencing Rape" is scanty on the notability curve. Interpretation is needed to make the passages encyclopedic; however WikiPedia can at BEST report on interpretation as published in reputable sources (those held to standards of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">editorial review</a>). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> has already posted some sources that could be used. To interpret the Bible passages on your own, even to just paraphrase what the Bible passages said in your own words is to engage in Original Research in some form. Also, as it stands, many passages identified as describing "Rape" are possible Original Research simply in the identification of the passage. For one example, the passage that starts with Numbers 31:7 only mentions women as "spoils of war" It does not imply, implicitly or explicitly, forced sexual relations. One could easily make the case that, as their men were killed, the women accepted their status as captors, and willingly went with their new masters. To assume otherwise is to possible assign modern western motives and values on a situation that may not be under that particular interpretation. So even the existance of many of the passages in the article (where rape is not stated, but interpreted as existing through the lens of modern values) could be considered Original Research. Other passages in the article suffering from this sort of problem include Judges 21:10, Deuteronomy 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:23, 2 Samuel 12:11, Deuteronomy 21:10, Judges 5:30, Exodus 21:7. Removal of those passages, which may not even refer to rape (assuming rape requires interpretation), leaves 3 passages. That's far too scanty to have an article built around. This article seems doomed to start with. Eliminate all interpretation, and lose the article on notability grounds; or keep the interpretation, and lose the article on Original Research grounds. Either way, it seems a lose-lose option. If the sources listed above could be incorporated into this article, and all original research removed, it MAY be savable. But I doubt it. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 04:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
