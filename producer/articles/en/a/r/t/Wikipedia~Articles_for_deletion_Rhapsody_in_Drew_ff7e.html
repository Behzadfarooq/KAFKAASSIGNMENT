<li>Im so sorry for what i said if you want this file to be deleted and have nothing but emptiness like the feeling Shadow the hedgehog had when his heart was broken or the feeling I had when my dad died 3 years ago but you probably wouldnt believe me or just joke im sorry about the deletion it was my younger sister who did it while i was in the rest room.

<li><del><b>Delete</b></del> Ouuuuch. I was about to say CSD A1 (no context), but then the morning coffee kicked in and I got inspired to research a bit. Good that I'm not an overly hasty person, especially before the morning coffee. =) So it's a <i>Pokemon series episode</i>. Why didn't you say so before? Anyway, individual episodes of the series aren't automatically notable, unless there's something remarkable to say about it, and even then they are often best merged to bigger articles. So either delete the thing, or perhaps merge to an article about the season (or whatever). --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Changing to <b>Weak keep</b>, only weak because the content is likely to get rewritten anyway if this is kept.

<li>One of the aforementioned articles has been revealed to be <b>copyright violation</b>, and probably almost every Pokémon episode article here is. Therefore, I'm changing my vote to <b>Delete</b>.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but it'll probably stay anyway.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless we've become wikipokia. Also, as it stands, not until the middle of the article does it tell you that the article is about pokemon.
