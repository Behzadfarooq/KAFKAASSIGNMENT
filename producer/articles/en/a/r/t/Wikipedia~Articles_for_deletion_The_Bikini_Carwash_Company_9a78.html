<li><b>Weak keep</b>. A little struggle with this one - it's an old enough film where sources likely exist, but aren't readily available. We have the allmovie link, which is reliable and independent, and the IMDb cast listing, which is reliable and independent, so we have what we need for the stub covered. <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=17-0&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.variety.com%2Farticle%2FVR1117935362.html%3Fcategoryid%3D25%26cs%3D1%26nid%3D2584&amp;ei=xBgFRpuKEbfG6wHyv_SfBA&amp;usg=__ty2TJRYudq6bAI0YDq42uKdofRQ=" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=17-0&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.variety.com%2Farticle%2FVR1117935362.html%3Fcategoryid%3D25%26cs%3D1%26nid%3D2584&amp;ei=xBgFRpuKEbfG6wHyv_SfBA&amp;usg=__ty2TJRYudq6bAI0YDq42uKdofRQ=" rel="nofollow">The film was notable enough in the director's resume</a> to warrant mention in his obituary, which means something, so I see no reason to delete.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No independent references (IMDB is user editable); no evidence of significance; virtually everybody in it is a nonentity (i.e. redlinked).

<li>The cast and crew areas are actually vetted by someone else before they're updated, and they <i>are</i> independent. The amount of redlinks has nothing to do with something's significance, it simply means we have poor coverage in this area. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quite an awful movie, but that's not a valid reason. I am not convinced by the redlink thing. If you take movies by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bresson_afb4.html" title="Robert Bresson">Robert Bresson</a>, for instance, who was using amateurs as actors at the end of his career (see <i><a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouchette.html" title="Mouchette">Mouchette</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancelot_du_Lac_%28film%29_a4fc.html" title="Lancelot du Lac (film)">Lancelot du Lac</a></i> for instance), you will have redlinks everywhere too. And you won't say that Bresson's movies are not notable. IMDB is not user editable, afaik, you can suggest edits but they are screened.

<li><b>Keep</b> - notable film. The nominator defining it as "soft porn" is a POV judgement call. It wasn't at all. I agree not every film can be listed, but this one has a cult following and includes cast members such as Landon Hall and Sara Suzanne Brown who are quite prolific in the 1980s-1980s B-movie industry. I'm also pretty certain this film was issued or distributed by a major company, however the new version of IMDb doesn't appear to list this information anymore. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per Badlydrawnjeff. A Google News Archive search for this film yields over 100 hits <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22bikini+carwash+company%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22bikini+carwash+company%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, although virtually all of them are accessible only for pay. (Some of the hits refer to this film's sequel, and there appears to be a band named after the film as well.) However, if we had access to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showtime.html" title="Showtime">Showtime</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinemax.html" title="Cinemax">Cinemax</a>'s records, I suspect we would find that this movie played on those channels more than all of Bresson's works combined. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 15:55, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>—for once I find myself in full agreement with badlydrawnjeff. I struggled a bit with this, and my first inclination was to say delete, but I think there's sufficient evidence that it has achieved at least a minor cult status. The fact that it was mentioned in the obituary, the fact that a band is named after it, regular appearances on television (including, apparently, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Up_All_Night_495c.html" title="USA Up All Night">USA Up All Night</a>, international distribution, <a href="../../../n/e/r/Neriah_Davis_6be9.html" title="Neriah Davis">Neriah Davis</a>'s first film; all of this adds up to sufficient notability, IMO. <i>On-line</i> references do seem a bit weak (although the existence of the same-named band makes searching difficult), but that argument leads to a "recentism" bias. I see enough to make me confident that there are reliable sources to be found, even if Google has trouble finding them. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 00:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
