<li>They want to assert notability using three newspapers articles, no way. They've already made a decision.

<li>And every provocative company that <i>does</i> get a BBC article (and coverage in at least one other place) should have enough verifiable information from those sources to write an article about it. It being a year ago is immaterial - notability doesn't change with time. Who is "they" and why does my membership of AMA have anything to do with this? Do you even know what the AMA does? Yes, we can assert notability on the basis of 3 newspaper articles, because those 3 newspaper articles provide enough verifiable information to write an article.

<li>Okay, put here everything with an article in the newspapers. Yesterday I read an article about the corner in the neighbourhood, it was in two newspapers independently. Maybe I should start an article about that corner. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 18:15, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there enough verifiable information to write a decent-sized article about said corner? Are the sources reliable and independent? If yes, then it could have an article.

The few sources that wrote about it might be enough for verifiability, but are not enough to make it notable. No other authors, scholars, or journalists gave it any attention. Notability is generally permanent - this company does not have any frequent coverage, compared to <a href="../../../g/a/p/Gap.html" title="Gap">Gap</a>, for example. It is not even listed on independent indices of clothing companies. I don't see any reason to keep it. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 22:52, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It passes the Primary Notability Criterion "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself". Notability is generally permanent, as you say - that is the reason that it <i>doesn't need</i> any frequent coverage, it was once notable so it still is. I still think you're looking at notability as somehow associated with importance, which it isn't. The reason to keep is that there is sufficient verifiable information to write an article that doesn't conflict with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - which is pretty much what notability is. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:03, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being notable as you define it is necessary for being included in Wikipedia, but not sufficient. For relatively-unknown persons and companies, it is enough to include them in a list (in this case, "List of clothing companies" or something similar). For example, all the schools in some area deserve to be listed in "List of schools in X" but not individually, unless a school is exceptional in some way. And I guess that most activities in schools are covered by the local press, so there you have "multiple independent sources", yet they don't qualify for individual articles. Maybe you mixed notability and verifiability. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 08:18, 25 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where are you getting this from (and you now seem to be arguing it <i>is</i> notable, which is a turn around)? Name a policy or guideline which having this article would disagree with - simply to assert that for "relatively-unknown persons and companies (an entirely subjective judgement, based on a personal idea of "importance"), it is enough to include them in a list" does not prove anything. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 08:55, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Added to that have been numerous irrelevant comments about local events in your newspaper and other AfDs. Argue in this case, for this article, not by making pointless comparisons. If you can give me a convincing reason for deletion (which <i>isn't</i> subjective), then I'll change my views. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 01:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hi Trebor. First of all, I didn't say it is now notable. I said that if you use your suggested definition of notability, you end up listing on Wikipedia every company, every school, every TV show, every album and every song on Earth, as well as most non-anonymous people. And now I'll answer your question about subjectivity. You <i>must</i> use some judgment when deciding what articles should exist in an encyclopedia and which should be left out or minimized, e.g. by including them in lists. I know that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, but still some subjective criterions should be applied. The policies that you mentioned are usually used the other way. For example, a person or company that was not mentioned in multiple independent sources is clearly non-notable, and thus it's a clear-cut delete decision. <b>But</b> even if a person or company <i>was</i> mentioned in multiple independent sources, it may still be non-notable and thus deleted, because, yes, <i>from a subjective point of view it makes sense</i>. This is the reason for the AfD process. If there is a "technical" reason for deletion ("clear-cut"), then the decision is obvious. Otherwise, it is open for debate, and in this specific case, I think it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 12:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, no, no - deletion should <i>not</i> be subjective. That's what causes <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>, that's what makes it dependent on what people <i>feel</i> and on which people decide to vote. There is no subjectivity anywhere in the policies or deletion guidelines (to the best of my knowledge). AfD is a place to ask for and be shown sources, to argue the reliability of sources, to discuss whether an article belongs in an encyclopaedia (whether it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), etc. You say I'm using my "suggested definition of notability", but it is the consensual one on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> - it should be used. Subjectivity undermines the whole deletion process. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 12:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Deletion must be little subjective. You are not a machine, just think about this company and think why it is notable and why it is in encyclopedia - because there were three articles in the newspapers. That's pretty bad reason. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 13:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That directly contradicts <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">this</a> though - notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. Our personal opinions are irrelevant. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 14:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't believe you think that three newspapers articles about company assert notability. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 20:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What exactly is your argument? You've changed and changed and changed, and every time I ask for an explanation you seem to go off on a tangent into a different point. If I may, can I ask a few straight questions and get a few straight answers? Do you think deletion should be a subjective decision? Do you think this article qualifies as notable using the consensual definition at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>? Do you think notability (as defined by that guideline) is sufficient for an article and, if not, what else must there be? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll tell you <i>my</i> argument. It's simple. You need notability plus common sense. Unfortunately, common sense is not so common in Wikipedia. For example, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rick_Ufford-Chase_84e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rick Ufford-Chase">other non-notable article</a> that I nominated for deletion was kept. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 07:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This suggests you have no argument. Common sense is obviously subjective (as we don't agree here), so cannot be used as a deletion criterion. And aside from that, you seem to have nothing. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 08:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What you say is not accurate. The deletion criterion was clearly stated in the first place, and it is non-notability. The handful of independent sources that mention this company are not "multiple" as the notability criterion suggests. Using also common sense for deletion decisions doesn't hurt. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 09:46, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what more, these articles are more about the political party members who estabilished that company. Not about company itself. We can't take it as a multiple non-trivial works about subject, simply cannot. <b><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETulkolahten_ac82.html" title="User:Tulkolahten"><span style="background:#CCFFFF;color:#FF0033">≈Tulkolahten≈</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/u/l/User_talk%7ETulkolahten_1a96.html" title="User talk:Tulkolahten">≈talk≈</a></sup></b> 10:20, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
