<p>Bizarre but notable if it's true. Or, maybe not. (I wonder who the first person to put down "Jedi" was - don't you?)

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are enough google hits to convince me it's real (at least for small values of real). It's certainly intriguing, and I don't see any obvious proof that it's vanity.

As an acquaintance of Cassandra herself I can vouch for the fact that she is (still) the only witch in the UK who relies on her craft as her sole source of income and that she was the first witch in the UK to register her profession with the inland revenue; I can think of at least two others who have since followed suit. Whether as an acquaintance of Cassandra's, writing an article about her is considered vanity is up for debate; I wrote it in a rare mad moment. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Talk</a> [[]] 11:26, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately we've also had a great deal of trouble with <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_proxy.html" title="Open proxy">open proxies</a>. An IP test isn't very meaningful when lists of literally hundreds are easily available. Dyanmic IPs are problematic also, though less so. Furthermore, it takes a developer to check the IP of a logged-in user, and the time they have to spend on non-development tasks is very, very limited. â<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 12:27, Jan 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not wanting to drag this into a long technical discussion (I also truncated my earlier comment). However, since wikipedia uses PHP, you should know that a PHP variable holds the IP of the visitor. That's how the site knows your IP when you're not logged in. Therefore, it would be easy to include both user ID <i>and</i> IP in the history. That would at least mitigate the "unable to get IP" issue. As for Dynamic IP, at least the different IPs would be w/n the same domain. But, while CommieCast has dynamic IPs, I've had the same IP for the past 21 months. Can't say much about "open proxies." At least this is educational.</li>

<p>Minor point. I had somebody privately inform me that it is more commonly called "Lexicon Game" as opposed to Lexicon RPG. When googling on that criteria, there are more accurate hits. Also, I have been told that googling "Lexicon Neel" is also an effective way of finding Lexicon pages. So, earlier assessments from a google on variations of Lexicon RPG are a bit skewed. Perhaps, also, this should be recategorized from RPG to games, or maybe wiki-games? --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenWilson_3b1d.html" title="User:BenWilson">BenWilson</a> 04:19, Jan 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did so only because that is a more appropriate name than LexiconRPG, as I have been told by several people. Not to circumvent the process. If this page had been deleted, I would have moved for that one to be immediately deleted as well. ----~</p>

<li>This term is reeeeeasonably widely used among gamers--White Wolf gamers, at any rate, or gamers talking about White Wolf games.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. While some of the votes were clear, they appear to be based on conflicting facts which did not get a great deal of discussion.</p>
<p>Based on my own research, I note that Cataclysm is already mentioned (in almost this same level of detail) in the main <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a> article. There does not appear to be any significant content to merge. I do not see this as a particularly useful redirect. My personal conclusion is that delete is the simplest and cleanest solution for this article. Counting my own vote, that gets 3 delete, 1 merge and one no vote. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:21, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This 'hoax,' is presently under study at one of America's top 3 engineering schools, who take it very seriously indeed. It is under license to several top American multinational corporations. The patent office has approved the claims, based upon an experimental demonstration. The only claim made, is that one can move magnetic flux from one side of a core, to the other, based upon pulsing coils. If that is untrue, then all of physics must be wrong, as presently understood. Something I find rather unlikely ...pigs should fly indeed. Furthermore, this technology has found significant international recognition through publication in Nexus magazine, translated into several languages, and internationally distributed, which resulted in several academic enquiries for further information, which were fulfilled. This is not my only contribution, I have edited several other articles, adding significant content in the IT section to existing stub pages, such as nforce, nforce 2, soundstorm, ATI, Nvidia, and others, before I formally registered. The request for deletion is wholly uninformed comment, apparently based upon raw emotion of some sort. This is exciting leading edge commercial technology, that in the years to come will become an important part of magnetic engineering. The text is both conservative, to the point, and non commercial in presentation, as is required. Why should knowledge of this exciting technology be suppressed, when a public domain article has been freely offered? What is so controversial, about the idea you can pulse a coil, and move a magnetic field around a core. I fail to see it.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> First there's the title "Joeflynn" which seems to be the name of the inventor (and I assume the author of the article) and not the invention. If nothing else the article should be renamed. I don't get any hits on Google for a "Joeflynn" other than a person. Second, the links in the article are only lead to a few very obscure web publications.

<p>There is talk of a peer reviewed article, I know some drafts have already been drawn up, but it always takes time to submit, review, etc. So what you are saying, is that until this gets in the peer reviewed literature, Wiki can't run it? Seems harsh. You could rename it 'parallelpath.' Thats the technology name. The patent is a form of official recognition. I dispute the fact Nexus magazine is an obsure web publication. It is distributed in paper form, on 4 continents, in several different languages, with sales in tens of thousands, and a much wider overall readership. So I would disagree with the wording 'obscure' and 'web.'</p>

<dd>What I'm saying is that it may or may not be a brilliant idea but that's not the issue. Even if it is a great invention it doesn't become notable (i.e. encyclopedic) until it has an impact on the world. For example, people start building and using the invention or it becomes a concept which is widely discussed (at least within engineering circles). When that happens the article could be resubmitted and will be favorably received. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">LeeHunter</a> 19:34, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Wonderful. Its a valid commercial technology, under license to multinational corporations. Its under academic study at top American universities, and indeed internationally. It has been accepted for publication internationally TWICE already, authored by someone with a genuine postgrad qualification from one of England's top 5 universities.

<li><b>Delete</b>. By itself the article is now a few dry diagrams and a little text. I am afraid that it may grow to include unproven claims. Of the three links, two are pay sites so I didn't read the actual articles. But the article titles that I could see included stuff like Area 51, Urine Therapy, and theoretical miraculous energy systems - all low-verifiability. The official website has page labelled "<a href="http://www.flynnresearch.net/prototype_test__data.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.flynnresearch.net/prototype_test__data.htm" rel="nofollow">Prototype Test Data</a>" which says "Contents will be added to this page by 8-1-2001, Please check back with us!" Yeah, sure thing. Once this invention has become proven/practical/otherwise notable we can put an article in. There's no need for a page on every patent looking for financial backing.

<p>I have made many contributions to the Wiki, most especially in the IT section, including filling out the stubs for nForce, nForce2, ATI, Soundstorm, Nvidia, and others. I was moved to finally register, simply out of the need to upload images for this article. The POD core is a widely replicated flux experiment, that showcases some genuinely interesting physics. An internet discussion group ran based upon it for some time, but without further funding I can not pursue the research, and simply wish it to be made available as common knowledge. The CD motor and POD cores have both been referenced in the internationally distributed Nexus magazine â so once again, the request for deletion makes false and uninformed comment. And finally, this Egroup is a continuation of this innovative research. In sum, I must question the motives and impartiality of Susvolan, and feel there may be a personal agenda of some sort, because he repeatedly makes demonstrataby false comments about my articles. I am happy for these two links to be added to the article, along with a reference for Nexus magazine, if the condition of Wiki entry, is that you must have been published elswhere previously - in this case, this condition has clearly been met.</p>

<li>Ohhhh, I recognize this stuff. That's an Adams motor, and you've been experimenting with overunity.

<p>Fine. If it needs some sort of edit to bring it 'in line,' then do it. But you can not say it does not work, as JM has taken the technology to a viable commercial product, as now referenced at the bottom of the page, in an edit I made 5 minutes ago, whose performance exceeds that of many conventional charge controllers. It has also been previously published in other forums, on the internet, and in hard copy. If it requires some form of 'perpetual motion tag,' as you see it, then just add it. But if SMOT can be kept in Wiki as a valid entry, I fail to see why a viable commercial grade technology should be deleted. And, may I point out, the article does *NOT* directly claim perpetual motion. It is a valid piece of research, widely replicated in JM's Egroup, and one I ran before that. Why not join the Egroup, and decide for yourself?</p>

<p>Its a write up of how a commercial patented technology was derived, one widely replicated, that shows a higher efficiency than existing technology. You take a comment not made in the article, to judge it. I was unaware the Wiki was not allowed to document the development of viable real world commercial technology, and I don't know the rules as well as you guys. I find it bizarre, that the SMOT toy is allowed to stand, yet this comes in for a hard time. May I kindly request, the SMOT article be deleted, as that has no peer reviewed scientific reference of which I am aware, either, and is most definitely "original research". I simply think you have a responsibility to apply editorial standards equally to all articles. Thats all. If you do that, then there can be no complaint. If editorial policy is variable - well, it just looks bad. Thanks.</p>

<dd>Well, I'll wait and see. I based my submission upon what was already in the Wiki. If my page gets deleted, I will look for any other non peer reviewed "original research" pages, and ask they be deleted as well. If I see some technology, with no peer review reference at the bottom, I'll nominate it. This could create quite a long list of deletions, and a large loss of content potentially, but rules are rules, I guess. The important thing is that the Wiki is consistent in what it allows. As long as that is the case, there can be no complaint. But clearly, a long list of other misguided content exists, but for some reason, someone decided to pick on mine, and ignore a lot of the other stuff like SMOT. Even I think SMOT is junk.</dd>

<li>Good point, Anthony; perhaps precedent is the wrong word. To say that the use of a censored or abridged version in one instance validates another is faulty. The Abu Ghraib page is not a policy. IMHO it shouldn't exist. I suppose I haven't invested the time and effort to fight it because its existence isn't as offensively POV as in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>. POV, but of the view that viewing torture, murder, and dead corpses is something people might not want to see. It's the same thing, but I personally find the view that people will be offended/disgusted/scarred by an actual depiction of the female form much, much more offensive. So my view stands, but perhaps one should substitute "endorsement of POV" with "precedent." <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_3fbc.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc">Timbo</a> 01:29, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey Centauri, what happened to your stirring arguments of keeping every minute detail for prosperity on Wikipedia? If you want this deleted but the others kept, there is a lack of consistency in your arguments.

<li>There's obviously a big difference between deleting valuable content which otherwise wouldn't exist at all on Wikipedia, and deleting a redundant sanitized version of an already existing unsanitized article.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:52, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>All browsers that I have ever encountered (and I've seen a lot of them since NCSA Mosaic in 1994) have the ability to download images, or not download images--it's usually a switch in prefs. I use this facility when visiting a page that contains images that I don't like to look at. Just because somebody puts a picture on a website, doesn't mean they're forcing me to download it and look at it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:11, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tech-savvy is the wrong word. Modern browsers are designed for GUI operation, anyone can do this.

<li>A person can not do something they don't know how to do. The problem here is the fact that English does not have an indicitive/subjunctive distinction. Yes, a person could do something they don't know how to do...once they learn how to do it. But, until they learn, they don't know how to do it. And, besides, putting a link at the top of the page which allows people to go to a version of the page without images it a lot simpler than turning off images in most browsers. Also: Why should a person not be allowed to look at pictures of bunny rabbits just because they have different values than the left-wing people on Wiki. I can not support the idea of giving people with different values than left-wingers a discrimitory experience. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamboy_e9bc.html" title="User:Samboy">Samboy</a> 19:45, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it is reasonable to expect that people who want to use the world wide web will first learn how to operate a web browser. I'm shocked to find people here freely admitting that they do not, and apparently clinging to the belief that this is somebody else's problem. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:54, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

(Parenthetically, I don't understand how anyone can be impressed by a perpetual motion machine whose diagram shows a battery in the circuit! If the thing works, why can't it just use, say, a charged capacitor to get it started, and maintain the charge thereafter with the "free energy" it extracts from, whereever it extracts it...) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:15, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How many of those are for perpetual motion machines? I'll admit to a certain bias towards screwy impossible claims made for tangible inventions, but I think that claim is what makes these things so good to read about. There are just 109 bullet points in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines.html" title="History of perpetual motion machines">History of perpetual motion machines</a>, so it doesn't seem to be the inexhaustible field some have tried to make it out to be. And not that many of them will be worth an article; I think this one is because it's contemporary and is still used as a basis for experiments by Free Energy nuts today. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:12, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because we have an article on one toy doesn't mean we should have an article on every toy. This is a perpetual motion patent despite the laws against perpetual motion patents.
