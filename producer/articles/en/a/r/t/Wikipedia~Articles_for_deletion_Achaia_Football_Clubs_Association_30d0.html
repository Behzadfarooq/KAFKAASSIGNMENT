<dd>When improved and expanded, the article will contain information about the association and will be verifiable and neutral. Can you quote one key policy that is being violated? The only argument for it's deletion is notability and it is not always so trivial to decide what is important or not. Why should we consider the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Downs_Football_League_5a67.html" title="Bristol Downs Football League">Bristol Downs Football League</a> article more notable?

The article is no less relevant than other football clubs that have articles and we always must work to fight systemic bias, so it should stay. However, the format it is currently in is terrible; its still just a list of champions with almost no prose. The lists need to be cut down or removed and the article needs to be modeled after other football club articles; it needs to consist mostly in prose. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 09:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If i am not mistaken, anyone with 50+ edits has the right to vote, so comments on the ethnicity of the people who vote are really irrelevant. Besides, it is only natural for Greeks to vote, since they know better what the article is about. The only reason for deletion is it's notability (certainly the content needs serious improvement too but this is not our issue here), however the basic argument against it is that there already exist similar articles about amateur or very low-level clubs/leagues. Please let people decide without commenting on or attacking the voters and if any vote is illegal then it simply won't be counted. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDada_6d84.html" title="User:Dada"><font color="blue">D</font><font color="red">a</font><font color="darkgreen">d</font><font color="purple">a</font></a> 14:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is so unimportant article. It has to do with a minor amature league of a district, even lower than Greek Fourth Division, where teams play in very bad stadium, and the teams are so weak. It does really not affect Greek football and I doubt even if that could be in a Greek encyclopedia (except wikipedia). So unimportant that doesn't cause the interest even of Greek fans and media. Nobody in the world will care about such an article. If such an article is accepted, I wonder what is not in wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also as we saw, so unimportant it is that ONLY GREEKS SUPPORT IT. The fact that is not accepted by the rest of the world, speaks everything. If Greeks want it so much, why they don't write it for their own in Greek wikipedia and want it here where nobody wants it, except them? Their opinion I think is too subjective. One proof of that that some of them called everyone who is Greek to save the article. One thing that proves the aim of them is that they called me anti-Greek because I proposed it for deletion. Their goal is pariotic rather than helping contribution in wikipedia.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whoa now, this is beginning to take on a somewhat racist tone.

KRBN, please tone down this inappropriate rhetoric. The problem with the article is NOT that it's Greek, rather its that it's merely a list and the title misrepresents whats located within.

<li>if amateur leagues are to have a presence at all on Wikipedia this league has a record of representing Greece in the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Regions_Cup_d8b3.html" title="UEFA Regions Cup">UEFA_Regions_Cup</a> (this is UEFA's top amateur competition and only one team composed of players from one amateur domestic league can qualify - Achaia won the Greek spot by eliminating the collective team of other amateur Greek leagues) in 2005. (<a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/RegionsCup/history/Season=2004/round=1962/Group=1991.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/RegionsCup/history/Season=2004/round=1962/Group=1991.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). There are leagues in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> that have not achieved this but have been accepted. There has been a similar discussion on English low level teams here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football/Archive6#Level_10_notability_debates_on_AfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football/Archive6#Level_10_notability_debates_on_AfD" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]</li>
<li>the league itself has been around for nearly 80 years, and teams such as <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a> who have won this league several times in the past have moved on and played in Greece’s <a href="../../../a/1/_/A1_Ethniki_76f7.html" title="A1 Ethniki">A1 Ethniki</a>, contributing players to the national team (hence the league has an element of historical significance too)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><b>However</b>, I think individual teams within this league should not necessarily have their own wiki entry (ie just for having participated in the league itself), unless of course they have demonstrated other notability criteria (like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a>). So I propose that the red links should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>I also agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">User:The Way</a>’s comment in that the format could be changed to resemble that of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a>.

<p>To my surprise, this process is working. I have already put in the information that <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> has taken the trouble to find (and some more). I understand <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a>'s desire to remove links, I would not get into the trouble. In my opinion red links are OK, even if they should better stay red for a very very very long time (no objection there). I understand the impression of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a>'s of the long list. It is a bit boring, but it is the FCA's history: The scope of playing is winning, winners should be noted (rather than a factual but ultraboring list of all teams participating in the FCA). It also shows <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a>'s history (an FC of national level Greek football). And...yes...the article was really ugly, but this was a question of notability as pointed out by several wikipedians who participated in this discussion, not a beauty contest.--<a href="../../../f/o/c/User%7EFocalPoint_b506.html" title="User:FocalPoint">FocalPoint</a> 20:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
