<dd><b>Comment</b> Bubba's right. If the band is notable then it should have an article on itself, not an article about the school where it comes from. If Mr. Smith has a dog that is notable, would you write an article about the dog or Mr. Smith?--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 14:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't make any sense. We don't usually make separate articles for notable high school sports teams and bands. If a school has a notable organization within it, that is reason to have an article about the school itself. WP:SCHOOL has been very clear about this. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 14:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It makes perfect sense. If a high school would be notable simply and only for the fact that it has a notable band within its premises, then apart from the band there's nothing worthwhile to say about the school and therefore an article about the band would suffice. WP:SCHOOL is not a policy.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 14:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By this logic, we should split some schools up into 5 or 10 different articles, depending on how many notable organizations they have. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 14:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think if a school had 5 to 10 different notable organizations, it would be considered notable as a whole. The crux of this matter is two-fold: the notability of the school (contested), and the notability of the marching band (agreed) – therefore you would expect the claim to notability to be the main focus of the article and as such placed in a more prominent position. Just a thought. I'm still out for deliberation. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">HoTep</a> 14:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

"2. The school has verifiably gained national recognition in an area such as curriculum (academics in U.S.), architecture, athletics, or extracurricular activities, or for its history or its program of instruction. For example, the school has won a science competition at the national level, or its athletic teams hold a nationwide record.<br />

- The band as well as the winterguard has many nationwide awards.<br />

<dd>The borderline between trivial and notable is at each one's own discretion. For me none of that information is encyclopedic.

<dd>I'm perturbed by the above comment, and particularly perturbed that the person who made it did not feel able to contact me directly. I would encourage him to "assume good faith" here and elsewhere. I have added a note about why I participate in AfD debates to my user-page, which I hope is useful. I have also added a comment to the above user's talk-page. The problem for me is that I feel that for a school to be notable it has to do something more than just exist and teach students. The two places where notability might most plausibly be asserted for this school are: (a) the fact that it's a magnet school, and (b) the supposedly unusual steelwork in the architecture. On (a) I feel that although the policy of magnet schools is notable, the individual schools so designated are not per se notable unless their teaching styles develop unique characteristics that are not general to all magnet schools. On (b) I feel that the reference from the "Steel Joist Institute" simply uses the school as an example of an architectural and construction technique, and does not assert any particular notability for the school building per se. On balance, therefore, I do not feel that notability is sufficiently clearly established. I hope this helps. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Article is an excellent, encyclopedic article that makes explicit claims of notability per both <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> and per <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>, as noted above. Sources provided are relevant, reliable and verifiable. Nominator offers no standard by which this article fails to demonstrate notability, other than his knee-jerk rejection of this article, making it impossible to demonstrate that an objective standard has -- or has not -- been met. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
