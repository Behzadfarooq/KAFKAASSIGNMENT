<dd>Sexual abuse as a sociological notion does not exist in clergy and non-clergy subflavors. Events, such as the Catholic sex-abuse controversy, merit their own articles for having been covered by the media, and individual confirmed/prosecuted molestors do as well, but this article was not about any specific events. At the time of nomination the article existed as a "clergy" fork of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> with a fat linkfarm at the bottom.

<dd>OK, thanks. Now, I understand the context and motivation for your original AFD nomination. I also get the point that "Sexual abuse by clergy" is not necessarily much different from "Sexual abuse by people in positions of authority" from a sociological point of view.</dd>

<dd>However, due to the Roman Catholic sexual abuse cases, there has been some focus on this question in the popular media and in religious organizations. In essence, people naturally asked "Is this phenomenon limited to the Roman Catholics?". Yes, it's true that there was a POV desire on the part of some Roman Catholics to say "No, it's not." And there was probably a POV desire on the part of some Protestants and Jews to say "Yes, it is". The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. It's not just a question of whether sexual abuse has occurred in non-Catholic religious organizations. The key problem that the Catholics had to grapple with was a willful organizational tolerance and cover-up of the sexual abuse across a major portion of the U.S. Catholic church.</dd>

<dd>The current article is much changed from the one that you nominated. However, it DOES treat "Sexual abuse by clergy" as a topic separate from "Sexual abuse by persons in positions of authority". I would like to hear your opinion on whether it would be encyclopedice to have an article such as the current revision under the title of "Sexual abuse by clergy" or "Sexual abuse in religious organizations". --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 17:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I added to the talk page for the article a bibliography of 19 appearances of the term I found in a search of the New York Times back to the 1990s and the Washington Post for the past few months. "Clergy abuse" appears to be a regularly used term to refer to sexual abuse of minors by clergy, so hardly OR, and quite notable. Editing should be used to correct anything POV.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crazy Russian</a>. Firstly, I take issue with the title, which is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. The article's creater has confused subject with object. It should, if anything be "Sexual abuse committed by members of the clergy". Secondly, I see the scope as being too narrow for an encyclopaedic entry: It is better grouped under the broader descriptive of "Sexual abuse committed by persons in positions of authority". Deletion is not to hide the fact that sexual abuse cases are not perpetrated by people of the cloth, but to remove a divergent thread of opinion and the singling out of clergy as sex offenders, as opposed to teachers and doctors, just to give some examples. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As we all know clergy abuse is a problem in all religions. All one needs to do is pick up any newspaper. It's vitally important for those who were abused by Priests, Nuns, Rabbis, Cantors, Monks, Pastors, etc. I think it's only those who try to cover up for those who offend who would want this catagory deleted from Wikpedia. For those of you who don't know, the term clergy abuse relates to not only sexual abuse, but also physical abuse, and other forms of manipulation for the gain of the individual doing the offending. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User_talk%7ENer_Israel_8e3c.html" title="User talk:Ner Israel">talk</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ner Israel (<a href="../../../n/e/r/User_talk%7ENer_Israel_8e3c.html" title="User talk:Ner Israel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ner_Israel_6b0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ner Israel">contribs</a>).</small>
