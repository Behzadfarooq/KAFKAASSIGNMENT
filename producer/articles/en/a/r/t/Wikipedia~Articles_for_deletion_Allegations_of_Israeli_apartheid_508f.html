<li><b>Keep</b> Seems well written and well sourced, referencing internationally renowned news sources.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although the article is well written and meticulously referenced, cited and sourced, I still think the article is inherently POV.

<li>Whilst you probably can find allegations of any position, this allegation seems to have come up a lot, and been made by many notable people and organisations (and more have either referred to or denied it).

<li><b>Delete</b> - allegations of Israel human rights violations do merit articles (though one can always wonder the paucity of such articles about other states and regimes who do much worse), but the term "apartheid" is a rhetorical device that distracts from the real issue. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 16:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If the current article seems to be infected with POV, the proper recourse is to <i>correct it</i>, not to remove the article.

<li>Under its original title it was defended as being an article about the political <i>term</i> "Israeli apartheid" but has always consisted of a set of arguments about whether Israeli apartheid exists.</li>
<li>Much of the article now consists of quotes from people who do not say Israel practices apartheid, but instead <i>compare</i> current practices to apartheid or say that Israel might some day practice apartheid.</li>
<li>Recently many facts have been added that sound scary in the context of this article, but does <i>anyone</i> consider them to be examples of apartheid? What is the 2005 Gaza withdrawal doing in this article?</li>

<dd>Furthermore, much as we have a well-meaning wish to help the reader understand whether there is validity to allegations of Israeli apartheid, it's not something that can really be covered in an encyclopedic fashion because the term "apartheid" in modern, colloquial discourse has no concrete operational criteria. (Yes, a definition of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_of_apartheid.html" title="Crime of apartheid">crime of apartheid</a> exists, but if we restricted the article to that definition it would practically disappear.) You can have a coherent, NPOV article about whether Israel practices <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>, because these are all well-defined terms. "Apartheid," as most of the sources used in this article use it, is a vague political insult. <a href="../../../s/u/-/User%7ESu-laine.yeo_5d6d.html" title="User:Su-laine.yeo">Su-Laine Yeo</a> 06:43, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Per 84.238.25.152's reasoning, I think it is silly for such allegations to have its own article. However, I think Szvest is correct that it belongs on Wikipedia.

<dd>If you talk about the term perse, yes you are correct. However, scholars do make comparisons between South Africa and Israel, and their conclusions are straightforward. On the title of the article, the current is POV, as it denies the scholary studies, but for the rest, I do not care abut the exact title, see my comment above. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimvdLinde_061a.html" title="User:KimvdLinde">Kim van der Linde</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimvdLinde_a7d1.html" title="User talk:KimvdLinde">at venus</a></sup> 06:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, let's look at those sources. They seem to level the "apartheid" charge not only at Israel's treatment of the population of the West Bank and Gaza, but at "Zionism" as a whole -- in other words, at the belief that there should be a State of Israel as a Jewish state. That being the case, the "merge" (if any) probably should be into <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a>. I know that that article has its own problems, but since it is already there, the fact that some people have chosen to use a word in another language ("apartheid") to refer to a related concept, does not merit a separate article with that word in the title. And I know the argument will be that the resulting article would be too long, but this article really does not need to be as long as it is anyway. We do not need to be citing every article in every little magazine, or every master's thesis, that refers to the issue. I think a lot of the sources are in there solely due to the controversy over the article's existence, to "make weight" for keeping it as a separate article. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 15:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I voted keep on the first one. The result on the second one was speedy keep. However, I would much appreciate any contact being via my talkpage. I believe in a transparent wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is heavily referenced... making the claims of 'original research' and 'unverifiability' seem nonsensical. NPOV is often a matter of perspective, but frankly irrelevant to a deletion debate. If it isn't neutral we change the wording, not delete it. See NO basis whatsoever for this deletion nom. It is a meme which passes notability. People will certainly be looking for information about it. The forced renaming was a silly abrogation of Wikipedia's naming conventions fueled by POV... this nom strays over from there into attempting to enshrine POV bias as a Wikipedia standard. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:51, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - definitely a notable POV, with 80,000 Google hits and numerous scholarly and academic sources referring to the concept. Article is also well referenced. No reason at all for deletion as far as I can see. Might possibly be an argument though for changing the title or broadening the subject matter, but that's another issue. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 12:31, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. POV is not grounds for deletion. POV is correctable through judicious editing and collaboration-- the hallmark of Wikipedia at its best. As to purported inaccuracy, the benchmark is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and not whether or not one agrees with the information presented. The article is large enough to stand on its own and would overly expand other articles. Does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. WP is <i>not a paper encyclopedia and can thus accommodate items that would not fit in one.</i> The article is about an (alleged) phenomenon and controversial subject that needs to be treated evenhandedly without censorship based on politics.

I note also that Haham hanuka has just recently been blocked for a week for another abuse of process on AfD and has a long history of blocks for 3RR and revert warring (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Haham_hanuka" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Haham_hanuka" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).

<li><b>keep</b> and improve. There is a very large published literature on this topic.

I suspect that there are enough scholarly, well referenced and peer-reviewed articles from professional historians and sociologists to provide an account of this topic. Maybe near the bottom of the article there could be one small paragraph for "Media coverage" and a very selective account of commentary from blogs, reporters and media pundits could be restricted to that paragraph. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 19:54, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
