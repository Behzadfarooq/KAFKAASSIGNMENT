<p>OK this is probably quite controversial, as this particular article has been nominated <b>10 times</b> before. But please, consider these points.</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject of the article has strongly objected to there being an article about him.</li>
<li>He is forced to check it every day for libel, slander etc.</li>
<li>He has now been banned for trying to get the article removed.</li>
<li>He has made an anti-Wikipedia website, and is a regular poster on the Wikipedia review. Probably both in response to this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, probably because of Wikipedia's popularity this article is first on a Google search. Please really consider your "vote", and don't "per" others here. I think this is a case where notability is irrelevant. I wish to end this silly battle once and for all with this, so the man can get on with his life. <i><b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Majorly</font></a></b></i> (<b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Talk</font></a></b>) 17:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Clearly notable. His objections are irrelevant to his notability. His checking for defamation every day is his choice.

<dd>Otto, just because something has not happened before doesn't mean it can never happen. --<i><b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Majorly</font></a></b></i> (<b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Talk</font></a></b>) 17:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you, I am aware of that. The reason why something has not happened before, however, may prove instructive in deciding whether allowing it to start should happen. You have no offered a compelling reason or really even a legitimate reason as to why Daniel Brandt should be allowed to dictate whether he has an article or not. He's notable. "Exceptional" case or not, he has an article and there is no reason why he shouldn't. If he doesn't like it, I'm sorry, but the proverbial genie is out of the metaphorical bottle and Mr Brandt doesn't get to stuff it back inside. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Incredibly strong keep</b> not just because of the notability of the subject, but because the nominator does not provide any reason for requesting deletion. There is no rationale along time lines of "non-notable" or "does not pass WP:BIO" or "unsourced and unverified"- the subject not wanting an aritcle or the subject being attacked frequently are not reasons to eliminate an article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, even if possible libelous comments are a problem (which, as far as possible deletion of the entire article is concerned, they are not), I'm sure there are (literally) dozens upon dozens of editors who have this article on their watchlists and check for updates regularly. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I already stated that this <i>should</i> be an exceptional case. Whether he is notable or not doesn't matter. The point is, he doesn't want an article, and since he plans to sue it is probably better it was deleted. --<i><b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Majorly</font></a></b></i> (<b><a href="../../../m/a/j/User_talk%7EMajorly_3c0f.html" title="User talk:Majorly"><font color="#002BB8">Talk</font></a></b>) 17:54, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. In English, that "If ..., ..." structure is often used for statements where the clause that immediately follows the if is not currently true.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 19:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that Irving was not a random choice; the statements we make on that article, like denoting him a racist, are not nice, even if they are well-sourced.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 19:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. None of the reasons cited are in the deletion policy, and an individual AfD is not the place to debate major policy changes.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Notable enough and the consensus is in favour. What I oppose is this afd, plenty of us check this article daily for libel etc not just Brandt, though dont know why he bothers as due to his own behaviour he is banned from editing. If George W. Bush wanted his article removing would we do that too. Brandt is internationally notable and far too important to consider having no article about him. 10 times is a mockery of our processes, as is the timing when many regular editors are on holiday and this page should be speedied, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Is it that time again, already? Let's see: he's still notable, and his desire to remove it still doesn't count. He has a right to demand that content be accurate and verifiable. He doesn't have the right to demand it be removed. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:10, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the subject of a biography does not determine if he belongs here or not. Libel issues need concrete examples. Diffs please? It's not like we just ignore if someone finds something libel. Also he is a known critic of Google and not just us. he is free to get on with his life, in fact I think both we and Google would appreciate that very much.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 19:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't agree with most of <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajorly_3081.html" title="User:Majorly">Majorly</a>'s arguments, which seem to play on our sympathy for Brandt. There's too little of that around here to go very far. Nor do I agree that Brandt is non-notable. He's made himself notable by his activities. I urge that this article be deleted simply because it is disruptive to the project. We don't need to have it, and it has directly and indirectly caused grief to many editors. Perhaps <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> can be invoked, or even <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. The end effect is that having this article does not, on the whole, help this project. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 19:20, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately, IMO, deleting this article would mean effectively allowing an outsider to dictate content, an absolutely unacceptable precedent. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:21, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>IMO, this is a horrible attitude! Wikipedia is a free and open project that anyone and everyone has a chance to add to or edit. There are NO 'outsiders'.
