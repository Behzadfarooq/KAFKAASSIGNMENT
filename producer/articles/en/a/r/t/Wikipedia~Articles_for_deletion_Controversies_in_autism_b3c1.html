<li><b>Weak keep</b>: While it's a poor quality article that seems to mix autism in medicine and autism in pop culture, the various autism articles need someone really knowledgeable to sort them out. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 08:21, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Delete</s> <b>. Merge the verifiable non-duplicated information in it into the existing articles dealing will with those aspects. Failing that, if it were rewritten shorter, tighter, and about the controversies, rather than another copy of the usual article as they all tend toward, it would be reasonably useful. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 10:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</b></li>

<dd><b>Comment: NO, <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> IS INCORRECT.</b> Articles certainly <b>can</b> be merged and deleted, preserving histories. The process is straightforward and described <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">here</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>keep</b>: There are numerous noteworthy controversies stemming from the <a href="../../../i/a/t/Iatrogenic.html" title="Iatrogenic">iatrogenic</a> epidemic of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> diagnoses. This AfD is unlike the usual offensive attempts to silence dissenting medical opinions, as it seems likely to be a protest to make a point, triggered by the odd decision to delete Neanderthal theory of autism. The real reason this article needs to be kept is that big pharma has as much as admitted its culpability for the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> by launching an expensive, preemptive lobbying and propaganda assault aimed at securing immunity from the industry's enormous <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injury</a> liabibilities (e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodefense_and_Pandemic_Vaccine_and_Drug_Development_Act_of_2005_583f.html" title="Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005">BioShield Two</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Readiness_and_Emergency_Preparedness_Act_7a2d.html" title="Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act">PREPA</a>). The assault also shows that the industry is unwilling to defend itself in the judicial system, which itself has been undermined to suit corporate special interests, rather than the mere carbon based life forms that courts were originally designed to serve. At least ten bills were in the works as of the end of last year to shield vaccine makers from any form of responsibility for these atrocities. Liabilities are projected by some observers far in excess of tens of billions of dollars. The controversies will only escalate as health care rationing decisions are made about the best/most cost effective treatments for this huge, emerging population. The controversies may be ignored deliberately by the mass media, as advocates like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy%2C_Jr._9dae.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.">Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.</a> have found out, but there is no doubt that the increasingly unstable and inefficient medical system will be put under considerably more stress in the near term. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are correct in that the deletion of the Neanderthal theory of autism sets a preference for me (and should for others too). However, in this case I'm not arguing only this point, but for the bad idea to have similar information at many locations. If you and <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> prefer to have the vaccine argument in this article that is fine with me, but then you will need to delete it from the other articles (like <a href="../../../c/a/u/Causes_of_autism.html" title="Causes of autism">Causes of autism</a>). --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 05:47, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing wrong with redundancy, per se; the purpose of this article is to summarize the various controversies in one place and then provide links to the in-depth article on each one. I always wanted this article to be succinct, providing readers with the means to study each matter more deeply, but with the right context. The term "controversies" is carefully chosen to avoid bias. Although I think the Neanderthal theory is specious, I think it should be kept and would have voted to keep it. I want all the controversies here. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 14:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The causes of autism themselves are all controvesial. However merging causes and controversies pages would make the article too long. I believe that all causes information should be kept with causes, with a link from controversies <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlister_Namarra_b221.html" title="User:Alister Namarra">Alister Namarra</a> 02:09, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, per Peter Grey. I believe it needs a more clinical approach, starting with individual assertations having direct citations, and not a blanket "references" for the whole article - as is it seems to serve to disguise the POV nature of the topic. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 22:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> It is very much needed, I often see links to it on autism sites. I have also made a note on the discussion page for the article. <a href="../../../a/m/y/User%7EAmyNelson_7429.html" title="User:AmyNelson">AmyNelson</a> 19:20, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
