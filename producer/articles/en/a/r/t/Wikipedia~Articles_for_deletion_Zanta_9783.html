<li><b>Keep.</b> article asserts notability, is carefully referenced and supported by reliable sources, and possesses a neutral point of view. The central argument in favour of deletion is that Zanta fails notability. Due to the nature of Zanta, he does not <b>neatly</b> fall into any of the categories in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. However <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not an exclusionary list, and Zanta should be considered an actor who has had numerous media appearances. The spirit of governance surrounding <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> should be extended to this man of predominantly local interest, although there is sufficient reason to suggest that interest in Zanta is more global than that with his appearance on a Showcase television series aired in the US and Canada, with his appearance in articles of newspapers with international distribution (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Toronto_Star_dfe6.html" title="The Toronto Star">The Toronto Star</a>). Since wiki is not paper, there's no reason to delete this article even if it were only of interest to residents and visitors to <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, which by the way is the largest city in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. <a href="../../../b/f/d/User_talk%7EBFD1_8921.html" title="User talk:BFD1"><font color="#0099FF">BFD1</font></a> 14:35, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

In addition, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a>, "Published works" is intentionally broad and includes published works in all forms.

Because we non-Canadians didn't hear about Zanta before doesn't make him less notable, it just means we didn't know about him. There is a cultural issue here as well, as odd as Zanta may be, since deleting Zanta would appear to be the removal of a Toronto Pop Icon from the Wikipedia, which means all other pop icons are suspect (such as <a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_Cowboy_dd1b.html" title="Naked Cowboy">Naked Cowboy</a>, who was only elevated in status to support publicity). Not everyone lives in the United States, and not everyone has the same influences. That said, having read the article I find it appears to be factual, and establishes notoriety to a fair degree. In this regard, he passes the grandchildren test: If you see him, you would probably tell your grandchildren (and they would probably look it up). While not something I see as a valuable resource, I see no harm in keeping it as a part of a large and rich world culture. However, if it is selected for deletion I do expect to see Naked Cowboy in queue for deletion with this entry's result as a precedent. If it's good for the goose, it's good for the Naked Gander. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 16:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Mind you, I've actually <i>seen</i> this raving lunatic with my own eyes. The article is factually correct. The fact it was deleted earlier is a disgrace to those of us with deletionist tendencies. Properly sourced, referenced and formatted articles should not be deleted, and the fact that this had to go to deletion review to save it is ... distressing.--<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 04:40, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
