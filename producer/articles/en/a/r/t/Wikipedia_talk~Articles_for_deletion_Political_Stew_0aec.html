<p>Although Burmaduck makes the claim that this is little more than self-promotion by the owner of the site the author of the entry does not own Political Stew any more than any other member. The author of the Wikipedia entry, who it is claimed is i_have_shiny_shoes (one of the two site administrators as per the entry itself) solely owns the domain name, does not own the site, and it has been their intention to move the ownership of the site to a non-profit company so no one person maintains overall control of the site. (Which would be a first for a privately operated forum)</p>
<p>Several persons contributing to the site are notable but their privacy must remain protected. One contributor is a journalist whose comments on the site are frequently in dispute with his own newspaper's editorial line, so no details can be disclosed of identities. Others include persons who have previously or currently work at the UN and major economic/political institutions, and whose opinions would be far more respectable in terms of politics due to the 'insider' nature of their jobs. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.15.71.151 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.71.151.html" title="User talk:82.15.71.151">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.71.151_97c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.71.151">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I'm not the same Burmaduck as the aformentioned one. Also, the people who are claimed to work at the UN or as journalists are certainly non-notable individuals. The reason I've suggested that this entry be deleted is because I don't want Wikipedia turning into a free for all forum for advertising whatever non-notable website someone starts. Wikipedia is a valuable resource but if we're not careful it's with the content that's allowed it'll all go downhill pretty soon. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurmaduck_17a0.html" title="User:Burmaduck">Burmaduck</a></p>

<p>User may also be a personal friend of the originally banned Burmaduck and who may hold a personal grudge against one of the site administrators. Burmaduck is not a site administrator or moderator at Political Stew so is not in a position to know what members do for a living. Burmaduck's argument suggesting users would be surprised what they know is poor and should be fleshed out before any contribution made can be given credit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.205.193.101 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.205.193.101_f690.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.205.193.101">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>A quick read of the board and nearly all of the statements by the author fall flat. It has failed to attract any new members in months, whilst it has haemorraged contributors for more than the past 6 months. A run down the name of the original members and more than 60% no longer contribute or have walked. The individuals left stay out of boredom and an inability to let go of something that back in the first few months was good. The posts are now stale, there is little to no new content and it serves only to fill a void in peoples lives who cannot find anything more constructive. This does not deserve to be up on wikipedia, the author as demonstrated here has taken to blowing his own trumpet when there is no substance. The whole entry is the creation of someone who has become somewhat obsessed with a dysfunctional forum and now ploughs 100s of hours in to trying in vain to drum up any publicity for it.</p>
<p>Leaving it up would be a great dis-service to your readers. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBashtard_081c.html" title="User:Bashtard">Bashtard</a> 09:29, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> User Bashtard is an ex-member and a personal friend of BurmaDuck. User BurmaDuck is most probably Kagyuster, who performed an act tantamount to incitement by mimicking another users handle on a different forum resulting in a denial of service attack on Political Stew.</dd>
</dl>
<p>User Bashtard neglects to mention that there have been plenty of new members on the forum and writes a comment seemingly more out of bitterness and spite rather than honest. Attacking an author for how they spend their time is poor behaviour and not something that should be taken into consideration and is rather beside the point. The point is whethe the entry meets the WEP guidelines. As it has been mentioned on boots'n'all, Lonely Planet and more sites beyond those and frequently, wholeheartedly suggest 'Keep'.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I have no connection with Burmaduck, but as an ex member of the board in question I am able to give a more impartial judgement.

<p>As for self-promotion, the idea is a little absurd as I (and by extension the other people involved in running the site) haven't promoted the site in any way, shape or form through commercial means, never mind free ones. With the package the site administrators (of which I am one) currently receive through their ISP that includes a certain level of advertising credit with Yahoo! and google adwords/adsense. This can be proven by searching through google and yahoo and seeing if there are any sponsored links.</p>
<p>I don't see why what I do within my private life should have any bearing on the decision you guys make, so Bashtard's comments are really beside the point and completely unnecessary, but I simply felt Wikipedia was an appropriate website in which the history, details and content of Political Stew could be found.</p>
<p>As Political Stew is hardly a common search item, for example googling the words 'Political Stew' returns approximately 75,700 results compared to 'Political Debate' which returns 125 million, a Wikipedia entry is not going to have any discernable effect on the search results. In other words, calling it promotion/advertising seems a little nonsensical and probably wouldn't increase the membership in any substantial capacity, or perhaps at all.</p>
<p>The site is non-profit, and has no commercial operation. It is entirely free to use and it is my desire and that of a few others to see the site moved into the hands on a non-profit company so no member has overall control of the site. As it stands, I solely own one of the few domain names to which the site is linked, where as actual site control itself (through Yahoo!) is administered by someone completely different. In other words, I don't own the site, which is a misleading impression given by some of the comments above. Site improvements, particularly aesthetic ones and those to increase the membership, are generally driven by the moderators, and are decisions in which I rarely play a part.</p>
<p>As above, if deletion is required then it is not a problem and will be completely accepted. I simply felt that what Political Stew is fell within the guidelines, and hence the entry. If not, then my apologies for taking up webspace and your time and I'll see if there is any way in which I can make an entry suitable for the WEP, which indeed there may not be.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Accusations like this should be backed up by substantiation to have any meaning. A newspaper once asked for contributions from our posters, and a small American regional newspaper at that, and for which we asked for an RSS feed to our site in return. Nothing came of it. As for any desire to turn it into a commercial operation, I did make the following comments, and once only, regarding the moderators and what sort of things they should be looking to do if they wanted to become one:</dd>
</dl>
<p>Setting up a non-profit company in which ownership of Political Stew will be vested, the directors of which will oversee the general functioning Political Stew and who will be made up of admins, moderators and members;</p>
<p>Potentially finding a non-commercial or commercial sponsors willing to pay for advertising on the site, the proceeds of which will solely be used to gain new membership, site development and donations to charity/good causes at the wishes of members.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that it will happen, as I don't make the decisions to do this - the word was 'potentially'.</p>
<p>It seems a little odd that Wikipedia should be the first step to getting new members, when as above, a Wikipedia entry is not going to have any particular effect on the increase in membership, and using a Wikipedia entry to find commercial sponsors is just a little silly. Any commercial investor worth their salt is likely to have a look at a proper business plan and what sort of returns they will get from their money. Simply having a Wikipedia entry does not make people invest. (And Wikipedia, additionally does not have a problem with commercial operations listing their websites).</p>
<p>The argument is purely whether the entry falls within the WEP. I believe it does. You guys may believe it doesn't. If it doesn't, then it'll be removed.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillipssolutions_2adb.html" title="User:Phillipssolutions">Phillipssolutions</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhillipssolutions_bed1.html" title="User talk:Phillipssolutions">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Phillipssolutions_b6f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Phillipssolutions">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did make that comment, and don't deny it. Eventually, and the most important word here is eventually, a Wikipedia entry is likely to increase the membership of a site, for example like the Gaia and Protest Warrior forums which are huge. However, given the very nature of the words 'Political Stew' and their limited usage in the English lexicon, as it stands this Wikipedia entry is not going to increase the membership in any way. If I had wanted to advertise it to the members, and anyone else, I would have posted the link on the website, as well as sending it to other websites, none of which I have done, and it was found entirely independently by another member.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> " I have no connection with Burmaduck, but as an ex member of the board in question I am able to give a more impartial judgement." said bashtard</p>
<p>For bashtard aka bashtc to say he is an impartial observer really takes the biscuit. Bashtc is a long time personal friend and devotee of the banned Political Stew poster BurmaDuck (just one of numerous usernames) who contributors to Political Stew and the Lonely Planet forums know as a travel writer of little regard who failed to win a plagiarism case against Lonely Planet some years ago. For the past 5 years BurmaDuck (in his many guises) has spammed Lonely Planet. He migrated to the newly setup Political Stew forum and true to form was banned. He was allowed back in and despite many people bending over backwards to accomodate him returned the favor by spamming and abusing the forum and certain ex-moderators on a massive scale when he was banned again. Bashtc has been banned from Lonely Planet and from the Political Stew forum also.</p>
<p>Whatever decision is made about keeping or not keeping this Wikipedia entry it should be noted that any comments from BurmaDuck or Bashtard are made by banned Political Stew posters with an extremely large axe to grind. If this is not the same BurmaDuck banned from Political Stew then using the name of a serial spammer despised by many on Political Stew and other forums would seem to be an odd choice of name for " a current and long time PS user" with " no axe to grind against PS." --Twistingo 15:59, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> IHSS has finally lost it. Finished with lying through his teeth he will now go back to the personal feuding that is so characteristic of his site. Wikipedia people take note.

It is hardly a great inclusion on this otherwise good quality and good natured site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBashtard_081c.html" title="User:Bashtard">Bashtard</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBashtard_e4a0.html" title="User talk:Bashtard">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bashtard_0218.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bashtard">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Comment</b> The site history will give a clear record of which comments have been made by the above author though and as poster of the main article it guarantees that this site will get no end of arguments and feuding of this nature. Honestly the article is no great inclusion and is best for all parties if it is removed before resulting in the infighting from the website in question spilling over here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBashtard_081c.html" title="User:Bashtard">Bashtard</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBashtard_e4a0.html" title="User talk:Bashtard">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bashtard_0218.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bashtard">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The site history does confirm that I'm not the author of the comment which attacked you/Burmaduck. If Wikipedia make a decision to keep the entry based on the WEP, then it should not be a problem in the future. As stated by myself, I believe that it falls within the WEP. Why this would lead to infighting after a decision is made, I have no idea. ----phillipssolutions----</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> How does it meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria? Has the content on PS been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of PS itself? Nope. Has PS won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation? Nope. Has the PS content been distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster. Hell no.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I am not that Burmaduck. If I was, would I really be using the proper means to lodge my displeasure at the use of Wikipedia as place to advertise non-notable forums. Also, would I have taken the time and effort to make a request for mediation between Bashtard and IHSS regarding the former's vandalism of the PS Wikipedia entry. Or indeed would I have taken time to revert Bashtard's vandalism efforts. I suggest that, rather than villify me, you stick to the matter at hand. Please provide supporting evidence that PS meets the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurmaduck_17a0.html" title="User:Burmaduck">Burmaduck</a> 13:02, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Why hide behind the name of someone banned by the mods and who is loathed by many? If you're a current member you should hae the balls to say who you are, it isn't like the mods can justify a banning. At this time it does look like you're being petty and if you do say who you are you'll get more respect as a result. It was not a good name to choose and you know that, and you only started this after the post was made on the forum, which makes it look petty, not because it's for the good of wikipedia. It's just cowardly and no-one should take you seriously. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.205.204.70 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.205.204.70_619f.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.205.204.70">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm not a PS member, but wondering about your proper motivations for this. I post at LP. You pretended to state above how much you know about the members, and while you may be right, using that handle is the act of a coward and you'd be far better to explain yourself otherwise you're going to be seen as untrustworthy. Through scanning the forums and your use of language, it's pretty fair to say that you're likely to be btraven or jelly belly. Either way, it's still cowardly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.205.223.168 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.205.223.168_26e1.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.205.223.168">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I have requested a speedy deletion of the post owing to the vandalism of the page last night, and the continuing argument between the anonymous poster and yourself, Burmaduck. Although I disagree with you over the meeting of the criteria, it is very obvious to both of us that the page is likely to continue to suffer from vandalism. I appreciate what you did yesterday in trying to curtail it. I requested deletion yesterday, but it doesn't mean that want the page to stay defaced while it happens, and the help was most welcome.</dd>

<p>I have no concern over whichever poster you are at the Stew. You have your reasons for doing so and, while I may beg to differ over whether they are valid, I don't believe you're doing it for any other reason than your belief on how Wikipedia should be run. You more than proved that by the number of reverts you made yesterday. I'm sorry if others can't see it that way. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillipssolutions_2adb.html" title="User:Phillipssolutions">Phillipssolutions</a> 15:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
