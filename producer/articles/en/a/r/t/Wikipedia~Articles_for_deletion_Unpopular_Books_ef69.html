<p>The result was <b>no consensus.</b> Specific and reasonable arguments for notability have got to prevail over those who claim a topic is non-notable. Verifiability is also raised as an issue, but the claims in the article are very basic, and do appear to be easily verifiable (although not sourced), and arguments are given that the information can be verified. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:02, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article states that this is a <i>"largely fictitious organisation"</i> and that it is <i>"best understood in the context of situationist praxis"</i>. I think a spate of AfD nominations may be in order. --<a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> 06:02, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The connection with the LPA is also notable as this organisation's texts inspired authors such as <a href="../../../i/a/i/Iain_Sinclair_910a.html" title="Iain Sinclair">Iain Sinclair</a> who have used psychogeography in their work. The official website <i>does not</i> include a list of their publications and I have added to and amended the list on the page concerned by referring to books that I own.

<li><b>Delete and investigate</b>. While the fact that Unpopular Books printed <i>Decadence of the Shamans: Or Shamanism as a Key to the Secrets of Communism</i> may be poetically apt, this seems to be a non-notable publisher dedicated to some minor and unintelligible ideology. I'm not sure that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies here, since this seems to be some kind of marginal movement in art or politics rather than a business. If the business guidelines were applied it falls well short of meeting them, but like all guidelines, they only define what is <i>per se</i> notable. What concerns me is that Mikka's articles seem to be a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> No assertion of notability (for the publisher) and per walled garden argument (for the rest) &lt;-- I know it not a deletion criterion but let's <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and make a reasonable judgment here. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 14:34, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>AFAIK there are no specific notability criteria beyond the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">most basic ones</a> for political or artistic movements. Most of the articles on Mikka's list seem to revolve around some sort of vague melange of Marxism and Dadaism, which makes me wondered whether these articles, any one of which might seem an eccentric performance, might be merged into some umbrella article about this particular tendency. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:46, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If there are no specific criteria, then this discussion becomes a bit nebulous. I am happy to revise the article on the basis that Unpopular Books is notable for the works it has published rather than for being a publishing company.

<p><b>A POV summary of the reasons for deletion</b></p>
<p>1) That the publisher is <b>unverifiable</b>. It is easily verifiable that Unpopular Books has published a number of works. At least two contributors to this page own a number of them. As I have stated above, I feel that the texts they have published, and their authors, make them notable.</p>
<p>2) <b>Walled Garden</b>. Because Unpopular Books is in some way linked to other projects such as the LPA, etc, it forms part of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a>. I would dispute this. It is clear that authors published by Unpopular Books such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Home_1868.html" title="Stewart Home">Stewart Home</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Barrot_1712.html" title="Jean Barrot">Jean Barrot</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asger_Jorn_d263.html" title="Asger Jorn">Asger Jorn</a> as well as the collected works of the <a href="../../../u/p/_/Up_Against_the_Wall_Motherfuckers_9339.html" title="Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers">Black Mask Group</a> have a wide appeal. They are, individually, relatively obscure, but to my mind clearly notable within their respective fields. If people feel that pages on the Neoist Alliance, or LPA, or AAA or NLI should be deleted then I would think that individual calls for deletion should be done on those pages and not here. I note that nobody is proposing that <a href="../../../a/s/g/Asger_Jorn_d263.html" title="Asger Jorn">Asger Jorn</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Home_1868.html" title="Stewart Home">Stewart Home</a> be deleted from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>3) "An under-construction text based official <b>website</b> <a href="http://unpopular.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://unpopular.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>". The page is about Unpopular Books and the works they have published, it is not a page about their website. Indeed it seems unlikely that "it wants to disprove its title using wikipedia as promo vehicle" if its own site is so minimal.</p>
<p>4) "dubious <b>ghits</b> (admittedly a very crude test in this case)". Indeed. As I have pointed out above, googling the authors or titles and Unpopular Books does give a reasonable number of hits for a project of this type (i.e. marginal, but still notable)</p>
<p>5) "Not a hope of passing <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>." Again, as stated above, Unpopular Books is not notable because it is a huge multinational corporation with offices all over the world. It is notable because of the works and authors it has published.</p>
<p>6) "No assertion of <b>notability</b> (for the publisher)". As I have said above: "I am happy to revise the article on the basis that Unpopular Books is notable for the works it has published rather than for being a publishing company." I am unclear if I am entitled to do this whilst the deletion debate is ongoing.</p>
<p>I would invoke most of the reasons for not deleting covered <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_Arguments_e228.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments">here</a>. I.e. wikipedia is not paper, there is a lack of objective criteria, etc.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if people could respond to these points rather than simply saying "delete" etc - it will add to my understanding of wikipedia if nothing else.</p>
<p>Finally, it seems that the creators of this article have not been informed, could the person who initiated the call for deletion do that? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Eden_ae98.html" title="User:John Eden">John Eden</a> 14:49, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
