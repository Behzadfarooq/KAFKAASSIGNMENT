<ul>
<li>I think the real problem here is a failure to remember what, exactly, an encyclopedia is. An encyclopedia is a general reference work that highlights and synthesizes important people, places, things, and ideas. It is derived almost exclusively from secondary sources and provides an overview of the critical objects either in all fields of study, as in Britannica or Wikipedia, or in a specific area, such as the Encyclopedia of Military History. Inherent in an encyclopedia's mission to highlight and syntesize is the necessity of making distinctions between what is important and what is not, i.e. notability, which will always be a subjective decision, but one that every encyclopedia editor is called upon to make (in this case, the editors would be the entire wikipedia community). Now, there are many that say that wikipedia is not paper when they justify keeping trivial information, but this should not make wikipedia a junkyard. It is true that wikipedia can include far more information than a typical encyclopedia can, but I see this more as allowing us to go from the level of notable to the whole of human history, which is what Britannica focuses on, to the level of notable in every little sub-field of human exploration. Thus, we can have notable schools, hospitals, sports figures, congressmen, MPs, churches, authors, etc. that would be left out of Britannica for space reasons. If every hospital were to be included, however, then the entire point of an encyclopedia would be lost, for it would no longer be highlighting. An encyclopedia article needs to place its subject in proper context, and that is impossible when there is little distinction made between the subject and similar institutions. There is a reason that the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> page states that this is not a general database or a yellow pages: an encyclopedia highlights and synthesizes. If wikipedia were meant to include everything, there would not be a wiktionary or a wikisource, or a wikibooks, or any other wikiproject save this one. If wikipedia becomes a source for trivial information that is hard to keep up to date, verifiable, and accurate, or continues to have longer articles on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate then on Kaiser <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_I_of_Germany_8df0.html" title="Wilhelm I of Germany">Wilhelm I</a>, the scholarly community will never take it seriously and no one will use it as a reference for research. Thus, wikipedia would be a monumental failure. This is a thought that should cause stress for everybody on the project. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:00, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are indeed correct. The real problem here is a failure to remember what, exactly, an encyclopedia is. Encyclopedias were conceived and intended as organized compendia of <b>ALL</b> knowledge - not just "select" knowledge or so-called "notable" knowledge (whatever <i>that</i> is supposed to mean). Nothing has changed in the past several thousand years, other than the technological capacity to make real the actual intention of the early encyclopedists. Those who promote the notion that "some knowledge is more important than other knowledge" would do well to remember that "importance" is a largely subjective matter (as the above Star Wars vs Kaiser Wilhelm II example shows), and that it is right and proper that an evolving project such as Wikipedia reflect the concerns, interests and obsessions of those who create it and the times in which they live, rather than presenting itself as the informational equivalent of a constipated Victorian maiden aunt. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:06, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It resulted from the merger of the Framingham Union Hospital and a smaller hospital in Natick, which is the next town. It is run by a for-profit hospital corporation. In fact, there are news reports that it is up for sale, apparently because it isn't profitable enough. I'm not sure that it is a teaching hospital. On the direct route through the western Boston suburbs to Worcester, it probably is in fact the biggest hospital. People in my family have been there a few times, and, you know, it's just a typical suburban medium-to-large-sized hospital. But there are dozens of hospitals in the Boston area, of similar size or larger, several of which are world-famous. This is far from being one of the famous ones. It isn't a Mass General or Lahey Clinic.--<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:36, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just happened to find this amidst the shockingly massive amount of work to which this page attests, and my only input in light of how little work i do here, is KEEP because, curps, someone does have the right to hope someone does want to do the plot synopsis, and i happen to be one. I hope the massive amount of work you all do does not tend to push you to delete the work of others when it is actually work. An encyclopedia is everything, in the sense that I think that's what the word means, and I have to keep reading to see how uniform you are in your assessments, but I must point out that to someone who has experienced cartoons for 36 years, even the most minor Ren and Stimpy character is more major than ... well in the interest of encyclopedism, the output a search with a popular file sharing program produced just now (happened to be searching for ren and stimpy, coincidentally, I think), were 3 banned cartoons, all characters owned by AOL. If the other important areas of editorial work here can possibly relate HERE, i think it is in relative freedom for non-evil people to have a forum here for their interests.</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. So here is your formula for high school notability, boys: establish that it has a big football stadium and a popular football team. The article says 20,000 kids have graduated from the place in 80 years. That is about 250 per year. But it has a 9000-seat football stadium. It seems they have their priorities a bit twisted. How would you like to have graduated from "The Pit", a notable high school football stadium?

<ul>
<li>I agree with you, their priorities seem a bit twisted to me as well. But we list professional sports teams that get less than 9000 fans, and people don't have to go and watch sports (to me, the average school is where the set curriculum is taught, which is why I'm only occasionally convinced that a school article stands on its own rather than as part of the local school board or geographical article). So, yes, this establishment is of more note to me as a sporting venue than a school. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:19, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even if we accept that these are real studies, I still believe that no student there is forced to learn football squads.

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>.</p>
<p>I count 29 clear delete votes, 10 clear keep votes (4 of which are discounted as extremely new users who may be sockpuppets), 1 clear keep-as-redirect vote and 3 abstain or ambiguous votes. Note that even if the ambiguous votes are considered as keeps and even if the new users are counted, the vote still reaches a concensus to delete.</p>
<p>Note 2: Based on the general tenor of the comments, the community concensus is that there is not sufficient notability for this slogan to be discussed <i>in a separate article</i>.

<blockquote>

<p>The slogan "the foreskin is not a birth defect" asserts the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_integrity.html" title="Genital integrity">genital integrity</a> position that male genitals of a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_being.html" title="Human being">human being</a> are designed properly and do not usually require <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_modification_and_mutilation.html" title="Genital modification and mutilation">genital modification and mutilation</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_circumcision.html" title="Male circumcision">male circumcision</a> of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreskin.html" title="Foreskin">foreskin</a> of a newborn.</p>
<p>The slogan casts the debate of infant circumcision in terms of personal rights of the man and the rights of him to retain his healthy, living tissues. It implies that the decision about whether to undergo plastic surgery or amputations should be made by the man involved, and should be protected by the United States Constitution under rights to life, liberty, and property, and under the principle of <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Protection_ad51.html" title="Equal Protection">Equal Protection</a>.</p>
<p>The chief argument against this position, as asserted by <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision_advocacy.html" title="Circumcision advocacy">circumcision advocates</a>, maintains that the choice may be made by doctors or parents to perform genital alterations they might desire or consider healthy. Moreover, for those who consider foreskin to be a birth defect, all reasonable effort ought to be made to sever the organ to make the child match his father.</p>

<li>Calm down, please. I don't need extra emphasis to see your point. I don't know why you're talking about disagreeing with the slogan, because that had nothing to do with my point. I don't really care about the slogan. I voted delete because I don't believe slogans should be separate articles; that's why I said to merge. (Perhaps you missed that, it's an understandable mistake.) I do care about the fact that your delete rationale was illogical. However, considering that you've re-voted, this point and this argument are moot. It would be pointless to continue, so let's just end this now. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPremeditated_Chaos_675b.html" title="User:Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF00FF">P</font></a><a href="../../../p/r/e/User_talk%7EPremeditated_Chaos_7524.html" title="User talk:Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF33FF">M</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF66FF">C</font></a> 19:06, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm calm. I just like using extra emphasis =) Talking about disagreeing with the slogan was on a completely unrelated train of thought, sorry I should have been more clear.

I just wish that the circumcision-advocates would stop advocating universal circumcision of all of the babies.

<li>Dan, non-notability is a very common reason to list an article on VfD (see 90% of the articles listed). Notability is often provided by Google hits, unless it can be shown to be notable otherwise. As for the existance of other, less notable slogans, unless they've previously been listen on VfD and have been kept (i.e. unless there is precedent), it really isn't an argument. I personally would be for merging this and others to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_slogans.html" title="List of political slogans">List of political slogans</a>, i.e. with short explanations under each, but the others would have to be brought here and argued case-by-case. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 23:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Asbestos, I like your idea.

There just no space in Wikipedia, right? But actually, for this slogan, non-notability is not the absolute strongest argument, given that bumper stickers and T-shirts have been available. But if we want to set precedent here, what the heck? Anything under 940 hits should go then, right? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 00:10, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You should feel free to list those articles here. But there are no hard cut-off lines for Google hits. 1) Different standards of notability are used for atomic physicists than contemporary political slogans. 2) If you can cite other evidence, such as sales numbers of the bumper stickers, then that would be evidence for notability. 3) As there appear to be less than about 50 real hits from Google, this one really some other evidence of notability, because nobody's seeing any on the web. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 11:23, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Few slogans are notable enough for that kind of treatment and most of them merit no more than a sentence or two in the relevant articles about the political issue or movement.

<li>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">VfD ettiquette</a>: <i>Votes by suspected sock puppets or votes which do not seem to reflect the opinion of Wikipedians may be ignored. In particular, votes from anonymous persons and accounts that did not exist prior to a nomination are typically ignored on strong suspicions of sock puppeteering or being cast by biased outsiders unfamiliar with our policies. If you are the primary author or otherwise have a vested interest in the article, say so openly, clearly base your vote on the deletion policy, and vote only once, like everyone else.</i> My reading of that is that primary authors and those with a vested interest <b>must</b> be special cases, otherwise why the need to declare it? - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 22:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know the policy and suggested changing it before. The problem is that that admins only <i>typically</i> ignore new voters. This leads to both sides asking for friends to help <i>(robert Brookes came here from a call from circumcision-advocates and I had to make a reciprical call to intactivists).</i> I and I hope the other side are not proud of that. I would like the policy absolute. I hope that the policy will be applied here. But this is not about that.</li>
<li>I do not like being singled out. I anm sure that you probably feel the same way. When it comes to counting, policy only really supports separating potential sokpuppets. The summary should read thus:</li>

<p>I propose that, upon deletion of this article, a new precendent be entered into the record. Apparently, the angry rhetoric from the 'delete' side of this debate deems it important enough to vote on personal whim (some are saying notability is contested, but apparently there is plenty of recognition of the slogan too). Leaving policy justification out of the equation is simply anti-Wikipedia. Therefore, because the attack on this article is unprecedented, I propose adding to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> the following entry:</p>
<p><i><b>Are articles on slogans with fewer than 1000 Google hits permissible? - No, slogans need at least 1000 Google hits</b></i></p>
<p>If this precedent existed beforehand, we wouldn't have needed this vote because deletion would be justified. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 14:39, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You must have a different definition than I, or maybe just picked the wrong Latin word. While I am sorry for upsetting you, we can respect each other and be critical of the arguments at the same time. Criticising words is not the same as criticising a person. I have linked to a documented precedent, and asked for yours. Let me get this straight: you claim deletion is right because the precedent is that 90% of articles are deleted on a basis of unspecified precedent, and this article is one of those, therefore it is one of those. Correct me if I read you wrong, but does that sound like non-circular reasoning to you? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 18:57, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not upset, and that accusation again is <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominum.html" title="Ad hominum">ad hominum</a>. Rather than trying to characterize the statements of others as emotional states (e.g. "angry", "upset"), or making suppositions about their reasons for voting (e.g. "voting on a whim"), or using pejoratives to describe them (e.g. "pro-mutilation"), or using pejoratives to describe their comments (e.g. "trolling"), please deal with the content of their statements. You have linked to no "precedent", as each article is evaluated on its own merits. There is no standard rule about slogans, nor is there a standard creteria for their deletion. However, there are other standards that are frequently invoked and used for deletion in general; non-notability is a primary one. Also, please note that invoking a <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_wrongs_make_a_right_%28fallacy%29.html" title="Two wrongs make a right (fallacy)">two wrongs make a right</a> argument is a logical fallacy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:12, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That you were upset was only my opinion. I am sorry if I incorrectly assumed that -- it's not an insult. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">Precedent</a> is inherently based on the assumption that the past can be interpreted in the present. It is "two wrongs" or "two rights", not random behavior. Your reason for deletion was "POV, stated elsewhere, almost no Google hits". So in your words, 940 is "almost" zero, I have "indifference to the outcome", new users are "distressing", and some users are "apologists". Other than (maybe) the last sarcastic term of yours, I am perfectly aware that even these are not truly <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominum.html" title="Ad hominum">ad hominum</a>. They do not attack the person, and neither did I, so I find your accusation unsubstantiated. But you should direct this to my user talk page, instead of here. In any case, the section <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> specifically permits slogans. No other deletion-supportive policy or precedent has been stated except notability, so that is why I'm proposing we set precedent at 1000 Google hits. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 19:55, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I described no editors as "distressing" <s>or "apologists". I have not even used the word "apologist"</s>, and I described a "delete" editor as an "apologist" in jest, obviously. Please read my comments more carefully. Regarding your "almost 940 hits", as you know already, that is actually fewer than 50 unique hits. That is not notable in my opinion, and in the opinion of many other voters here and elsewhere. Google searches are often used as a means of ascertaining notability on VfDs and elsewhere. Policy creep is a bad idea, but if I were proposing one, it would be more on the lines of "any VfD'd article that gets the support of more than 5 editors who make their first edit on the VfD should be automatically deleted." <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:23, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't recall only counting TOTAL hits at all; in fact, the Google results are often examined for source and uniqueness, and particularly whether or not they reflect independent sources, or merely Wikipedia and its many mirrors. As for your other arguments, please read my previous comments; it's not about those articles. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:46, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Google doesn't even display the number you want to substitute. I never proposed a change to hit-counting in Wikipedia, did you? The existing precedents all use the total, not your method. The only arguments you've made are for 1) deletion without need for giving rationale, and 2) adding a precedent to count new users instead of Google-hits (call it a meta-precedent). Either way, neither of your arguments would ever inform Wikipedia users what is considered notable for a given article. Many precedents do precisely that, saving us all a great deal of frustration knowing the articles won't get trashed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 22:37, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? What number do I want to "substitute"? Nor have I made any arguments for a new precedents or methods. The slogan is non-notable, amongst other things, because it gets very few unique Google hits.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. No one argued that this article be kept as is. 5 voted for clear delete. 2 voted to redirect. 2 voted merge but there is nothing <i>to</i> merge - which means that the usual argument about "redirect to preserve attribution" doesn't really apply. I am going to exercise my discretion on this one. <b>Delete</b> to clean out the article history then <b>redirect</b> to discourage the recreation of the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:42, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are two sub-stubs about neologisms. Both were marked for speedy deletion, but I spotted an objection on the talk page of Phun (copied below) so I thought a VfD would be more apropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 18:08, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>from Talk:Phun</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been using the words "phun" and "nooph" for a few months now, as have many others, to describe the action taken when opening or closing a laptop computer. As the laptop is a relatively recent invention/popularization, words for these two actions have only recently been added to the English vocabulary. I did not make this article, but I support keeping it so as to perpetuate the English language. I have a staunch belief that words are always good, and that the so-called "newspeak" philosophy described in George Orwell's 1984, by which the English language is constantly consolidated into less and less words, is indicative of the de-education of our society.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For those that argue that no word is necessary and that these two words are just the invention of some attention-seeking kid, I suggest you read the book Friendle.<br /></dd>
