<p>The result of the debate was Delete. I spent a fair amount of time looking this over, the raw numbers are 19 delete votes to 4 keeps, so starting at that level there seems to be a pretty good delete consensus. <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">G4DGET</a> put together a very detailed case for keeping the article which from the looks of it generated a lot of discussion. From my experience when someone presents solid data that supports a keep decision after a AFD is underway it really shows in the votes cast afterwards. In this case most of the votes cast after the case was made were delete votes. The main disagreement was <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> and it doesn't look like the case <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">G4DGET</a> made convinced enough folks.

<p><i>(NB. The original post of what follows, authored by <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">User:G4DGET</a>, was an extensive commentary stating the reasons she believes the article deserves a place in WP. Owing to its great length, there was some difficulty reading the page. Furthermore, as lengthy, essay-like commentaries are not usually ideal for AfD project pages, I have refactored the comment with an eye to preserving its main arguments yet shortening its length. The original may be found on this AfD's Talk page.

<p>The Requirements Sin Star, Mind Pollution, and Davien Crow meet are listed in the following sections. I have highlighted the guidelines Wikipedia has set and my argument as to why all 3 articles should be kept. If anything as i've said perhaps Mind Pollution should be deleted or be merged under Sin Star and Davien Crow should be kept because of his accomplishments seperate to the band. This is as I said in relevance to Sin Star, Mind Pollution, and Davien Crow articles and their redirects.</p>

<li><b>Being on at least one international or national tour.</b> They have been on 2 which are easily identified in the intangible Internet Archives at <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" class="external text" title="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" rel="nofollow">Wayback Machine</a> for several sources, claims, and sites that have had information on them. Mainly the official ones.</li>
<li><b>Having 2 Albums (does not specify full length or ep) released on a record label.</b> They have been released on Mushroomcloud Records, Kid Atrium Music, Red Pill Music (self owned), and Independantly. Mind Pollution had to remove their materials with the exception of what was released by Mushroomcloud Records from the market in all forms because of legal trouble noted in several sources.</li>
<li>I also realize <i>Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.

<p>I Think I have pointed out enough in fact. <b>FAIR IS FAIR, IT MEETS YOUR RULES &amp; GUIDELINES</b> and hopefully you will reconsider the biased delete nominations that have been made because of the voters never reviewing the information beyond what the person who first nominated said (which included false information I may add, perhaps to try to get it deleted faster) or only did so at a galance. If Anything you should leave Davien Crow and then Merge Mind Pollution under Sin Star since they are after all the same band. Another solution would be to merge all 3 and another would be to only keep Sin Star &amp; Davien Crow. Davien however has accomplishments outside of his band that are notable. <a href="../../../g/4/d/User%7EG4DGET_f4cd.html" title="User:G4DGET">G4DGET</a> 22:01, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li>Ooops, I didn't mean to imply that the content was neccessarily all that similiar.

<li><b>Comment</b> only for now: Halo guitars make custom guitars and push them. As for "endorsement", the Halo web site does not have a listing under <i>either</i> <u>Mind Pollution</u> <i>or</i> <u>Sin Star</u> <i>or</i> <u>Davien Crow</u> on their artists page. Lack of inclusion makes me doubt the claim that Mr. Crow is being endorsed or that Halo might be making a signature guitar unless it is just a custom order.

<li>A detailed argument deserves a detailed response. It seems that all but one of the points given don't establish notability. No one has noted a specific actual national tour they were on (their own tour, not a one or two-time guest). The music guidelines require release by a major label or major indie label, meaning one "with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable". Publishing on poetry.com also is not notable; the idea is that someone's own entire work, more than a small amount of poetry, is published. Having things on the web, whether personal or business sites, reviews, blogs, forum posts, etc. are not notable unless read by many tens of thousands of people. Anyone could join BMI, and lots of non-notable garage bands are listed on sites and forums on the same page as other names. So the notability question comes down to one point, his cult following: if it exists, Davien Crow and his band are notable. If there is a small or no cult following, they are not notable.</li>
<li>Upon examination, it seems that there is not a significant cult following. Davien Crow gets 0 mentions on a xanga search, and the same for "sin star"; one blog ring for sin star has only 4 members. Sin Star has 849 MySpace friends, compared to a random 18-year-old with 769. No actual cult following here. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/d/e/User%7EDDerby_76ea.html" title="User:DDerby">DDerby</a><a href="../../../d/d/e/User_talk%7EDDerby_b92b.html" title="User talk:DDerby"><small>(talk)</small></a> 06:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree with the assessment by <a href="../../../d/d/e/User%7EDDerby_76ea.html" title="User:DDerby">DDerby</a> that most of the facts given to establish notability aren't very relevant. To me it comes down to one thing: the band. If this guy is notable is any way, it's as a musician, right? As far as I've been able to see, certain things are lacking: There's no mention in allmusic. There's no indication of an actual national tour. There are no records on a major label or an important small label. Having rubbed elbows with more famous people doesn't automatically make one famous by extension. It's unfortunate that things got heated and that the band supporters took this Afd personally. Please understand, this is not a judgement that the subject of the article is bad or untalented. This is simply about whether this subject belongs in an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Many, many bands that are real, have played lived, and have made recordings have been deleted before. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:31, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
