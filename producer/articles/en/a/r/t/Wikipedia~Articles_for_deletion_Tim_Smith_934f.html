<p>Losing minor party candidate in last November's Congressional election - and no edits since last November. Not notable. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 14:33, 2005 Jun 22 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Losing minor party candidates (and, indeed, major party candidates when they have no chance whatsoever) are not as a rule notable. Articles on the parties are fine, but unless they are a recognisable figure in there own right (e.g. the late Screaming Lord Sutch in the UK) then nothing can really be worth saying about them other than their percentage of the vote, and that is most usefully achieved in an article on the election rather than the candidate. This Tim Smith has certainly had less influence politically than, say, the former Conservative party MP for Beaconsfield in the UK of the same name. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 15:08, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Failing that, <i>merge/redirect</i> to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives%2C_Washington_District_7_36ce.html" title="United States House of Representatives, Washington District 7">United States House of Representatives, Washington District 7</a> once created.

<ul>
<li>Even if we should have an article on the district (which I agree we should), I disagree with incorporating information about <a href="../../../g/a/d/Gadfly_%28social%29.html" title="Gadfly (social)">gadfly</a> candidates. The <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/WA.phtml" class="external text" title="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/WA.phtml" rel="nofollow">Green Papers</a> (which is very conscientous about listing third party candidates) does not even show this guy's name, meaning he probably never even made it on the ballot. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 22:13, 2005 Jun 22 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hold the phone. I just checked the WA Secretary of State's site (<a href="http://vote.wa.gov" class="external text" title="http://vote.wa.gov" rel="nofollow">here</a>) to double check that, and their site (like the Green Papers) lists only McDermott and Cassidy. It appears that Smith was not on the ballot; therefore, I am changing my vote to <b>Delete</b>. Please note that my comments in support of keeping all candidates that <b>are</b> on ballots for federal elective office still stand; I just now know that Smith is not one of them. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Moore_%28politician%29_d8e1.html" title="Charles Moore (politician)">Charles Moore</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Guthrie_fa8e.html" title="Bruce Guthrie">Bruce Guthrie</a>, Spencer Garrett, and Robert Losey should have articles. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 03:23, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This discussion has been had before. It is trivially easy to get onto ballots in many countries. (In several, it's merely a matter of a monetary deposit and a certain number of people's signatures.) A general principle of allowing biographical articles for people whose sole claim to notability is that they managed to have themselves listed on ballots is an unwise one. <i>Actually winning the election</i>, on the other hand, is a different matter. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:33, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suggest that a losing candidate is notable by their candidacy alone (as opposed to some wacky thing they said or did) <i>if</i> the number of votes they received has some legal significance (in many districts, a minor-party candidate who gets more than 5% of the vote assures their party an automatic slot on the ballot for the next cycle), <i>or</i> if their presence on the ballot actually influences the outcome of the election (in the sense of <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Nader_6df8.html" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>). --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:50, 2005 Jun 23 (UTC)</li>
<li>And I still disagree that including federal candidates regardless of ease of candidacy is an unwise principle. For example, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Guthrie_fa8e.html" title="Bruce Guthrie">Bruce Guthrie</a> in WA-2 received 2.5% of the vote in a U.S. House of Representatives election. That's not a huge percentage (and less than the 5% referenced by BD2412 above), but it still means that nearly 8,000 people voted him. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Moore_%28politician%29_d8e1.html" title="Charles Moore (politician)">Charles Moore</a> in WA-1 had 1.75% of the vote, which means almost 6,000 people voted for him. I'm fine with merging them into district articles if really necessary, but we've kept article that I feel have far less notability than federal political candidates. However, I do realize that consensus is (usually - see <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_de_Jardin_71ab.html" title="Alan de Jardin">Alan de Jardin</a> and the related VfD) against me in this and will not create any more articles for losing third-party candidates. I will defend them each and every time I see them on VfD, though. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 04:17, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Substantially more than 49 people voted for, e.g., <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Guthrie_fa8e.html" title="Bruce Guthrie">Bruce Guthrie</a>. And I actually do think Barrie Singleton should have an article. However, I do think that my comment there should have been generally addressed rather than to you in specific, as there are plenty of other reasons (by contributors other than you) given in the Mitchell VfD that do not apply to Smith. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 04:17, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless he has done something else notable. Running for office is not in itself notable unless the candidate is elected or affects the election contest ie by saying something controversial that handicaps his parties chances.
