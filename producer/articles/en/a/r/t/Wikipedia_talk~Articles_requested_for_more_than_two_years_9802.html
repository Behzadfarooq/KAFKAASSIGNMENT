<p>Any ideas on how we can maintain this entire page? Everytime we update it (say once a month), by retrieving an old version of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Wikipedia:Requested articles</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_7c5b.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles">Requested articles</a> we have to remove the inappropiate requests again (unless we can set up a redirect). Making a judgement whether an article title is inappropiate or not is subjective and hard. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 12:47, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think anything short of a feature request to the developers would help. We would have to ask for a feature that takes a page, and filters out already-existing links and non-link text. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 12:50, Feb 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That much can be done by hand. The problem is if someone requests some bogus article that will never exist, then it has to get removed every time. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 13:43, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, <b>in theory</b>, you could run an sql query against the entire requested-articles history. You take all the nonexistant articles ever requested, and put them in one list, ordered by date. Then, by hand, you remove the bogus ones (once). Use entires in the list prior to Feb 6 (or whatever 2 years ago is). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 13:50, Feb 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about this for a less technical solution - we make things like Wikipedia:Articles requested since February 2002, Wikipedia:Articles requested since August 2002, Wikipedia:Articles requested since February 2003. Every six months we add a new page with this naming convention - Then we redirect <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_requested_for_over_a_year_47e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles requested for over a year">Wikipedia:Articles requested for over a year</a> to Wikipedia:Articles requested since $CLOSEST_TO_A_YEAR_AGO the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_requested_for_over_two_years_e309.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles requested for over two years">Wikipedia:Articles requested for over two years</a> redirects to Wikipedia:Articles requested since $CLOSEST_TO_TWO_YEARS_AGO. We update the redirect only once every six months - and when the weeding happens once every six months with the new page we go to the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_articles_0db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Request articles">Wikipedia:Request articles</a> page and remove them from there too - so it they won't be weeded again in six months time. I <i>think</i> that makes sense! <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 14:26, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometimes those listed here are not deserving of articles, but some evidence should be presented before simply removing a listing. Personally I'm not certain these two should be removed. A Google search on <a href="../../../y/v/e/Yves_Meyer_d9b6.html" title="Yves Meyer">Yves Meyer</a> returns over nine thousand hits, and seems to show him to be a mathematicians of some influence with a <a href="http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/HASSIP/hassipbib/Author/MEYER-Y.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/HASSIP/hassipbib/Author/MEYER-Y.html" rel="nofollow">long list of publications</a>.

<dd>Your right that a search for <a href="../../../y/v/e/Yves_Meyer_d9b6.html" title="Yves Meyer">Yves Meyer</a> returns a lot of results and it seems that he may have been important in some way with the long lists of publications. They also are both linked to from other articles. However, I would challenge you to find any actually information about them. Besides that the requests are over two years old. To me it seems like a toss up whether to keep them or delete them. In a way they are not really hurting anything by being there, but at some point we have to say that if we can't find any valuable information then we shouldn't just leave them there forever. We would only be deleting them from the request pages, not other articles. --Matthewjhale
<dl>
<dd>Regretably there are many topic that are deserving of articles, but which cannot be written based only on what is found with Google. For obvious reasons these pages tend to make their way to these aged requests pages. Writing articles on these fairly minor figures will probably require turning to offline resources and we are likley to have to wait some time for them to be written. However, these pages always somehow do get written. Every single one of the many thousands of legitimate requests made before December 17, 2003 have been filled, other than these two. Many of these requests were for topics of even greter obscurity. You've been doing some great work in this area, such as the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivienne_Dick_259d.html" title="Vivienne Dick">Vivienne Dick</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Ames_3c98.html" title="Cherry Ames">Cherry Ames</a> articles. You have also removed some listings that certainly did not deserve articles, such as analogical masks. What I feel is that you are being too ambitious and that can't set the goal of clearing every listing on your own. Some will just have to wait the arrival of one of those extremely specialized experts that are so useful. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 00:08, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is becoming increasingly inaccurately named. Wikipedia has an increasingly large number of contributors creating articles, and there's an upcoming <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMaintenance_collaboration_of_the_week_62ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Maintenance collaboration of the week">Wikipedia:Maintenance collaboration of the week</a> to be focused on the one-year requests. It seems like the backlog is shrinking, not growing long enough to hit two years again. So, I've merged this page with the one-year requests, preserving a special section for the very oldest. This will also save room on various lists of pages with outstanding requests. 8) -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 02:28, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This page is still an extremely useful tool for clearing out the oldest requests. Most items listed here get articles within a couple weeks, after many months requested. It is true that it has not matched its name in sometime, but this does not mean it is not very helpful. The requests are also gradually getting older, so in time it will match. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:24, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Why can't people go to the "oldest" section on the one-year page instead, to see the grand total of <i>three</i> oldest requests? Of course each request gets older every day, but more than one week's progress on the backlog is being made each week, so I don't see how there will ever be any two-year-old requests. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 21:34, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I did see "Irish Covenant" for "Ulster Covenant" (which has a Wikipedia article), for a deed (in Irish) relevant to a 19th Century dispute over the boundary between two parishes, for the claim that the Ark of the Covenant is buried at Tara, and in reference to "Ars Magica", which I think is a game. But none of these are in Wikipedia. My point is that I can't find evidence that any article in Wikipedia has a red link to "Irish Covenant".-- <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> 02:25, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With help from the Oxford English Dictionary online, I have finally created a page for Extranoematic and removed it from this list.

<dd>I've been able to create some three or four-paragraph articles for titles on this list. I've also ended up redirecting to another article as a somewhat weak guess as to what was meant.

<dd>I did at least a cursory Google on each of the names before I added them to the list - that's why there's at least one word describing each one, and why some non-notable red links weren't listed. It seems to be a common enough alternate spelling that it is worth a redirect page to the real article. If J.E. is a major writer, we should definitely have an article on him.

<p>But not in a good way. The only article was Waryngya Band. They are an aboriginal band from Australia. that appears to be the only information available. I think if someone comes along who thinks such an article is needed, he'll create it. For now, I'm editing it out.</p>

<dd>The website <a href="http://bitterjerksociety.org" class="external free" title="http://bitterjerksociety.org" rel="nofollow">http://bitterjerksociety.org</a> no longer exists. I checked the Wayback Machine - it's archived there from Nov 2002 to Jan 2006. It was a website apparently created by students (who presumably graduated and no longer have any interest in it).

<p>One should be very careful about this kind of reasoning. I did a Google search myself, for <i>Missilina Rei -wikipedia</i> <a href="http://www.google.no/search?hl=no&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;hs=hcD&amp;q=Missilina+Rei+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8k&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.no/search?hl=no&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&amp;hs=hcD&amp;q=Missilina+Rei+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=S%C3%B8k&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, (note that Google is so friendly that it prioritizes results depending on your location within this world, in my case Norway) The top result was this <a href="http://www.nihon-fr.net/forums/showthread.php?s=065cfa68006902ba2e365ea42efea462&amp;postid=178086" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nihon-fr.net/forums/showthread.php?s=065cfa68006902ba2e365ea42efea462&amp;postid=178086" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> French article, (why I get French articles on top is still a conundrum to me). The article suggests that we are talking about a Japanese artist. In such case we are talking about transliterations, which can explains why so few articles exists with this name. Our best bet would be to search for similar sounding transliterations, or perhaps contact the person who wrote the forum entry in the above mentioned article. <a href="../../../b/f/g/User%7EBfg_7212.html" title="User:Bfg">Bfg</a> 12:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A little more research reveals the following, "Missilina Rei" is another transliteration/misspelling of "Missalina Rei", see <a href="../../../../ja/m/i/s/Missalina_Rei_14b4.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Missalina_Rei">ja:Missalina_Rei</a> <a href="../../../b/f/g/User%7EBfg_7212.html" title="User:Bfg">Bfg</a> 12:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. Well, it was me that put the note there; I had my preferences set to return English results only, which I guess is a bad idea. (I also don't use Google.no, which your link points to, don't know if that makes any difference). So I only got four results, all of which were Wikipedia or its mirrors. I'll set it back to "any language". Thanks for finding that – <a href="../../../q/x/z/User%7EQxz_3066.html" title="User:Qxz">Qxz</a> 16:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not using google.no either, that was my point, even though I juse google.com it just chooses google.no, probably based on IP, or some criterion. Anyway, I have an issue with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">Google test</a>, and it is precisely the bias it creates against certain issues. Google is great, but one needs to understand its limitations. On the other hand, if your comment hadn't ticked me off, I probably wouldn't have done this research either, so perhaps its a good thing to use the test.&#160;;-)</dd>

<p>I translated a source from Spanish for information on this group and wrote an article. It's very dependent on this one source, however, so please feel free to add to it. Pkeets 04:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
