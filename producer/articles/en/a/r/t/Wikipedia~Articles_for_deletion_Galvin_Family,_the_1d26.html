<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Looks like it was taken from one of those bogus "buy your family shield" kiosks. Coat of arms belonged to an individual, not a family. Ifnord 15:15, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Preserve</b> The Galvin family used to be rulers of southern provinces of Ireland, such as Dungarvan and Youghal. Also, a sect of the Galvin Family are the founders of the communications giant Motorola. Also, the Galvin's are high ranking officials in the American health system, one being Chief of Physiotheraphy for the AHA. A member of the Galvin family was in the English national football team in the early 1900s. Daniel Galvin, world renowned hairdress, is 'World Hair Colourist of the Year' and is a powerful force in fashion from London, and ever increasingly, the world. Another thing of 'notable' worth is that a Galvin was the very first soldier to paratroop into Holland after Operation Market Garden was commenced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I think there is no information here that would serve as 'vanity'. As the site says itself "Many visitors come to this site to acquire knowledge. The second reason is to share knowledge." I am merely sharing knowledge, and now people may, if desired, which I'm sure people will desire, to read the article. It is not MY article, it is a article for other Galvin's around the world, of which there are many, and anyone else for that matter to find more on there background and be educated in its long and notable History.</p>
<p>As well as this, I had not finished this article and I did intend to add 'notable's' and such like.</p>
<p>As for calling the family shield bogus, I have official documentation that says otherwise, and dozens of NON PROFIT sites also show the coat of arms. It is a part of FAMILY history, not for INDIVIDUAL profit</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If the article will be deveoped further, state something on the talk page right away. Also, get a stub entry in place and maybe put a bullet list of notable information.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've had a good think about this. There <i>are</i> notable families, such as the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_family.html" title="Kennedy family">Kennedy family</a>. I might even accept this article if it were about the ancestral rulers in Ireland (though I would imagine Galvin clan might be a better article title in that case). But it's stretching the definition of "family" too far to claim that everyone with the same surname is part of a single family that is <i>per se</i> encyclopedic because some of its members are. Any individual Galvins who are notable should have their own article, as <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvin.html" title="Galvin">some of them do</a>. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 12:04, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The word family can and does mean 'A group of persons sharing common ancestry.' or 'Lineage' so actually the phraseology is correct. I have also expanded this article to include the notables, or the 'distinguised lineage'. As for the Notables, they are all proper and correct, and worthy of being notable. As 'notable' means 'Worthy of note or notice' and for those looking upon on <i>FAMILY</i> ancestory, they are notables, or for those just browsing Wikipedia in general. So, the arguements that this is vanity is incorrect, as it serves no egotistical purpose, but a insightful one. And if you look up to the bit I posted earlier as to what Wikipedia is about, some of you seem to have forgotten, as it is there help people "accquire knowledge" and thats what this article does. Not to serve as a vanity article, as vanity is pride in ones own accomplishments, and the accomplishments of Galvin ancestors are not my accomplishments, but theirs. Also, it does now contain notables and the phraseology within the article is perfectly correct and proper.

<li><b>Comment</b> Considering every 'delete' comment here has been totally proved worthless and idiotic, I think it's been about time we close this discussion. Yes. <small>unsigned comment by <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexius05_9599.html" title="User:Alexius05">Alexius05</a></small></li>

<dd>As stated on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, in the normal course of things this discussion should last five days, and it will be down to the administrator who closes the debate to decide on the worth or otherwise of the arguments here. "Vanity" - only mentioned as a reason for deletion by one person - is sometimes used as shorthand for "articles in which someone has a personal stake", such as someone writing about their own website, company, family, etc. And the fact that you had earlier created a (speedy deleted) article on Alex galvin probably didn't help matters. Had you actually bothered to engage with people rather than dismissing them as "idiotic", you might have got further (I nearly voted to keep this). --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 16:05, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - as has been said, if there are notable members of this family, create articles about individuals. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneyboo_eb5f.html" title="User:Barneyboo"><font style="background: #ff66ff" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Barney</b>boo</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarneyboo_2e94.html" title="User talk:Barneyboo">Talk</a>) 16:09, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to <i>OpenToppedBus</i>. I sincerely apologise, however, the sheer number of lamentable comments have aggravated me as all comments have been responded to and though they may have been useful, they are now outdated(referring to the comments such as <i>StoatBringers</i>) or are and were incorrect (such as <i>Ifnords</i>). As for the call for personal family member pages, from a variety of you, do you really think I'm going to start upon them when I get a veto upon the creatin of this page (designed to be the root of the member pages). The idea seems almost hypocritical at this moment in time. Also, despite this, there are already several notable pages linking the Galvin name, links which are on the page. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexius05_9599.html" title="User:Alexius05">Alexius05</a> 13:22 3rd December, 2005.</li>
