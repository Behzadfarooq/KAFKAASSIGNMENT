<p>The article is about a former band with no results on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">allmusic</a>. Most of the information in the article is sourced from the band's web site, or band member's or fan's blogs. This is the second time I have nominated this article for deletion. I believe the outcome of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mind_Pollution_cb37.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mind Pollution">previous vote</a> was influenced by multiple unsigned keep votes from the article's creator, and a lack of interest on the part of other Wikipedians. I would ask that people review the article, the previous vote, and follow the links in the article. Some are broken, and some don't show what the article claims. For instance, a search on the Marilyn Manson site turns up no references to either Mind Pollution or Sin Star. I would also ask that all participants here <b>sign their votes</b> with four tildes: ~~~~. My vote is to <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 18:42, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> David You are full of shit, you keep lying. <a href="http://marilyn-manson.net" class="external text" title="http://marilyn-manson.net" rel="nofollow">Marilyn-Manson.net</a> Clearly shows Sin Star on their front page, If you use the Wayback Machine you can see where Mind Pollution was listed in MMDN's Marilyn Manson news, and a Banner for Mind Pollution as well. <a href="http://allmusic.com/" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">allmusic</a> DOES have information on [Sin Star], Mind Pollution has CDs released on Record Labels, They have 2 nation tours ... The sources are from their official news from years ago in the internet archives.. This information cannot be altered. This was the source for several things. What is wrong with citing Fan Sites as sources&#160;? What is wrong with citing the band members Blogs as sources. You know for a fact that those Livejournal entries &amp; dates cannot be forged. There are pictures of Davien Crow (the singer of the band) with [Gidget Gein] ... I dont even feel like repeating the fact they can be found on SO MANY different sites. AND I DONT NEED TO POINT OUT THE FACT THIS IS RELATED TO [SIN STAR] .... David stop lying and handing people bullshit. I don't know what your problem is with this band, but you could at least be Honest instead of taking things out of context to try and get rid of them WHEN YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY put no effort into looking at the sources and only keep pointing out some of the official site sources and so on. NONE OF YOU ARE READING THINGS OVER. THEY MEET WP:MUSIC by at least completing 2 catagories&#160;! not to mention other ways. Dont be fooled by David Twisting things around to suite his little vendetta, trying to keep himself from looking stupid for being wrong. Sin-thetik 23:41, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I followed the link to marilyn-manson.net. I see nothing about Sin Star on the front page. I entered a site search for "Sin Star". It returns three results. <a href="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/128/ARTICLE/1058/2005-09-10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/128/ARTICLE/1058/2005-09-10.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/126/ARTICLE/1057/2005-08-05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/126/ARTICLE/1057/2005-08-05.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/0/ARTICLE/931/2004-06-21.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://marilyn-manson.net/news/0/ARTICLE/931/2004-06-21.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> None of these have anything to do with Sin Star. There were no results for Mind Pollution. You are correct that <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/" rel="nofollow">allmusic</a> does have something on them. A search for "Sin Star" finds a "Sin Star Project" with the following information: "Genre: Rock". Again, there were no results for Mind Pollution. If you search for a real band on allmusic, you would find their albums and much other information. I have by now spent hours looking at your sources, and I have no problem whatsoever with this band. I wish them much success, and I hope someday they make it and are deserving of an encyclopedia article. You say they have albums. Can I buy any of these albums in a music store? I searched Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Amazon, with no success. Livejournals entries cannot be forged? Anyone can write anything they want in a blog or on their own website. The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> standards of Wikipedia ask for more reliable sources. I have not made any untrue statements, and I do not appreciate being the target of personal attacks. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 03:26, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> or <b>MERGE</b> Meets at least 2 requirements under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, David Conrad is fabricating the non-valid sources, has states false comments in order to get this deleted. I do however agree with a previous vote (that seems to have mysteriously dissapeared, perhaps David's doing) that it should be Merged with Sin Star if it is not kept. Both articles rely on their connection to meet certain requirements. HOWEVER they both do meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> with at least 2 or 3 requirements met. ALL SOURCES ARE VERIFIABLE Gadget is God 23:57, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have not made any false comments, nor have I removed any votes. You may be referring to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mind_Pollution_cb37.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mind Pollution">previous vote on this article</a>, which I linked to in the description of this 2nd nomination. Regarding non-valid sources, please follow the link to <a href="http://livejournal.com/daviencrow" class="external text" title="http://livejournal.com/daviencrow" rel="nofollow">Davien Crow's Livejournal</a> in the article, and tell us what you find. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 03:26, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>MERGE</b> with [Sin Star] as a sub section. There is no reason for there to be an article on Mind Pollution when [Sin Star] better meets WP:MUSIC with the aid of this article. It meets the Guidelines set by Wikipedia for WP:Music because they have 2 national, verifiable, tours and have releases on notable independant labels Kid Atrium and Mushroomcloud records.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> If it is not merged I say keep it. It meets the Guidelines set by Wikipedia for WP:Music ... They have 2 national, verifiable tours (through fan sites and the internet archives, the archives cannot be altered) and have releases on notable independant labels Kid Atrium and Mushroomcloud records as said before. There are also several other non-music related guidelines both articles meet. I mean hell guys if Brian Peppers can get put on Wikipedia when all the government links verifying him dont work you guys should have no problem accepting NOTABLE WORKING references to a well known underground band.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Member Darien Starr is responsible for creating the genre "Death Pop" currently used by Orgy and Deadstar Assembly</li>

<li><b>COMMENT'</b> I REALLY THINK THIS SHOULD BE MERGED WITH Sin Star's vote A LOT OF THE INFO THERE PRETAINS AND VERIFIES THIS ARTICLE AS WELL&#160;!!!! Christina Jacobs 02:17, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> PLEASE CONSIDER VOTING AT SIN STAR instead of here. There is no need to be voting on both articles.</li>
