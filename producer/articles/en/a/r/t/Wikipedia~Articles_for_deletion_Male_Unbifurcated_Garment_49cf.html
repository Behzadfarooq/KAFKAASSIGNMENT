<dd>Dresses and skirts are two different garments. Besides, they're Western terms. Wiki is global, and there are more than 70 different terms which specifically describe various countries' MUGs. You gotta admit, the acronym MUG is a lot easier than spelling out "skirt-like garment" or "dress-like garment" when describing fustanella or thobes. And calling a fustanalla a "skirt" is an insult to the Turkish! The acronym MUG was developed in the 90s to accurately describe all unbifurcated garments worn by males, hence, male unbifurcated garment, or as it's commenly used, "MUG.'

<li><b>Response</b> Go to the Fashion Freedom entry and follow the links - you'll see that it's certainly a notable movement. At least 70 Million people worldwide actively participate in pushing fashion trends towards freedom. That's notable. Regardless, those in the fashion freedom movement comprise but a small fraction of men who wear MUGs. Approximately 40% of all men around the world wear "MUGs," and calling them "skirts" when they're not skirts, or "kilts" when they're not kilts is inappropriate. MUGs is an acronym, one that's been in use for <i><b>decades</b></i>. Although the term may not have the exposure of "Hip-Hop," it's been in use longer! <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response'</b> Google counts the number of Internet hits, which for "hip-hop" was about 205 Million. Compare that to the 1.4 Billion men who wear MUGs throughout the world, and the many Millions of Google hits given above for MUGs, which is very significant. Since your Googling skills are obviously rusty, try this: Add an "s" to the end, as in "male unbifurcated garments," you get 8,710 hits. Using "MUG" and "skirt" yields 650,000 hits, with the plural of MUGS and skirt yielding 347,000 hits. And "MUGs" and "kilt" yielded 174,000 hits. So again, what's your point about some "441 Google hits?" My question to you (still unanswered, I see), is "hard did you work to find the right combination that yielded the least amount of hits?" <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While using the number of Google hits to judge a topic's relevance has some <i>slight</i> value, it's a very poor indicator for one simple reason - it measures the frequency that a particular topic has on the web, not the quality or relevance of that information to human society. For example, "nuclear power" generated just 43.8 Million hits, less than 1/4 that of hip-hop, but if hip-hop died tomorrow, we'd be none the worse for wear. By contrast, if nuclear power died tomorrow, nearly a billion people would be without air conditioning, refridgeration, and the other necessities we need to survive. <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. It seems that you, Dr1819, misunderstood my (much briefer) comment, or perhaps read into it some words that were not there. My objection has nothing to do with gender issues, but only (as so many people have said) with the <i>term</i> "male unbifurcated garment." Those millions of men wearing sarongs, lungis, kilts, wraps, whatever, <i>don't call them MUGs</i> and they <i>don't wear them for the same reason you do</i>. They aren't a movement, they're simply wearing "clothing." (Perhaps I should have omitted my parenthetical comment about "Unisex Unbifurcated Garment," as it seems to have confused you. In a culture where everyone wears a sarong (for instance), it is inaccurate to call it a "male" garment.) <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 14:35, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Tildes included. "What the rest of the world does is irrelevant?" Are you aware that Western civilization comprises just 10% of the population on this planet, and that a mere third of the users of the Internet are of Western origen? What the rest of the world does may be irrelevant to you, but it's certainly relevant to most Wiki readers! Perhaps you didn't notice the fact that Wiki pages are served in many languages, or that translation of English Wiki pages into other languages (and vice versa) is a high priority at Wiki. Besides, no one here is trying to convert Western styles of fashion. Do what you want. Just stop believing that your choice of fashion should dictate what the rest of the world does, including among American men in your own country - they/we should be as free to wear what we want as anyone else on the planet. As for the remainder of your comments, I defer to the more than 1 Million Google hits which clearly indicate it's not "a term most people have never heard" as you wrongly claim. If you're prone to psychological projections, please keep them to yourself and let the evident facts at hand regarding the validity of the term speak for itself. Thank you!

<dd><b>Response</b> While I appreciate your support, you really cannot call it a skirt, for two reasons. First, most males who wear MUGS throughout the world strongly resent it when people refer to their dress as a "skirt," due to it's feminine connotations. They're wearing lunghi, sarongs, fustanellas, kilts - and more than 70 other terms, but most of them will respond with is, "For crying out loud, man! It's a kilt, not a skirt!" Or other words to that effect in their own language and accurately describing their particular term for the MUG they're wearing. The second reason is that the MUG acronym encompasses both lower and full-body unbirfucated garments. Many garments worn by males, predominantly in the Middle East, but also throughout Africa, Siberia, and other climates ranging from incredibly cold to unbearably hot, resemble dresses, not skirts. Thus, using the term "skirt" is like calling a car a "wheel." Or, in the case of those who're offended, calling a Porshe a "VW." It's simply not equivalent. The MUG acronym was developed more than a decade ago to accurately encompass, without either error or offence, all unbifurcated garments worn by males, hence, male unbifurcated garment - MUG. What could be simpler? <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 18:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>there's a growing global movement of blokes who believe in a man's right to wear the <b>Male Unbifurcated Garment or MUG (the correct term for legless menswear)</b>. In February, 100 skirted men from the Men's Fashion Freedom group marched through New York, protesting "trouser tyranny". "We're not transvestites," said one. "We're men. Men who want the right to wear a skirt."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, the <b>pro-MUG</b> group Kiltmen are battling on behalf of their private parts. "If we are proud of our maleness, we should treat our male organs with greater respect than by cramping them in trousers," says their website. Manly men throughout history wore <b>MUGs</b>, they say, and trousers "are no longer a symbol of manhood but rather a unisex garment customarily worn by women"<i>. Amy Cooper, "</i>Great lengths<i>", Sun Herald, June 20, 2004</i></dd>

<p>Sometimes understanding the articles here can require a bit of research. Often, google does not provide the best results. Deletion is rarely the best solution if we want to serve the needs of all our users whether in skirts, sarongs, trousers or MUGS. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:21, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
