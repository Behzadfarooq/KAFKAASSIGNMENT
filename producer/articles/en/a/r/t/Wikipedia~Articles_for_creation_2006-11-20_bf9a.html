<p>P.L.U. (short for People Like Us) is a group of like minded friends, started in late 2005. P.L.U. was started in Hinckley, Leicestershire but soon spread into the rest of the country. The main feature that distinguishes P.L.U. from any group of teenagers is the creativity. P.L.U. probably contains the most impressive young authors, poets and artists in England today. The group would later be called S.P.P.O (Society for the protection of P.L.Us originality) although the name change was not liked by all the founding members.</p>

<p>Blade Braxton of Topeka, Kansas, son of Dwight Braxton, is a columnist for the insanely popular WrestleCrap.com. Blade pens the popular Jobber Of the Week article, as well as co-hosting WrestleCrap Radio. He is also currently co-writing The WrestleCrap Book Of Lists.</p>
<p>Blade is a fan of the victory challenged Detroit Lions professional football team. This has led to several bets with WrestleCrap's founder R.D. Reynolds (fan of the Indianapolas Colts), which led to Blade watching the porno One Night In China, starring professional wrestlers Sean Waltman and Joanie Laurer.</p>
<p>Blade has a profile on MySpace.com and currently has 757 friends.</p>
<p>He wishes John Cena's name in The Marine was Tito Martel or Rick Santana, since the movie was taglined with "A One Man Strike Force", making obvious reference to former WWF Tag Team Champions Tito Santana and Rick martel.</p>

<p>Radical moderatism holds that most political issues and questions are unscientific, unanswerable, or irrelevant. It differs from <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderate_%28politics%29.html" title="Moderate (politics)">moderatism</a> in that the latter tends to mild-manneredly emphasize compromise, the merits of political arguments from all sides, and the status quo. Radical moderatism, as the name suggests, urges radical rejection of contemporary political priorities, while asserting that government-regulated <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> cannot be optimized and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_issues.html" title="Social issues">social issues</a> cannot be <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morally.html" title="Morally">morally</a> or <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethically</a> decided.</p>

<p>Radical moderates are often frustrated with contemporary politics in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> countries because they disagree with political rhetoric that ranges from issue-based partisan sloganeering to extremism. Some think of mainstream politicians confident in their own views on an issue as unreasonably self-righteous. To many radical moderates, variations of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a> are the ideal manifestation of radical moderate beliefs. Because governments cannot effectively solve political problems, they should not try.</p>
<p>Other radical moderates cite political reality in advocating the election of moderate candidates. One strategy they hope to implement is to vote in primaries in favor of the most moderate candidate, so that mainsteam <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">parties'</a> moderate candidates have a better chance of winning <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_elections.html" title="Primary elections">primaries</a>.</p>

<p>Since beginning on guitar over 4years ago,Bam(not to be confused with Bam Margera of Jackass and Viva La Bam fame)has worked extensively on the Irish music scene from classical like the Cross-Border Orchestra to the more underground rock of his band Noir to his instrumental solo project Nocturnal Orchids.He achieved his mercurial and inimitable style by a strict practice regime of 5hours a day,much in the same vein as Steve Vai.He says he tries to use his music and his guitar to convey deep emotions and feelings and essentially bring his music to life by utilizing a plethora of techniques such as tapping,sweeped arpeggios,economy picking,alternate picking and legato.He gives his students sound advice and a practice routine that is set to hone and define their chops as well as the greats.He also has written and posted numerous works of poetry through the medium of the internet ranging from the darkly emotional to the thoughtful and more profound.</p>

<p>Bam has staunchly said that his main influence is Steve Vai but his playing shows colours of guitarists ranging from metal to blues to the progressive.Other influences include Shawn Lane,Paul Gilbert,Jason Becker,Jeff Beck,Frank Zappa and John Petrucci among others.</p>

Doing It Differently was an attitude the school had embraced to engage the entire school to reflect on all that was happening in school, pondering on the purpose and value underlying these processes and offering suggestions to add value to them. For example, students were encouraged to seriously mull over the need for an enhanced school tone and discipline and to present their views on the desired outcomes. Suggestions made by students for school improvement were welcomed and rationale for decisions were openly discussed to help them appreciate the value and respect for collective responsibility.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting developments that had taken place this year was the active involvement and empowerment of students in managing major school events. Year 2005 started off with the student leaders from Sec 2 to Sec 5 getting together to plan and organise the Sec One Orientation. The programme, called ‘The Metamorphosis’, was so successful that they felt confident enough to take on greater responsibilities and had gone on to be key players in organising this year’s school’s Cross Country, the Track and Field event and Total Defence Day. One other initiative undertaken by the IT Club was the ‘Computer Literacy Course’ for Parents. Sec 3 and 4 pupils prepared course materials and conducted the course and now they have plans to impart computer skills to their junior schoolmates.</p>

Doing It Differently was an attitude the school had embraced to engage the entire school to reflect on all that was happening in school, pondering on the purpose and value underlying these processes and offering suggestions to add value to them. For example, students were encouraged to seriously mull over the need for an enhanced school tone and discipline and to present their views on the desired outcomes. Suggestions made by students for school improvement were welcomed and rationale for decisions were openly discussed to help them appreciate the value and respect for collective responsibility.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting developments that had taken place this year was the active involvement and empowerment of students in managing major school events. Year 2005 started off with the student leaders from Sec 2 to Sec 5 getting together to plan and organise the Sec One Orientation. The programme, called ‘The Metamorphosis’, was so successful that they felt confident enough to take on greater responsibilities and had gone on to be key players in organising this year’s school’s Cross Country, the Track and Field event and Total Defence Day. One other initiative undertaken by the IT Club was the ‘Computer Literacy Course’ for Parents. Sec 3 and 4 pupils prepared course materials and conducted the course and now they have plans to impart computer skills to their junior schoolmates.</p>

<p>Howard Clinton Zahniser (1906-1964) was born on February 25, 1906, in Franklin, Pennsylvania, and grew up in nearby Tionesta along the banks of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_River_87c0.html" title="Allegheny River">Allegheny River</a> close to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_National_Forest_7f77.html" title="Allegheny National Forest">Allegheny National Forest</a>. He attended college at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois, where he graduated with a B.A. degree in 1928. He is the primary author of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilderness_Act_0d0f.html" title="Wilderness Act">Wilderness Act</a> of 1964.</p>
<p>After beginning his career with the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey, Zahniser went on to become executive secretary of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wilderness_Society_d204.html" title="The Wilderness Society">The Wilderness Society</a> from 1945 through 1964. In his capacity with The Wilderness Society, Zahniser drafted the Wilderness Act in 1956, which was introduced in the United States Congress that same year -- in the House of Representatives by Congressman John P. Saylor of Pennsylvania, and in the Senate by Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Zahniser was the main proponent of the Wilderness Act over the subsequent eight years that it took to pass the legislation, including overseeing numerous rewrites, attending all 18 public hearings on the bill, and personally lobbying virtually every member of Congress in support of the legislation.</p>
<p>Zahniser died of heart failure on May 5, 1964, just a few months before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law in September of that year. The Wilderness Act established America's <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Wilderness_Preservation_System_c639.html" title="National Wilderness Preservation System">National Wilderness Preservation System</a>, which today permanently protects more than 106 million acres of federal public land for the benefit of future generations of people and wildlife alike. Wilderness areas must be designated by act of Congress under the framework of the Wilderness Act that Zahniser created on Forest Service, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management lands. There have been more than 100 seperate wilderness bills signed into law since 1964. Every United States President since 1964 has signed substantial wilderness legislation during his time in office.</p>
<p>Zahniser is buried in the Tionesta Riverside Cemetary, his rough-hewn marker, taken from the surrounding forest, facing his beloved Allegheny River.</p>

Ukrainito - a Ukrainian homoertotic artist/photographer from Simferopol, Crimea, Ukraine, who happens to be the first openly gay artist in this post-soviet country. He holds a Master’s in Fine Arts and spent ten years training as a classical painter and graphic artist at the Crimean Samokish College of Fine Arts before, in 2002, making his first foray into digital graphics and photography. In January of 2003 he started his first web-project hosted at a free Russian web-server narod.ru to show his first examples of homoertic art. In January 2005 his site moved to www.ukrainito.com, so a growing number of male-art lovers from around the globe got a chance to enjoy Ukrainito's atwork at high speed.</p>
<p>His work is all about artistic love for the fantastic beauty of the male body and Ukrainito’s love for his life-partner, Ermanito; the latter’s endless unconditional love, hope, and trust providing non-stop inspiration.</p>
<p>The artist tries to strike a blow that so many of gays and lesbians in the so-called post-Soviet “new democracies” continue to be discriminated against because of their sexuality, being deprived of rights and freedoms often taken for granted by modern gays (post-gays) in more enlightened democratic countries.</p>

<p>Population distribution relates the numbers of people to the space they occupy. It is not always that reliable as large cities will have more people in a smaller area than the countryside of a large area.</p>

Caleb Harrison was born in the late 80s in Chicago, Illinois. He came to Canada looking for his parents, whom he had never met, as he was abandoned at a young age. On a whim, he moved to Yellowknife, where he found his mother. He currently resides in Yellowknife, playing gigs around town, trying to scrounge up enough money to move back down south and become a travelling musician. Studying several styles of drumming including jazz, latin, funk, blues, new orleans, etc. he hopes to one day find his father, who he has long since forgiven for abandoning him so many years ago. "I hope this message finds you papa", says a hopefull young man. But until then, this musician is just going to keep on a rollin'.</p>

<p>The 1 Second Movie was created as a spoof on The 1 Second Film. The project will be a worldwide co-production and thus will be shot in seven countries - one in South America, one in Africa, one in Asia, two in Europe plus Australia and the US. Producer credits are FREE OF CHARGE so virtually everyone can become The Producer.</p>
<p>The 1 Second Movie will consist of the following elements presented at once and thus forming the entire movie: - Opening credits - The movie itself that will last one second and that will be frames from the shots made in every country - Deleted scenes which will be shown right after the 1 second movie. Deleted scenes will be 5 minutes for every country and thus will total 35 minutes - End Credits that will roll approximately for 1 hour</p>
<p>Deleted scenes will play a key role in the project. Each 5 minute section will be shot in one of the seven co-producing countries by the director from that country (so we'll have seven directors in total). Each story will evolve around a panel used in The 1 Second Film (its spoof version of course) visiting a particular country (like it's a human being). By the end of the production we'll have seven 5 minute sections of deleted scenes shot by different directors but with the same main character - the panel (that is visiting that country). The scripts will be developed for each country while we will be working on the project. Participant will be able to follow the progress of the project and to give their suggestions on the The 1 Second Movie website blog.</p>

<p>Grampa Bill's G. A. Pages George Patrick Lee 1943 - living</p>
<hr />
<p>Born 1943 Towaoc, Colorado Baptized as a child Missionary to Navajo Reservation Married Katherine Hettick; three children First Quorum of the Seventy 1975-1989 Excommunicated 1989</p>
<hr />
<p>George Patrick Lee was the first American Indian to become a General Authority of the Church. He was born in 1943 in Towaoc, Colorado to Mae K. Lee (Asdzaa Lichii) of the Tódích'íi'nii (Bitter Water Clan), and to a Medicine Man, Peter Lee (Hastiin Jaaneez Yee Biye), of the Under the Flat-Roofed House People Clan. One of 17 children from his parent’s marriages, Lee was called Ashkii Yazhi (Little Boy), until he was given a sacred name, Ashkii Hoyani (Boy Who is Well Behaved and Good).</p>
<p>He attended a government boarding school at Shiprock, New Mexico for two years after a trader, assisting the Bureau of Indian Affairs, helped him enroll. Because a religious preference, other than the Native American traditional faith, had to be indicated on the application, Lee’s mother told the trader to write in the name of his religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After completing the second grade at Shiprock, Lee attended school in Aztec, New Mexico, where he was promoted to the fifth grade.</p>
<p>When he was 12, he became a member in one of the first children’s groups to participate in an official Indian foster placement program sponsored by the Church. He was transported to Orem, Utah where he lived with the Glen and Joan Harker family. Lee remained in their home for seven years, returning to his Navajo family during summer vacations, until he graduated from Orem High School in 1962. He excelled in school, achieving many honors, and became a devout member who later served as a missionary on the Navajo reservation.</p>
<p>He attended Brigham Young University, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree and a Doctorate in Educational Administration, and Utah State University, where he completed a Master’s Program. In Arizona, Lee taught at the Rough Rock Demonstration School and later served as President of the College of Ganado. He received many honors, including a fellowship from the U.S. Office of Education for the 1970-1971 academic year, a Ford Foundation Fellowship Award and the Spencer W. Kimball Lamanite Leadership Award.</p>
<p>George P. Lee married Katherine Hattick, a Comanche. The couple had three children.</p>
<p>George's efforts were not limited to academic excellence. He also served long and well in his adopted church. Over the years he was called as a Scoutmaster, a Young Mens President, an Elders Quorum President, a Branch President, a District President, a Counselor to a Mission President and as a Mission President.</p>
<p>Lee’s achievements culminated in his October 3, 1975 ordination, at the age of 32, as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, a General Authority, by President Spencer W. Kimball. President of the Arizona Holbrook Mission at the time of his call to the First Quorum of the Seventy, he continued as Mission President for some time as a General Authority. He woluld serve some fourteen years as a General Authority.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1989, however, it was announced that Lee had been excommunicated for “apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member of the church.” His excommunication was the first of a General Authority to occur in 46 years. According to Lee, the action stemmed from his disagreement with the other church leaders over the role of American Indians in the religion and from other charges he had presented in a 23-page letter to President Ezra Taft Benson, and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It is the policy of the Church to respect an individual's right to privacy and not publicize the details of an excommicant's behavior which brought about the disciplinary action. However the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Lee had attempted to molest a minor girl. Lee originally denied the charges but on October 12, 1994, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Lee acknowledged his guilt:</p>
<p>"A year ago, former Mormon general authority George P. Lee proclaimed he was 'innocent before God' of sexually molesting a 12-year-old neighbor girl.</p>
<p>"But Tuesday before a 3rd District judge, Lee humbly hung his head and admitted to touching the girl's breasts for sexual gratification....</p>
<p>"Lee, 51, pleaded guilty to attempted sexual abuse of a child, a third-degree felony...."</p>
<p>At this writing, Lee remains outside the Church.</p>

Line of succession to the Russian Throne From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search</p>
<p>Part of a series on: Orders of Succession</p>
<p>Former Monarchies</p>
<p>Albania Austria-Hungary Bavaria Brazil Bulgaria Ethiopia France (Orléanist) France (Bonapartist) Germany/Prussia Greece Hanover Iraq Italy Montenegro Portugal Romania Russia Saxony Tuscany Two Sicilies United Kingdom (Jacobite) Württemberg Yugoslavia</p>
<p>see also: Monarchies Presidencies</p>
<p><br />
The Monarchy of Russia was abolished in 1917. The current Pretender is open to debate.</p>
<p>If one accepts H.I.H Grand Duke Vladimir Kyrillovich of Russia's morgantic marriage to H.S.H. Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhranskaya, a member of a junior line of the Bagration family as valid, and overlook his father's treasonous behavior during the Revolution then the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>H.H. Princess Maria Vladimirovna Romanovskaya b. 1953 (H.I.H. Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna Romanova of Russia)</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Georg von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1981 (H.I.H. Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov of Russia)</li>
</ol>
<p>Georg and Maria's Russian styles are disputed hence the parentheses</p>
<ol>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Louis Ferdinand Friedrich Wilhelm Hubertus Michael von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1939</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Philipp von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1968</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Paul von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1995</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Timotheus Friedrich von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 2005</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Wilhelm Heinrich Michael Louis Ferdinand Friedrich Franz Wladimir von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1940</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Georg Friedrich von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1976</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Christian Sigismund Louis Ferdinand Kilian von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1946</li>
<li>H.R.H. Prince Christian Ludwig von Hohenzollern of Prussia b. 1988</li>
</ol>
<p>Descendants of Maria of Leiningen would be excluded due to her morgantic marriage</p>
<p>If one accepts that the descendants of H.M. Nicholas II's sisters H.I.H. Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia and H.I.H. Grand Duchess Olga of Russia would be the next dynasts then the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>H.H. Prince Mikhail Andreevich Romanov b. 1920</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Andrei Andreevich Romanov b. 1923</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Alexei Andreevich Romanov b. 1953</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Piotr Andreevich Romanov b. 1961</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Andrei Andreevich Romanov b. 1963</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov b. 1924</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Mikhail Mikhailovich Romanov b. 1959</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Nikita Nikitich Romanov b. 1923</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Fedor Nikitich Romanov b. 1974</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Aleksandr Nikitich Romanov b. 1929</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich Romanov b. 1985</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Nikita Rostislavovich Romanov b. 1987</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Nikolai Nikolaievich Romanov b. 1968</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Daniil Nikolaievich Romanov b. 1972</li>
</ol>
<p>If one accepts senior male line descent regardless of morgantic marriage the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>H.S.H. Prince Dmitri Pavlovich Romanovsky-Ilyinski b. 1954 (Head of the House of Holstein-Gottorp)</li>
<li>H.S.H. Prince Mikhail Pavlovich Romanovsky-Ilyinski b. 1960</li>
</ol>
<p>If one accepts the Head of the Romanov Family Association to be the head of the family then the following are heirs to the Imperial Throne of Russia.</p>
<ol>
<li>H.H. Prince Nikolai Romanovich Romanov b. 1922</li>
<li>H.H. Prince Dmitri Romanovich Romanov b. 1926</li>

<p>Actually- I was only blocked once. I admit I made mistakes and angered some old-timers here- but the article above is all inclusive with source material and the current article is not. It is not only my POV, but the most respected genealogical source material on Earth. If the Almanach de Gotha states Prince Nicholas and not Princess Maria to be Head of the House- who are you to argue it? Prince Dmitri is also listed as Head of the House of Holstein-Gottorp, which makes him an equally viable candidate. His father was offered the throne and declined. I make no stand on any side- I present all the claimants equally without bias. The current article cannot say the same. Thanks for your input!Tim Foxworth 15:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Almanach de Gotha that you cite is not considered to be very reputable. I could write a book stating that George Bush is head of the Imperial House of Russia and it wouldn't make it right. Also, being the Head of the House of Holstein-Gottorp does not make one a Russian dynast when one is a Russian morganaut. Also, when the same content was presented, you insisted on changing titles and styles to forms that go against any real usage. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 18:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Romanov Family does not recognize the title or styles you prefer- so which usage is correct? I would think they would know better than you. I presented BOTH styles- as is correct when a title or style is DISPUTED. You want only the ones you see as correct. Do you presume to know more about the House Laws of the Romanov family than the Romanovs' do? Are you really that arrogant? Yet again, I have taken no side, but show all relevant points. Tim Foxworth 23:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The original Almanach is considered the definitive source- please check your reference material. If you wish to write that book that would be your own concern. Being the Head of House of Holstein-Gottorp would make them a dynast when as the case is all persons involved in this could be considered morganauts. They were after all offered the throne by Russian delegates and declined after the fall of communism. The titles and styles are disputed- hence using both versions- you only want the ones you want to see online. Check your facts Charles. Tim Foxworth 20:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The correct solution is not to create a new article, so forget it, Tim. The right thing to do is to edit the existing article (<a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_throne_85bc.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian throne">Line of succession to the Russian throne</a>) to be NPOV. Admittedly, it is a bit difficult in the shadow of warring between Tim and Charles. Both of them bear some responsibility for the present difficulties. And their temperaments are obviously totally incompatible with each other. Personally, I have edited the article towards NPOV direction. And in fullness of time, that will continue. At the moment, we are at its talk page, where we do work for example to find other reasonable alternatives, and also to find sources to be verification behind each such pretension, right or claim. Please join that work, do not war. The Nicholas Romanov position is already presented in that place, we know "all" about the current Almanach de Gotha and its value (Charles, in Wikipedia almost NOTHING is THE definitive thing, not even the old AdG, we just present all POVs as they are published. There may be toiletpaper quality sources - even their positions are usually presented. But the current Adg is not total toiletpaper, it has some weight.). So, in my opinion, it is totally futile to battle over the value of RFA position here, as it is already presented and no one is seriously (I hope) trying to erase that position from the existing article. Here, in this creation proposal page, you have a tempest in a teabottle, if I may say. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 21:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shilkanni- I have tried that approach- any edit that Charles does not agree with does not get included. His knowledge of the subject matter seems to be minimal and one sided. Thank you for your objectiveness in this matter. Tim Foxworth 21:46, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-20_bf9a.html" title="Edit section: Clubwear">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clubwear</span></h2>
<p>From boiler suits, whistles, white gloves and bum bags to cyber pants, glowsticks, UV dummies and fluffy legwarmers, love it or hate it, Clubwear has been one of the main elements that has set the UK dance scene apart from any other emerging youth culture over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>From its underground routes, the freedom to express yourself in not only your dancing but in how you look has always meant that clubland has been awash with original designs and vibrant colours sometimes bordering on the outlandish.</p>
<p>The free parties and outdoor festivals of the early 90’s gave rise to such legendary names as Dreamscape, Fantasia and Helter Skelter and saw the emergence of a new breed of fashion. The neon bright colour clothes and smiley face t-shirts of clublands acid house beginnings evolved into day glow work jackets, illuminous vests and white gloves not forgetting those most essential accessories, a whistle, a horn and a tub of Vicks Vapour Rub!</p>
<p>In 1994, the government imposed the infamous Criminal Justice Bill which forced the free-party and underground movement into mainstream clubs, with many prohibiting this type of early rave fashion and paraphernalia which stifled much of this early free form of dance fashion expression.</p>
<p>In the mid to late 90’s much of the UK club fashion was influenced by the ever popular club culture of Ibiza, with the first sightings on the scene of the ever immortal clubbing accessory the Fluffy Legwarmer, as worn by many of the Balearic Islands podiums dancers at the time. The end of the 90’s saw the emergence of the “super club”, with names such as The Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher, taking much inspiration from the early days of Manchester’s legendary Hacienda, with UV and strobe lighting and brightly coloured décor. It was at this time that club fashion started to go back more to its original roots with club goers wearing much more brightly coloured attire, leading to the materialisation of a new type of clubbing fashion known as “cyber wear” with neon colours and UV reflective materials, early pioneers of this new clubbing trend were clubwear companies such as Cyberdog and Battery Organic.</p>
<p>The late 90’s to early 2000’s saw a re-emergence of the outdoor festival scene and with it a need for club goers to express themselves more in their appearance, festivals such as Gatecrasher Summer Sound System, brought with them loyal groups of followers with outfits emblazoned with their club emblem, outrageous hairstyles, fluffy legwarmers, childish backpacks and lashings of UV makeup and the “Crasher Kid” was born.</p>
<p>The last six years, has seen a big move towards much sexier and much more sophisticated clubbing clothing for the ladies, and designer t-shirts and funky jeans for the lads. Clubwear still holds the elements of the original scene but has become more creative and diverse with designers like Contagious Clubwear who did not exist 10-15 years ago leading the way in cutting edge designs, giving today’s club goer much more choice to help them stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>What will the future bring? Well judging by current trends, clubwear will get even smaller and sexier, until everyone will be clubbing in UV fig leaves! But the important point is that clubwear like the scene that it belongs too is changing and evolving constantly and adapting with the clubbers who wear it.</p>

<p>The Tay Coast Line is a railway line in central Scotland. The line was originally constructed by the Dundee and Perth Railway company in 1845. It is approximately 18 miles long and runs mainly along the northern side of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Tay_63de.html" title="River Tay">River Tay</a> valley, linking the cities of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Scotland_2b8a.html" title="Perth, Scotland">Perth</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Dundee_5989.html" title="City of Dundee">Dundee</a>.</p>

<p>The line is almost entirely double tracked, and the generally flat and straight nature of the line leads to relatively high speeds for a Scottish railway. The exception to this is a short, single tracked section between Perth and Barnhills which includes the bridge over the Tay. Other than <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth_railway_station%2C_Scotland_3ebe.html" title="Perth railway station, Scotland">Perth</a> the only other active station is at <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invergowrie.html" title="Invergowrie">Invergowrie</a>, since technically the line ends at Dundee Central junction, which is a short distance away from <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee_railway_station.html" title="Dundee railway station">Dundee Station.</a></p>

<li><b>decline</b>, not notable nickname for the Dundee and Perth Railway. The submitter has provided half a dozen credible sources in their attempt to get this into Wikipedia, either directly, or by reference from another article. None of these sources use the name Tay Coast Line. A Google search for "Tay Coast Line" seems only to return references from Wikipedia and from other Wikis. Therefore there has been no evidence presented and there is no evidence discoverable via Google to indicate that TCL is commonly used, let alone the preferred name. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 22:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
