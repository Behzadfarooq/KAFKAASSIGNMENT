<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw comment total is 8-5 Delete. But two of the Keep comments are a bit fishy: one by an editor who has made two other edits, one by an editor who has made one other edit, to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Dark_Enforcer_362f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Dark Enforcer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Dark Enforcer</a>. If we discount those two, we have a raw total of 8-3 Delete (counting one Redirect comment as Delete). The argument that the non-production of the film is of some notability is well taken; this is not just somebody's fever dream, but a real event (by being a non-event) in the history of the Batman film franchise. On the other hand, no real claim was advanced that the Batman film <i>series</i> (as opposed to the individual films) and it's backstories and financial ins-and-outs is itself sufficiently notable that a non-produced film in the series must be notable. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> <i>does</i> specifically discourage articles on unproduced films except in special instances which are not really met here. So I don't see a really convincing Keep argument, and in the end, with an 8-3 raw vote total, I see a general consensus to delete. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the film never entered production and has no significant value to have its own article. This project is already mentioned in its own section in the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_%281997_film%29_de33.html#Sequel" title="Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)">Batman &amp; Robin</a></i> film article. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 00:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> we have a category for cancelled and unfinished films; this one is part of the history of Batman in films. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 02:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Firstly, it is not a movie that would gain a good amount of attention; it is merely a sequel in a series. Sure, people would've seen it, but is it really so important and notable that even when canceled, it still deserves an article? Secondly, the two sources are merely speculation themselves - I don't think we should be basing articles on such things. WB has not released information about this canceled movie; fans have merely speculated on it. All in all, the mention at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_%281997_film%29_de33.html#Sequel" title="Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)">Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)#Sequel</a> is quite enough, I believe. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicaroon9288_bfd0.html" title="User:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a>•<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">talk</a> 03:36, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article needs a bit of cleanup, but is generally properly sourced, and while not of earth-shattering importance, does factually detail the failure of the Schumacher franchise, and it's demise. I found it interesting the first time I read it, because I hadn't actually found much about it before then. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 03:45, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is history as an unmade Batman movie. It tells the story of what could have been had the series gone on with Joel Shumacher(sp?) continued as director and what his next film would have been.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Walks4fun (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Walks4fun_404b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Walks4fun">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. A film like this "should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place," which it never did. Furthermore, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> states that unreleased films are "generally <b>not</b> appropriate unless the <i>production</i> of the film is notable in some way." Seeing that this film never even entered production, it can't even qualify for notability. It's not even "unfinished", it was never started. If this article is kept, then it will be trimmed down substantially based on the speculative bits in the article. There wasn't even a script treatment released about this supposed film -- how can anything be assumed about what takes place? If this film article is kept, we may as well create film articles for other films that never got beyond pre-production. As I've said, <i>Batman Triumphant</i> already has its own section in the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_%281997_film%29_de33.html#Sequel" title="Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)">Batman &amp; Robin</a></i> film article, and any information from this particular article should be adapted to fit that paragraph instead of having its own article. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 21:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, being a Batman film is its only notority, and the information is too scant to warrent its own page. Plus, as previously said, it is already covered in its <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_%281997_film%29_de33.html#Sequel" title="Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)">appropriate place</a></i>.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canceled_Superman_films_2aee.html" title="Canceled Superman films">Canceled Superman films</a> article seems pretty extensive since there were various people (such as screenwriters) attached at different points, but I'm not sure how valid of an article it really is. That's a debate in itself. <i>Batman Triumphant</i> was one intended film (under one intended script, it seems), which does not make it very notable from that particular perspective. The <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> article seems to contain the necessary information in its sequel section, though I'm sure it could be improved. I don't know if there's been any other attempts to film a Batman movie after <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> and before <i>Batman Begins</i>, but that could be an article in itself if <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancelled_Superman_films_2eb4.html" title="Cancelled Superman films">Cancelled Superman films</a> exists. That's a discussion for another day, though. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 21:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> If the article had any sniff of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> I would advocate keep in the interest of Batman History.

<li>Yes, maybe so, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a compendium of interesting film history that gives non-notable, cancelled movies their own fansite-sourced articles.
