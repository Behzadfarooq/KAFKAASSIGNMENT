<dd>I don't dispute that it's relatively well known for the moment, but so are lots of Internet e-mail forwards and novelty websites, very few of which deserve any mention in an encyclopedia. What is this article going to say six months or a year from now, when the interest in this bile has died down and the website is defunct? "Briefly controversial rant against Southerners copied by many <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">weblogs</a>, some approving, some disapproving"? IMO, this kind of thing makes Wikipedia into an compedium of stuff-I-just-heard-about instead of a proper encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/y/s/User%7ETysto_ecb9.html" title="User:Tysto">Tysto</a> 02:50, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain</b> at this time, because I am too disturbed by the website itself. I am from the South. The website that the article refers to is a hate-filled misinformed rant directed against a small percentage of southerners, the ones Hollywood uses as cliché villains. Yes, there are <i>Bubbas</i> who own assault rifles and fly the Confederate battle flag (and might not recognize any of the real Confederate flags). They are a minority. This is the Bible Belt so there are people who think they are Christians preaching hate against homosexuals. Those two groups alone do not make a majority, but voting with other conservatives and some moderates get a slight majority. Nationally, in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">2004 presidential race</a> Bush received 50.7% and Kerry received 48.7% of the of the popular vote. To assume that everyone in the South thinks the same way based on which party wins elections is just wrong. The web site just is another divisive factor in the United States, based on regionalism instead of some other prejudice. Ask yourself as you think about this AfD - <b>is notoriety the same thing as notability?</b> I will vote later, after I have had some time to think and to review the Wikipedia article for NPOV and to review policies. -<a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 23:58, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Taco Deposit did a good job on keeping the article here NPOV. Rant itself is quite stale; that is it was posted a couple of days after the election and there appears to be no new material since. Why someone is so filled with hate as to pay to keep it up is a mystery. However, I feel that documentation of divisive elements in the US itself is notable.
