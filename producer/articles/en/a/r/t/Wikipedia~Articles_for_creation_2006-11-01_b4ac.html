Cell Phone Unlock-Without Keys --&gt;</p>
<p>This tip only works for people who have electronic push button keys. If you are ever stranded with your keys locked inside your car, there is a very simple way to unlock your car without the help of AAA or any other service. If someone has access to your spare keys, call them on your cell phone. Have them click the spare keys into their phone and, on the receieving end, hold your phone next to the lock of your car. The transmission will most definitely unlock the door. Though many say this does not work, it does. Just try for yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is impossible. Even the cited sources agree, and give an explanation why, this is impossible.</p>

The purpose of the Pasadena Anarchist Collective is to facilitate the integration of various forms of Anarchism, Human Liberation, Animal Liberation and Earth Liberation.</p>
<p>We see all sides as having a lot to learn and gain from the other. We see all sides as springing from common roots -- discontent with the dominant social norms of alienation, competition, and antagonism.</p>
<p>Likewise, we see each movement as working toward similar a solution to these problems -- a qualitative change of social relationships and institutions to be more cooperative, nonhierarchical, democratic, intentional, intimate, and authentic.</p>
<p>Despite this common ground between the two movements, we see unfortunate prejudices, misunderstandings and misconceptions between different forms of anarchism and other forms of liberation.</p>
<p>To help bridge these gaps between the two movements, we seek to:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain and deepen the understanding of our common ideals of liberation from any form of oppression.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explain and deepen the understanding of each individuals purpose</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help facilitate interactions between anarchists who want to participate in a free exchange of information and ideas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help facilitate interactions between all forms of activism and find a common ground.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
The Pasadena Anarchist Collective does not discriminate against different nationalities or forms of expression. We support all forms of nonhierarchical, democratic, intentional forms of activism. The underlying goal of the Pasadena Anarchist Collective is to combine the efforts of a wide range of individuals into one unified action.</p>

<p>87.74.52.158 04:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC) Don Quarrie is regarded as one of the finest sprinters in the history of track and field. He is also considered the greatest runner around the bend. Don is a world class athlete who is not only respected for his athletic ability but also his discipline and his demeanor on and off the field.</p>
<p>Quarrie competed in five Olympic games. This is an exceptional accomplishment for a sprinter. The high point of his career came in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. Don captured the gold in the 200m and the silver in the 100m. His silver finish was just 0.01 seconds behind the winner. While training for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Don met in a car accident. He was able to recover and make the team and ended up with the Bronze medal in the 200m.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Games is where Quarrie had some of his best performances. He became the first male athlete to earn six gold medals in these competitions. For three consecutive games, Don won the gold medal in the 100m. He won the 200m in the 1970 games and successfully defended his title in the 1974 games. Don was well on his way to winning a third gold in the 200m but he suffered cramps in his semi-final heat and was not able to advance to the final round.</p>
<p>Don's outstanding career would not be complete without being a world record holder. In 1971, Don broke the world record for the 200m. He ran a blistering 19.80 seconds at the Pan American Games in Cali, Columbia. In 1976, he tied the world record for the 100m with a time of 9.9. With all his accomplishments, Don always maintained a good natured attitude and was admired and respected by his peers.</p>
<p>Quarrie has received recognition both on and off the field, a statue of him is proudly positioned at the entrance to Jamaica's National Stadium. There is also a school (Donald Quarrie High School) that bears his name in Eastern Kingston. Musical artists have also sung the praises for Don, "Tribute to Donald Quarrie" is a reggae song written by Joe Gibbs and The Guerillas. Many Jamaicans still refer to him in casual conversation, citing his speed in comparison to an event. Comments like, "I was running so fast, not even Don Quarrie could have caught me that night." are common among Jamaican Nationals.</p>
<p>Don has long since retired from competition but he is still active in the sporting world. He has been working as a sports agent and was Inger Miller’s manager in the 1990's. He also finds time to give back to the community. Don has also given time to help deliver holiday presents to hospitalized children.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.myspace.com/barramundisundi" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/barramundisundi" rel="nofollow">Barramundi Sundi</a> is a gathering of friends and acquaintances at Oatley pub every Sunday for a drink. The Barramundi Sundi has been in the hearts of the regular Sunday drinkers for many years, but it wasn't made official until Sunday, 22 October 2006. A landmark day for the drunks in the top corner of the pub when one Mr B. Elliot donated his socks and the first Inaugural Barramundi Sundi Award was created. A moment that will go down in history, and will always hold a special place in the hearts of all of us that support the Barramundi's cause and purpose in life.</p>
<p>The Inaugural Barramundi Sundi Award is not won easily there are various qualities and attributes that must be displayed before receiving the award. Qualities that are not easily acquired, some that may take years of practice and vigorous training. Some of these qualities are:</p>
<p>The ability to survive the weekend with minimal sleep (sometimes without shelter)</p>
<p>To be able to drink on Sunday free of concern about work the next day</p>
<p>To lose the ability to think for yourself</p>
<p>These are just a few of the attributes that the Barramundi Sundi brings out of people, some of which didn't know that they had it in them. Most importantly is that the Barramundi Sundi doesn't discriminate, anybody can be nominated, and anybody can win, and everybody can have a good time. It doesn't matter how you get there, whether you chose the natural way or the minger way, all the best.</p>
<p>The Barramundi Sundi isn't for everyone, but once you have taken the bait and had your first sweet taste of the Barramundi, you’re hooked forever.</p>

<p>Artists: Trey Spruance, Trevor Dunn, Danny Heifetz, Eyvind Kang, Bär McKinnon, Phil Franklin, and John Wayne Law</p>
<p>CD Mimicry (WOM-002) 5/2000</p>
<p>A limited edition release CD. This CD is a great illustration of just how fantastically shit-hot the Secret Chiefs 3 are live. With a 60-minute setlist made up primarily of songs from their first two albums (The First Grand Constitution &amp; Bylaws and Hurqala: The Second Grand Constitution &amp; Bylaws).</p>
<p>"Set Two" the first track is a medley made up of "Adept Chamber Of The Magian Tavern", "Inn Of Three Doors", "Theme From 23d Nade", "Inn Of Three Doors", "1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4", "Combat For The Angel", "Theory Of The Supreme Ones", and "Mary Of Magdalen". This 21-minute track is a profoundly good example of everything SC3.</p>
<p>"Renunciation" and "Jabalqa/Jabarsa" are groovy Centro-Asian numbers and again show the band's perfect performance technique. "Zulfikar" and the Morricone-inspired "Assassin's Blade" again are impecably performed. The recording quality is not great, one gets the impression that this was initally intended only as a bootleg live recording - albeit a very good one - not as a proper CD release hence is limited release in a simple cardboard sleeve.</p>
<p>"Ciocarlia", a song that has never appeared on any album, but performed regularly, is the only track here substantially different musically from the rest of the CD. It is a traditional piece with it's roots firmly in Bulgarian and Hungarian music. An intense and joyous way to close the show.</p>
<p>Outstanding live recording of an important American band fusing rock, metal, Middle Eastern/Centro-Asian, surf and the avant-garde.</p>

<p>Zubeida Malik is a correspondent for the Today programme, and has also reported for Newsnight. She joined the BBC in 1994.</p>
<p>During her time on the Today programme she has reported from Europe, Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. After September 11 she was one of the first journalists to arrive in Pakistan and report on the aftermath. She reported from there and Afghanistan for three months and was the only Western woman to get an interview with the Taliban during that time, before and after their fall. One of her many reports at the time included interviews which predicted ethnic conflict in the country, guerilla warfare and the rise of the warlords.</p>
<p>Zubeida has carried out many investigations for the Today programme. She made a ground breaking series on children dealing crack cocaine. At the height of the fuel protests she exposed how drivers who carried on working were being intimidated by union members, with their families being threatened.</p>
<p>She is the only broadcast Journalist to have interviewed the young men who were innocent of killing Damilola Taylor.</p>
<p>Her interview with the runaway 16 year-old Bobby Kelly, led to questions being asked in the House of commons and a change in the law.</p>
<p>Zubeida has been reporting on Bin laden and Al Qaeda since the nineties; she was one of the first journalists to look into extremist groups holding secret military training camps and encouraging young men to become jihadis. Recently Zubeida revealed how hundreds of Mujahideen are flocking to Iraq, as the country has become a 'new Afghanistan' for them. She's also one of the few people to have interviewed one of Bin Laden's relatives.</p>
<p>She has interviewed key figures for the BBC, including Kofi Anan, President Musharraf, Tony Blair, Prince Saud Al Faisal, Archbishop Tutu, and the spiritual leader of Hamas Sheikh Yassin, amongst many others.</p>

<p>Super Saiyan 5 is the highest confirmed level of Super Saiyan to appier in the animes. The only person shown to become a Super Saiyan 5. This was done in GT with the fusion of Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Gogeta in his Super Saiyan 5 state.This stage is seen in Dragon Ball GT, where Goku and Vegeta both faced off against Yi Xing Long. With the fusion dance, they successfully created Super Saiyan 5 Gogeta. Unlike Vegeta and Goku, Gogeta's SSJ5 form has brown fur and fiery red hair, instead of the opposite. He is also the only character in the series with glitter in his energy aura, and is the only Super Saiyan to feature blue eyes. Compared to his more serious Super Saiyan form, Gogeta is somewhat more cocky and wacky, toying with the evil Shenron instead of easily defeating him. While at this stage, Gogeta is easily the strongest character in the series, surpassing SSJ4 Goku's, Vegeta's, and even the evil dragon's strength. The fusion lasted only 10-15 minutes rather than the usual 30 because of the immense power Gogeta possessed.</p>

<p>Anise Tatlin is a fictional character in Tales of the Abyss. She fights using a doll named Tokunaga. With many different accessories, Tokunaga can be transformed into a variety of different Easter Egg characters, such as Presea(Tales of Symphonia), Cless(Tales of the Abyss), and more.</p>
<p>In battle, Anise acts as a melee fighter and a mage in one. She is slow, yet powerful(Much like Presea from Tales of Symphonia).</p>
<p>Though usually cheerful and childish, Anise can sometimes show a mature side, giving other characters helpful advice. Anise hopes to marry into money, and seems to be willing to do anything to win over anyone who is rich enough. Throughout the game, she has many different "crushes" on any male who has money.</p>

<p>Born on May 12 of an unknown year, The Banker is played by "Himself", as stated on the end credits. He has, on occasion, talked to the player via the Bakelite telephone on the contestant's desk. The character was called "The Dealer" in pre-publicity for the show; evidently, the name was changed before recording started (possibly to avoid any connotations of drugs, though the name "Banker" also appears to be used in other countries' versions so the use of "Dealer" here may have simply been a mistake by the Channel 4 Press Office). Channel 4's website referred to him as such though on their listings page until April 12 when after a number of complaints, including an organised campaign by posters to the forum of the website Cook'd and Bomb'd, the text was changed to say The Banker.</p>
<p>The identity of The Banker has not been revealed - one theory is that it is the series producer Glenn Hugill, although he has refused to either confirm or deny this in the past, continuing to refer to The Banker in the third person. However, it is clear that whoever is "playing" The Banker has some considerable improvisational skills, as the offers and Banker's banter frequently respond to something the contestant has done or said during gameplay. Also, when contestants are handed the phone The Banker frequently is able to make them dissolve into hysterics with his unheard chat. This would suggest that Glenn is indeed the public voice of The Banker, as he has had previous acting experience.</p>
<p>The Daily Mirror and Jo Whiley reported on April 3, 2006 that the actual offers made by The Banker were calculated by Glenn and two 'Executives' (believed to be executive producers Richard Osman and Richard Hague) but that Glenn has the final decision.</p>
<p>On March 9, 2006, contestant Paula H - a barber - enquired about The Banker's hair, to which Noel replied, "I don't think he has much". Other traits have also been suggested for The Banker, such as the fact that he is a bachelor, he refers to his mother on many occasions, and that, according to many of the contestants, he has a "nice voice, very Oxbridge", the character of The Banker does not necessarily bear any relation to the person "playing" him.</p>
<p>On March 10, 2006, he spoke to a member of the audience, named Shaun, who had been giving his own analysis on the game but made a rather unrealistic prediction of The Banker's next offer. He ridiculed him by making him say out loud "I, Shaun, will never be a banker. £35,000 was a silly thing to say. The Banker is always right!"</p>
<p>On March 23, 2006, contestant Dave Cheeseman mentioned about Chinese New Year. The Banker said that whilst Dave was born in the year of the dog, the banker himself was born in the Chinese year of the dragon. This gives a clue to his age, probably 42 or 54 years old - though the Banker's later reference to almost making the Munich Olympics (1972) as a swimmer suggests the age of the "character" may be 54. Although The Banker's speaking voice has never been heard on-screen, he has been clearly heard laughing several times to date, when Noel has held the telephone within audible distance to his microphone on his shirt. The first time was during the end of the aforementioned Nick Bain's 1p show.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2006, The banker gave contestant Lucy a mini 'Deal or No Deal' box with 50 on the front. This was because it was her 50th show. The mini box also contained her name where the amount usually goes and a poem saying how The Banker wished that she win a penny.</p>
<p>In March 2006, The Guardian described The Banker as 'a cult character in the making and no mistake' and included him in their hotlist. On April 1, 2006, the end credits stated that The Banker's name is Richard Oldman. This however, was an April Fool's Day joke; Richard Oldman can be segmented to 'Rich (H)ard Old Man'. Alternatively, this could be an in-joke reference to the two executive producers, both called Richard.</p>
<p>On April 13, 2006, the Banker gave an offer of £4,100 to contestant Maxine. She started saying how the Banker was actually quite 'sexy' because he had quick wit and humour, she liked older men, and he was rich ("what more could a woman want"). At that point the phone rang again, and The Banker changed his offer from £4,100 to £6,100, which was a first for Deal or No Deal. Maxine declined the offer and left with £10,000 at the end of the show - the amount in her box.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2006, Holy Saturday, Gabrielle won £1,000. When she revealed that the money was going to charity, the phone rang and The Banker said (three times) that just that once that he would double the winnings to £2,000. This was a Deal or No Deal first, and shows that the Banker has a 'Compassionate Streak', as Noel put it.</p>
<p>On May 6, 2006, The Banker produced another poem, in honour of Morris' fondness for speaking in rhyme when he opened boxes in other people's games, called "Ode to Morris".</p>
<p>On May 12, 2006, The Banker revealed that that day was his birthday, as well as that of the contestant's mother. It is unsure whether May 12th is The Banker's birthday, due to the fact that three shows are filmed per day, so his birthday could be several days - even weeks - before that. That said, Noel's birthday celebrations took place on the show due to be transmitted on that day. The Banker said he was 'full of cakes and fine wine' but had not received any presents.</p>
<p>On May 13, 2006, The Banker jokingly offered contestant Max "2 Weeks of Therapy". He also revealed that "the position of Mrs Banker is currently vacant!"</p>
<p>On May 15, 2006, The Banker said that he would offer double his offer if contestant Simon could guess it correctly. He guessed correctly at £2,800, the same amount that he said a previous contestant, Susie, would get, thus the offer doubled to £5,600.</p>
<p>At some time in the past it was revealed that The Banker enjoyed the Eurovision Song Contest, this was taken further with the Eurovision-themed show on May 20, 2006.</p>
<p>On May 25, 2006, At the time of the banker's offer, Noel Edmonds questioned the East Wing on what would be the offer given to contestant Rich. When the banker did make the call, he criticised the East Wing and labelled them as "fools" due to the fact that they could not guess his offer. As a result, the offer was £5,146, an offer that seemed impossible to guess.</p>
<p>On May 26, 2006, the banker made a "joke" offer of "£2 and a copy of the rules" to contestant June, due to her apparent confusion at how the game worked. Fortunately, she had dealt earlier at £23,000.</p>
<p>On June 2, 2006, the banker gave a present of a bunch of 22 red roses to contestant Stevie, thanking her for the players' games she destroyed by having high value amounts in her boxes.</p>
<p>On June 6, 2006, the Banker offered contestant Suzanne, instead of a monetary first offer, the opportunity to swap her box, after the first 5 boxes, with any other box she had a 'feeling' for. Suzanne accepted the swap, and swapped box 19 for box 3. The Banker did this because he believed she wouldn't walk at the first offer, and he saw her as a kindred spirit, because he used to be a great swimmer (apparently), and Suzanne was an Olympic-class swimmer before retiring to teach young children. The Banker said he was known as 'The Wet Rocket' because at school other children would throw his abacus into the school pond, and he would dive in for it so quickly. She opened Box 19, her original box, in the third round, it contained £500.</p>
<p>On June 12, 2006, Carlton said The Banker "sounds like the Scream man". A week earlier, James had also told The Banker he sounded like "the voice from Scream".</p>
<p>On June 16, 2006 (the 200th show), the banker said that he used to be a psychic, as the day's contestant, Ron was a hypnotherapist, and predicted that he was going have the worst round in the show's history. However this prediction was proven wrong as Ron took out three blues in the next three boxes. On the same show, the banker asked to talk to a member of the audience because he was angry with Noel. He spoke to Georgina, who told Ron the offer.</p>
<p>On June 16, 2006, the banker offered contestant Chrissie £8,853, which he claimed was equal to the height of Mount Everest in metres. Chrissie had earlier said that she had climbed 19,500 feet up the mountain.</p>
<p>On June 18, 2006, (Fathers Day) Noel asked the Banker whether he had any offspring off his own. The Banker replied by saying he had one estranged son, when asked why he was estranged the Banker said that his son was a charity worker.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2006, during Bianca's game The Banker offered a swap again instead of a monatary first offer, due to the fact that she had box 22 on the table, and it had contained £250,000 the last two times it had been there. She declined the swap. During the second offer the Banker asked to speak to Bianca's mother who was in the audience. They talked for a while and then she put the phone down and said the offer was £10,000. Noel said that she could have made the offer up, so he picked up the phone and 'dialed' the Banker. Noel said "is it true you offered her £50,000!" £10,000 was the offer, and she declined the offer. It was unclear what the Banker's phone number was, but it was presumably just for show. During this show, Noel referred to the banter between Bianca's mother and The Banker by calling her "the potential seventh Mrs Banker", perhaps implying that the Banker has been married six times already. A second wife was mentioned during Debbie's game, though this was presumably as a joke by The Banker, who, through Noel, said: "My second wife was called Mina. I was mean, and she was meaner!"</p>
<p>On July 21, 2006 the Banker offered Naqiyah £7,777 due to her passion of multiples of 7. She responded by saying that she was there to play the game and the money was a bonus and so it seemed she would No Deal at that point. So, before Noel could finish the question, the Banker rang again to increase the offer to £14,014. The Banker rang again before the question could be completed, causing Noel to wonder if he had "holiday fever" (referring to the break the show was about to have) or if he just wanted to torment Naqiyah. This time he just called to state that he was looking forward to hearing her response. After this call, Noel took the phone off the hook so the Banker could not ring up again and he could finally ask "Deal or No Deal?", to which Naqiyah answered "Deal". On the same show, Naqiyah was also offered a swap as the first offer, but never accepted it.</p>
<p>On the same day, July 21, 2006, Naqiyah also said after speaking to him that the Banker sounded just like Lance, who was another contestant in the West Wing. Lance is perhaps best known for his broad, posh accent. When Lance played (August 30, 2006), the banker called Lance "my doppelganger". Lance also suggested that the Banker was a boy he had been to school with many years earlier, whom he referred to as "Meany Minor". In response to this, the Banker claimed instead to be "Meany Major".</p>
<p>On July 22, 2006 the Banker said to Noel that, as it was the last show before the summer break, he had a present for every contestant on that show. It came in the form of a poem saying how he would have more fun than them on his holiday and that he'd come back meaner than ever after the break. He also gave each contestant a bookmark which said "This bookmark belongs to..." on one side and "the next member of the 1p club" on the other. Coincidentally, that day's player Giorgio Fellicini did leave with the 1p.</p>

<p>C Stamp™ modules are microcontrollers (self contained single chip computers) that are designed for use in a wide variety of applications. Projects that form an embedded system, meaning that they have some level of intelligence derived from hardware-software interaction, can use a C Stamp module as the controller. The architecture of the C Stamp emphasizes high pin count, large memory space, and high speed. The C Stamp uses a subset of the standard C programming language called WC. The computational power of the C Stamp is derived from its set of commands, standard function calls, and software. The C Stamp supports floating point numbers, unlimited nesting, and recursion, and it comes with well thought out and pedagogically sound examples developed by College professors. This ensures that doing projects with the C Stamp is a powerful and enjoyable experience. Although the C Stamp has the form of a DIP chip, it is in fact a small Printed Circuit Board that contains the essential elements of a microcomputer system:</p>
<p>A CPU with integrated non-volatile program memory, volatile data memory, and non-volatile data memory A clock A power supply External input and output</p>
<p>The C Stamp language incorporates many common microcontroller functions, including PWM, serial communications, I²C communications, communications with common LCD modules, driving of servo motors, sine wave frequencies generation, and analog to digital values conversion of electrical signals.</p>
<p>A user can connect a battery to a C Stamp and have a complete system. A connection to a PC allows the programmer to download software to the C Stamp, which is stored in the processor's non-volatile program memory. This memory stays programmed until it is erased and reprogrammed (the memory remains intact even when the power is removed).</p>

This subject was brought to my attention by an art zine called [PROCESS] <a href="http://www.thisisprocess.com" class="external free" title="http://www.thisisprocess.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisisprocess.com</a>. It deals with deconstucting what exists to it's core elements to really see what gives something value. As we are usually bombarded with the glossy, finished product of everything, we tend to disreguard the message or meaning of things becuase we don't get a chance to see the humanity in it's creation, the flaws that make it unique, and not just another carbon copy. Even the meaningless can hold intrigue as long as it has a unique quality to it, which, with mass production of things (and art) can take the back seat.</p>

<p>It was the year 1963 that this man came to be. Peter Ferguson Clouse grew up in the small town of Granville Ohio. He leaved in the heart of Granville where he became a star baseball and football player. His passion for sports led him to his career in chiropractics. When he was in highschool he suffered from severe neck stiffness. He said that "It hindered my ability to be a better athelete and a better person". When he played for the Aces he had 12 touch downs as a senior in football and 8 homeruns in baseball. When at last, Clouse finished highschool, he went to local, Ohio University in Athens. He studied to become a chiropracter so he could help people like himself. In his senior year, he found the love of his life, Ms. Carla Waters. She had plans of moving to South Carolina to teach elementary school. Upon moving to SC Peter Clouse found property for purchase to start his Chiropractic practice. October 1986, Clouse Chiropractic Clinic came to be. It is the most profitable business in all of Monicks Corner, South Carolina. Peter Clouse now lives happily with his wife Carla, daughter Clarice, son Peter in North Charleston.</p>

<p>Naruto (ナルト, Naruto? romanized as NARUTO in Japan) is a manga by Masashi Kishimoto with an anime TV series adaptation. Its main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is a loud, hyperactive, adolescent ninja who constantly searches for approval and recognition, as well as to become Hokage, who is acknowledged as the leader and strongest ninja in the village.</p>
<p>The manga was first published in Japan, by Shueisha, in the 43rd issue of the Shonen Jump magazine in 1999. In TV Asahi's latest top 100 Anime Ranking, Naruto ranked 34th on the list. VIZ Media publishes a translated version in the American Shonen Jump, and has translated roughly a third of the series. Naruto has become VIZ Media's best-selling manga series.[1]</p>
<p>The anime series, produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex, premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo network and the anime satellite television network, Animax from October 3, 2002 and is currently still being aired. Viz also licensed the anime for North American production. Naruto debuted on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block on September 10, 2005, at 9:00 p.m. EST in the United States, and on YTV's Bionix on September 16, 2005, at 9:30 p.m. EST (since changed to 8:00 p.m.) in Canada. Naruto began showing on Jetix in the UK at 8.00 p.m. on July 22, 2006.</p>

<p>Growth and popularity The series' length and popularity is comparable to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, another popular action-oriented shōnen manga. Naruto is the second-most popular ongoing shōnen series in Japan, behind One Piece.</p>
<p>Since its creation, Naruto has spawned a large number of fansites that contain detailed information, guides, and active forums. Some of the first and most popular sites targeted at English speaking audiences were established shortly after the first English manga volume was released in August 2003.</p>
<p>Prior to the anime's North American debut in 2005, several scanlation and fansub groups translated the series and made it available for free download on the internet. Despite North American companies' perceived tendency to prosecute fansubbing groups more frequently than Japanese companies[2], there are some that have continued to translate new Naruto episodes due to the extremely large gap between the English and Japanese versions. Indicative of Naruto's continued internet popularity are the episodes subtitled by the Dattebayo fansub group, which are downloaded over 100,000 times within the first couple days, almost always surpassing 200,000 downloads within their first weeks.[3]</p>
<p>Like many other manga and anime titles, Naruto has also spawned its own collectible card game.</p>
<p>Volume 7 of the manga has recently won a Quill Award for best graphic novel in North America.[4]</p>

Anime details See also: List of Naruto episodes and List of Naruto media Although it debuted some time after the manga, the anime quickly caught up, since one anime episode usually covers around one and a half manga chapters. To prevent overlapping, the anime's producers tend to organize content from the manga chapters into long, uneventful sections followed by short bursts of action, sometimes adding filler content in between. Currently, in order to give the manga time to get ahead, the anime is only showing filler episodes.</p>
<p>The anime generally remains true to the manga, usually changing only minor details (causes of death, loss of limbs, and other injuries have been lessened in the anime) or expanding on parts skipped by the manga, such as the fight between Tenten and Temari. The filler arcs, though unreferenced in the manga (save for a few scant scenes), deal with the breaks between manga volumes, which covers a short period before the Sasuke Retrieval arc and several months before the time skip. The filler arcs tend to cover the supporting characters, occasionally giving insight into an otherwise rarely seen character.</p>
<p>New episodes, animated by Studio Pierrot, air weekly on TV Tokyo in Japan during the Golden Time slot (Japan's equivalent of prime time in the US). As of October 5, 2006, it has moved to Thursday nights, beginning with a ninety-minute special followed by a regular episode [citation needed]. The series has also spawned three movies, Naruto the Movie, Naruto the Movie 2 and Naruto the Movie 3. The first two are available on DVD.</p>
<p><br />
Anime filler episodes By the time the Sasuke Retrieval arc ended in the anime (episode 135), the series was at a point where it was quickly gaining on the manga, its source material. At the conclusion of this arc, the anime immediately switched to anime-only filler episodes to allow the manga to broaden the gap once more. Most of the filler arcs are stand-alone stories, with a few being several episodes long.</p>
<p><br />
English-language broadcast On September 10, 2005, Naruto had its hour-long premiere in the U.S. on Cartoon Network's Toonami. The first episode of Naruto premiered in Canada on YTV on September 16, 2005. In Australia and New Zealand it premiered on Cartoon Network on September 27, 2006 at 6:00 p.m. AEST. Naruto is also available on Toonami Jetstream, Cartoon Network's broadband video service.[5]</p>
<p><br />
English localization In its English anime release, Naruto was aired with a TV-PG rating in the US and a PG rating in Canada. References to alcoholism, Japanese cultural differences, mild language, mild sexual situations, and even blood and death remain in the English version, though reduced in some instances.[6] The manga was edited in a similar fashion. Recent episodes, such as Jiraiya's debut, have been given a TV-PG-DS rating.</p>

Plot overview Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow. Further information: Plot of Naruto, Plot of Naruto II, and List of Naruto story arcs. Twelve years before the events at the focus of the series, the nine-tailed demon fox attacked Konohagakure. It was a powerful demon indeed; a single swing of one of its nine tails would raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. It raised chaos and slaughtered many people, until the leader of the Leaf Village –- the Fourth Hokage –- defeated it by sacrificing his own life to seal the demon inside a newly-born child, whose origins are as yet unknown. That child's name was Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
<p>The Fourth Hokage was celebrated as a hero for sealing the demon fox away. He wanted Naruto to be respected in a similar light by being the containment vessel for the demon fox. The village he grew up in, however, mostly shunned Naruto; they regarded him as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood.</p>
<p>A decree made by the Third Hokage made it so that the other villagers were forbidden to mention the event to anyone, even to their own children. However, this did not stop them from treating Naruto like an outcast. Although their children did not specifically know why their parents treated Naruto the way they did, they learned through example to despise the boy. As a result, Naruto grew up as an orphan in a lonesome atmosphere without friends, family, or acknowledgement. He could not force people to befriend him, so he sought acknowledgement and attention the only way he knew – through pranks and mischief. However, that soon changed after Naruto graduated from the Ninja Academy by using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to save his teacher, Iruka Umino, from the renegade ninja Mizuki. That encounter gave Naruto two insights: that he was the container of the demon fox, and that there was someone (Iruka and the Third Hokage, initially) who actually cared about him. His graduation opened a gateway to the events and people that would change and define his world and his way of the ninja for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Naruto maintains a balance between drama and comedy, with plenty of action interspersed. It follows Naruto and his friends' personal growth and development as ninja, and emphasizes their interactions with each other and the influence of their backgrounds on their personalities. Naruto finds two friends and comrades in Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, two fellow young ninja who are assigned with him to form a three-person team under a very experienced sensei named Kakashi Hatake. Naruto also confides in other characters as well that he has met through the Chunin Exam. They learn new abilities, get to know each other and other villagers better, and experience a coming-of-age journey as Naruto dreams of becoming the Hokage of the Leaf Village.</p>
<p>Naruto places strong emphasis on character development. Almost all outcomes are a result of decisions, character, and personality; very few things happen just because of chance. At first, emphasis is placed on Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who are the members of Team 7. However, other characters are developed, such as Kakashi, Guy, and Jiraiya, as well as Naruto's peers in the other Genin teams and other villages.</p>
<p>Several major villains came into play as well, the first being Zabuza Momochi, a missing-nin from the Hidden Mist Village, and his partner Haku. Later, in the Chunin Exam arc, Orochimaru is introduced as an S-Class missing-nin at the top of the Leaf Village's most wanted list. Later, a mysterious organization called Akatsuki begins to pursue Naruto in order to take the demon fox inside him.</p>
<p>Spoilers end here.</p>
<p>Characters</p>
<p>Team 7.Main article: List of characters in Naruto Naruto has a large and colorful cast of characters, running a gamut of detailed histories and complex personalities and allowing many of them their fair share in the spotlight; they are also seen to grow and mature with the series, as it spans several years. Fittingly enough for a coming-of-age saga, Naruto's world constantly expands and thickens, and his social relations are no exception -- during his introduction he has only his teacher and the village's leader for sympathetic figures, but as the story progresses, more and more people become a part of his story.</p>
<p>The students at the Ninja Academy, where the story begins, are split up into teams of three after their graduation and become Genin, or low-class ninjas. Each team is assigned an experienced sensei, or teacher. These core teams form a basis for the characters' interactions later in the series, where characters are chosen for missions for their team's strength and complementary skills; Naruto's Team 7 becomes the social frame where Naruto is acquainted with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, and their sensei Kakashi Hatake, also called the "copy ninja" for copying thousands of ninja techniques with his Sharingan eye, forming the core of his world-in-the-making. The other three-man teams of his former classmates form another such layer, as Naruto connects with them to various degrees, learning of their motives, vulnerabilities and aspirations and often relating them to his own. The groups of threes are not limited to the comrades Naruto's age – groups in the story in general come in threes and multiples of three with very few exceptions.</p>
<p>Sensei-student relationships play a significant role in the series; Naruto has a number of mentors with whom he trains and learns, most notably Jiraiya and Kakashi Hatake, and there are often running threads of tradition and tutelage binding together several generations. These role models provide guidance for their students not only in the ninja arts but also in a number of Japanese aesthetics and philosophical ideals. Techniques, ideals, and mentalities noticeably run in families, Naruto often being exposed to the abilities and traditions of generation-old clans in his village when friends from his own age group demonstrate them, or even achieve improvements of their own; it is poignantly noted that Naruto's generation is particularly talented.</p>
<p>Many of the greater lingering mysteries of the series are questions of character motives and identity. The legacy of Naruto's parents, the goals that guide Kabuto Yakushi, the objective of the mysterious organization Akatsuki and the identity of its mysterious leader – these are only a few of the fundamental unanswered questions of "who" and, by proxy, "why" currently at the core of the series. The story is remarkably character-driven; the theme of causality runs inherently throughout the series as characters reciprocate for their past actions and relationships. In this respect, characters' respective destinies are very much intertwined, and large emphasis is placed on comradeship and 'bonds' between the community or individual.</p>
<p>Character names often borrow from Japanese mythology, folklore and literature (such as the names borrowed from the folk-tale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari), or are otherwise elaborate puns; often there is a noticeable influence of the story behind the name shouldered by the character.[7]</p>
