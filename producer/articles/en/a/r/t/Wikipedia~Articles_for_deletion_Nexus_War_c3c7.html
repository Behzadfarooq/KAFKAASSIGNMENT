<li><b>Keep</b> - People are far too eager to sling around "non-notable", when you've got articles on quite a large number of more "non-notable" topics. Nexus War is extremely innovative for a browser-based game and has gained a large number of players in a very short period of time, and will only continue to do so. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 18:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Nexus War has gathered a lot of players already, and the community is still growing swiftly. The game is very entertaining, and are actually better than some browser games that I know of. There's little doubt that it would be swarmed by browser-based MMOG fans. --Kamalia Timandre 19:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> How about you do some research instead of just saying Delete as norm for everything. Its a very active community with about 8000 users so far and its only just gone into Beta. --Rogue
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If this can be verified, wouldn't this tend to make the article notable? I don't know what a large player base for a beta is, but this sounds like a significant number. If so, certainly criteria according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> will follow; should we delete the article until then, or try to stay ahead of the curve and keep developing the article, since it's already been started? <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 09:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article as it stands is at worst a badly written stub on a worthy topic. I hardly find that reason for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> Its a fairley new game and thus dosn't have much wrote on it yet, I've been looking through the other browser based games edit history and most of them started off with even less information than this, if the lack of statistical information bothers you that much, then go find it out and add it to the article. --<a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeirleach_4434.html" title="User:Meirleach">Meirleach</a> 21:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're missing my point, look at say one of the earlier Urban Dead edits - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urban_Dead&amp;oldid=19720476" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urban_Dead&amp;oldid=19720476" rel="nofollow">here</a> Its tiny, not very well written and contains very little information, now look at the current page <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead</a> it contains information on the player base, how many active accounts their are, and several of the interesting game mechanics. My point is that articals don't start off perfect, most of them start off as small poor quality stubs and are expanded upon by interested wikipaedians, they need time to grow. Go back to the earliest version of most articles in browser based games and you will see exactly the same thing. --<a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeirleach_4434.html" title="User:Meirleach">Meirleach</a> 22:15, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Meirleach makes a good point. It's disappointing to me when there is the appearance of being automatically dismissive of an article whose merits may not be immediately apparent. Peephole, your questions are worthy of consideration, but they are subjective: What makes a game notable or innovative? Whose coverage sets the standard for noteworthiness? And a developer's first game could indeed be noteworthy, so precedent needn't be an issue. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 22:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This afd isn't specifically based on the contents of the article but on whether the subject deserves a wikipedia article or not. My questions were indeed very subjective and that is why the subject needs independent, external and reliable coverage, which doesn't seem to exist at the moment. So the article should be deleted. If the subject is truly notable and worthy of an article, then it will eventually be treated by a reliable source and then the article can be recreated. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 01:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Regarding re-creation of the article, see my comment under Rogue's above. And my questions were not rhetorical: What criteria define notability or innovation? Where, specifically, should we be looking for worthy coverage? I generally get my own initial information through the less significant sources like blogs and forums, and look to Wikipedia itself as one of the significant sources. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 10:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> And as I have said before, most of the other articles in browser based games started off in nearly exactly the same condition, why weren't they all deleted? If this browser based game isn't deserving of an article why are the rest of them? Almost all of us have agreed that the article needs work, and if you look at the earliest versions of just about any of the browser based games most of them weren't 'notable' either, but they were given a chance and some time and they grew into 'notable' articles. --<a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeirleach_4434.html" title="User:Meirleach">Meirleach</a> 17:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

But this discussion should be on this articles merits, not those others. Oh and the problem isn't that this wikipedia article isn't notable but the subject (the game) has no notability and thus doesn't adhere to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 17:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: The games only been in beta for 3 months and already has 8000 players and as for innovation, most browser based MMORPGs seem to either focus on running a big empire(Dark Throne, battlemaster) or running your character around levelling up killing things (Shartak, UrbanDead and Runescape), Nexus War is a very interesting fusion of the two due to the faction system.</li>

<dd>It has the more normal RPG elements, like finding weapons, gaining experience and levelling up, buy skills and all the usual RPG fair, but it also contains elements of the more strategic RPGs, you have to keep your weapon stocks up, so your faction members actually have stuff to attack with, you can hold areas by building barricades, make your faction bonuses stronger by infusing squares on the map.</dd>

<dd>But unlike games like DarkThrone you don't do this by yourself, due to the games design its impossible, so if you want lots of faction bonuses, you have to organise the other players to infuse, if you want to attack someone you can't just click on their name and obliterate them, you have to find willing players in your faction and co-ordinate them, you want tons of guns and ammo, you have to keep players with crafting skills supplied or even forget that bit and make an alliance with another faction where they supply you with weapons in exchange for protection.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: And therin lies the problem with browser based games, most accepted by the wiki reliable sources dont review browser based games, its very unlikey that you'll find a review of Nexus War in a newspaper or gaming magazine, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> has "The software is/was innovative, significant, or influential in some specific way, and this is verifiable from reliable sources independent of the software developer." You will be hard pushed to find a reliable source for any browser based game, due to their nature they don't fit properly in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the two articles I linked above dont meet those two, which by the way are not policies, only guidelines, guidelines which due to the nature of browser based games, don't apply to them very well.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Those same arguments were used for webcomics and internet memes. Until it was discovered that notable memes or webcmics ones were actually covered by reliable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're being a bit disingenuous. Browser-based games aren't typically covered by mainstream press, nor do I expect them to be. This doesn't make a particular game any less notable -- although perhaps it makes it less likely that <i>you</i> will have heard of it, which I suspect is the real issue here. As far as verifiability goes, I agree that it would be better for there to be abundant coverage by mainstream media sources, but the fact that this is a <i>web-based</i> game puts us in the unique position of being able to actually click on the link and see it with your own eyeballs. Would you argue that items such as the <a href="../../../w/3/c/W3c.html" title="W3c">W3c</a> article shouldn't be on Wikipedia? -<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrummerx_ef6b.html" title="User:Grummerx">grummerx</a> 20:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: They're not typically covered, because...they're not typically notable. W3c definatly belongs on wikipedia and guess what, it is extensivly covered by reliable sources. No one is contesting Nexus War doesn't exist but wikipedia just isn't a collection of links. So the sites that have an article should be notable sites. And Nexus War doesn't seem to have an exceptional number of users, it barely has any google hits, alexa barely notes any traffic and there are no reliable external sources covering it, so I don't see how it is notable.--<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 21:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Equating Alexa traffic to notability is a spurious argument.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please read my comment again and notice that I wasn't addressing the W3c's notability, but rather its verifiability.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The question isn't "why should we keep it", but rather "why should we <i>delete</i> it?" The onus is on you to provide a satisfactory reason for deletion, which as far as I can see you have yet to do. The only criteria for deletion that I have yet to see comes entirely from proposed guidelines, and the assertion of "notability" itself can be seen to be NPOV. While your point of view is that a browser-based game is "not notable", from the point of view of thousands of very active players, it is quite notable. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#There_is_a_lack_of_objective_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> article itself states under the "Arguments against deleting articles for non-notability" section that "'Non-notable' is generally a non-NPOV designation."</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: "the burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain." My point of view isn't that a browser-based game isn't notable, it is that this particular browser-based game isn't notable. And indeed notability is a point of view, that's why we need reliable, verifable and independent sources and that's also why there are guidelines for notability like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the proposed <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 17:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Without getting into an argument over whether gaming press coverage is necessary / sufficient for notability, I'd like to point out the game's virtues. To my knowledge, persistent-world 100-way capture the flag hasn't been done before. The game mechanics blend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Of_the_Red_Dragon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Of_the_Red_Dragon" rel="nofollow">LoRD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewars_2002" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradewars_2002" rel="nofollow">TW:2K2</a> in a way that is, in my estimation, fundamentally new. Other MMO's have done roleplaying and PvP, but long-campaign strategy (and the community it begets) is the emerging paradigm in the genre. This game does it better than its browser-based cousins, not to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft" rel="nofollow">most popular game in the world</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Hi, I've contributed a great deal to this page (though as an exopedian it's not that obvious), and I'd like to vote keep because I believe the reasons for deletion don't fit in this case. It certainly doesn't fit <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as a browser based game, and it is notable regardless of its coverage in the press purely because of the sheer amount of players.

<li><b>keep</b>- When I look at the article I can see where it can be improved. I know as a player of Nexus War that maybe the article in question should be declared a Snub until it gets expanded. The information there is all correct, and compared to Urban Dead, the game that spawned Nexus War, Nexus War has the potential to grow past UD (Urban Dead). To me, the article is not about how much publicity the game actually gets, it's about having information out there. Information is the real meaning Wikipedia was created. Nexus War is complex enough to warrant having an article. I agree that the current article is lacking. But improvement is a much better than deletion. So I stand that it should be kept and improved. This sin't some Unclyclopedia article on bungee jumping, it's an article about a real thing.I'm certain there are people in the NW community who would be willing to improve the article. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivselis_3d3c.html" title="User:Rivselis">Infested-jerk</a> 17:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Despite what many of you seem to think, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is, in fact, a criteria and NOT a guideline. As, quite truthfully, Nexus War is not the subject of any reliable publications. Also, from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Internet guides - Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known." This is more an introduction to the game than anything else, and has nothing like dates of the beginning/end of alpha, or beginning of Beta that an encyclopedia entry would have. The only information is a summary of the game and Jorm's name. However much I enjoy this game, I also recognize that this entry is not encyclopedic, has no statistical information, and, therefore, does not belong on Wikipedia. 19:59, 29 July, 2006

Surely by answering these questions and helping other people to expand the article, this would help more than deleting the page outright. --84.64.13.108 00:47, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If there is an issue with the lack of encyclopedic information (and yes, I'm aware that that's not the only issue at hand here), then I would like to attempt to rectify that situation rather than delete the page outright. Give me a few days to see what sort of information I can grub up on the subject, and I'll see if I can at least alleviate the unencyclopedic concerns. Their user-base also seems to be growing at quite a clip (From playing the game, it appears that they generally have at least 200 players logged in at any given moment, and this seems to be increasing rather than dropping), though I don't have reliable figures for the true user-base figures. -- <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby1024_888e.html" title="User:Kirby1024">Kirby1024</a> 00:45, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The userbase numbers are posted to a restricted section of our forums, but I've already stated them earlier on in my keep vote. They're as current as that comment. Anyways, if you need or want more information, and you use IRC, please, come to #nexus on irc.zirc.net and speak with jorm, myself, or any of us. Your best bet would probably be to PM Keolah, Maggah, Meirleach, or myself (Wyn). We'd be more than happy to answer any questions you need, and <a href="http://wiki.nexuswar.com" class="external text" title="http://wiki.nexuswar.com" rel="nofollow">our own wiki</a> can provide you with a great deal of information. -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 01:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are thousands of people registered, with over 100 players online at any given time. As mentioned before, popular forums such as Penny Arcade and Something Awful have large in-game factions.</li>
<li>From what I've seen, the game is much more innovative then Urban Dead because it forces the player to specialize their characters to remain effective in their preferred task as they level up. This in turn makes it very beneficial to join a faction, as the skills of each faction member complement each other. As mentioned before, it really does boil down to a 100-way game of capture the flag. Large 40 man raids comparable to those in World of Warcraft are not uncommon.</li>
<li>This may be a somewhat weaker argument, but the game only went public near the end of May. For a new non-commercial game made by an formally unknown developer to gain such a large player-base in only three months is amazing. I don't really see the point of deleting, since the number of players will only continue to grow and even if the game is not notable now by the official guidelines, it will be soon. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesGecko_0bfa.html" title="User:JamesGecko">James</a> 22:34, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I would assume the three main points being argued are:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. Does NW need to, or already, fall under WP:SOFTWARE?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Does NW need to, or already, fall under WP:WEB?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. If none of the above, is it notable?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would argue that NW does not fall under either WP:SOFTWARE (as it is not a "software application", and in a category of games that is generally overlooked completely by ANY mainstream media. Whether it falls under WP:WEB is debatable, but it doesn't really seem to apply in this case. In addition, while I have participated in a good many AfDs that allege "WP:NOT a crystal ball", at this point it doesn't need to be. The site has thousands of unique users, with hundreds on at any given time. In addition, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead</a> has an article as well. It is slightly fallacious to argue that it is not notable at this point by people arguing for a "Keep" as as stated above, Wiki is NOT a crystal ball. But I feel the article is notable. Cleanup it may need, but that's not a reason to delete it either. Tokakeke 04:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This is non-notable, there is no way to "make" a subject notable. Wikipedia is not a platform to advertise or establish noteriety. Ifnord 05:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>- But is is a place to learn about things. So tell me. Does the article act as a public relations ploy or does it actualy give out information? I feel it's the latter. The article in question really doesn't show vanity and it certainly isn't just a propaganda or advertising platform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>-I'm well aware that people not familiar with NW are having to take the word of the players for it, but as someone who has personally watched the growth in playerbase from day one of beta, and before, I can say that if this is deleted now, because it is not "notable" enough, it'll only have to be restored later when everyone is convinced it is "notable" --Lancensis 16:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Judging by the comments here and the size of the community behind the game, it rides on the cusp of the "notable" definition, such that its notable status currently depends on how one defines notability. So at the current moment call the situation balanced. But since it shows signs of increasing membership, I think we'll have to nudge it in the direction of "notable". Or, if not that, we'll have to look at some clearer criteria. But I think that the continued existence of the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead</a> page at least invalidates the requirement for "respectable sources" coverage, because as far as I know there is no substantial coverage of that game in any respectable source. (There may be a one-sentence throw-away reference somewhere, but such a reference really establishes nothing that can't be better established in other ways: e.g., visiting the listed URL.) <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurtim_f504.html" title="User:Furtim">Joshua Nicholson</a> 19:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Many of the delete votes note that the article does not have properly "encyclopedic" information like player numbers, start of alpha, et cetera. I'm more of a Wikipedia reader than contributor, but it's my understanding that one of the main purposes of using the wiki format is to permit members to improve articles themselves rather than requiring them to be discarded. "It's not good now, so let's not give it a chance to become so" is not a valid argument by any stretch of the imagination. Speaking as someone who plays this game and is an enthusiast of games and browser games in general, I can attest that the growth in player numbers in Nexus War has been nothing short of astonishing and, if anything, appears to be accelerating. The design innovations it has introduced are remarkable as well. Finally, for those arguing that this can't possibly be noteworthy because it hasn't been covered by the press or other "reputable" sources, it's worth noting that internet phenomena in general tend to be poorly covered. The next mention I see of Slashdot in the mainstream press will be the first (not saying there haven't been any, just that I haven't seen them), and I'm a certified news junkie. --<a href="../../../m/c/s/User%7EMcSnatherson_00bc.html" title="User:McSnatherson">McSnatherson</a> 02:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Fans of the game, please do not argue against deletion using reasons below.</li>
</ul>
<p>1) This game has a huge player/fan base&#160;: Please do not quote large number of players unless you can prove it. I investigated into this matter and found out that there are only around 150 "characters" online at any one time. It is hard to see how there could be even 1000 "active" unique players in the game based on this data. (note: 1 unique player can own multiple "characters" in the game)</p>
<p>2) This game is "better than" another game&#160;: Please refrain from citing reasons like "this game is better than World of Warcraft" or the more general "this game is good/fun". All these are POV opinions and not facts. Wikipedia do not delete software entries based on POV opinions.</p>
<p>3) Using other wiki articles as examples&#160;: This discussion is about this article only. If you feel that there are existing wiki articles that "deserves to be deleted more" then feel free to nominate them for deletion on their respective pages. The existance of other articles is not an excuse to keep this one.</p>
<p>If this game indeed have a huge player base and thought to be good (or better than mainstream commercial MMORPGs like some claimed) then it'll eventually earn coverage and become notable. From what I understand, this game was heavily inspired by Urban Dead which earned itself three citation from notable sources. Remiraz 10:29, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - It's an AP based game. For the most part, characters are only logged in for 5-10 minutes at a time to spend their AP. That does not mean that there "must be" fewer players than was stated. The data on the number of players came from the game admin himself. Also, I would like to point out to you the most similar games to Nexus War, <a href="../../../m/u/2A/Category%7EMU__games_6342.html" title="Category:MU* games">Category:MU*_games</a>, many of which have far fewer players than NW does. And I will state again that "notability" is not a viable criteria for deletion and never has been, in spite of what some people like to insist. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 06:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not a fan; I'm a moderator on the wiki associated with the game, and also a playtester. Brandon Harris is the game creator, and is therefore on the shortlist of people who actually have access to the programming and the database, and he has a habit of posting current stats in the playtesters' forum. I have <i>access</i> to current numbers, but only secondhand. I posted them straight from Mr. Harris' post in the forums. If you wish, I could get screencaptures of the forum posts - but somehow, I think you wouldn't accept them as proof, either. Also, please keep in mind that any one player can only have three characters unless they donate to the game or were present in the Alpha phase, and therefore if you divide the total number of characters by three, you're likely to find a relatively accurate number of accounts with the game. Research, research, research! -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 10:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - First of all I tried the game and know that it definately takes more than 5-10 minutes to spend all APs from full. Second, the only way to log into the game is through its website: if there are more than 8000 active unique players logging into the game twice or more everyday shouldn't there be a lot more traffic than those shown on Alexa? Finally, the existence of other similar wikipages has never been a deterrence from deletion. If you feel that those pages deserve to be deleted, please nominate them for delete. Otherwise, they have nothing to do with whether this wikipage stays or go. Remiraz 10:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - That is the current number of undeleted accounts, this is true. Regardless, 'playing every day' is misleading. Some people play day-to-day. I certainly don't play every day. With ten characters, I don't have the time or the inclination to play them all every day. I'll try and find out the number of accounts with at least one active character. -<a href="../../../w/y/n/User%7EWyndallin_b493.html" title="User:Wyndallin">Wyndallin</a> 11:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is good reason why Alexa is not an acceptable measure of a site's "notability". Alexa's traffic ratings only indicate how many people using Alexa's toolbar are using a site, which is extremely subjective and most people don't even use Alexa's crap. Plus there's been some talk of Alexa's ratings being compromised by people intentionally trying to boost their ratings on it. (The same can be said of Google to some extent, but Google tends to be more widely used.) Alexa was rejected as a method to determine "notability". --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 17:05, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Once again the argument devolves into dubious claims of "non-notability". Allow me to address your points individually, Remiraz:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) <i>Re: player base:</i> While I sincerely appreciate your effort to actually investigate the item in question, it would be nice if you'd also make an effort to understand how the mechanics of the game affect the number of concurrent users at any one time. In short, the AP mechanism means that users will typically only be online twice a day, and only for a few minutes at a time -- this happens to be directly mentioned in the article itself and should be apparent from a quick perusal of the game. The number of concurrent users you quote (150) is quite large when considered in this light.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) <i>Re: Comparisons to other games:</i> Agreed. NPOV statements and comparisons to other games do not belong in this discussion. However, this same standard should also apply to NPOV claims of "non-notability", e.g. claiming that a game can't be as good as others simply due to lack of mainstream media attention. To your assertion that "Wikipedia do not delete software entries based on POV opinions" I counter that this is exactly what you are attempting to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) <i>Re: Using other wiki articles as examples:</i> Agreed on the point of comparing this article to others that may or may not deserve deletion. However, pointing out articles which have set a precedent by surviving similar AfDs is entirely acceptable. The mention of <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a> above is indeed pertinent to this discussion as it has just <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_BattleMaster_bf0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/BattleMaster">survived an AfD</a> proposed on the same grounds as that for Nexus War.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd now like to add my own items to your list if I may, for the benefit of those championing deletion:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) If you're going to question the size of the player-base, at least make a passing effort to understand the game mechanics. If I were to claim that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> is non-notable because I watched a game and never saw more than 2 players, I'd be betraying a flawed understanding of that game, and this instance is no different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5) Don't resort to straw man arguments. When verifiability of an article is mentioned, don't couch your argument in terms of notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>6) Don't use Alexa as a measuring stick (ever). To quote <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Alexa_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a>: "Alexa rankings are not a part of the notability guidelines for web sites for several reasons." Ignoring Alexa results is especially important when measuring a game such as Nexus War or Urban Dead. Players of these types of game tend to favor Firefox since the game community releases Firefox extensions to aid gameplay, such as <a href="http://www.sl.ecwhost.com/nw/" class="external text" title="http://www.sl.ecwhost.com/nw/" rel="nofollow">NWTool</a> and the <a href="http://pete.nu/software/nwhoming/" class="external text" title="http://pete.nu/software/nwhoming/" rel="nofollow">Nexus War Homing Beacon</a>. Alexa, on the other hand, is compatible only within Internet Explorer and would therefore never register many, if not most, of the users.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) It would be nice if the people who have access to the secret player stats told us how many people were actually active in the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Whether the game is as "better" than others is irrelevant. If someone claims the game is non-notable and that it must be a bad game, it's only the non-notable aspect that this AfD concerns itself with.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) No, this is just as bad. Battlemaster and Shartak seem to have survived simply because nobody who agreed strongly with the AfD happened to read the page, and because somebody who disagreed with it decided to close it. A couple of articles sneaking through AfD doesn't mean they should be kept forever (articles often come up for deletion multiple times), and particularly not that all similar games should automatically be kept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Again, it would be nice to actually see some figures about the number of players, and the number of retained and active players.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) That's fair enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>6) It might be erratic, but even if players of these games mostly use Firefox, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http://www.urbandead.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http://www.urbandead.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Dead has an Alexa ranking of 14,711</a>, compared to Nexus War's 200,691.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And to add my own:-</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) "I think this game might be notable one day" is an argument for deleting the article and recreating it <i>if</i> its subject becomes notable, rather than keeping it and waiting. (People should accept the possibility that this game may never become notable.) --Grole 03:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Agreed, these figures should be published. However, my comment was in response to Remiraz's own investigation of the game, wherein he was able to see that there were "around 150" characters active just at that moment in time. I was merely pointing out the fallacy in Remiraz's use of a flawed extrapolation of this number to claim that there couldn't be very many real players in the game.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) Again, note that I agreed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) I do happen to agree with your points about the other AfDs not necessarily being set in stone, but must point out that doesn't preclude us from mentioning them. AfDs don't happen in a vacuum, and similar AfDs elsewhere on Wikipedia are most definitely valid points of discussion, whether or not you happen to agree with the outcome. We don't necessarily have to follow their precedent, but you can't just pretend those AfDs don't exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Agreed, see point 1.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>7) Perhaps. My contention though, is that Nexus War is notable <i>now</i>, or at the very least can't be shown as "non-notable" by any honestly applicable guideline. Please refer to my comments on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pardus_%28game%29_8944.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pardus (game)">AfD for Pardus</a>. To summarize:
<ul>
<li>The only real notability guideline that has been claimed here is <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was designed to weed out trivial, easily created, sites such as vanity pages and web comics.</li>
<li>Nexus War and the other games in this category are not easily created, and do not easily attract a user-base of thousands.</li>
<li>Applying <a href="../../../u/c/s/WP%7EUCS_6cee.html" title="WP:UCS">WP:UCS</a> and considering <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_rule_making" title="WP:NOT">the spirit of the law</a> makes it apparent that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> wasn't intended to weed out non-trivial creations such as these.</li>
<li>There should perhaps be a notability guideline for these sorts of games, but until one exists it's better to err on the side of leniency rather than to delete legitimate information.</li>
