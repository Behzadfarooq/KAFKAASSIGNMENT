<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Your making a big deal out of nothing. The links are off and it is a notable group. The article shall continue to be written and be up as long as there are no links to any weblogs (since your gonna make a big deal about it.)

<li>I don't see how it's not notable. I think it's informative and it's important that it stays here. As for "dangerous," if one thinks that it's dangerous, one has to remove the group itself along with their archives, methods, etc. Deleting this article is like deleting an article on Hitler, because people may decide to follow him and become neo-nazis. Or we might as well delete all the articles on controlled and dangerous substances, lest people should find out about them and use them. BittenCaliban 20:37, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - OK let's break it down. Searching for Benjamin Bryant + Majic 95.5: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+Majic+95.5&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+Majic+95.5&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. 3 hits that actaully are on topic... 2 of which are from his website. Searching for Benjamin Bryant + K-Juice: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+K-Juice&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+K-Juice&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> yields one hit... from his website. So basically, he qualifies as a non-notable disc jockey. The behind the scenes stuff (i.e. Program Director) isn't merit enough for inclusion either. He won a Paul R. Ellis Award, which has it's own wiki entry compelete with mention of Mr. Bryant; not so surprising when you notice that the author of that article is the same as the author of the Benjamin Bryant article. I would surmise the Paul R. Ellis Award article was added to support Mr. Bryant's article...
<ul>
<li>This delete nomination seems kind of personal, probably one of the reasons I felt compelled to research it a little more in-depth. As for the award, the author may be same, but a quick web search for the award supports that it is an award of some repute from a nationally recognized organization. When the entry is worthy of inclusion on its own, do we get to disqualify it because we question the motives for inclusion? <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3027862" class="external free" title="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3027862" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3027862</a> <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3027862" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3027862" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
</ul>

<dd>Moving on, Mr. Bryant hosted and emceed some local events, nothing more exciting than what many local "celebrities" do. Mr. Bryant then moved on to column writing. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B40&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+Soap+Weekly&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=B40&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=Benjamin+Bryant+Soap+Weekly&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> produces one valid hit, which puts him on the level of every other column writer that doesn't have a bio on wikipedia. The claim that <i>The early 2000s saw Bryant’s writings published on all of the industrialized continents, and translated into several languages...</i> appear to be non-verifiable.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This is verifiable, I found a list (with some links to original material) on Benjamin Bryant's website (the same one you cite): A number of these publications appear to meet the circulation requirements of the Wikipedia biography policy and they, in what I, at least, found interesting, cover a wide variety of topics. You seem very insistent that this point is unverifiable. One look at this page (and the links to actual scans and/or reprints of the original publications) kind of debunks that...Benjamin Bryant is clearly a widely published author, if not an author of the "sexy" material variety (No Brad and Angelina articles, though there is a piece on a beauty queen). <a href="http://www.benjaminbryant.net/stringbook/" class="external free" title="http://www.benjaminbryant.net/stringbook/" rel="nofollow">http://www.benjaminbryant.net/stringbook/</a> <a href="http://www.benjaminbryant.net/stringbook/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.benjaminbryant.net/stringbook/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> el_amante 21:41, October 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is nothing personal about it el_amante and you seem to be inferring bad faith on my part just because I'm actually trying to support my argument for a deletion. I agree that the Paul R. Ellis Award is worthy of inclusion in wikipedia on its own... I just don't agree that getting this award confers notability to the recipient. I view in the same way I view the Medal of Honor: If someone has done something notable, and happens to be a medal of honor recipient as well (regardless of whether or not the notable action is tied to receiving said honor) the MoH certainly merits mention in the person's article. However, just receiving the MoH is not, in my opinion, sufficient merit for inclusion in wikipedia. My argument against using the Paul R. Ellis Award as a benchmark for notability is solely based on that reasoning and my mention of the genesis of the Paul R. Ellis Award was simply a comment, though perhaps inappropriate in the context of an AfD.</li>

<dd>Per your second statement, I don't know how you are inferring that I am very insistent that the point about his published work is unverifiable from the statement <i>appear to be non-verifiable...</i> denoting the fact that I could not verify the claim. I missed that link you posted when I originally looked at Mr. Bryant's website. Having reviewed it, I still don't see anything that meets my criteria for notable published works. It is a collection of local newspaper articles. The <i>Soap Weekly</i> article I mentioned in my original vote, and some technical writings and press releases. I'm not judging this on the "sexy" nature of the material, but rather on precedent. Looking around wikipedia, I don't see many articles on local newspaper writers (baring those who write for nationally distributed "local" papers like the NY Times, Washington Post, etc.) or for technical/ad copy writers.</dd>
<dd>There is nothing personal about my delete vote. My long explanation for deletion in my original vote was simply because that, based on the article, a simple "delete - nn-bio" was inappropriate based on the numerous contentions of notability. I was at least trying to do some due diligence and look at the claims the author made. If this article stays, it needs a cleanup to removed POV wording (like "cinderella-like"), but ultimately I simply disagree with retaining an article on someone of such low notability.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:28, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The rest of the article concerns his lineage (which does not confer notability unless you are <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>), some minor awards, and his career. An unpublished novel and an unfinished play cap it all off. Taking it all together, I don't see anything that confers notability her. It is a well written article with tons information. It would make a great resume, but there as of right now, I don't see anything that distinguishes Mr. Bryant as notable. If his book ever comes out I may change my mind on this...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:59, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> – the page is well-written, and all the information is relevant. Having won a number of awards, and being related to an Emmy-winner, he is clearly a noteworthy individual. He also holds the record of 'youngest director of a mid/major market commercial station in all of Texas', which is undoubtedly of interest to somebody. Simply not being well-known does not mean that the subject is not noteable. It may be possible to merge all of the Bryant articles into a single article, but deleting is too crude and wasteful.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ronald Collinson (<a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERonald_Collinson_b8e5.html" title="User talk:Ronald Collinson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ronald_Collinson_318b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ronald Collinson">contribs</a>) 21:57, 10 October 2005 (UTC).</small>

I better start writing up my copy...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:45, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>C'mon, let's keep this discussion fair and reasonable. Obviously, being related to a notable is not simply enough, but when the person is a published writer related to another published writer of significant note, and obviously part of a family of significant achievement (and we can debate whether a given person is or is not) I think they can qualify for an entry, at least on principle, to be evaluated individually.--el_amante 19:34, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I was on the fence of "keep" vs. "strong keep" but I ultimately chose strong keep for the following reasons: While this person is not well known, the accomplishments are legitimate. Though some of the Google searches link to his site <a href="http://www.benjaminbryant.net" class="external free" title="http://www.benjaminbryant.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.benjaminbryant.net</a> (click through to the "professional" site), an actual review of the site provides plenty of supporting information--including several newspaper articles, and a complete list of works written for major publications and public relations campaigns managed in various countries. The most notable are the Black History Maker of Tomorrow award, which I know from watching a TV special years ago is (was?) a legitimate national award given by McDonalds, and being the youngest Program Director of a commercial station in Texas. Other supporting information includes being named "Most Memorable of 1996" and working on a major Defense program that is always in the news. ALONE, the circular reference to the other family members (some of which are also clearly notable, others not so much) or the fact that the Ellis Award entry was entered by the same author, might challenge the article's legitimacy, but there are clearly enough supporting factors to keep this one. I do not think we should be too dependent upon how many Google hits a person turns up--many people accomplished things before the Internet was in widespread use, particulary for archiving. I also think that one of the brilliant things about Wikipedia is that we can include "B-list" notables that might otherwise be left out of traditional encyclopedias due to space constraints. Wikipedia can be less elitist and I think that's a good thing. Sorry for the length of this, but I wanted to rebut the detailed entry above, as I strongly disagree with using primarily quantitative data (hits, etc.) as justification for keeping OR deleting--and I'm not sure that while Ben Bryant's page was cited, that the author actually followed many of the links on that page, which support Mr. Bryant's notability el_amante 19:45, 12 October 2005 (UTC).

<li>A note: I noticed that the bio on the site(and even the tone of the bio) is not the same as this Wikipedia article, which I often find is the case when a person has done their own their own vanity page. el_amante 21:54, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I understand that this page was put on and survived a previous AfD, however the previous vote was inconclusive with 1/1/1, with myself neutral.

<ol>
<li>non-notable.

I've seen 300,000 ones get speedied. Google test comes up with 13,400 hits, but bear in mind that this is an EXTREMELY generic name, just like "<a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover.html" title="Rover">Rover</a>" is anyone's dog.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - Being told that using sources that are not correct is not a personal attack. That means that either you need to find the correct sources or just remove the non-factual information. Remember, me and Marc, David and Grutness are vexillologists, if you need information (or perhaps drawings) of flags, just let us know. But since, from reading this, I still personally believe that this article is nothing but original research.

<dd>Homeontherange, <i>I see you have changed your vote from <b>Delete</b> to <b>Merge.</b></i> It is nice to see that you conceed that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article I created has some value on Wikipedia. However, as for <b>Merging</b> the article with another <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_France_a644.html" title="Flag of France">Flag of France</a> article, I would strongly disagree with that suggestion. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article touches on a subject that is not generally known in Vexillology, and it provides a compact, specialised article to highlight these French Flags, which are commonly overlooked, and un-emphasised. <i>I submit to you that the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article is quite appropriate, and educational in <b>its present location (i.e., with its own separate article).</b></i> <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmchairVexillologistDon_2c04.html" title="User:ArmchairVexillologistDon">ArmchairVexillologistDon</a> 20:55, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> Sorry Marc, but you're incorrect. There are a number of flags that have used the tricolor canton. Togo has, Wallis &amp; Futuna has and Morocco has, to name just three off the top of my head. A quick glance at some of the pages on <a href="http://www.fotw.net/flags/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fotw.net/flags/index.html" rel="nofollow">the Flags of the World website</a> (many of which I had a hand in writing, I venture to add) will show that what Don is saying is basically correct, though some of the things said on the page do need their accuracy checked. The use of the word "ensign" is also a little wayward, to say the least - these are colonial flags, not ensigns (ensigns are flown from ships, not used on land). (BTW Don, are you on the fotw mailing list?)</s> <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 12:21, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>
<ul>
<li>Okay - Marc's explained to me a bit more clearly what his beef is with the page, and I understand now. That there are flags like this in general is accepted, but their direct relation to British ones is questionable, especially given their usage. Also, some of the 'templates for flags" shown on the page in question never existed as flags in themselves. Many countries have used or do use flag designs similar to those probably first used by the British navy, either deliberately or coincidentally - and that is worthy of a Wikipedia article. The current article, though, is not that article. This needs a thorough rewrite, a split and a move to titles like Similarities in European colonial flag designs and Similarities in European naval ensign designs (or possibly something a bit more catchy). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 12:43, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no parallel -- none -- in the use of British and French ensigns. The British have a system: red for merchant vessels, blue for government, white for naval (I have somewhat oversimplified) that France never had. Please act along the lines of Marc Pasquin's and James Dignan's ("Grutness") arguments. The parent article is just plain wrong; I don't know where the author got his information. ASKirsch

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, in the sense that the French Ensign is worthy of an article. Much of the page belongs elsewhere, if at all, but that is an issue for talk pages, not AfD. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 09:09, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I want to comment on two issues, espeically since my name came up with regard to one of them. In a previous debate on AVD's contention that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_flag.html" title="Canadian flag">Canadian flag</a> was based on what he calls the "republican tricolour", AVD provided a list of references to support his argument. (This was on an article he wrote entitled "French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag", which was deleted.) Most of them were for books published decades before the maple leaf flag was introduced in 1965. I looked into a recent book to which he referred, and could find nothing to support AVD's claim. Part of the problem was that instead of providing the page number to support his claim, which is what would normally be done, he provided the number of the page from which he took the publisher's information, which is not useful in any way to someone trying to verify the references. <s>And he never provided the pagge number to support his claim at any time later.</s> The other issue is his statement, "If I have to obey the 'No Personal Attack Rule' then so does Homeontherange." When has AVD ever obeyed the NPA rule? Several editors have pointed out his violations, and he has never withdrawn the attacks (as far as I know). There is currently an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_ArmchairVexillologistDon_9fd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/ArmchairVexillologistDon">RfC</a> about his personal attacks, and he made a personal attack against me on the RfC page, which he has not withdrawn or apologized for. Because of his behaviour, it is hard to known whether this article has been written in good faith based on the references cited, or if it is original research. His past behaviour suggests the latter. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 15:39, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

He stated that he was not aware of this, and he had nothing to do with it. Next I asked him permission to defend the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ensigns.html" title="French ensigns">French ensigns</a> article, and the Administrator granted me permission to so, with the warning that I was absolutely not to engage in personaly attacks.

<dd>I stand corrected with reference to the Archibald book. You did provide page references after I requested them, so I will withdraw the remark that I made above. The rest of our discussion shows, however, that the book does not support your claim that the Canadian flag is based on the republican tricolour. You have drawn, on your own, the conclusion that the remote similiarity of the Canadian flags to the flags of other countries, some of which are republics, is basis enough to draw your conclusion that the design of the maple leaf flag was chosen to promote republicanism by undermining royal and British connections and symbolism. In this case, the reference that you provided did not support your claim, but rather showed that what you were writing was original research.</dd>
<dd>As far as the "coincidences", it is not uncommon for editors to watch the contributions of editors who in the past have violated Wikipedia policies. As you know, the "French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag" was deleted for being a POV fork of what you were trying to include in the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Canada_52f6.html" title="Flag of Canada">Flag of Canada</a> article, which is not permitted. So you should not be surprised if your contributions are being monitored. This is one of the ways that Wikipedia policies can be maintained. Of course, if you are not violating Wikipedia policies, then you should not be concerned that others are watching your work. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 19:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In the Housman article <i>Last Poems</i> is dated at 1922, in which case under U.S. law it is still in copyright until 2017 (publication + 95 years for works before 1978-01-01). <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 03:52, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is incorrect. See <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_copyright_law_7d4d.html" title="United States copyright law">US Copyright law</a>. All works before 1923 are in the public domain. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 08:11, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unless the copyright was renewed in time, which Last Poems was, in 1950 (note the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0805005471/ref=sib_dp_pop_cr/002-1939658-3473647?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S005#reader-link" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0805005471/ref=sib_dp_pop_cr/002-1939658-3473647?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S005#reader-link" rel="nofollow">copyright page via Amazon</a>). --<a href="../../../k/g/f/User%7EKgf0_e092.html" title="User:Kgf0">Kgf0</a> 19:21, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, that sentence in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_copyright_law_7d4d.html" title="United States copyright law">US Copyright Law</a> is shockingly incorrect. Admittedly 17 USC 304 is hard to read, but that's just not right at all, considering the renewal provision. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:33, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The sentence in the article is <i>correct</i>, I think, and all charts listing copyright expirations affirm. The Sonny Bono Act did not restore lapsed rights. A work published in 1922, renewed in 1950, had its copyright lapse on Dec. 31, 1998, before the effective date of the Sonny Bono act (July 1, 1999). All works published in the US prior to 1923 <i>are</i> in the public domain. Housman, published 1922, is no exception. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:25, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A laudable aim, but this isn't the place for that discussion - unless you are proposing that it be deleted. As to the use of the term, it is used, but not widely, and it certainly isn't the "standard" nomenclature. Usually, you will find the term abstract minimalist used (or simply abstract expressionist). People like Josef Albers and Mark Rothko in particular are absent from this article, as is Barnett Newman - so it could do with considerable expansion. But what's there is good. What are you proposing - merging it into something?

<dd>I've only come across it a couple of times in three years of part time work as an arts reviewer - and in that business it's difficult to say what's a neologism and what's real. A move to Monochromatic art (with links to things like <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grisaille.html" title="Grisaille">Grisaille</a> and expansion to cover more than just 20th century art) might be the best solution, since that term is widely used.

The fact is, he is employed as the number two person of a U.S Federal Government ageny. His architecture work involves some of the most well known structures in the United States (and possible the world). The number of people that know of him is not the only factor in deciding whether he gets an article. I think there is room for him on Wikipedia.

<p>"THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE QUOTES</p>
<p>The quotes allow a general viewer to receive a better insight into the mind of not just one man, but humans in general. The quotes give a clear indication of how the mind works in certain stressful situations, and the thought processes that appear in many people's mind that link thoughts and ideas into a single sentence. The quotes also, therefore introduce the power of the spoken word, showing how a single message can be used to convey a thought or idea much better than a single action. The quotes also allow people to view the expressions that build in a human's vocabulary as (s)he increases in age, and the frequency (s)he uses said sayings to those that have never heard them before, and in turn passes these sayings to those people which they have relayed the comment to. These people, in turn, may adopt one or more of these sayings and use them in another situation in which the comment makes sense, and so the circle continues.</p>
<p>This article is clearly one that gives an insight into the human mind, and I think it is of clear importance to the community. It contains mannerisms of a personality, and can be used how the user wishes to. If a user has no imagination, then the quotes seem little more than a watse of time where no information is contained. Others, however, will feel that this does have some significance to their lves and the information that they receive in them. They need to be able to understand that while the quotes give no information in a sense, in another sense the quotes are very useful, and informative, because they give us all a look at the mind of a human and their speech patterns. As well as this, the quotes give an indication of wisdom, and enlightenment, and in this sense they give information. They are significant, as without them many would not be able to view key human speech pattern information and it's relevance in today's stressful society."</p>
<p>This is what is said in the article. I put it there just in case people do not bother to read the pages they vote to delete, as I know is often the case. I have used Wikipedia for years. I am a memeber, as you can see, but not for any length of time. These quotes are what they say they are, however, if you feel that the information that they provide is not apparant to the average Wikipedia surfer, then obviously that is fine. I would say that I would vote to keep the quotes, as I do believe they are worthy of Wikipedia. May I point out that the quotes have been on Wikipedia three weeks. Has anyone been hurt in that time, by those quotes? Maybe they have.</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> vaguely noteable for his service and relation to clearly noteable Lori Bryant-Woolridge, but not enough to merit his own article. This should be incorporatd into either a Lori article, or one of the linked miliatary articles Ronald Collinson 22:05, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as he is clearly the least notable of the Bryant entries. He has won a Bronze Star, which is admirable, but is not uncommon among veterans. The only reason I don't recommend "delete" is that he is differentiated from other veterans as he was (is?) a member of the very famous 82nd Airborne, was featured in a book that is widely available by a very well-respected and widely-known author (just do a Google search for the book and/or the author), and is clearly part of a military family who could be considered notable for the fact that it is has "dynasty" qualities: both grandfathers are decorated Generals, as is the father, and he is a decorated veteran of a high-profile war featured in a major book. Clearly, when taken in total, the family is certainly notable for their consistent multi-generational military achievements (many people are from "military" families, but very, very few, I suspect, consistently reach the general officer level). If this entry is deleted, I would suggest keeping reference to same in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Bryant_Jr_cf85.html" title="Albert Bryant Jr">Albert Bryant Jr</a>. and Renee Bryant entries. el_amante 19:56, 12 October 2005
<ul>
<li><i>May I also say that just because several notable family members are entered at one time and by one person does not mean that they are automatically vanity pages. On very rare occasions (and I think this is one of them) the individuals entered are actually notable for their own reasons. I'm not sure that user25be isn't a relation, but while there are some traditional red-flags, close review shows that these people are largely notable</i>. el_amante 19:56, 12 October 2005</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Collins_4dbf.html" title="Paul Collins">Paul Collins</a> is a former Australian Priest and current commentator on Catholicism.

He resigned from his priesthood after Cardinal Ratzinger attempted to discipline him for his book on <i>Papal Power</i> in 1998. He probably is notable enough for an article.

<li>Hey there. Just to clear up one or two things. It is a complete coincidence that there is a priest called Paul Collins in Australia. Simple as that. No doubt there are other Paul Collins' out there. As to how I found the article, I got an email from a friend in Galway about it. Maybe he had something to do with putting it up, he is a bit of a history nut. My mistakes in my post are due to my inexperience with Wikipedia... I'm a noobie, please forgive. Oh one more thing, DannyWilde, I'm not from Galway. I'm from Glasson, Westmeath. I went to college in Galway. -- BarrysT 11:01, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Sorry DESiegel, but I feel that it is wrong for us to carry out an anonymous troll's dirty work like this.

<li>I disagee. A speedy keep (which this is obviouly headed for) doesn't take long, and preserved a record for future reference. I don't approve of citign <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> to avoid normal procedure -- indeed I am convinced that anyoen citing it for such a purpose thereby demonstrates a weak case. Besides, this may not have been trolling, but a person who honestly doesn't belive that such articles belong here. A reasonable defense of such a postion could IMO be made, although it would change the nature of wikipedia soemwhat, and i wouldn't support it. But a relatively new user may not fully understand the nature of wikipedia. in such a case, seeing the response is more likely to bbe educational than having the nom simply vanish, IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:07, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Clearly notable for receiving presitigious awards and for relation to a Brigadier General. Possibly, she does not merit her own article, but the Bryants as a whole should certainly deserve some mention. I advocate combining all of the above into one article. <sup>(unsigned by Ronald Collinson)</sup>
<ul>
<li>What is so notable about the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outstanding_Civilian_Service_Award_c434.html" title="Outstanding Civilian Service Award">Outstanding Civilian Service Award</a> or the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander%27s_Award_for_Public_Service_f055.html" title="Commander's Award for Public Service">Commander's Award for Public Service</a>? Both of these were added to wikipedia by the author of this article, presumably to bolster the case for Renee Bryant's notability. Can you point out other existing articles on wikipedia where these awards are used as a case for notability (not by the author of the Bryant articles)? I'm not advocating removing the articles for these awards because I think this is good, useful, encyclopedic information (and the articles are well written); however they don't make a case for notability. Your other point about her being notable for relation to a Brigadier General also isn't supported by wikipedia precedent. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Schwarzkopf_f750.html" title="Norman Schwarzkopf">Norman Schwarzkopf</a> has a wife and three children... none of them have wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a> has a wife and three children as well. Only <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Powell_ba9a.html" title="Michael Powell">Michael Powell</a> has a wikipedia article because he has clearly achieved notability on his own (ignoring any arguements of nepotism) by becoming the chairman of the <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a>. The Bryant's clearly have had distinguished and interesting lives, but not one of them, other than <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lori_Bryant-Woolridge_c7d6.html" title="Lori Bryant-Woolridge">Lori Bryant-Woolridge</a> has done anything to acheive an encyclopedic level of notability.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:34, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The two awards are clearly notable, as they are (verifiably) the third and fourth highest honors the Department of the Army can award to a civilian. Supported by www.cpol.army.mil/library/mer/awards/public.html, they are clearly not throwaway or vanity honors that are handed out to every Tom, Dick, or Harriet. By definition it stands to reason that there have not been that many of these awards given out (this is admittedly conjecture, but based on similar stats for similar high-level government awards). Interestingly, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Bryant_Jr_cf85.html" title="Albert Bryant Jr">Albert Bryant Jr</a>'s awards are given out to far more people than the ones Renee Bryant has received. Thus in an odd way, Renee Bryant may be more notable than her husband.--el_amante</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Based on the legitimate significance of the awards and the clear link to an established multi-generational, award-winning, military family. Just because there are low Google hits does not mean she is not notable. It doesn't strike me that there would be much coverage of this type of individual, however notable, except, perhaps local coverage and or DoD press advisories at the time. Do we know, too, whether some of these awards weren't awarded pre-dating the archiving of articles, etc. commonly on the Internet? (Agree, as well, that the article is well written.) <i>(el_amante) 19:22, 12 October 2005</i></li>

<p>As Wikipedia is not to be used as a dictionary, then yes, the 'article' should be deleted. However, my original attempt was to correct a mistake in the article on the Arrente, where it refered to them using the term 'anangu'. This is a name used by another Aboriginal group all together (the Pitjantjatjara ). Arrente do not call themselves 'anangu' and would be happy to be referred to by this word.</p>
<p>I have spent all day trying to find an internet reference for the word 'rhilla' but have not been able to do so. So by all means, remove the 'rhilla article', but I would suggest rewriting the original Arrente entry as well. Sorry if I've caused any inconvience. petersmith</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> IMHO, we should start out with a separate "International response to Kashmir earthquake" article, and only when <i>that</i> gets too big to contain all the information, should separate articles be created for individual countries.

The relief effort is a significant event in Singapore, because of the large Pakistani, South Asian and Muslim community in the country.

<dd>I doubt its systemic bias. If there were, wouldn't larger countries like the US which offers $50 mil + several military equipment and China which offers $6.2 mil + dogs have pages of their own?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I respectfully disagree with the comments that this article can only exist on condition that other "Country-X reponse" articles are created. There is no wikipedia policy and guideline that impose such a condition. While I can easily satisfy it by creating another article, I disagree with such a condition that is based on editorial preferences, which are not grounds for <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a>. Let me state clearly the reasons for keeping this article:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The content is NPOV, factual, verifiable and notable.</li>
<li>The presented facts received wide coverage not just in local news media, but also reported by AFP, Reuters, Xinhua, as well. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Singapore+earthquake" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Singapore+earthquake" rel="nofollow">[32]</a></li>
<li>Keep in mind that there isn't just one perspective looking at this event. There are X-country's perspectives as well. And I don't deny that this article is about Singapore's perspective. That's nothing wrong with it as we strive for a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">comprehensive, global perspective in wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li>This article is related not just to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> event, it is also part of the comprehensive coverage to provide the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/d/Understanding.html" title="Understanding">understanding</a> on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Singapore_15c3.html" title="Demographics of Singapore">demographics</a> (which has large number of foreign residents), the importance of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_relations_of_Singapore_0a53.html" title="Foreign relations of Singapore">foreign relations</a>, and the preoccupation with <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Defence_2319.html" title="Total Defence">internal security</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force_86c6.html" title="Singapore Civil Defence Force">civil defence</a> in the small country. The relief effort are therefore significant in Singapore. I cannot say for other countries, but they may or may not relate as much to the event in South Asia. Therefore, whether there exists other articles is irrelevant.</li>
<li>If you only want to read summarized description of the main event, then of course this article is of little interest to you. But for others who wish for a detailed understanding of the disaster or to study the politics of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_Asia_e921.html" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a>, they would find this full article more useful than just a one-paragraph abstract.</li>
<li>This is not a loop-sided contribution by a user, I have contributed much more to the main article <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a> than this one; and many entries in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Kashmir_earthquake_6a28.html#International_response" title="2005 Kashmir earthquake">2005_Kashmir_earthquake#International_response</a> were added by me. We may wish there are other countries' articles as well, but deleting this article is really a step backward, not forward. There are alot more work to be done as we aim for a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compendium.html" title="Compendium">comprehensive coverage</a>; but as long as this content is <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a>, there is no reason to remove it.</li>
<li>In its currents state, there is no way to merge this article into another without deleting most of the content.</li>
<li>Finally, the stated reason for this nomination is really <i>not</i> valid for AfD, according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 17:30, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is a hoax. The history of the organization, that is, created from two debating societies, does not square with the university's protrayal of the demise of those societies. According to the University: "The Franklin Society was organized in 1824, a year when such a large class entered that the two existing literary debating societies, the Philermenian Society and the United Brothers Society could not accommodate enough of the entering students. The membership was also augmented by the acceptance of honorary membership by Henry Clay, Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and other notable personages. Ten years after its establishment, in 1834, the Franklin Society was dissolved, its library of several hundred volumes was turned over to the College Library, and in 1847 its members were elected in equal proportions into the two older societies." Furthermore, the organization is largely unmentioned today. One reference was made in the Brown Daily Herald, but the College Hill Independant article, mentioned in this article, cannot be located. If a more precise reference could be provided, that would be helpful. While a search of the University records finds the society mentioned ONCE among university documents, that reference is questionable, and I am currently awaiting replies from those authors. Finally, a whois search reveals that the "official" website is registered to "Joe Pacifica" with a fake phone number. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahross_a6c3.html" title="User:Micahross">Micahross</a> 04:30, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I managed to find that very article. Rereading my post I find it was somewhat ambiguous. There is ONE mention in a paper and ONE in among university documents. I am trying to track down the origin of the hoax now, but few people are being helpful. I was directed to a member of the organization, but have yet to hear from him.

<li>Pacifica House is definitely real. It has multiple mentions in the Brown Daily Herald, has its website, and is mentioned here in several other entries here.

<li>I have been able to get a copy of the publication cited by the Brown link. However, there are difficulties verifying both "Pacifica House Trust" and "Brunensis, Ltd." The "official" site is registered to the former, but the latter holds the copyright. Neither is registered as a charitable trust with the IRS. However, this would not be necessary if the trust had no tax ramifications. If the trust accepts charitable donations, this is a tax ramification. There have been a total of TWO mentions of Pacifica House by The Brown Daily Herald. Moreover the university archivist has never heard of the organization, but they could provide me with the papers of the Franklin Society. If Pacifica House had evolved from that organization, I would suspect that they would have kept their minutes and acceptances of honorary membership -- one of these was an 1824 letter by Thomas Jefferson and another was a letter by Horace Greenleaf Whittier. (Sadly, the signatures have been removed.) Those are valuable. On the other hand, I have found one alumnus who claims to be a member of Pacifica House. Finally a careful reading of their website has revealed an oddity: on the history page, a picture of the "charter" appears. (<a href="http://www.pacificahouse.org/images/Charter.JPG" class="external free" title="http://www.pacificahouse.org/images/Charter.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificahouse.org/images/Charter.JPG</a>) This is not a charter -- the text reads: "Providence, May 16: Sir -- Pardon a stranger for occupying a moment of that time which I know to be inestimably precious. I must beg to offer you my sincere thanks for your last proclamation as the chief magistrate of the nation. You call upon all your fellow citizens to render unto God thanksgiving for his recent mercies and to offer to him (sic) as individuals and societies ... prayer ... He will ... our ... efforts with security, which he alone can ..." This a letter, not a charter. Frankly, the matter is out of my hands. I can only provide a finite amount of evidence that this is a hoax. I am also a little reluctant to take unsigned avowals of the legitimacy of Pacifica House seriously. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahross_a6c3.html" title="User:Micahross">Micah Ross</a> 09:05, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting. It may well be that we can't determine for sure the status of this without doing our own "original research".

<li>I can't verify how legitimate the information on this site is, but I can verify that the Pacifica House group exists. I don't know details about the organization, but I do know that it's members regularly meet and it is an invite-only society.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>--inherently unverifiable even on the extreme offchance that it's true, as Micahross's efforts (thanks for that) demonstrate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(First post from 66.31.44.201) Pacifica House does exist, whether all the information on the Wiki page is true is unverifiable. The question now is: should a Wiki page containing information, much of it unverifiable, on a given entity be deleted on the basis of lack of confirmation? Highly unlikely this group is the creation of just one person--if so then it's an expensive way to be vain--registering the website, etc., and making sure the campus newspaper mentioned the group--but it seems plausible a lot of the "historical" information is just lost in time. Histories have a way of sounding better with every telling. "Deletion" as the ultimate price of unverifiability would implicate a lot of Wiki's pages. but why don't we just edit the actual Wiki page and tell everyone that all this stuff is highly unreliable and not to drink the kool-aid?</li>
<li>(Second post from 66.31.44.201) Theoretically ALL secret societies on Wiki are unverifiable. duh. they're secret. but seriously, there are a couple options here. the first is to delete the hell out of this page. if Wiki does this, then so too shoudl be considered every other collegiate secret society. or else we should start conducting research to _verify_ their claims, and if they cannot be verified, delete them, or at least information we don't know for sure: skull and bones claims a long list of alumni, can we verify this? the other option is to let it alone. maybe. the third option is to put a disclaimer like the skulls have now--the article has info that can't be verified. there are a lot of suspicious bits of info on this wiki page that can't be confirmed and that is a FACT. but let's be objective and apply the same principles here to other college society pages. there's far too much vanity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Okay, it seems people have taken an interest in what I have written. Fine. Let's cover a few bases. I can understand the removal of a personal name, but the removal of my research and evidence is fraudulent. (Be forewarned -- this history function of the talk page is a powerful tool.) Also, if you choose to remove a personal name, why not just replace it with a string of Xs? Also, I asked earlier for the sake of clarity that people sign their contributions. Two separate contributions from the same IP does not a consensus make. On 12 October, 2005 I had written "Well, I followed up the information returned from the whois search. It was registered with eNom, Inc. and is hosted at ixwebhosting.com. It is worth noting that www.pacificahouse.info was registered by XXXX X. XXX for the organization "Pacifica House." This is the ONLY person I have met who claims to be a member of the organization. pacificahouse.info is hosted by ixwebhosting.com. Frankly, I'm saying "mystery solved" on this one. The thing never existed beyond XXX X. XXX, who probably authored the article. I suspect he also stopped by here to defend it. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahross_a6c3.html" title="User:Micahross">Micahross</a> 12:42, 12 October 2005 (UTC)" I really hate an intent to defraud. Deleting the fruit of my research has made this personal. Moreover, there are some things about Skull and Bones that can be verified: they have a building, people can -- and have -- watched who goes in and out. For many years they had a page in the yearbook at Yale. Their trust is registered, The Russell Trust, was registered with the IRS (although I think they may have changed the name by now.) In several unsigned posts, it has been stated that Pacifica House indeed exists. In some ways, this is true. The Secret Protocols of the Elders of Zion also exists. I have a copy of it. By the same token, the "member(s)" of Pacifica House are probably limited to those here who defend this hoax. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahross_a6c3.html" title="User:Micahross">Micahross</a> 14:15, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is basically a debate between TWO people--"Micahross" and some anonymous poster! Why anyone in the world should care about "Pacifica House" and whether 100% of its information is verifiable escapes this user. Why anybody has accumulated this much information about such collegiate organizations that have no relevance outside their institutions is also puzzling. In any case: to the WIKI board: if you delete this website, please do not delete it because of one rather long-winded individual who claims that he cannot make unsecret a secretive organization. But if you let it alone, do not leave it be because the benefit of the doubt. It seems we need some rigor in verifying claims here, but this includes claims of people who have come into a website with an agenda, as well as claims of organizations that seem extraordinarily hard to make concrete. Can somebody else besides "Micahross" and "unknown poster" step forward with information? We are hesistant in believing one person on either side.</li>

<li>Hey guys, i wrote this page. would it be ok if it was merged to part of stolen generation pages. I believe that the issue of the howard government's refusal to say sorry has not been sufficiently cataloged by this encyclopedia. It is quite important to this aboriginal history of australia, just as important truganini and namatjira. that's why i placed it here.

<p>Reasons I feel this is very probably a hoax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fairly ludicrous event</li>
<li>Links at the bottom fail to verify the validity of the article</li>
<li>The article is written in an overly-dramatic manner</li>
<li>Can't find compelling evidence elsewhere that this event has actually occurred</li>

<ul>
<li>But the article says at the beginning that you should take the story with a grain of salt. Perhaps this is a legend in Tanganyika that people tell in which case it is still a valid piece of information. It's information about a legend. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 152.23.105.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.23.105.7_4766.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.23.105.7">contribs</a>) 05:11, 12 September 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>I would keep this page. The incident has been documented in other notable sources, and mentioned briefly in an article in American Scientist. <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/24591;jsessionid=aaa-xzJgGRqz85?fulltext=true" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/24591;jsessionid=aaa-xzJgGRqz85?fulltext=true" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.149.140.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.149.140.99_7daa.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.149.140.99">contribs</a>) 02:23, 27 September 2005 (UTC).</small></li>
<li>Don't delete this article. Aspects of it are most probably exaggerated to some degree, but it is more a reference to a famous myth surrounding an actual event, so it should be kept in for that reason. I think the article makes it clear that there's no rock solid evidence, but it is an interesting study case for psychiatrists and undoubtedly something did happen out there in 1962.
<p>I believe legends like this have a place on Wikipedia so long as the author makes it clear that the evidence is shakey. --86.137.13.28 08:26, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I won't vote, but as the author of this page I thought I may as well comment. Thanks for the criticism, and I can only agree with some of the opinions mentioned above. I found the topic to be interesting (though I can't remember where I heard of it first, much like some of the voters below) and sought out a Wikipedia article with further information; I found none, so I made one to the best of my ability. I'll keep the criticism of my writing style in mind if I make future contributions.

<li>It's also the view that about 50-60% of users DO ascribe too. Which is probably the basis for the neverending lack of consensus. Half of us see schools as building in which some education happens, others see them as some higher trancendent institution that is more then the sum of it's parts. I've seen too many schools close with no repercussions to accept that view.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:30, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A school is not a building, it uses a building. By the same token, a playground, computer network, school web site, are also not schools. They're used by schools. Sometimes two schools share one building (with entirely seperate administration, faculty, student bodies; and very occasionally even separate school boards). Obviously, countless schools also have multiple buildings, often disconnected. Often, schools move, or replace buildings, but the school goes on, and just one article for the school exists. One should understand what something is before deleting it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:33, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Obviously we disagree on this point. If the Park School of Buffalo building were to burn down... that school would cease to exist. You cannot deny this. The students would be moved to other schools until the building was ressurected. And even then there is no guarentee that would happen. Or by the same token if a school were to close the institution would be gone, but the building would still be there (infact we have a few articles for just such school buildings). A school is a building nothing more. Sure there can be more then one group of students sharing the building, but if the building ceases to exist so does the school. Admittedly this tendency is more prevailent in public schools then private schools as private schools tend to have alumni and benefactors that are also interested in maintaining the institutional aspects.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:39, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't know what a school is, unfortunately. If the school burnt down, and they found other places to house them, and then rebuilt the structure, then the school would continue to exist. The same article would apply to the school before and after. In fact, there are a number of articles where a school has relocated, and one article applies to the same school, for the entire time period. This is especially true of private schools, charter schools, and special program schools. Now, some district schools would be shut-down in such a case, but that's not a universal rule. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:48, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please stop starting your responses by insulting me. We obviously disagree, that doesn't make either of us right. And yes it's possible they would relocate the school, but that's more likely in the case of a private school. As I said before if a public school closes its institiutional aspects are gone, finito, kaput, but the building remains and is still Such and Such School.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is just patently false. This is a nonsensical argument created to support the absurd contention that schools are just buildings (and therefore unimportant). My Junior High School burned down when I was in grade 7 (about 70% of the original site was destroyed). The school district decided to rebuild the school while cleanup of the old site was still going on. They obtained land in a <b>different community</b> within the same city and rebuilt the school. I attended the school as soon as it opened the following winter, it had the same name, same staff, same students, same mascot, same colours, same school song, same motto, same programs, same curriculum, some awards had been salvaged from the old school- but it clearly had a different (AND BETTER, I might add) building. The old site, when cleaned up then was used by the district to construct a new elementary school, which made use of the 30% or so of the old building (including the gynmasium), which had a different staff, different name, taught a different level of schooling, etc. etc. Surely the newly constructed building was the same school (with the same name, etc.) that had been my Junior High School - not the 30% of old buildings that had been incorporated into the new elementary school. Clearly, the institutional structures of the school persisted, even though it's original building had been destroyed. What is more, while our classes were indeed taken inside other active school buildings, our classes were maintained, and we were taught by teachers from our school. There was no integration with the other schools whose buildings housed our classes while we were awaiting our new facilities (in fact, some students from my Junior High School took classes at a local YMCA, and some in a church basement during that year). We were still a school even though the buildings were gone, and the YMCA didn't become our school because it was the building. My solitary example illustrates how simplistic some of the approaches from "those who routinely vote to delete school articles" with respect to schools really are. I actually have two or three other examples that come to mind that disprove, but truly, one example is sufficient to debunk the idea that "A school is a building nothing more."--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 19:56, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Create an article <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vityaz.html" title="Vityaz">Vityaz</a> and redirect</b> this Russian knight there. Google finds &gt;21000 hits on Vityaz (in latin letters), so I assume it is an English word now. I suspected many English-speakers might look into Wikipedia to understand what the word exactly mean (I, been a native Russian speaker, would be interested as well). According to my understanding Vityaz as a professional warrior, usually on a horse, in armour and with proper weapons. He is much more real than Bogatyrs, but still has some folklore connections. Part-time warriors like Bogatyr Mikula Selyaminovich are never refer as Vityazes, despite been valiant and able.
<dl>
<dd>While he was a professional warrior, he was not necessarily mounted (at least 30 of them were not&#160;:-). Also, wikipedia is not interested in "your understanding". Did you see anything specific on net? As for &gt;21,000 hits (+ 11,000 for <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitiaz.html" title="Vitiaz">vitiaz</a>), the majority of them are various names of things of Russian production (and many of them do fit encyclopedia), so it is not exactly an English word. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 06:05, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Instead of deleting it why don't people who know about the subject of russian knights/warriors, simply improve the article. Because after all there were such a thing as "Russian" Knights and they <b>were</b> different in appearence from the European and other slavic ones.I have seen and read some books (mostly in Russian) which contain information about Russian Knights, which meens that they did exist. Unfortunatly there simply is no name such as "samurai" to describe Russia's particular type of knight. Also, on a side note, I have seen various figurines of <b>Russian</b> Knights posted on the internet and in stores, so obviously people must recognize that they have existed.<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenrin13_e688.html" title="User talk:Henrin13">user talk:Henrin13</a>
<dl>
<dd>There were Russian warriors. There were no Russian knights, just as there were no Mongolian knights, no Egyptian knights, no Papua knights. One may call the figurines of lightly armored Russian warriors "Russian knights" to boost their business, but it is not for encyclopedia. the word "knight" has certain complex associations, not transferrable unto early military of Rus.

<li>Alright, then what would everyone say if an article on the <b>Russian Warrior</b> was created? I hope no one would have a problem with that. I just want to educate people on the fact that Russia also had warriors. The article isn't finished by the way. I just started it and was planning to write about certain battles and warriors of Kievan Rus, Novgorod, Muscovy, ect. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenrin13_e688.html" title="User talk:Henrin13">user talk:Henrin13</a>

<dd>You will probably run into several troubles with this as well, from other people. I will not go into detail, but there are three problems with this title (not to say about a trifle that the proper style would be Russian warrior). First, a "politically correct" term would be "Early East Slavic", rather than Russian (judging from your intentions). Second, there was no single kind of "warrior"; there were many categories of them, both by social organization and by specialty. Third, all this was changing with time. So I strongly suspect that this title is way too general for your knowledge. Finally, I would not strongly objects against the current article either, but if you excuse me, it is so naively incorrect, primarily by the above three reasons. So I will strongly suggest to use some serious sources, rather than Internet sites. There is so much garbage, lots of Russian pseudohistry, because there is no <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a> in the internet, everyone publishes their petty theories, some of which are really crazy, e.g., explanation of the name "Rus" from the meanings of the sounds "r", "u", "s". 00:04, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you for your opinion. Like I said before if anyone would like to help save this article then feel free to do so.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have a few problems with this article... most of which have already been enumerated above. It's unsourced and seems to have a large element of original research. It is also non-verifiable... and the term appears to be a neologism. That being said, I understand what the author is trying to do here, but as pointed out, is it correct to call this facet of the Slavic military at that time "Knights"? From what I'm reading in this article, they don't appear to bear any real resemblance to what the definition of a knight is. Even calling it Russian Warrior is problematic because of the problems pointed out above, but also because it is unclear to me how "Russian Warrior" merits distinct mention over say "Polish Warrior" or "Chinese Warrior". The term is also detached from the time period you are trying to target. A better route might be to create an article on Early East Slavic Warfare, or something along those lines where you could detail the things that set Early East Slavic military tactics, arms, and armor apart from any other military organizations of the time period... provided you can properly source this of course. You could also make mention of the bogatyr motif, etc. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:11, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Do not delete.</i> Hello. I am themanwhofellasleep's sister and I wrote the article. Notable? Well, fairly. He's written for radio in Britain, and as the article mentions, he is about to have his first novel published (hopefully with a foreword by Julie Burchill). As the article states, the website has been covered in large chunks of the UK press: the Guardian, the Sunday Times, Independent on Sunday, San Francisco Chronicle, Zoo Magazine, Word Magazine and he has a regular column in Time Out London. The reason I added him was that I saw Rob Manuel of B3ta on here, and I figured that if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for Greg. Surely the point of Wikipedia is that it can be far more exhaustive and detailed than other, offline encyclopedia? <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDis_embodied_723c.html" title="User:Dis embodied">Dis_embodied</a> (UTC), author of the article}}</li>
<li><i>Do not delete.</i> I'm a big fan of Greg's work, and know many others with similar enthusiasm for it. He is referred to surprisingly often on the internet, occasionally without a link to his site; the page here is useful for more detail. Greg may currently be a somewhat obscure artist, but this will in all likelihood change in the near future with the launch of his book and his continuing media contributions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jackjordan334 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackjordan334_fe88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackjordan334">contribs</a>) 18:32, 5 October 2005 (UTC), his only edit.</small></li>
<li><i>Do not delete.</i>The question of whether the article falls foul of Vanity Information guidelines has been raised (whether the subject is "Typical" or "Noteworthy").

<li><a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>. Why would anyone go to that much trouble to fake those press clippings? I personally remember seeing the Grauniad one, and the regular appearances in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Out_dcb6.html" title="Time Out">Time Out</a>. Plus remember not everything is available online, and I doubt these scans will be found anywhere else. In the case of websites I personally believe offline coverage implies greater notability.

<li>Assuming good faith has no application here. Please read the page that you are referring to and refamiliarize yourself with what it is actually about. It deals with editors contributing to Wikipedia, <i>not</i> with people publishing stuff out in the Big Wide World. <i>That</i> is dealt with in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:reliable sources</a>. Your question was already answered in what I wrote above. I once again point to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Kane_a13f.html" title="Jamie Kane">Jamie Kane</a>. Anyone who always uncritically assumes supposed third-party coverage, that is supplied by the subject of that coverage xyrself on xyr own web site rather than from an independent source or the actual third party, to be true, is being far too credulous. Anyone who thinks that people don't make up things and post them on their own web sites is being naive. Looking for <i>multiple sources that are independent from the subject</i> is as much good encyclopaedism as it is good journalism. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:39, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's a waste trying to explain things to some, who don't wish to listen. With any reason I give, you'll say "but that applies to lots of schools". When people nominate tiny municipalities (smaller than this high school), I don't see similiar demands for specifics. The fact a municipality has the same signficance as other municipalities, which are notable, is a reason to keep it. By the same token, its reasonable to beleive this school is as legitimate a topic for an article as most other high schools. You assume, by default, this high school, is as unimportant as any other high school. I, assume, it's as important as any other high school. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't assume that you know what my assumptions are&#160;:) Why would I ask for reasoning if I wasn't willing to evaluate the response? Perhaps the problem is that the "schools are inherently notable" argument is extremely weak, and does not stand up to detailed scrutiny. Faced with defeat in a reasoned debate, people voting keep for a school <i>because</i> it's a school invent all sorts of excuses to <i>not</i> justify their position. It is quite obvious from the present state of AfD's that assumptions of inherent notability are doing far more harm then good to Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 21:49, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

People need to be able find the school, in order to be able add info about it. Also if/when somebody adds a detail, like an actual notable alum, are they going to add that to the town's article instead of a school article?

<li>Why respond to a comment, without addressing the point about categories? The prior voter suggested a merge (you want a delete). Now, deletionists, while consistently wrong, are at least consistent. My comment, was about mergers, who wish to toss information, in various places, sometimes in town article, sometimes in district articles, and sometimes in its own article. This makes categories useless for finding information. It's pointless having information in wikipedia, if it's not where it can be easily found. Also, the "crystal ball" reference is silly, since I'm not suggesting we make a prediction in the article. However, we certainly can make allowances for future article improvement, in advance. We should organize information in a way, that allows for it to be found and updated, in an effecicient and reliable manner; which in this case, means a separate article. I don't call that a crystal ball. But, of course, if we blindly mass-delete articles, we needn't worry about organization. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:27, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Thats more like it. An encyclopedia does not need to have full coverage of every school in the world to be "complete" - that's a Yellow Pages standard of "completion". Ideally, it should convey the general principles of organised education, and give more detailed treatment to particularly notable schools. The coverage <b>will</b> be biased, by design, against non-notable schools. Note that including every school by default is also a form of bias (just like the current standards of AfD are biased in favour of keeping). So it's not necessarily a bad thing. Semi-random? I doubt it. Do you mean because AfD's depend in who happens accross them? In which case the solution is to fix the AfD process, as opposed to claiming inherent notability status for schools (which would actually create the bias and inconsistency that you seem opposed to).--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is not supposed be a selective encyclopedia, or it wouldn't aim to have every Simpons episode.

<li>But Wikipedia <i>is</i> selective - otherwise why are we bothering with AfD?&#160;:) To further that point, while there may be an article on every Simpsons episode, there isn't one for every TV show, because not all are as notable as the Simpsons.

<li>You're labelling people again. There is a difference between asserting the weakness of an argument, and demonstrating it by means of argument, and by pointing to the acrimony that the concept of inherent notability has brought to AfD. If you disagree with arguments against inherent notability, refute them, instead of trying to stifle them by references to civility and NPA guidelines that are frequently violated by both sides. I have always been concerned that the concept of inherent notability with regards to schools is doing far more harm than good, and have yet to see evidence or argument to the contrary.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:39, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>To be fair, "the concept of inherent notability" didn't bring this acrimony to AFD, and if it went away today, there'd be towns and webcomics and roads and whatever people start arguing about next. People <i>on both sides</i> are personalizing these debates, and then lashing out in what they see as justified retaliation. Other people lash back, and both people see themselves as aggrieved (and nothing is accomplished in the meantime).

<li>This entire exchange illustrates how pointless all of this "discussion" truly is. The fact is, that those who routinely vote to delete school articles (since you don't like "labelling"), such as <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a>, come to the debate with an equally pre-conceived philosophy, ie. "Educational instutions are <b>not</b> noteworthy in and of themselves, simply by virtue of their being educational institutitons. Other characteristics of such institutions need to be established in order to consider them noteworthy". This position is <b>every bit as much</b> a pre-conception, and opinion-oriented, inherently unjustified philosophical position as the position held by myself and others that: "Educational institutions by virtue of the importance they hold solely as institutions of learning (public or private) carry a noteworthiness to society and the culture by their existence and delivery of education. No other defining or illustrative characteristics are necessary to establish their noteworthiness and thusly their eligibility for inclusion in Wikipedia" (otherwise known as the "schools are inherently notable" view). It clearly, (after hundreds and hundreds of VfD/AfD on schools in the last 2 years) is a <b>matter of opinion</b> over which we <b>fundamentally</b> disagree on the philosophical nature of the issue. Wikipedians accept (for the most part) that *MANY* things are inherently notable: Battleships, Towns (even with miniscule or insignificant populations), Countries, Train stations, Submarines, Simpsons episodes, etc etc etc etc. There simply is no objective standard to determine if and whether schools are inherently notable - either you believe it, or you don't, and most people (even those unwilling to admit it) come to the debate over schools with one or the other position in mind. As to all of the other arguments for and against, we have debated them over and over and over and over and over. They have been regurgitated, re-invigorated, rehabilitated, re-ventilated, swalllowed and re-gurgitated again and guess what - NO FORMAL CONCENSUS EXISTS - gee what a surprise. Whether or not people state "schools are inherently notable" has virtually nothing to do with it. It has to do with a philosophical approach to whether or not schools, in their own right, justify having an article on Wikipedia (just like towns, battleships, countries, pokemons, etc.) or if you believe some other characteristic is required. Saying "schools are inherently notable" is, frankly, just a way of cutting through all the bullshit of these pointless arguments over and over and over and over. We already know that no formal concensus has or will be reached. "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" continue to nominated and continue to vote to delete (all the while knowing the nominations and the votes will fail to get the article delete) and "Those who routinely vote to keep school articles" continue to vote to keep them. 85%-90% of all nominated school articles in the past year <b>have survived the VfD/AfD process</b> and the great majority of them do so because at least a plurality of editors who vote believe that schools are "inherently noteworthy" and thusly deserving of an article. The <b>real</b> acrimony exists because "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" refuse to accept these results and continue nominating school articles for deletion in what is quite clearly a vain attempt to get even one school article deleted (as much has even been stated by one or more of the usual suspects). All tactics have been tried, multi-nominations, mass-nominations, region or country specific nominations, and they all fail. While there may be contention and disagreement over school articles, one thing is an incontrovertable <b>fact</b> - school articles do not get deleted on Wikipedia because they are "non-notable". You may not like the policies or the processes of AfD, or the results that they generate - but that is the way that WP works. Certainly, school AfD pages are not the place to hash out differences of opinion over the AfD process. This is the tool we have - and it is working. The results are so completely overwhelming that it <b>might as well be policy</b> - "School articles are not deleted on WP simply because they are 'non-notable'". You might disagree, but in practice it is already a fact - the best thing at this point is to accept it. Accepting the results over the last year, <b>will</b> end the acrimony over these articles. There can be no question, that as articles continue to not be deleted at AfD that it is pointless to continue nominating them on the basis that they are "non-notable". Nominating a school article that you know, in advance, will <b>never</b> be deleted on the basis of its lack of noteworthiness engenders acrimony and wastes everyone's time (including your own)- <b>EVEN IF YOU THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE HERE</b>. In summary, "Those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" must accept the results - schools simply aren't deleted on WP because they are "non-notable", like it or not, it's a <b>fact</b>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:46, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You've overlooked an important distinction - I treat all articles equally, and single out no particular class of article for special treatment. Every article I've voted to delete has failed to prove it is worthy to be here. Every article I've voted to keep, I have done so on its merits. To me, no article is inherently notable, and each has to be individually meritous, be they schools, battleships, or Simpsons episodes. Inherent notability is being used as a crutch to sidestep proper discussion.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 02:02, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, that is balderdash. I doubt very much that you look at an article about a nation-state (like say, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Marino_54a0.html" title="San Marino">San Marino</a>) and make a decision on whether or not it "should" have an article on Wikipedia on it's own merits (and if you do, than the absurdity of your position is manifest). Anyone who sees an article about a nation-state on Wikipedia rightly concludes that it has a place here, irrespective of it's "notability" because it's status as a nation-state confers inherent notability upon it, regardless of it's size, population, impact on world affairs, or any other <b>subjective</b> assessment of it's relative "notability". The assumption made by almost anyone who looks at an article about a nation-state is that it is inherently notable. Even if you do hypothetically assess nation-states in this way, it makes no difference whatsoever. Your insistence that others use your deletion philosophy is condescending and elitist. Other editors are (and should be) free to determine for themselves that certain groups or classes of things (like nation-states) possess inherent characteristics of noteworthiness as a legitimate philosophical approach to building a comprehensive encyclopedia. Your assertion that "your way is superior" is noted, but I just think you are plum wrong. Certain classes of things <b>are</b> inherently notable, and I believe one of those classes of things is schools. To try to suggest that those of us who hold and advance a certain philosophical view about notability in good faith, are to blame for the acrimony in this debate is both false and irresponsible. Despite all of this (pointless) back and forth, your response still refuses to respond or take accountability for the main point of my obscure and lengthy dissertation above in the first place. That is, that "School articles are <b>not</b> deleted on Wikipedia on the basis of being "non-notable"." As I have stated, this is a <b>fact</b>. The obvious question that arises is, "Since schools are not deleted on this criteria, why is it that 'those who routinely nominate and vote for school deletion' continue in their pointless and arguably bad-faith crusade to delete school articles "on their own merits", when it is <b>clearly</b> contrary to what the obvious outcome of these attempts will be? I am not simply trying to be rhetorical here - I am asking for a legitimate explanation from the other side, why they are continuing to nominate and vote to delete in the face of the <b>overwhelming</b> history of VfD/AfD results that demonstrate that school articles simply do not get deleted on the basis of being "non-notable" or being a stub?? Please, please explain what is achieved by repeating this process over and over and over? At this point, "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" aren't even making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> anymore. Of the last 100 or so schools nominated for AfD, the <b>only</b> candidate that was successfully deleted was an article about a school that didn't exist, which was created by an editor who "routinely votes to delete school articles" on the basis of their lack of notability. You think your approach of "determining how to vote on each article according to it's merits" is better than my system? Well good for you. Just tell me what the point of all this is when the school articles in question will <b>not</b> be deleted?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:47, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Apples to Oranges. You're comparing schools to countries. If it were possible to have several million countries in the world, I'm sure we could argue that some are not notable enough to be mentioned here. The point is that if concepts of inherent notability were not used, we could have a reasoned evaluation of each school on it's own merits, and then those that don't deserve an article can be deleted. If schools truly are as important as you assert, what's the harm in dropping inherent notability?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 04:10, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Substitute "official municipality" for "country", and the example works fine. There are countless municipalities, with a much smaller population than this high school; which are all auto-included.

<li>Hey, if a municipality with 5 people in it had come up on AfD, I'd vote to delete it as well. I'll state it again - if these subjects are truly so obviously important, why is the concept of inherent notability required to defend them? Finally, you can't accuse me of wasting time if you're also here - by your definition, if there was no opposition to a delete vote, there would be no time "wasted" either&#160;:)--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 23:00, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Possible micro-agreement: If somebody creates an article for 5 kids in there mom's homeschool, I'll likely delete it. I guarentee you, that you will never, be able to vote delete on multiple real muniicpalities with any real powers, however small they may be (at least in North America). I have wasted time in these school AFDs, mainly at the request of those demanding explanations, that they're not satisified with. But, a vastly greater waste of time would occur, if schools started being deleted. All the time I (and others) spent, creating and improving articles, would be lost. I'm forced to decide which is a bigger waste: time in AFD or loosing the time spent creating/editing school articles. You on the other hand, have no need to waste any time, whatsoever. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:44, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Municipalities, townships, towns, etc. are kept on WP even if they have zero residents - that is settled concensus. Your statement shows your clear willingness (manifest in this very debate) to defy concensus in favour of your own opinion (which is the problem in the first place). As to wasting time, there are a number of areas where your argument is nonsense. First, by deleting articles about schools that are created by editors in good faith, you are wasting those editors' time (there are many of us that have a good faith intention to create verifiable, well-written articles about schools for Wikipedia) and waging a war against those who wish to participate in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a> in good-faith on the basis that you (and others "who routinely nominate and vote to delete schools") subjectively find such schools non-notable. The next waste of time, is crying foul everytime someone (like me) who has explained their reasoning on schools a thousand times (ok, a hundred times) to explain and justify <b>every</b> vote on <b>every</b> school. Some of us are tired of screaming at the brick wall that is "those who routinely nominate and vote to delete school articles" and just vote <b>bicycle</b>. The next waste of time is your own. Nominating school articles <b>that will not be deleted</b> for AfD is an undeniable waste of time that is only perpetuated in order to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. I have asked repeatedly for some justification why nominations and voting and arguing to delete school articles persists, when if nothing else can be agreed upon, it surely could be that as a matter of precedent, school articles are <b>not</b> deleted on WP on the basis of "non-notability".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:06, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is legitimate information. Ziad Mawassi is a real person and a local hero who lends his valuable time to many people in the community. He has helped many troubled teenagers by giving them a knowledge and experience in the automotive industry. Ziad Mawassi improved the quality of my life when he transformed my classic Ford into a show winner, as he has to many others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has he appeared in any newspaper articles or anything of that sort which would prove what you've told us? --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 11:19, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I can also attest to Ziads quality of work. Previously having bad experiences with another restorator, i had a meeting with Ziad to discuss my options with my vehicle. Noting his professional behaviour and vast knowledge of the industry, i decided to trust him with my pride and joy. The final results were unimaginable. Even i couldnt envision such a quality job!</p>
<p>I would also like to state how much Ziad has contributed to our community. Realising that his success has been hugely a result of our community, he now strives to give back what he can. Quite often he has been a part of charity fundraising. From simple ordeals, to larger-scale projects, such as restoring cars to be sold off to raise funds.</p>
<p>I can not stress enough the faith i have in Ziad Mawassi, and his level of character.</p>
<p>I can and will definately hold my flag up high and show support that Ziad Mawassi as a genuine person. I can surely solemly swear that he singlehandedly "tricked up" my show winning Datsun Fairlady roadster. 2 Cheers for ziad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hooray!!</p>

<p>This article purposefully ignores a large amount of documented, historical data, regarding the non-authenticity and non-acceptance of the Zohar that does (and did) exist within the current and previous generations of the observant, Jewish world. Also, the article minimalizes the truth by using many emotive words, that display a terrible level of bias, and assume the truth and acceptance of the Zohar (from the start), while totally ignoring many strong and real arguments that have been made since its inception. Objective words like "claim" and "purport to" are totally left out of the discussion, when they rightfully should be the terms of choice. In addition, the author picks and chooses from an extremely limited level of chosen arguments (against his own position), which he/she then immediately answers in an extremely non-scholarly fashion, that leaves out the true complexities of the original objections that have been made over the past 1,000 years. In short, this reads more like an advertisement for book publishers of the Zohar than it does for an encyclopedic article. And whoever this author is, he is lightning quick to replace a copy of his original article back on line, after edits have been attempted. This just is not fair!</p>
<hr />
<p>--Concepts (such as the position of the Zohar in Jewish Law) are totally glossed over, without any serious attention to it at all. The author makes it appear that the Zohar was universally accepted. Any old, legitimate, and dissenting opinions appear totally insignificant in selling of this article. Nor does he/she mention these specific objections. Only his/her own, which he/she is able to answer.</p>
<p>--The four main legitimate positions in today's observant Jewish world are ignored -- which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>- Partial acceptance: (portions of the work may be old and midrashic but not written by rabbi Shimon ben Yohai)</li>
<li>- Some may may have been written by him, and some was not.</li>
<li>- All was written by him</li>
<li>- None was written by him</li>
</ol>
