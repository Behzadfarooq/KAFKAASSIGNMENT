<p>While 'I know the original author and he wants this article gone' isn't all that valid a reason; Mr. Phillips could get on Wikipedia himself and make his own case if he were so determined (and assuming this is taken responsibly, like it should, he just might eventually). So instead, consider this: this article contributes nothing toward Wikipedia in terms of actual encyclopedic material. I am of the mind that this article will NEVER be edited or expanded to the extent that it WOULD deserve recognition as a worthwhile article for Wiki. Given the topic of the article outright, deletion should be obvious - it's an eight-year-old internet comic with no notable history in the past five years, and the article does less to describe the comic than to describe what Josh Phillips hasn't done with it, which can just as easily go on a personal page for him (assuming THAT would even be relevant to Wikipedia). Larger and more notable webcomics, ones that have actually been popular in the here and now, aren't even being allowed to remain on Wiki, and an argument that Avalon has won WCCA awards in the past should be groundless, given that the WCAA article itself is up for deletion. At the very least, I am requesting that some consistency be shown across the board for webcomic deletion, especially given that this article deserves it more; this should not remain as a testament to nostalgia. I understand that this sort of thing isn't smiled upon here. True.mcdohl 19:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>No; that was a premature book announcement made by <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>.

<li><b>Comment regarding the books:</b> If anyone still has the book they purchased, I'd be surprised if it was still in one piece -- the binding was terrible, never mind the print quality. I have to admit the real evidence of this publication attempt is the stack of two dozen books on my shelf that I couldn't successfully repair. The initial sales run was cut short when the publishing quality was revealed, and I recall there was a significant number of customers who tried and failed to obtain refunds (it also says a lot that I, the book's author, could not get reliable info on sales and distribution). No ISBN was ever registered for the book, and it was only sold directly from the publisher, Maverick Camel, so I doubt any official record of the publication could ever be found -- hence my original comment that no evidence of the publication existed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaedtler_f122.html" title="User:Staedtler">Staedtler</a> 04:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> The comic is notable as one of several that contributed to the rise and popularization of the webcomic. It won awards, and was incredibly popular in its day.
