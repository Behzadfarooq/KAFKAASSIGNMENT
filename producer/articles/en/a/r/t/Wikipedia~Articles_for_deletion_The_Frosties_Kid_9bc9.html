<p>This article has been going through a pointless revert war due to aggressive editing from certain editors, the fact that it is now only 3 lines serves no purpose, nor is it useful to anyone trying to find out more information relating to the subject or phenomenon of "The Frosties Kid", basically there is no reason to have this article when all the content pertaining to the subject matter is not present. The discussions in the talk page have resulted to no consensus so now I am putting it up for deletion to see what the redeeming qualities are to keep such a pointless installment to WP. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 00:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, please do not try to make this personal. I couldn't care less about the article as it stands. I put it up for nom. because as it stands (as I have explained) it is not notable, nor bears purpose as a decent WP article therefore it should be deleted in my opinion. There is insufficient information relating to this subject, being an article relating to the protagonist <b>The Frosties Kid</b> when there isn't even a full name for the actor or any other information and evidence given other than <b>3 lines of text</b> which hardly inform of anything. It should be deleted because it is not a worthy article, the three sentences are very vague and do not possess any possible information that contribute to the article or subject. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 02:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> this is not a content disagreement this is a disagreement for such an article which hold no decent content relating to the subject matter to be included within WP. This as of now is basic internet cruft. If the article is changed to "The Frosties Kid Commercial" or moved to Frosties cereal and the three lines moved into that article then fine. But as a stand alone vague article it does not belong here according to the guidelines. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 02:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please don't try to "stuff the ballot box"; for one thing, the process is immune to this (decisions are made on the strength of arguments rather than vote count), and for another your nomination has already explained your argument enough that repeating it here as an additional "vote" isn't necessary. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 02:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, once again you're making things out to be as they aren't I am not "stuffing the ballot box" if this article is kept fine, I put my vote because when I put it up for nomination I forgot to state I wanted it deleted.

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> The Frosties kid is an advertsment and has notability. My own thoughts are that it should be regarded as a notable advertisment rather than a spiel about a kid none of us know. Their are no less than 5 ADMINS involved with the article and every ADMIN seems to think that EVERYONE must be a 13yr old kid who adds to the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, once again I will state the facts as they stand. It's true that the Frosties Kid is an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">internet phenomenon</a> but this is not present in the article. And regardless what mboverload or any other editor who has been associated to the ongoing mess that is a discussion about this article says, the proposed substitution articles are hardly useful or according to the title. If you want to make an article relating to the commercial than do it by all means, but this one is NOT about the commercial. Let's try again <b>THE FROSTIES KID</b> should be an article relating to the character, perhaps the phenomenon relating or not relating to him and anything between. It is not an excuse to write three lines where, the first describes the ad and the last describes the jingle and there is no purpose for it. When there is no purpose for the content relating to an article it is void of being useful or having a point, and in this case I continue to say this article is pointless. I would agree to either <b>MERGE</b> with <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frosted_Flakes_fc2c.html" title="Frosted Flakes">Frosted Flakes/Frosties</a> article - seeing as it would fit into a "popular culture" or "trivia" section. Otherwise delete and remake an article based on the appropiate subject matter i.e. the commercial <b>itself</b> and not some ambiguous character here that has hardly any information relating to it (supposedly). <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 11:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This Afd concerns how the article is steered whether (1)it should be about an ADVERTISEMENT or (2)about a kid who happens to appear in an advertisement (who despite all the wealth of information the Internet gives us is nameless). Not sure how copyvio comes into it. It (as the article stands as I write this) includes a short summary of the subject matter of the advert (albeit pointless when readers are directed to a well written full synopsis) and a screen grab (properly listed as FAIR USE ONLY). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 19:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the best of my knowledge the lyrics have not appeared in the article for over 14 days. Afd is not a "vote" and yes it is an invitation for comment. The idea of an Encylopedia is not cut and dry, all encyclopedias have many contributors, and many styles of writing. Until 2 hours ago, I had no idea that <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Dude_0940.html" title="Dell Dude">Dell Dude</a> existed. On our side of the pond <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell_Dude_0940.html" title="Dell Dude">Dell Dude</a> isn't well known - should I raise that as AfD?

Esse est percipi (To be is to be perceived)</dd>
<dd>Comment can create changes in perception. I am all in favour of that. My decision that I agree with the originator of this AfD was that the article was replaced by an idea I posted in a sandbox, that the article should be steered in another direction. It was never decided upon, despite constant discussion. If this AfD is moving to arguments about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> then my stance changes. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 22:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This AfD was raised about a content dispute and the direction/steering of the article. If this AfD is about notability, then please see <a href="../../../f/r/o/Talk%7EFrosted_Flakes_c8e7.html" title="Talk:Frosted Flakes">Talk:Frosted Flakes</a> discussion about the frosties kid were raised 5 weeks ago after constant vandalism to the site. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 22:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's exactly the problem. AFD is not the place to resolve content disputes. AFD is an invitation for comments on whether or not an article should be deleted, yes, but it is not a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request For Comment</a>, which is, I think, what Toffile meant in his comment above. If issues relating to this article could not be resolved on the article's talk page, it's time to go to the next step in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a>. But Picraft's nom, combined with some of his comments on the article's talk page immediately before he nominated the page, suggest that, as Mboverload said, he nominated the page because he was displeased with the way the discussion was going. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=66258379&amp;oldid=66257615" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=66258379&amp;oldid=66257615" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66259230" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Frosties_Kid&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=66259230" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Abuse_of_deletion_process" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Abuse_of_deletion_process</a>. This is why I and a few other editors have voted for a speedy keep - this is an out-of-process nomination.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Editors are always free to suggest deletion for concerns other than those raised in the nomination. The most common deletion vote is 'per nom,' but that doesn't mean that every deletion vote must agree with the nominator's reasoning. If the article is deleted, it won't matter who supported what course of action and why, so if you think the article should be deleted, and so does Toffile, why does it matter if you don't agree on the reason? -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 00:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I feel a little foolish now. User:Piecraft:Piecraft and <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJum4_3697.html" title="User:Jum4">Jum4</a> had disputes with several admins about RV to the point where 5 admins were involved and the article was locked for a week. it sat as 3 lines, which could have sat on any article and nobody would have noticed them. The last frosties kid article was a speedy delete on july 7th. (i was not involved with that and neither was Jum4, who started this present article on july 8th) My only involvement with the article has been on the talk page or RV when spurious unsourced comments and sections have been added. Prior to the locking, the article was constantly vandalised like <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frosted_Flakes_fc2c.html" title="Frosted Flakes">Frosted Flakes</a>, some guy even posted me with a test3 on my user page. AfD is probably not the right way to have dealt with the matter. But if the article were to be deleted because I voted because I agreed <b>Per nom</b> then it would greatly matter to me if it was deleted as a matter of copyvio or notability, which haven't been largely discussed. But thanks <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">User Talk VARY</a> for the explanation about how AfD works. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike33_94a4.html" title="User:Mike33">Mike33</a> 02:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I repeat, the article has been put up for deletion <b>not</b> for content dispute, but for the fact that at the time I put it up for deletion the article no longer referred to the <b>subject</b> of <b>title</b> that the article should have been discussing. It's all very well to go on about how we should have discussed it on the talk page or resolved it on <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution</a>, but bear in mind I was the one who had already requested admins to lock this article down when the article was being carelessly reverted and "vandalised" to the extent of going <i>nowhere</i>. And when the article was once again changed to the revisions of 14:01, 28 July 2006 which if anything were already considered to be acceptable by other users. If such an article was to be acceptable it would need to be more than a pointless stub relating information about an ad and the jingle when it is supposed to be relating to <b>THE FROSTIES KID</b>. Wikipedia is not a repository for pointless articles to take up space, now if I need to once again repeat my reasons for nom then you seriously need to check up on the regulatins yourself. This nomination is <b>not</b> about notability but the fact that the article is pointless and of no use. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 09:18, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Keep, Move and Stub</b> . "Useless article" is no excuse for blasting the article straight. Then, all stubs would be gone. How about this: move it to <i><b>They're Gonna Taste Great! (advert)'</b>, and write about the advert, it's content, audience and audience reaction. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 15:30, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> the article was not originally a stub, and the stub that you are relating to did not have any room for expansion, so please leave your assumptions aside when misinformed. The fact that I branded the article "useless" was for those following reasons. Thank you. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 21:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Easy now, I was referring to granting it Stub status after, as you suggested, removing any unverifiable information and beginning afresh. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrD_808e.html" title="User:MrD">MrD</a> 01:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
