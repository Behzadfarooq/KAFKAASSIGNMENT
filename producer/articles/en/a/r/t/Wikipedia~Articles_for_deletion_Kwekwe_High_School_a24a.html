<li>An assertion of notability generally involves more than saying something that's in the article title. Can I create a blank article Olmsted Island High School and say it should be kept because, well, it's a high school, and that's notable? There are tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands, of high schools on the planet. They don't all get to have a meaningless one sentence stub article merely stating their location. See <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Blair_High_School_d411.html" title="Montgomery Blair High School">Montgomery Blair High School</a> for a good example of a high school article that <i>does</i> assert its notability. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 05:30, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>As you probably know, many people think high schools are notable. The article says that this is a high school. Therefore the article asserts the notability of the topic. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:24, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's a terribly circular argument, and is based on a very bad logical flaw. "Many people think X implies Y. Given X, then Y." Most people once thought the Sun orbited around the Earth, too.

<li><b>Keep</b> article has only existed for about a week. It does currently have three sentences of seemingly factual information. On that, this AfD should be dropped. Nonetheless, the assertion that an article topic only has x amount of google hits surely should not be the standard for notability. Kappa clearly made a point regarding the role in internet access in relation to articles here. We have tons of articles on a significant amount of schools in the US, and the only thing notable about them is that they are schools in the US. If those schools can have articles for being a school, then clearly this school should be treated on an equal footing. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 06:32, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Contributions are not necessarily positive. Spreading information out in a thousand articles padded with ephemera is not useful if someone isn't after the ephemera. If that's your aim, well we've got that already, it's called the internet. We shouldn't be judging things on what theoretical position we have previously decided to hold, we should be judging things on what is most useful to a user of Wikipedia right now - not in some theoretical utopian future when a million other articles have been added. Of course, since I'm asking for a judgement call, judgement will differ. But I'm asking people to judge, not just say "It Has Been Written". <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 22:22, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly please remember that the people of Zimbabwe, who overwhelmingly do <i>not</i> have the internet, are the most likely to want to read about this school. In a theoretical future when a million other articles have been added, and if a decent proportion of them are about schools in Zimbabwe, it would be less harmful to bury this info in the town article. Right now users need to be able to find it, and they need to know that more information like this is welcome. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:20, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, firstly you should consider that the population of Kwekwe are the most likely to want to read about the school, and such people are likely to have the intelligence to notice that Kwekwe High School is in Kwekwe. If you really think people would be unable to grasp such a concept, you could put in a redirect, which I believe is the standard move when information is merged. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:23, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When there are only two articles about schools in Zimbabwe, the most likely people to want to read either of them is people interested in schools in Zimbabwe in general, not those schools in particular. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:49, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "It says it's a high school, how is that not an assertion of notability?" Will we ever see the end of nonsense like this? There are indeed a few notable schools on the planet; to state that schools are notable merely for being schools ignores the fact that things are notable relative to other things. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 20:43, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is hardly nonsense, it is a completely sound and reasonable statement to make, in light of the fact that <i>not one</i> single verifiable high school article has been deleted as a result of the 350+ schools nominated for deletion during the past year. Learn to live in harmony. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 20:52, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That not one single school has not been deleted speaks not at all to sensibility, but rather to the action of a cabal. I will allow you to get off your high horse before I remind you that I have not voted to delete a single school in the time there has been discussion ongoing at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. Such comments as yours, however, could cause me to reconsider my position. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 01:42, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that "not one single school has been deleted in a year" is not relevent to the discussion. Most normal people have run away from the school AfF's because they are a complete waste of time. The school inclusionists have won by attrition and apathy and more importantly because rationale people, such as Denni, are not fighting the inevitable and trying to find a working solution to schools. Such a solution would prevent schools coming to AFD in the first place. The fact that the some are still on a high horse speaks volumes to the goals of the project. When will the adversarial interactions be replaced by something constructive? Again, the inevitable, "all schools are kept" is NOT a consensus it is a default. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 17:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>"When will the adversarial interactions be replaced by something constructive?" - good question, I'm disappointed that we are exchanging words like "nonsense" and rehashing the same old arguments for the millionth time, I thought we could have moved on by now. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure where that feeling of disappointment might come from, Kappa. Your participation in the discussions at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> was more than a tad underwhelming. Why do you suppose we're rehashing the same old arguments? I propose it is because the group of inclusionists seeking to keep school articles has not (with the notable exception of <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a>) made any effort whatsoever to compromise on school articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 00:34, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>To be fair that is because Kappa actually does clean up the articles that come through Afd and makes them into fairly decent stubs. However, kappa can't do every school article himself. Merge without losing information is a fine compromise and one that would easily stop AFD nominations. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 19:15, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
