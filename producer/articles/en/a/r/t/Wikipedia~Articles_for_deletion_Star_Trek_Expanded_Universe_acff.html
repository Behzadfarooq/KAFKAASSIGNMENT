<p>This article should be deleted as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">Neologism</a>. Besides the many times the term is used on wikipedia itself, the term "star trek expanded universe" (as opposed to star wars expanded universe) does not seem to be used much if at all. Why are Star Wars novels called "an expanded universe" instead of novelizations, fan fiction, adapatations, etc.? Its because of the peculiar attempt at maintaining a continuity with each other above all else. This phenomenon does not occour nearly as much in Star trek derivative fiction, which makes little to no effort to be referential to other works of star trek derivative fiction. Original research: none of the statements cite sources, and seem very suspect to me in terms of being actually based on published books. In addition, I'm sure contradictory explanations of many things in this article were made by different novels, to focus on one implies it being the correct explanation which implies a non neutral POV. Fancruft: this article is fancruft, although absolutely atrocious fancruft articles such as styles of lightsabre combat have been previously kept. -posted by an anon ip user on 12 Jul 2005</p>

<dd>From original proposer of delete: Thanks for everyones comments. I change my proposal from <i>delete</i>, to <i>merge</i> INTO the article "star trek, other storylines". The reason: doing so avoids the neologistic and possibily misleading term "star trek expanded universe". This would then also eliminate the implied opinion of any book or storyline being mentioned in the article as being the "real", "canon", or "in-continuity" version of a story. Some people have been saying that "star trek expanded universe" brings up around 200 hits in google but a large amount are wikipedia mirrors, the second most common is refrence to a pen and paper rpg called "Star trek: expanded universe".
<dl>
<dd>As I see that as pretty much the same as withdrawing the nomination to delete the article, I move this be closed as a KEEP result. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 04:47, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, sounds like a withdrawal of the delete request. The merge request can be handled on the talk pages but I will say right now that I'll vehemently oppose the merge. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 19:46, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>: This article reflects a large amount of information that has been put forth in <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_Books_4ac4.html" title="Pocket Books">Pocket Books</a> over the past 25 years and also speaks of a concept that was purposed by <a href="../../../d/2E/c/D.C._Fontana_eb50.html" title="D.C. Fontana">D.C. Fontana</a>, one of the leading authors of Star Trek. I agree that sources could be added but that is not at all a reason for deletion. This article is not by any means original research and is certianly not "neologism". In addition, "fancruft" is not a reason to delete a page as we have all seen at: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia_eccd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Starfleet ranks and insignia">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Starfleet ranks and insignia</a>. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 12:34, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I've never worked on any Star Trek or Star Wars articles, so I've got no dog in this race, but the idea of deleting this article is ridiculous.

The content here should be made into a subsection of that article, with the resulting article left at STEU, or a better term if anyone can come up with one. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> - <a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorwen_11fb.html" title="User talk:Morwen">Talk</a> 13:03, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> as above. Lucas and his minions specifically call Star Wars additions the "Expanded Universe". Star Trek has no such similar title.

<li><b>Keep, possible rename</b>. Agreed that the TERM <i>"Star Trek expanded universe"</i> doesn't seem to be used much. However, the concept that authors have written about the ST universe beyond what we see in the TV shows/movies is certainly a concept worthy of an encyclopedia article, given the popularity of those works. I can't think of a better name for that concept, personally; maybe someone should go ask the Trekkies what they call it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek%2C_other_storylines_8ee4.html" title="Star Trek, other storylines">Star Trek, other storylines</a> is definitely a worse name (it's plain old factually incorrect, really) and should end up merged into whatever this ends up being called. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> 20:24, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> is not and absolutely should not be the final say over what the point of an "expanded universe" is.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> "Fancruft" is not a valid reason to delete an article, incurable POV, verifiability, original research and things mentioned in What Wikipedia is Not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, are valid reasons to delete, "Fancruft" is none of these. While "expanded universe" might be more used with Star Wars, there should be some term to describe the collective body of officially licensed but non-canonical materials produced for Star Trek. For lack of a better term "expanded universe" is what is used (it is officially used with Star Wars, de facto used with Star Trek). A quick Google search shows several hundred mentions of the phrase "Star Trek Expanded Universe", the vast majority of which do not appear to be direct references or copies of this article in any way, and are legitimate references to the larger body of Star Trek works outside the canonical TV and movie sources, thus the term and this article are encyclopedic and warranted in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 00:52, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
