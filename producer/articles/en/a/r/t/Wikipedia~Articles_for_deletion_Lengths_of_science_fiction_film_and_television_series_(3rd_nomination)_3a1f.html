<p><b>Delete</b> - third nomination for this list. First nomination closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_science_fiction_movie_and_television_series_6950.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of science fiction movie and television series">keep</a> and the second closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_superhero_film_and_television_series_fd08.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of superhero film and television series">no consensus</a>. It should be noted that many of the&#160;!votes to keep the article in the second AFD were based solely on the article having survived the first AFD. This ignores the actual arguments offered in the AFD and also ignores the fact that <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">consensus can change</a>. The arguments against the article as presented in the second AFD, especially the arguments offered by Serpent's Choice, continue IMHO to be much stronger than those offered in favor of keeping. With re-releases, director's cuts, newly-released deleted scenes and the like the running time of a number of these projects is open to debate. Much was made in the last AFD of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a> about the running time of Doctor Who, however, that reflects a misreading of the article. The BBC was talking about what show had been on the air longest with the most number of episodes, not what series, if all the material was run one after the other, would take the longest to get through. Note that two similar articles, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series_bd53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of fantasy film and television series">Lengths of fantasy film series</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_superhero_film_and_television_series_%282nd_nomination%29_84b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of superhero film and television series (2nd nomination)">Lengths of superhero film and television series</a>, have been deleted for just these sorts of concerns. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - For the same reason as the last two times: it is a list that people are finding useful. All the information in it can be found in other sources, such as imdb. The only thing that might be called original research is the math done to get the final number. If we can't do simple math equations, then we aren't allowed to calculate how long someone lived given their birth and death dates. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/r/c/User_talk%7EArctic.gnome_882b.html" title="User talk:Arctic.gnome">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arctic.gnome_a82a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arctic.gnome">contribs</a>)</small> 14:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether or not someone finds the list <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">useful</a> is not only not a strong argument for keeping, but the utility of the article is not offered as a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your argument is that "the running time of a number of these projects is open to debate". Well that came up on the talk page and the community came to a consensus of how to list both originals, directors cuts, remakes, and whatnot. The list has largely stabilized on those issues.

<li>But it's the main issue you mention in your nomination: you emphasized Serpent's Choice's arguments about films with edits of different lengths. This has been addressed.

"<a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">Consensus can change</a>", like "indiscriminate collection of information," are the new ways to say "<a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">I don't like it</a>", it seems. I don't see that anything has changed significantly since last month, and the <a href="../../../b/a/s/WP%7EBASH_32b5.html" title="WP:BASH">fact that you consider a delete opinion to be eloquently argued</a> is not grounds to ignore prior results or to repetitively nominate the same article for deletion until the "correct" result obtains. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First off, "consensus can change" has nothing to do with "I don't like it" and your suggesting that I'm arguing IDLI by pointing out that people can change their minds borders on an accusation of bad faith. Secondly, what's changed is that of the three similar "lengths of" articles, consensus on two of them has changed against such articles and "consensus" on this article changed from "keep" to "no consensus." It is not at all unreasonable, in the face of two of three articles of a kind being deleted and the third closed with no consensus, for discussion to continue on the third. Finally, if I were trying to ignore prior results it's pretty unlikely that I would've talked about the previous results extensively in this nomination, don't you think? Let's try to make this about the nomination and not the nominator, OK? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:21, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Sure, consensus can change, but there's no point in forcing people to make the same arguments every few months.

<li>Well, actually it <i>is</i> <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERSTUFFEXISTS_ee3f.html" title="WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS">WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS</a>. You're saying this article should exist because there's a whole category full of similar articles. Which is not compelling because anyone can write an article on anything and it will stay here until it's deleted. That's the <i>essence</i> of OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. And frankly, having looked at the Indy 500 list if it came up for deletion I'd&#160;!vote against it as meaningless data and the only reason I wouldn't vote against the Hail Mary list is because the extreme rarity of the play being successful makes it somewhat notable. There is nothing, on the other hand, notable about a TV show having a running time and the biggest piece of evidence you cited in supporting the article last time, the BBC article, doesn't support your argument at all. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The BBC article was about what the longest-running science fiction series is. That can be determined in several ways: by years on the air, by number of episodes, or by total running time.

<li><b>Additional comment</b> — the superhero and fantasy lists were deleted in part because they were not being regularly updated, and because some editors felt the genres were ill-defined. Science fiction on television and in film is a well-defined genre, and this list is regularly updated.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. That is your interpretation. Personally, I consider just about all nominations claiming that articles are "indiscriminate" or "trivial" to be far too subjective to justify erasing anyone's work, at least where (as here) the article shows signs of skill and care. These labels are unhelpful, and lead to unnecessary friction, which is perhaps what you are finding out now. I merely pointed out that a nomination that closed in February was too recent to make a convincing case that "consensus had changed." - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 03:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Except of course that consensus <i>did</i> change on one of the articles in that time. And as far as "indiscriminate" rubbing you the wrong way, considering that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> is Wikipedia policy, voting against AFDs solely because they mention that policy strikes me as demonstrating a lack of consideration of the actual nomination. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 06:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Completely significant collection of valid information, and I'd honestly not mind this list being expanded to cover a wider variety of film and television series. I wouldn't even mind a comparable version for book series if somebody wanted to develop it. This is valid information which would certainly be included in the pages on the various series in question (or are you saying that say, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> shouldn't mention how many episodes are in each version? This is merely a collation of information that will be elsewhere on Wikipedia. Why that's so objectionable, I don't know. BTW, try to be civil folks, all of you, both pro and con.

<li>I agree, this list should include more tv series and movies. Incompleteness is not a reason to delete, and this could be completed with enough work.

<li><b>Keep</b>. One thing I think the article is missing is enough justification for its existence. The BBC article on Dr. Who is certainly evidence that length of running time is notable, and I think should be cited (perhaps from the introduction) to help establish that the topic is one that is of interest. Other similar evidence would be good to add: in other words, I'd like to see just a little more text, supported by citations where possible, talking about the significance of the list in the eyes of fans (and the networks too, presumably). With that, "keep" seems the right answer: deleting the article would lose information that's clearly encyclopaedic (in the sense that it's the sort of thing one would go to an encyclopaedia to find out) and which is notable in that it's been the subject of at least one media report, and more are likely to be found. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 11:58, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
