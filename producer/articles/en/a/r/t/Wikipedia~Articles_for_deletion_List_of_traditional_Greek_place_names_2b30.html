<p>This page is simply a list of classical Greek placenames, with demotic and English translations. I see no encyclopedic content here. The names are from all over the world (and since they include <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceania.html" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>, I suspect copyvio from a Greek-English dictionary or gazeteer). This list is admittedly incomplete - and hundreds or thousands of lines could be added to it, and it would still be incomplete. It also massively uses non-compliant special characters. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:29, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

As such, Greek toponyms from Roman times are more than appropriate for what was essentially a Greco-Roman imperial culture. See also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traditional_Arabic_place_names_7cd1.html" title="List of traditional Arabic place names">List of traditional Arabic place names</a>, where there are old Arabic names even for places in Sicily and Spain. There were even distinctive Arabic names as far north as France that are highly relevant to Arabic-speaking history. As for Norse names, absolutely—an article like that would be just as invaluable as these articles.

<li><i>If it has something wrong, correct it.</i> — It does indeed have something wrong. It's a Greek-English translating dictionary of placenames, complete with IPA pronunciations, in Wikipedia, contrary to our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy. And indeed we are correcting it. We are deleting it. There's a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikt:Main_Page">translating dictionary of all words of all languages</a> that is ready and waiting for any and all translations that editors want to submit. It's intended to be Wikipedia's lexical companion. There's no need to be a Lost Lexicographer wandering the encyclopaedia in lonely fashion, when one can collaborate with a whole load of other lexicographers at the dictionary. The dictionary has a group of editors doing far more than this mis-placed-dictionary-in-the-encyclopaedia can, with editors collaborating on giving individual words translations, pronunciations in at least three systems, declension tables, etymologies, and even audio files with example pronunciations. It even already has a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Greek_proper_nouns" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Greek_proper_nouns">category for Greek proper nouns</a>, with a sub-category for placenames, that can be filled to one's heart's content.

Yet, this is not the case here, and as far as I know we don't have a list deletion policy or a category deletion policy (if I'm wrong please let me know). Besides this is not a list with translations. It is a list that shows the present or the historical names of various places (with wiki-link, aka the articles for these places are present here on WP, and are named this way), and all these places have something in common. The place name derives from a greek word. This list is like a category, with a small comment for every article. I'm not sure what would be the purpose of moving it to wiktionary and I disagree with the reasons to delete it. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatia.gr_dc78.html" title="User:Matia.gr">MATIA</a> 23:41, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia has many such lists that have survived vfd, and they are all sufficiently encyclopedic. Besides, <b>I</b> wrote this article, and I used no dictionaries nor gazetteers for the names. I used linguistic resources, as many <i>modern</i> Greek place names are very different from traditional ones, even in the ancient Greek language. Besides, I included names like Oceania because it actually has a Greek etymology.

And, as is noted, this isn't a Greek-to-English dictionary, nor is it the geography of Greece or of Turkey—it's a linguistics article about listing traditional names, and includes modern Greek forms if the tradition still lasts. Look at the locations of these places—they're all over the place, but still figured prominently in the Classical Greek world, the Hellenistic world, the Roman world (where Greek was considered the language of the educated elite), the Byzantine world, the Ottoman world, and the modern world as well. This isn't a dictionary. It's an annotated reference of extreme usefulness to deeper linguistics studies, and not strictly for the typical homemaker, or sixth grader doing his homework.

<li>Send it to <b>Wiktionary</b>. Leave a soft-redirect in it's place. This is very good content but it is more lexical than encyclopedic.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is a list, not an encyclopedia entry. Names of places which have Greek etymology should already have this information in the article itself (in fact, I have added it myself in many places),but I <i>especially</i> object to the link from individual articles to this list. I do find it interesting to have a list of all the names of Greek etymology, though: perhaps this should be a category, "Names with Greek Etymology". The word "traditional" is also inappropriate. As for names with non-Greek etymologies but which are used in Greek, that seems like straight dictionary material. What is Βρετανία (Britain) doing here, for example? Aristotle uses the word, so it belongs in a Greek dictionary, but not in an English encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:49, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: The point is that Βρετανία is a distinct form in the Greek language, and not simply an adaptation to nor from a Latin form. It has significance to linguistic studies, and there are many other such linguistics list articles around Wikipedia with clear encyclopedic value. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but <i>this</i> is not a dictionary either. If it <i>were</i> a dictionary, it would more resemble a gazetteer of every Greek name for modern places, and yet it doesn't. Notice that many of these places are long since in ruins, and are part of history. Yes, it is nice to put this information in each article, but it is also extremely helpful to a topical study to put these in one place, and placing a <i>category</i> in each relevant article raises its own issues for many an impatient editor who might think "This isn't a Greek place. It isn't in Greece. This category doesn't belong here," or those who are wary of having too many different topical categories stacked into one article, particularly when they don't see the relative significance of adding so much detail of a place's history for what may effectively be a dead culture for a place where it may not seem like a relevant topic to the region's modern inhabitants. This is a <i>linguistics</i> article, and many of the things that make it important and useful as a linguistics article also make it an extraordinarily dry topic. It may be college-level material and not well-suited to <i>most</i> Wikipedia users who just want to find a fact or an encyclopedic snippet, but that doesn't mean such rich topical academic detail doesn't belong here. Wikipedia has many lexicon-style list articles that have long since survived vfd challenges, for the reason that a list makes the material easier to browse. Another bad reason for categories in this case is that it complicates the effort it takes to make a detailed topical study like this. The subject material is somewhere <i>between</i> lexicon and encyclopedia, and should not be ripped from one domain just because it resembles the domain of the other. See how <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_name.html" title="Hawaiian name">Hawaiian name</a> especially survived a vfd challenge, and see how <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traditional_Arabic_place_names_7cd1.html" title="List of traditional Arabic place names">List of traditional Arabic place names</a>, List of Hebrew names, List of Arabic names, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indo-European_roots_5e14.html" title="List of Indo-European roots">List of Indo-European roots</a>, etc. thrive in Wikipedia's environment. To rid of any of them is inappropriate. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 07:23, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> As I said before, I do find much of the content useful. I also find the various dictionaries on my bookshelves useful.... And it's not so awful that this article appear in the Wikipedia -- my vote is really a weak Delete, because you can always ignore the article if you don't find it useful. What I do object to <i>strenuously</i> is the introduction of the link "List of traditional Greek place names" all over the place. <i>That</i>, you can't ignore.

<li><b>Keep</b>—This is not a dictionary-anything. This has nothing to do with a dictionary, and is of great encyclopedic and reference value.

When people are naming articles with Unicode characters, there are bigger fish to fry! My browser can display Unicode characters properly long before it and the server can do all the mangling associated with URLs.
