<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I spent some time trying to discern consensus on this one. Because of the number of keep comments that came from potentially single-purpose accounts with a vested interest in the project, the number of keep comments is not a good indication by itself. Next I looked at the notability requirements specified in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. The only claim being made for notability here is inclusion in the <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a> software distribution, but even there, the claim was weakened by the apparently poor adoption. There are also the issues that this is a port of the <a href="../../../d/c/%2B/DC%2B%2B_e7f6.html" title="DC++">DC++</a> software and that there is no current release. When taken as a whole, the arguments in favor of keep don't meet the requirements of notability. The other option was to <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../d/c/%2B/DC%2B%2B_e7f6.html" title="DC++">DC++</a>, but per the sparse nature of the article and the lack of a release version, there isn't much to add that isn't already mentioned in the DC++ article. If more needs to be said, please expand the discussion of this version in the DC++ article. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 08:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, actually, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> specifically lists Debian as a bad indicator of notability ("some distributions, such as Debian, include a particularly large number of packages.

<li><b>Comment</b> Which is why <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (or at least that section of it) is not a viable measure of notability. You can't say <i>"It's notable if it's in Debian (but not if it's in Debian)"</i> and expect people to use that as a suitable guideline. Also, in case anyone hasn't looked at it, WP:SOFTWARE is currently marked as a "draft" so I don't think using it as a basis for deletion is sound yet. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheParanoidOne_a135.html" title="User:TheParanoidOne">TheParanoidOne</a> 06:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Most criticisms of WP:SOFTWARE that I've seen involve it being too inclusive (especially the free-software clause). Yet you seem to be using its still-tentative status as a justification for being even <i>more</i> inclusive. In the absence of more specific guidelines, the general guideline that prevails in AfDs is non-trivial coverage by multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If you're going to ignore <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (which, while somewhat controversial in parts, is usually well-received in AfD discussions), you should be providing more standard evidence of notability, not just saying, effectively, "keep 'cause I think it should be kept".</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../d/c/%2B/DC%2B%2B_e7f6.html" title="DC++">DC++</a>, I see no reason why the Linux port needs its own separate article. I think any notability this product may have is independent of the platforms on which it may appear. Nor do I think the Linux port is different enough/unique enough to require a separate article. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:59, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Although there are no packages available on the Download site, it is possible to download LinuxDC++ through <a href="../../../c/v/s/CVS_5133.html" title="CVS">CVS</a>. Personally, I find "port" awkwardly put. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porting.html" title="Porting">Porting</a> doesn't imply how much a software need to be changed to not be a port, but "half" (the GUI) of LinuxDC++ is written from scratch. Also, the porting article say "The term is not usually applied to the process of adapting software [...] [rewritten] to a different language (i.e., language conversion or translation)". LinuxDC++'s GUI is written with Gtk+, which is C, while the DC++ code (that LinuxDC++ uses) is C++. <a href="../../../u/l/l/User%7EUllner_506e.html" title="User:Ullner">Ullner</a> 12:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The user <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidkay_530f.html" title="User:Midkay">midkay</a> recommended keep on this AfD and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stellarium_b20e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stellarium">the one on Stellarium</a> at the same time, both also have qwm recommending keep.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just pointing out that the result of that discussion was Keep. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPulveriser_85fd.html" title="User:Pulveriser">Pulveriser</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPulveriser_663d.html" title="User talk:Pulveriser">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pulveriser_711c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pulveriser">contribs</a>) 07:20, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, but with general consensus and a lot stronger arguments than those presented here. What I wanted to point out by mentioning that midkay and qwm have expressed their recommendations on both these AfDs in a similar fashion (but in no other AfDs) is that they seem to be cooperating or be the same person.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think merging is not a very good idea because LinuxDC++ has a separate user base, very different code and most importantly different developers, releases and aims (it's not an exact replicate of the Windows version, and never will be). The other derivatives listed in the DC++ article are modifications of the original DC++ with the same GUI.<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelzi_293e.html" title="User:Pelzi">Pelzi</a> 13:16, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I still believe that the client has questionable notability, and I'll stay the idea of merging until this software is notable enough (by certainly satisfying criteria in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">WP:SOFTWARE</a>) to merit its own article. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 14:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC) ╫</li>
