<li><b>Weak keep</b> Someday, when people aren't so het up under the collar about these things, we'll have to settle down and work out what really makes a school article worth keeping. (Or maybe we'll just create wikischools and move them all there.) Until that day, I'm willing to compromise on keeping any school with a meaningful assertion of notability in the article, and deleting all others. So for now, keep, but if no better assertion of notability arises, this will be a goner once we actually have standards instead of being an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment. I think the debate used to be between those who considered schools inherently notable (eg. as of significance to all in the community they served for several generations) and those who said 'nope, let each one have a specific claim to notability over and above that'. Generally speaking we seem to have moved on to accepting the latter viewpoint. And that is a good thing IMHO. The issue with this school is thus whether or not it meets that extra level of notability over and above being a school and thus of import to its community. Does it? Well, it would certainly appear to be a <b>good</b> school. (The awards tell us as much perhaps). But is it notable simply by virtue of it's being a good place to send your kids? I still think not. It may require other schools to strive to reach it's standard - and that is no bad thing - but to my mind it still requires something more in order to be considered notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 12:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed. That's life. The elementary school I went to as a child is not on Wikipedia, nor should it be. Schools (and people in the district) should not be seeking validation by having articles on Wikipedia. If it's a decent school, be content with that.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the awards listed in the school's article are not valid. One (the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_I_21a1.html" title="Title I">Title I</a> "award") is not an award at all but a designation by the Federal government that a school has a significant number of students from low-income families. It is not based on test performance, teacher quality, or anything else. The other one (the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Distinguished_School_d7bc.html" title="California Distinguished School">California Distinguished School</a> award) is expired. It is only valid for 4 years, and was not renewed for this school in 2004.<a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingyear.asp?year=2004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingyear.asp?year=2004" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Without these awards, what's notable about this school? <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>My feeling is that if it has won these awards, it is notable enough, it does not need to continually win the same award every year or four years, and not everyone has to agree with my opinion. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 19:48, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
