<li><b>Keep</b>. Nothing has changed since the previous nomination four months ago, when these same issues were raised. This is article is not research or speculation original to Wikipedia, it is about <i>other people's</i> research and speculation - sources are cited liberally throughout. The nomination claims that no sources are provided to verify that the debate exists within the fandom when down at the bottom of the article in the clearly-labelled "external links" section are two links to very extensive pro- and con-Holocaust pages. As for the section in the article on the moon, after the first AfD an attempt was made to merge the whole subject in there and it was ultimately split back out again because it took up an inordinate amount of space there. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Things have changed. As I said above "The matter was finally settled with the release of the book Inside the Worlds of the Star Wars Original Trilogy, which stated that following the Battle of Endor, Rebel ships prevented most of the larger pieces of debris from the Death Star's explosion from hitting the moon's surface, thus nullifying the theory that the forest moon was significantly damaged" This topic is null and void now.

<dd>But that only <i>supports</i> my argument. If Inside the Worlds sees fit to address the issue, that indicates it's considered significant even in official circles.

<dd>Apparently, the book addresses it in such a way that it's clear the moon was never damaged and that the supposed event never happened. I still think we can <b>merge</b> it in the Forest Moon article and note that it has been a significant discussion point between fans, but an entire article is overkill. Perhaps the forest moon article can get a link to the Star Wars Wiki. Surely they have a similar article there. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:36, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - The first two nominations did not reach consensus, but there are virtually no verifiable sources for this, so it should absolutely be deleted unless reliable sources of the information can be found. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 08:22, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article <i>does</i> cite sources. Most significantly, these sources indicate that the debate has some presence within "official" material:
<ul>
<li>In one of the <i>Star Wars Tales</i> comics, an Imperial veteran of Endor makes an apparent reference to the holocaust theory, after telling the story of his unit's trouble with the Ewoks in a bar. Another character dismisses it as a myth, saying that most of the Death Star's mass was obliterated in the explosion, and that the Rebels "took care of the rest."</li>
<li><i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy</i> describes how the Rebels managed to use <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflector_shield.html" title="Deflector shield">shields</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor_beam.html" title="Tractor beam">tractor beams</a> to protect their strike team on the moon of Endor</li>
<li>The First issue of 2005's <i>X-Wing</i> minisiers from Dark Horse comics, begins one week after the battle and shows Rebel ships dousing a forest fire begat by debris from the Death Star.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And of course the two external links at the bottom of the article show how much attention has gone into the issue in the unofficial "fan" community. Other sources are cited throughout the article when specific issues such as the Ewok's survival post-RotJ are discussed. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 08:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Verifiability requires multiple reliable sources about the topic, and the information contained within the topic. Of the three official sources you cite, only one of them even alludes to the possibility of an Endorian Holocaust ("apparently"), and contains none of the information about it presented in the article. The other two refer to circumstances around the destruction of the second Death Star but don't actually talk about even a hypothetical Endorian Holocaust. Fan discussion is not verifiable, and the overuse of phrases like "are speculated to be", "Pro-holocaust debaters", "some also argue", and "has been proposed by fans" are indicative of inherent unsourced POV. Which fans? How many? How do you know this is a representative sample? Are you referring to Internet fandom only? This is the reason that verifiability is required, because these claims are not falsifiable or provable in any reputable source. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 20:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Fire when ready, commander</b>. Sorry, that should be <b>delete</b>. In May last year I said <i>This is not canon. Everyone lived happily ever after, that's why they all were dancing (badly) at the end of the film. It wasn't in those awful books set after the films either. Delete, lest be we swamped with articles like Theoretical genetic mutations that would have arisen if Leia had married Luke or The sex lives of Ewoks. Is every piece of fan speculation on anything that exists notable? This isn't about being pro or anti star wars (I love Star Wars), or even about how much genuine Star Wars information deserves to be on Wikipedia,</i> <i><b>this is about non-notable non-canon unverifiable speculation about something that didn't happen in a film.</b></i>, comments I stand by. It has been defended as an article about the debate but it clearly isn't that, listing as it does every reference used in said debate. It is the debate. And as a debate meme it isn't notable as say, Star Wars versus Star Trek. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 08:34, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>So books don't count? Star Wars books are canon too. Just because it wasn't in the film doesn't mean it's unimportant. Feel free to vote delete, but don't use the argument it wasn't in the film on its own. You need to address the comics, books and other media too. - 131.211.210.17 09:31, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>All books and comics refered to suggest it never happened. The only people who do are fans. Thus, Cruft.--<a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeedubber_00ec.html" title="User:Geedubber">Geedubber</a> 09:37, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Exactly. In the books and comics that I have read (in some cases to my misfortune, Kevin J Anderson should be thrown into the Sarlac) that had references to Endor, said forest moon and it's irritating furry semi-sapient race were fine. Ergo it never happened. Thus not only is the debate pointless and daft in the extreme, but it is not a debate that has garnered any interest from the world outside (and therefore been reported in the media in the same way that Star Wars versus Star Trek has). As such while maybe worthy of a brief mention on the Endor page (with the citations being used to show why the wretched place survived) or fthe Star Wars fandom page, it does not require a detailed examination of the evidence on it's own page. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> <a href="../../../s/a/b/User_talk%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_5ef7.html" title="User talk:Sabine's Sunbird">talk</a> 09:45, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with David Sneek that the paragraph in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_moon_of_Endor_b610.html" title="Forest moon of Endor">Forest moon of Endor</a> is enough, and the whole thing is non-canonical at any rate (a notice on the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Endor_Holocaust" class="external text" title="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Endor_Holocaust" rel="nofollow">Wookieepedia article</a> notes that "Events, opinions, and individuals described in this arcticle are neither present in any authorized source nor claimed to occur in the Star Wars universe"). It might be worth adding the two external links from Endor Holocaust to the main Endor article, so people can read the arguments for themselves if they really care, but a seperate article is too much, even for me.
