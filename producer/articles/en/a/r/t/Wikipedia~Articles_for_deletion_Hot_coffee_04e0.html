<li><b>Keep</b> - This case could create a precedence for game classification around the world and is likely to have historical significance</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Who's the moron that even thought of deleting this? Please tell me!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly <b>create disambiguation page</b> - This issue has already entailed some remarkably significant precedents; in time, it may well be a much bigger issue than its parent article. Still, many users with an interest in Hot Coffee would also take interest in the main GTA:SA article. Re: The poster below, the Mortal Kombat controversy never had a catchy name. Scoff if you will, but a good title can seriously affect<s>ion</s> the public perception of an issue. Edit: "Seriously affection?" Yeesh, good thing I got some sleep since typing that.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> - There aren't special pages for Mortal Kombat's original controversy that created the ESRB in the first place. This is the internet celebrating itself. Giving this much merit to what Rockstar coders made to stay busy at work and what modders unlocked in a few afternoons is an insult to superior mods that took a lot more time and original work to accomplish.</li>
<li><b>Create disambiguation page</b> People searching for "hot coffee" will most probably be looking for this article rather than actual "coffee". To be sure, though, creating a disambiguation page would prevent any unneccessary viewing. However, this article merits separate mention from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_e6da.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> article because the controversy bears ramifications that extend far beyond the scope of the game itself.</li>

<li>The article already exists. Much more could and will be added to what there is in the San Andreas article, requiring a seperate article.

<li><b>Keep</b> THIS MADE NATIONAL NEWS AND THE ADEQUACY OF THIS ARTICLE ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO ANY OF THE SHITTY ARTICLES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED FOR DELETION</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Votes to delete the article have not generally recommended deleting the content, but merging it to <i>GTA:SA</i> under the "controversies" heading. Deletion pertains mainly to the usefulness of having an article under the name <i>Hot Coffee</i> -- NOT to the validity of the content itself. Many of the votes to keep the article seem to have been made without respect to alternatives to merge the content. The fact is that people will look for this information under <i>GTA:SA</i>, not by searching Wikipedia for <i>Hot Coffee</i>. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 23:25, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Let's fast forward 5 years. It turns out that Pokemon Unleashed has a mature hidden level that people are able to get into. It causes quite a stir, "Like what happened in 2005 to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas bug known as 'Hot Coffee'". No matter what we do, the link to future events can point to GTA:SA#Hot_Coffee or to Hot_Coffee. People will be able to find the event in either section. So, does one who wants to learn about GTA:SA necessarily want to know about Hot Coffee? Maybe -- so follow a link. Does one who wants to know about Hot Coffee want to know about the rest of GTA:SA? Maybe -- so follow a link. In either case, they're related, but the content and audiences of the two articles are potentially different.Chrysrobyn</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- this has gained media attention and the controversy/issue is significant in and of itself; however, the title could use some improvement so that it is more descriptive, i.e. "Grand Theft Auto - Hot Coffee (Game Modification)", and <i>Hot Coffee</i> should be a redirect to a disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 12:47, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep.html" title="Keep">Keep</a>: It's definnatly notable and should remain. Also about redirecting it I have some thoughts: 1) Despite popular belief "Hot Coffee" is not a mod, it was written into the initial code, but was never meant to be accesed. 2) Most people searching for the drink will most likely type in "Coffee" while people looking for this will type in "Hot Coffee" <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathawk_f102.html" title="User:Deathawk">Deathawk</a> 23:49, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Create disambiguation page</b>. I typed in this page looking for information on the "hot coffee" political scandal thingy, and immediately found people suggesting it be deleted. I came here specifically to look for it, so I imagine it would be useful to others as well. Um, I'm not quite sure if I'm doing this voting thing right. Awk 01:03, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is too important to be deleted. In time, it shall find place perhaps in other articles, or maybe it will be cited by other articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> And move to disambiguate, if that helps. This "mod" is already among the most important legal precedents in gaming and so having a page to explain the software and the results is useful, apart from background information on the specific game. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinHall_7315.html" title="User:JustinHall">JustinHall</a> 04:59, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
