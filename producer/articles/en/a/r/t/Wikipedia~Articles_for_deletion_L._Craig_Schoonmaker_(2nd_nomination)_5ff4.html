<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Here is an article about a colorful figure in US politics, whose activities have been as diverse as they are bizarre. This the sort of article that makes Wikipedia a joy to read. Would Wikipedia be improved by deleting this article? No. Would it be diminished? I think so. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 23:35, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable politician. The party he founded doesn't even have a wikipedia page. The article even notes that it is primarily a one man operation. Did you know that hundreds of people ran for governor of California in the last election?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 00:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if people care to write articles about any of them, should those articles be deleted as well. Did you know that there are about 90 Wikipedia articles about Pokemon characters? And they are <i>fictional</i>. L. Craig Schoonmaker is, on the other hand, <i>real</i>. (As they say, you can't make this sort of stuff up.) It makes sense that if his party is a one-person operation, it is covered in the article about him, rather than in a separate article, doesn't it? If this article were just a stub that said, "L. Craig Schoonmaker was a candidate for President of the United States.", I be with you in supporting deletion. But this article provides a lot more information than that. What harm is the article doing? In what way would Wikipedia be improved by deleting this article? <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 02:37, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Pokemon characters should be merged anyway. However, there is one key difference: all of the Pokemon information, being much more popular than any non-notable real people, is more verifiable and has more interested editors. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:17, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Invention of the term "gay pride" makes him significant, and the other stuff makes the article quite interesting. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:48, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Coining "Gay Pride" appears to be his only claim to fame - not enough to be encyclopedically notable beyond a mention and an external link to his claims in the Gay Pride article. The other stuff is just crazy crank one man party politics. I'm sure most crank political parties have pretty interesting manifestos - it doesnt automatically make them encyclopedic enough for their own article though. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The only evidence he introduced the term "gay pride" is in things written by himself on websites. It should have been deleted in the previous nomination.

<li><b>Comment</b>: so far, no one voting to delete this article, including the nominator, has provided a reason for deletion that is consistent with the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. The rationale always seems to be "he's non-notable". As the essay on notability notes (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>), Wikipedia does not have any policy on notability. It has policies on verifiability, vanity and original research. not on notability. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 21:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I did not vote for delete due to a belief that the subject is non-notable. I voted for delete because - as I stated - that this subject does not have enough notability to be <b>encyclopedically notable</b> for his own article in Wikipedia . Can you see and appreciate the difference? The "this article does no harm" argument inherently fails to understand that Wikipedia is an attempt at an <i>encyclopedia</i> and "harmless" articles of insufficient notability do cumulative damage to the authority of this attempt. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> states under <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_that_may_require_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Problem articles that may require deletion</a> that if the "subject of article fails...<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (for biographies)", then it "may require deletion". Note that the title of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is "Wikipedia:Notability (people)". The Deletion policy also refers to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information: ... Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety." The rationale of non-notability refers to these policies and guidelines, and is a specific application of the fundamental principle that <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:01, 28 June 2006
<dl>
<dd>WP:BIO is a guideline, not a policy. Furthermore, it states: "The following types of people may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</dd>
<dd>WP:N is not even a guideline. It is an interesting interpretation that notability is a "specific application" of a fundamental principle when WP:N states that: "There is no official policy on notability. However, there are a number of consensual guidelines regarding notability within a limited subject field...." and "Although notability is not formal policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious), it is the opinion of some editors that this is what is meant by Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information (which is a formal policy)." You are entitled to your interpretation of notability and WP:5P, which is shared by some other editors, but it just isn't policy, and there is no accepted consensus on it. If consensus could be developed on notability, you can be sure that it would have been added as a real ground for deletion to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> a long time ago.</dd>
<dd>Schonmaker filed to run for President of the US in 2005, and announced in March 2006 that he is running for mayor of Newark, New Jersey. This doesn't make him famous, or important, but given his colorful background, it makes him an amusing addition to the wonderful world of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 00:02, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So, these delete recommendations do cite policy, they just don't agree with your interpretation of it. Also, note that any U.S. citizen over the age of 35 can run for President of the United States, and presumably there is similar openness in the Newark mayoral race. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:46, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ground Zero says:<i>it makes him an amusing addition to the wonderful world of Wikipedia</i>. That kind of attitude is exactly why we have <i><b>official policies</b></i> such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a></b> which specifically support "consensually accepted guidelines" such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:02, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
