<li>Thanks for everyone's feedback. I noticed the article has gone through some hefty editing in the last couple of days. If you don't think an elected politician (which having read notability requirements led me to believe this article was acceptable) to a capital city, and the youngest no less (not verifiable via internet) doesn't pass the sniff test, I'd honestly be surprised. I have numerous scanned magazine articles (Profit Magazine, MacLeans, Realm Magazine), newspaper articles and television interviews - and yes they are about me. I didn't realize I required so much verification, but if you want it...just ask. Or just do a google search. I had the theatre section there so people could cross reference with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Deaf_Theatre_da9a.html" title="Canadian Deaf Theatre">Canadian Deaf Theatre</a> on WP, but if you don't believe that should belong either...As for the deputy mayor question, when you sit on a City Council, everyone alternates deputy mayor responsibilities (when the mayor is absent) at community functions and council meetings themselves. As Whitehorse's deputy mayor I have chaired Whitehorse City Council meetings and greeted HRH when he visited Whitehorse during his northern tour in 2001. Hope this helps you during your deliberation.Hartland</li>

I knew that this subject was potentially huge, and I really did not want it to clutter up the article about the bridge, nor did I want to research it any further. So I split it off. I don't think this article is harmful, and I would <i>not</i> like to see this information added back to the parent, I'd also hate to see the parent stripped of its FA status because this information was not covered more thoroughly.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It should not have been nominated for deletion where a mergeto tag suffices, in my opinion. In any case, I favor moving popular culture references out of major articles in most cases. The main article is 32 kilobytes long.

<li>I would be agreeable to this.

Now if anything is to be merged back into the article it should be the eastern span replacement, and NOT the cultural stuff. Deleting <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_in_fiction_and_film_359a.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in fiction and film">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in fiction and film</a> will not make all the cultural references go away. They will all end up added back to the main article, to the detriment of the main article. You can fight the things that people add to Wikipedia, or find a better place for them.

<li>Okay, I did create this article, and this comment probably won't save it, but this article is a little different from many pieces of cruft that are listed here. It is extraordinarily rare for an album to share the name of a track not on the album but released by the same band - the fact that there are only about 50 here is some indication of that (this is not a list that will grow out of hand such as some of the existing and apparently accepted song list articles). In many cases, there are reasons behind the lack of title track which give insights into the albums, the tracks, or the band/artist in question. These reasons can be (and in several cases are) indicated on this list. I realise I'm biased (as I have found this list useful on several occasions since I started it for my radio work), but I still vote <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 07:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If it's so rare, then why are there already over 50 entries on the list? The earliest date on the list is 1967 which means that, according to this list, it happens once or twice every year.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The name of the article is problematic, Grutness. Elvis Costello, for example, released an album called <i>Almost Blue.</i> It was a record of covers, so he didn't put his original song, "Almost Blue," on it. That song appeared on his next record, <i>Imperial Bedroom.</i> However, "title track" is inappropriate in the first case, and the name of the article indicates that any album that doesn't have <b>a</b> title track is implied. Perhaps the list, in paragraph form, can be in a <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_track.html" title="Title track">title track</a> article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:22, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I am strongly opposed to List of X that happens to have some random and unreleated feature Y associated with it eg bands with colours in their names, or places named after rock formations. I typically recommend delete on articles that look like that. However, Grutness's comments are persuasive as I believe there is encyclopedic value in a List of X that share notable encyclopedic similarity Y - an example that occurred to me was List of professional athletes that have held political office. I'm persuaded that this list falls into the latter of my categories but I'm only weakly persuaded as I share the generic concerns here. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If nothing else, the article title is inherently problematic and meaningless. If a track is not on an album, then it is not that album's "title track".

<li><b>Comment</b> In Gardner's book, "The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix", p. 42, he mentions prior publication of the list in the Aug. 10 Newsweek and the Aug. 21 Time magazine in 1964, so I doubt he was the original author of the list. Like most urban folklore, the origin may never be established. The list, as reproduced in his book, contains only 16 items. The entire chapter 4 of the book is devoted to the subject. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 17:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, it's just a list of coincidences. In fact, some are not even conincidences, like "Both Corbett and Ruby were known as unstable men who were prone to violence." This would be expected in lone assassins (as opposed to a military operation or a revolutionary group) of political figures. Another thing that is not irregular enough to be a coincidence is "Both assassins knew of their victims' whereabouts by reading about it in newspapers." The media is by far the most likely source of information for the assassins, so there are two choices, newspapers and television news. Others are just silly, like "Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre. Kennedy was shot in a Ford car; a Lincoln limousine." Still others are common to many if not most U.S. presidents, like military service and the studying of law. Few things that are listed are true coincidences and most of them are still not that unusual. However, coincidences happen all the time and there are so many things that are not coincidences that are not listed. For example, the presidents and assassins had different first and last names and they were not wearing identical clothing during the assassinations. Also, they were not shot on the same date. Finally, the presidents and assassins were different ages at the time of the assassinations (measured to the year). -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I tried to clean it up, but the biggest problem is the selection criteria. They all have been chosen to suggest a connection that doesn't exist. Should we also list all of their dissimilarities so as to not lead the reader down an inappropriate train of thought? This list is encouraging the reader to draw illogical conclusions based on the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have completely rewritten the article. I hope folks find this rewrite acceptable.

<li>I think this is the proper approach to take with this article (I was going to propose something similar, but then decided Syphonbyte pretty much covered it). The article should be about the phenomenon of drawing irrational conclusions based on selective comparisons of important individuals. What it be <i>real</i> great would be if we could find some primary sources to cite. With that, I've changed my vote to <b>Keep</b> on the basis of the rewrite, but would support a name change. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 13:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> it presents the list in a very POV light and immediately beginning by stating that it is <i>debunked</i> - how can an article on an english encyclopedia use the word debunk and still seem balanced?

<p>It makes many specific claims and insuations about an historical figure without providing footnotes or source quotes. It is also poorly written, with the section Personal Life offering scant information about Mitrione's actual life. It violates NPOV in that the only associated information is in external links that are from ideological critics of U.S. government policies that Mitrione was allegedly implementing. Bias is shown by the inclusion of a See Also link to a "List of U.S. foreign interventions since 1945," which has no information about Mitrione.

<dd>I just wanted to see if Wikipedia had any credibility. No credible publication could possibly keep an article as laughably unsupported by evidence as this one.

<li><b>comment</b> - The missing part of your <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> quote is "...that qualifies above", and there's been no charted hits among his discography. In looking over the material proffered, I note two uncredited biographies, and the first one mentions Kent as a shout-out. If you're saying he's a <i>former</i> DJ, that would also explain the lack of articles, in that he's apparently failed the suggested "100-year test" for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> after only 12 years. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 06:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your first claim is false. <a href="../../../l/o/v/Loverboy_%28Mariah_Carey_song%29_f722.html" title="Loverboy (Mariah Carey song)">Loverboy (Mariah Carey song)</a> is a Clark Kent production, it reached #2 in the US. You are also misinterpreting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. First off, on WP:BIO, the suggested "100-year test" is an alternate test without being a consensus-backed guideline. It's in there as an afterthought for a reason, and using it to prove <i>non</i>-notability is not established practice here and highly disputable, because it is <i>extremely</i> subjective--you need some expert opinion to make any valid claims because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">divination has no place on WP</a>. And no, Google will not turn you into an instant expert on everything. Secondly, notability criteria on WP in general, and explicitly in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a one and done deal: you hit any one criteria and the subject is notable. The easiest criteria to prove right now is "Has credit for writing or co-writing either lyrics or music for a musician or ensemble that qualifies above." If you will, please entertain this proof:<br />
1.) by "a musician or ensemble that qualifies above", the criteria means a musician/performer who meets <i>any one</i> of the criteria listed in the section above it. It does not, as you claim, mean the performer charted a hit, there are several other criteria it could meet to be notable.<br />
2.) Jay-Z, Notorious BIG, Rakim, Slick Rick, Queen Latifah, and Junior MAFIA are all hip-hop acts that qualify as notable performers in WP:MUSIC<br />
3.) Producers in hip-hop are always the beatmaker, or composer for the song. They have songwriting credit and get royalties from BMI and ASCAP per their status.<br />
4.) <a href="http://prodby.altervista.org/producer_list.php?producer=Clark%20Kent" class="external text" title="http://prodby.altervista.org/producer_list.php?producer=Clark%20Kent" rel="nofollow">Clark Kent has produced for all of them.</a>, QED.<br />

<li><b>Question</b> Is the function of a list same as the of a category? If yes, why do we have lists and categories of the same subject?

<li>The purpose of a category is to keep the users on their toes. For example, they might be just be looking for a multiple champion player, or a female one.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This article has been a joint effort of 7 people to establish some foundational content on wikipedia about the term "missional"...it has been noted that we should go back through and look more closely to the "point of view" of the articles but it has been the intent to be as fair and broad as possible without deluting the term missional. As far as the authors attributions, it is will full consent from the authors that their material is on the page. It was written for wikipedia. I was designated as the original "poster" of everyone's input, then each person would come in and edit and bring a more full balance to the content. Each person has been told to attribute and use footnotes when citing sources. If anyone sees content that does not seem to meet this criteria, please point it out and we will either fix it or remove that citation. All other feedback is appreciated so that we can fully comply with the guidelines of wikipedia. Thank you. --Missions fan 19:11, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> A major problem with what you've said so far is that you are implying those who have contributed to the article so far "own" it. Wikipedia, being a collaborative project doesn't work like that. See <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a>. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that <b>anyone</b> can edit, not a host for personal essays. By attributing each section, it's implying that no one else but the original author(s) can modify the article and also implies that the specific section is that author's "original thought", which poses not only copyright problems, but also neutral point of view issues as well. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 20:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

See the Wikipedia Collaborations section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Collaborations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Collaborations" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> where it says that "In order to improve the quality of articles which are short or lacking in detail, Wikipedia's community take part in collaborations to expand articles. On each collaboration, an article is chosen by people interested in the topic, and for a period of time (a week, fortnight, or month) the chosen article is worked on, under Wikipedia's principle of collaborative editing." --Missions fan 00:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Criticism taken and understood. Our weaknesses in the articles have more to do with each of us learning about posting to Wikipedia. The origianal goal was to have one person post for everyone at first so that we could coordinate a strong start to the page. Per yours and others suggestions, the remainder of our group will post their own material. We will also be editing and critiquing one another, and we are <b>WIDE OPEN</b> for others to post/reply etc. (We understand THAT <b>IS</b> WIKIPEDIA) A topic that is so hotly discussed right now needs this space and an open forum. Many people have no idea where to begin to understand this and study it for themselves. We wanted to provide an outline, resource list, and links to begin. And start the flow of input. We have simply been surprised there was not a wikipedia page yet, so we wanted to <i><b>start</b></i> it--not own it. Everyone has been contacted to make necessary changes, add needed references, and work on the "point of view." Thank you for your feedback. Until the others have posted, I hope this answers your original concerns. All criticism, edits, and comments are welcome. --Missions fan 21:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> As I have stated, all criticisms have been sent out and will be worked on. The basic difference between missionary and missional is Missionary is a noun, Missional is an adjective. As I have been studying the basic submission guidelines and processes for improvement, I saw that before an article is to be suggested for deletion that the two parties in disagreement should discuss it first. Why did you suggest this for deletion before making a comment on the page (talk or discussion section)? Since you are proponent of the "guidelines of wikipedia" it seems that you would want to follow all rules of protocol?</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Missions Fan, will the others be adding content or editing? That is your best bet for keeping it. The point of view is your biggest problem. If it is a group, then stay true to wiki and have everyone post-otherwise, it doesn't follow the wikipedia guidelines. make sure you read those--Cocodysri 19:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Yes, our goal is to edit the contributions of each of the other people in the group so that it is as solid of a beginning as possible. As far as people outside of the ones we know, we hope so. I am certain that more editing will come. The term is gaining broad use with varying "definitions" or "understanding." We are hoping there will be a LOT of contributions, discussion, editing, etc.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> This topic is being talked about a lot in evangelical circles. Can you add more references/broader pictures of how others are defining it or not defining it? I think this would be a better submission if more of your "team" were actually adding the content and you had a broader range of references. It reads a little like the "Ed Stetzer and David Putman show"--excellent resources, I know of Dr. Stetzer and his work with North American Missions and church planting. It is understandable if you are all most familiar with their work. But for the integrity of a wikipedia page, you need to look at the broad picture of what is taught and written. You should also include material from www.missionalchurch.org, www.gracepeace.com, Tim Keller, Gruder's <i>The Missional Church</i>, www.sentchurch.com, the Gospel and Our Culture Network: Empirical Indicators of a 'Missional Church' A Working Document of the "Developing Congregational Models" Team The Transforming Congregations Toward Mission Project (<a href="http://www.gocn.org/indicators.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gocn.org/indicators.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gocn.org/indicators.htm</a>). And I would suggest clearer contrast and comparison with the emerging church movement. You have some mention, it is sophomorish at best. You are on the right track, just fix these things and you should be fine. Make a note on this page if you would like help. --Goandtellallyoucan 20:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Missions Fan, your co-writers are recreating the wheel on a few topics. You have a whole section that ties in with the history of christian missions which is already a part of wikipedia. this will be a better article if you simply link to those pages as a reference rather than rewrite everything. If there is content on those pages that is insufficient, then edit those pages with updated, accurate nonbiased information and improve the whole community. You all seem smart but you seem to be doing a lot of extra work. Before anyone started writing they should have become more familiar with wikipedia - it would have saved everyone some time. --Goandtellallyoucan 04:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> As one who just recently attempted to add to the entry under discussion, I can honestly say that, at least on my part (and I believe, for my collegues as well), any failures in regard to Wikipedia standards as the innocent result of our bubmbling efforts to create an article. I, for one, am admittedly a complete novice to the Wikipedia reality. With all that said, I believe that Wikipedia may be enhanced by the inclusion of an article on the subject that we selected.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This page seems to be very helpful and useful to many of us who are new in this subject. The discussion shows that the problems seem have to do with the guidelines and technical issues. May be a little bit of patience and tolerance can help them to get it up. Since it is in a public community environment, many of us will be benefited in long run. Just reading many of your insightful feedbacks, I have already learned few things in this subject. It is worth a try.--Clui 03:22, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Anyway, to be honest I do feel that the article is somewhat hopeless because like Goandtellallyoucan has pointed out, it seems to be reinventing the wheel in that the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission_%28Christian%29_bdc3.html" title="Mission (Christian)">Mission (Christian)</a> article already covers the topic well in an impartial manner that is to be expected in an encyclopedia. On the other hand, this article appears to be preaching on how best to be a missionary -- not exactly a topic that can be written about objectively since it all depends on how each writer individually interprets the Bible. I simply can't see anyway how any of your writers can convey the information you wish to add to this encyclopedia while maintaining a neutral point of view. Anyway, due to the lack of opinions submitted by other reviewers, I would think there will be at least week before a consensus is reached by the Articles for Deletion team. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 15:38, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:'</b>Why should we be so hasty to delete the things on this page. It is obvious that there is a desire for this to be defined and those who have contributed really were unschooled in the ways of the Wikipedia... It seems to me that we should keep working on what we have in order to improve it rather than just throwing the whole thing out. I have just posted an addition to the article that I hope will be helpful.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - None of the external links are about Datamonitor, they all mention the firm in connection with a press announcement about someone else's earnings, e.g., the company still fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for lacking multiple non-trivial third-party articles about itself. Verifiability is not the issue, notability is. The question of verifiability does however lend itself to the question of original research, which the article largely still consists of. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 18:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its not clear to me whether these meet the WP:CORP criteria #1 or not. The footnote to the criteria states "The published works must be someone else writing about the company, corporation, product, or service". The product of Datamonitor is its reports, and these are articles by independent sources writing about the company's products. There is ambiguity here, but at the least its reasonable to argue that these sources count, which is why I added them. This would be a good example to discuss on the WP:CORP talk page as I think a clarification of the policy is needed. Given that there is general agreement about the notability of Datamonitor if not about the article as it stands, I believe its right to keep the article for now. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 19:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well there's the Superbrands article and site that was on a previous version of the article - it should probably go back. I found two other articles, Hoover's and CBRonline, but they are both paid services so I can't link them here. I find myself in the odd position of having been the one to AfD it in the first place (the first time I searched I only found articles by Datamonitor, not independent sources) but now believe that it's notable enough. I'll keep looking for sources that we can actually cite in the article to support notability, for the moment I'm ok with the article staying in its current form (excised of the previous advertising) - but that's just one editor's opinion. I'll be doing a bit of travelling for the next four days, so it will be a while before I get back to this. Personally, I'm ok with either delete or keep at this point. It's a pretty weak article and started out its life as a blatant advert. Datamonitor probably <b>is</b> notable enough for a Wikipedia article, but more work is needed to demonstrate the "multiple non-trivial independent articles" about it... <a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 18:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)btball</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Datamonitor might be of some note, but that is not at issue. I looked into the article as it is now. It is bad. Datamonitor is only needed because we are going to quote them. Or they are going to be quoted. In essence, they are a footnote. Status is as such; they provide footnote material. Any relevant information they provide will be sold to high bidders as reports. Their public information is similar to Dow-Jones or other business listing agencies. In addition, they provide no historical information. I say delete. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessemonroy650_0a9e.html" title="User:Jessemonroy650">meatclerk</a> 02:01, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Hello, I am a staff member of this website and it is the second largest New York Knicks website on the internet. It has gotten many responses in the newspapers and radio stations. I believes it should be kept on because it is a legitimate website with much more traffic than just "Google hits" and has a lot of dedicated and loyal fans. Wikipedia readers should have the right to know about a great website like this.

<p>Alright nerds, listen up: I cannot find the NY Post article in which we are mentioned because it was a very long time ago but we have interviewed writers of the NY Times and NY Post before as a website and even interviewed people from ESPN 1050, a sports radio station here in New York. We've also gotten a few mentions on that radio station as well. A link? <a href="http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575" class="external free" title="http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575" rel="nofollow">http://www.knicks4life.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10575</a> That's the best I can give you.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia is for people all over the world so just because your site was mentioned in a few New York newspapers, although they are well known newspapers in the United States, not even everyone in the U.S. reads them so their not country-wide much less world-wide. Therefore your site being mentioned once in two popular U.S. newspapers doesn't make it notable to all the other English-speaking countries who use the english version of Wikipedia. Also, there's no reason to call people nerds just because they're intellectually superior to you and you aren't even intelligent enough to come up with a good reason to keep your article posted.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a.

<p>Haha. Intellectually superior? What makes you think that? Because you sit behind a computer all day decidng the fate of Wikipedia? If someone wants to search for Knicks sites on Wiki he'll find this on there. It's one of the best sites on the internet. What harm will it cause for it to remain up there? I don't see any insults or pornographic images. I just see a successful website wanting to expand it's image. Let up a little bit, would you?<a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKnea2006_b618.html" title="User:Knea2006">Knea2006</a> 03:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Once again your intelligence is just astonishing. First of all “You sit behind your computer all day” is not a very accurate statement seeing as any intelligent person (which explains why you wouldn't notice) can see by the timestamp that I'm on around the same time every day and not “all day.” Also, you have no room to say anything about people being on the computer all day. I went to your forum site that you posted here and it's pretty much just 50 posts from you talking about this article and crying about how it's going to get deleted. And one more thing, considering you just said I sit at the computer all day and post on Wikipedia you sure replied fast to my last post. It's almost as if you sit at home all day watching this just to see who else has come here to let you know that your web site is completely unimportant to anyone.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a.

<ul>
<li>More To Add To My Previous <b>Comment</b> - I just thought I'd add that your web site is most definitely not “one of the best sites on the internet.” It is in fact, quite possibly, one of the worst sites on the internet, which is one more reason it doesn't deserve an article. Also, I'd appreciate if you didn't come here and babble incoherently about “insults and pornographic images.” I don't know what that has to do with anything so if you could just keep your porn addiction to yourself that would be great.

<p>Hahaha. Who do you think you are, tool? You think you are someone special because you can decide the fate of Wiki articles? Who gives a rats ass what you can do? Listen up buddy, you don't intimidate me and your attempt to "own" me failed. Also showing your ignorance was the fact that you insulted a website that has done nothing to you. Calling it one of the "worst sites on the internet" is not what you should be doing. Nowhere did I say it was the best on the 'net. I said it was the best KNICKS sites on the web. Now, aside from reading Harry Potter books and pleasuring yourself to Star Trek episodes, do you have any idea who or what the Knicks are? Because from what I can see, you have none. So please, spare me the preaching and the attempt to act like a smart aleck. I've been there and done that and dealt with people like you, who think you are someone special because you work on wikipedia. Whoopdeedamndoo brother, what in the hell is that supposed to mean? I'm supposed to respect you? I don't even know you! So get whatever is out of your ass and act like a human being, rather than a robotic mouthpiece for wikipedia.<a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKnea2006_b618.html" title="User:Knea2006">Knea2006</a> 04:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - And yet again you're intelligence astonishes me. However if you could stop with the childish insults for a second and learn how to read you would see that you did in fact say that it was the best site on the internet so just in case you do learn how to read I will quote you from your earlier post and highlight the incredibly unintelligent statement contained within it.

<li>Now that you've been embarrassed repeatedly and tried to redeem yourself repeatedly with foolish and childish insults, which, as stated in a previous post, make absolutely no sense, I would suggest that you just give up trying to sound intelligent, get off your computer, leave your mom's basement, and go out and get a job so perhaps someday you can pay for an education. Thank you for your time, I've enjoyed making you look like an incompetent ass, although you didn't need my help, have a nice day. Also, I realize your going to respond with yet another childish insult and call me a “doo doo head” or whatever, but I'm not going to continue trying to convince you that your web site is not one of the best on the internet and not even one of the best Knicks sites on the internet because you are obviously to incompetent to realize that. Once again thank you for using Wikipedia, try putting your article on one of the many gay porn sites you visit.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMertens21_8589.html" title="User:Mertens21">Mertens21 a.k.a.

<p>LOL, what a classless tool. So, I made a mistake. The point was it is one of the best KNICK sites on the internet. Why don't you get your head out of your sarcastic, stuck up ass and realize you are a nobody? Mother's basement? You wish buddy. The only ass you've seen is yours in the mirror of your bathroom. You have your opinion about the site, I have mine, but to fall to the levels of calling the sites "one of the worst sites on the internet" is a disgrace for a wikipedia "employee." How did you get your position anyway? Seems like you have no sense of humor though, especially not with that lame gay porn joke. Get a life dude. No, seriously.

<dd>Please stop twisting my words Drett. Your interpretation takes quite a bit of skill to work out from what I wrote. The article is about a summer camp and - irrespective of location or denomination - virtually no summer camps deserve separate articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 09:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nevertheless, there are over 100 separate articles on summer camps on Wikipedia, which suggests that other people disagree with you regarding the worthiness of their inclusion. You said you could not fathom the argument that Canadian/Jewish summer camps would not be deleted while presumably other summer camps would. As other summer camp articles have not been deleted, I could only assume that you did not know there were myriad other articles on similar institutions that you were not aware of - that was how I interpreted your nomination, but if I have misrepresented you, I apologise. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrett_ca1d.html" title="User:Drett">Drett</a> 14:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I strongly disagree with the term "non-notable". Eastside VW is a recognised club by major UK insurance companies, being a member entitles those taking out a car insurance policy to a discount. Eastside VW also has displays at major UK events and shows and has been featured in national UK magazines. In the highly popular UK VW scene, Eastside VW is widely known and respected.</p>

<dd>Nomination withdrawn, I have noticed that articles like this are a once in a lifetime phenomenon and that it is extremely unlikely that any other articles about grade 4 bands would be this good. Deleting it would not work to set any type of presecent for similar pipe band articles, because there probably won't ever be any similar pipe band articles.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 06:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>User pages aren't supposed to be free home pages, and thus I don't think this would be appropriate material for a user page. I don't really see a problem with vanity here, despite the author's admitted relationship with a band member, as long as the material is objective and verifiable. Having said that, I think the notability of even a strong Grade 4 band is in doubt. <strike>so my vote is <b>Weak delete</b>.</strike> Changing vote to <b>Weak keep</b> based on some competition success and some evidence of notability within their local community. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 20:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Userfy or Weak Delete</b>, (nominator, my real vote). This material isn't really a home page, and as said before it could very easily be on wikipedia if it was more notable. An article like this does not seem to violate <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserpage_a297.html#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F" title="Wikipedia:Userpage">Wikipedia:Userpage#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F</a>, and it is not any more a home page than most other userpages. Vanity, I beleive, is a key issue here though as more 2/3rds and possible 3/4 of the author's edits have been to this page and immediately related articles. This is generally bad for wikipedia and harms the encyclopedic nature of pipe band articles.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 23:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>First I would like to state I have no problem with the discussion in regard to the issue that the City of Rockford Pipe Band article may or may not meet the "notability" standard. I, however, am beginning to take umbrage over its deletion based on "vanity." While I made a great number of edits in the article my intent was to provide proper structure and objective content. If the sole critera for "vanity" in any new article is the percentage of edits made by one individual then we may have a problem with some, if not most, of the pipe band articles - all of which are relatively new. Example: <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midlothian_Scottish_Pipe_Band_87d5.html" title="Midlothian Scottish Pipe Band">Midlothian Scottish Pipe Band</a> (no allusions to "relationship" intended). Further, I believe time would be better spent in defining or at least developing a consensus as to the "notabilty" standard for pipe band inclusion and carry on from there.--<a href="../../../s/r/e/User%7ESrebob_df54.html" title="User:Srebob">Srebob</a> 11:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)srebob</li>

<dd>I really hope this doesn't offend you in any way, but I meant that over 2/3rds of your total contributions were to this article, and that you've contributed to little else (there's nothing wrong with that in general). This definetely doesn't alone qualify the article as vanity, but considering the subject's non notable nature, it isn't good. If a user were to only contribute to one article, it should be to somthing more notable and a subject which that user is not directly connected to.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 05:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<dd>Please note that as of now the encyclopedia has 3 articles about grade 1 pipe bands in the US, 3 articles about grade 2 pipe bands in the US, and just this one article about a Grade 4 band. To be fair, we would need to write articles about the rest of the grade 2 bands and the best grade 3 bands before we would include this one. Honestly, I don't think anyone would want to write articles about grade 3 or grade 4 pipe bands unless they play in them themselves, or are very close to someone who plays in one. There simply is no way that a Grade 4 band is notable.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 05:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The premise that the grade 2 and grade 3 articles need to be written first is faulty. Wikipedia articles generally don't get written "in order" - they are written whenever someone has the time, interest and knowledge. I think the issue is simply the notability of a grade 4 band. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 14:46, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, I was only demonstrating that there is practically no interest in G4 pipe bands. There is enough time and knowledge here to write an article on almost any pipe band.--<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusaabdulrashid_7bae.html" title="User:Musaabdulrashid">Musaabdulrashid</a> 00:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment 2</b>. I agree, somewhat, with <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a>. As a continuing aside: just what the heck (change "heck" as it suits you) is "notable (I know I'm being redundant)." In the midwest the City of Rockford Pipe Band is a minor phenomena, in the world it's a "piss-ant" pipe band. Do we disallow the over all effort to write Pipe Band articles based on some yet limited definition of "worthiness" or do we simply delete them from the "Notable Pipe Band List" (my vote) and let well written and object articles stand on their own merit? Beats me...--<a href="../../../s/r/e/User%7ESrebob_df54.html" title="User:Srebob">Srebob</a> 01:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)srebob</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I am the creater of Ohio Severe Weather Page. I agree it should be deleted. I am sorry for the non-notable website. I am still learning about weather and have not totally developed the skill, but in the near future I hope to create a more advance website. I monitor the website on my own because its free web hosting, so it is pretty hard to keep up with everything and keep up to date everything. I really enjoy weather, but I understand it should not be posted in Wikipedia because it is created by free web hosting. I appologize. If anyone understands where I come from, please keep posting because I agree it should be deleted. I didn't know that you were not alowd to delete your own article you created yourself. I rather not have my IP signed on this page if you don't mind. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanrschroeder_062a.html" title="User:Jordanrschroeder">User:Jordanrschroeder</a> - 28 July 2006

<li>I don't think that any editor disagrees that the security scare should be mentioned in Wikipedia. I think that the question here is what the best way to do that is. Should Wikipedia provide a name check to Mr Battaglia, and discuss the incident in a biographical article on a person, where readers won't even know to find it in a couple of years' time? Or should Wikipedia expand the discussion of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>'s protective detail in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a>, currently a 1 sentence mention, to include documented security scares such as this one? The latter seems to be the better approach that will benefit readers in the long run, especially given that this article practically has a separate header for every sentence, strongly indicating that it has had to be padded in order to make it an article of any great length. So <b>condense and merge</b> to a section on the PM's protective detail in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Federal_Police_32ae.html" title="Australian Federal Police">Australian Federal Police</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:03, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i> This is probably the most applicable point. The primary members were <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Heal_60ba.html" title="Marc Heal">Marc Heal</a> of <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubanate.html" title="Cubanate">Cubanate</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_De_Meyer_cf58.html" title="Jean-Luc De Meyer">Jean-Luc De Meyer</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_242.html" title="Front 242">Front 242</a>. These are two very notable bands, and are known internationally. Also, since they are the only members from their respective original bands, there should not be a call for a merge, as C-tec is a distinct enough entity to warrant its own article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another argument I have is that if you do a search for C-Tec on this site, you will find two pages worth of results that link to this article. If it is not notable, then why would it be so frequently mentioned?</p>
<p>By these arguments, I think this article certainly deserves to stay on Wikipedia. I do not understand where the issue arises that they are not notable enough to have their own article.</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> [reason] We need a reference guide to smaller characters. As a on going show, we get many rumours and speculations posted on One Piece related pages. For that reason pages such as this are needed purly to resolve such debates. Also, most of these characters have play extremely important roles or are generally important things to the series. If this page is deleted a lot of important information would be lost. These characters also don't warrent their own pages because they don't have enough imformation for them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngel_Emfrbl_46cc.html" title="User talk:Angel Emfrbl">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angel_Emfrbl_0295.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angel Emfrbl">contribs</a>) 12:33 2006-07-27.</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Both the Manga adaptions and the Anime adaptions pages were orginally one with the One Piece Main page. What we found is that it cause confusion and inconsitancey with other parts of the article. When we seperated the information it allowed us to clean up the One Piece main page and gave each section a chance to grow on its on without repeated information or inconsistacies. Also, this page is fairly new and as such has not been completed yet. At least it needs a couple more weeks to bring it up to scratch with wikipedias standards. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 13:53, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> One Piece Template. Size wise, we are actually trying to strink that, it is work in progress and discussion has been on going. Half the trouble is tha the series itself, One Piece, is the most populaur anime in Japan and therefore has a lot of information in general, much of it important to the storyline and worth noting on the One Piece pages. We haven't finished with the template, we need a few weeks to sort it out. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 14:03, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The One Piece crews being listed, that has only just been created as such and while has a list of crew and information doesn't provide much information on roles and importantce of the crews themselves. The individual Pirate Crew pages list the roles they've played, as well as information that cannot be summed up in a few short sentances. Another reason for them being the way they are is that there are so many (One Piece is afterall a show on PIRATES) that there is a lot of different crews. To put it plainly, you can't sum up EVERYTHING on the pirate crews in one list like on that page without loosing a lot of information important to the series. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 14:01, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, there are plenty of game companies that are only very active in a certain area. For example, there are numerous ones only active in the US and/or Europe (Microsoft's console games are not popular in Japan at all) but that does not make them any less notable. At any rate, certainly keep the template, but it looks like there's a lot of cleaning up to do around there. <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> <sub>(t|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Syphonbyte_b9d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Syphonbyte">c</a>)</sub> 18:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I may be wrong, but judging from your initial comments, you, good sir, seem to be under the assumption that One Piece is primarily a game series, while it is in fact an anime/manga series. Since Naruto et al gets to keep its attack lists and such (<a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu_%28Naruto%29_8413.html" title="Ninjutsu (Naruto)">like this, for instance</a>), One Piece should keep its own.

<p>"Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters."

<li><b>against</b>: This word produces a few hundred hits on Google (web), and a usenet search turns up more, going all the way back to 1992...note that the above-mentioned Golden Globe was published in 1998. Sadly, there are no <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_relay_chat.html" title="Internet relay chat">irc</a> search engines to log the common use of "heinleiner" on the various Heinlein-related channels from at least 1995 to the present.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you specifically exclude Varley and my own name...a very broad brush because I tend to go associate with anyone who identifies with the word, and plenty of Heinlein readers will mention Varley in other context, for many reasons...you get a result which includes a few dozen people mostly saying "I am a heinleiner", or "he is a heinleiner".</dd>

<dd>It's a rule, in several industries who wish to weigh public attention, that for every written mention of something, there are (as with roaches) a great many people aligned the same way, who are (like normal people) not bothering to state it on the record. In the TV industry, one "fan" or complaint letter is thought to represent somewhere between one and ten thousand people who didn't bother to write, for example. There are different ratios used by the publishing, music, advertising, and political industries.</dd>

<dd>We can also suppose that those who go on record as "a heinleiner", despite not being associated with various groups or cliques of that name, have their own friends, clique, or subculture from whom they derive or with whom they use that word.

<li><b>against</b>: Word is observably being used with some frequency by fans of the author, polyamorous people, libertarian individualists, etc. Though relatively small, the usage is not anomalous and, as this context exists outside of Varley's novel, it would not be sufficient to simply refer to that reference. As this article could be expanded to go into detail on a Heinleiner lifestyle, aggregates that consider themselves Heinleiners, and so forth, Wiktionary would not be sufficient either. --DiBaggioMA 17:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What constitutes "good secondary sources" to you? If you're expecting a sociological text on the subject, you won't find one, but that's not a reasonable standard to hold for such an entry, either. The word and what it describes can be readily seen on blogs, discussion forums, political discussions, litcrit forums and essays, among science fiction, polyamorous, futurists, and libertarian groups. --DiBaggioMA 12:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> discusses this issue: "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources... self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." For more detail on what constitutes a good source, see that page, but in general self-published work that hasn't been critically vetted by anybody but the author is not it. Things like blog posts do demonstrate that there are people out there calling themselves 'Heinleiners', but they can only illustrate one person's understanding of what that word means at a time; claiming a general usage on the basis of such individual uses is synthesis, which violates <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>.

<dd>The suggestion that the article needs to be deleted because the number of people who self identify as Heinleiners is lower than some arbitrary amount should not be heeded any more than the suggestion that an article about a specific tribe of indians should be deleted because the number of people who identify as of that tribe is low. Heinleiners exist, they self identify as such, they have a community, common characteristics, history and even a culture of their own. They exist and the article is valid in referencing them.--Daniel Macintyre 17:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)<small>(This is user's first edit.)</small></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>against</b>: One reason for the relative scarcity of people who identify as heinleiners is that RAH was careful to not endorse the many people who took his works as road maps leading towards a better future. Some of the people who embraced his work were visionaries, and some were rather strange indeed, but RAH maintained the principle that he wrote what he wrote for the money, and that if anyone chose to take it as more than entertainment, then that was on their head, not his.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This lead to a situation similar to the old saw of "those that know don't tell, while those that tell don't know." After RAH's death, Virginia was kind enough to grant a small degree of recognition to some of "Heinlein's bastards," in our case that came in the form of permission to reprint portions of his works in our newsletter in order to help folks better understand what we were doing and why. A remnant of this is our expection that anyone who wants to become involved in our organization read, at the very least, _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As one of RAH's bastard sons, I can assure you that heinleiners exist, and that we're still working to make his vision manifest since there's nothing more radical than a working model of a better way.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Note that if it is true that "those that know don't tell, while those that tell don't know," then, unfortunately, as with all secret societies, Heinleiners cannot be the subject of a Wikipedia article, because all the information in Wikipedia articles must be traceable to a published source, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">the verifiability policy</a>, linked under the edit box in every article creation screen. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC) P. S. The use of the word "against," uncapitalized, is a little unusual and idiosyncratic. To see three different accounts, none of which has created a user page, all using the same idiosyncratic style, leads me to wonder whether these users are independent of one another. Multiple and assumed identities were a fairly common theme in some of Heinlein's work...&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>, no indication that the site itself is notable. The books are already mentioned at the author's article, a message board doesn't become important by itself just because it's started by a guy who's written books. The rest of the arguments fail to say how the site is any more notable than any other fansite; "Many established star trek sites link to this site" is more of an indication of non-notability. "There are other fansites listed on wikipedia" isn't a reason to keep this one. Insisting that this is not a fansite with no other argument to back that conclusion isn't very convincing. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 08:38, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are many articles on message boards and other similar websites on WP. And there are <i><b>five</b></i> <i>Nitpicker's Guides</i>, not two. It has many users and traffic every day. I see no evidence of "vanity" in its creation, any more than in that of any other WP article. If the site is not considered "notable", then may I ask what the criteria are for notability? I know what the critieria are for <i>general knowledge</i> subjects, but those don't really apply to websites and messages boards, because those things don't generally produce those same criteria, like mention in books or magazines. None of the material in the article violates OR, verifiability, or any other guideline or policy that leads to deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> This site has a long standing in the Star Trek fan site web universe. Many established star trek sites link to this site. It provides all to continue to submit nitpicking comments to Star Trek episodes and movies. It's a lot more than a sequel to five published books. Most particularly, the message board has inspired the trend to place nits (and occasional editorial commentary) on many various different shows and programs, though the Star Trek shows are the heart as they demonstrate the challenges of maintaining consistency in such a universe that has lasted in t.v. shows, movies, animated series and books for over forty years. The site also has had impacts on the whole idea of nitpicking media shows as well, similar to a fad as say the "Jump the Shark" website. waldnorm 18:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nitcentral should be kept as a Wikipedia entry simply because frankly there's no harm in having it be included here. Anyone with objections to it simply don't have to read the article, let alone ever visit Nitcentral at all. Just because a few people don't want it on Wikipedia shouldn't supersede the wishes of a lot more people who would rather it be kept here. This is certainly a case of the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. Please keep the Nitcentral article on Wikipedia. Thank you. User:MarkWilliam 20:51, 28 July 2006

<dd><b>Comment</b> Since I'm not involved in the Trekie community at all, I can't really comment on the actual notability of the site in question. However, "Anyone with objections to it simply don't have to read the article" is not a valid reason to keep it: similar justifications could be made for the most absurd/NN of articles. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 17:31, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The original rationale for deletion is invalid on both counts. Nitcentral is not a "fansite" (it is a vibrant online community with an eight-year history covering a wide diversity of topics), nor is the entry a "vanity" article (for one thing, the original creator of the site had nothing to do with composing the article). The cursory wording of the original prod shows that the individual who made the recommendation for deletion based it solely on their superficial perception of the topic, without doing any further investigation or providing more congruent reasons why the topic is non-notable. Such activity should be discouraged. --Toddpence 13:16, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is a fansite and a dying stagnant discussion board where arguments are more common than discussion, people dont care about each other or anyone who has a problem with their special people. It is like a high school clique. The person who authored this article is also a moderator there and has been trying to rally the members of nitcentral to come and vote to help it avoid deletion.

<p>The site has had some bickering, but no more than what I have seen in other discussion boards or blogs. Discussion is still going on, and while there's tangents, the main reason people are there is to nit the over forty year old Star Trek universe, television shows, movies, commerials, etc. This site was the most influential in terms of the art of nitpicking, and has had much more impact than the original five books have done. The original author, Phil Ferrand, has long abandonned writing books on this subject, and the web site is now a center of nitpicking that universe. As for the claim that it is "dying," each day a number of posts appear on this board--compared to most blogs and discussion boards, this site still gets a lot of activity. waldnorm</p>
<p>Why should any decent, non-offensive entry like that for Nitcentral be deleted just because some people who never even visit the site in the first place want it so? Don't they have anything else better to do than to find Wiki entries they want to complain about and then try to have be deleted? Do something better with your time and leave the Nitcentral entry alone! But if you want to persist in this immature and idiotic endeavor then just remember that the same can also be done for any entries you naysayers may have added yourselves just by checking your names in the "contribs" link next to your names so you might want to think twice about wanting to have someone else's entries deleted. After all, it's a two-sided blade that cuts both ways. Or to put it another way, what's good for the goose is also good for the gander. User:MarkWilliam 19:19, 29 July 2006</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The site is the spin off of a book series and has enough traffic to be notable.

And yes Floyd I do because no one on Nitcentral did the right thing or attempted to reign in Nightscream and yelled and me to shut up bend over and take it when i was attacked by him and he said his malicious comments and abused his authority to silence someone he was involved in an argument with as a moderator.

The observatory, although my personal favourite, does not seem notable either, unless there were made some significant discoveries I'm not aware of. As to the comparison with <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strida.html" title="Strida">Strida</a>, that article also has a problem with sources. But since the number of Google hits is vastly greater, probably some could be found. If not, I'll follow Yomangani's lead and endorse Strida's deletion, too. In general, the existence of other bad articles should never be construed to allow the existence of one more bad article. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 09:29, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>. So "beixo" can mean a kiss, a bike, an observatory, a village, or the moon, depending on what language one is speaking. I have no problem with that, but why must we document it on wikipedia? And why, for heavens sake, would we document it on the <i>English</i> Wikipedia when the word doesn't mean anything at all in English? Put it on the Portugese wikipedia, or the Tayo Beixo wikipedia once those original inhabitants of Venezuela get around to setting one up (if there are any original inhabitants left). In the meantime, delete it from here. --<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 20:53, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>. Quite hard for a starting organisation to get an entry here when you keep saying: "Google hits are scarce". Right, but deleting will not help on this one. If a same article, but with more hits on Google can remain, I think that's strange. andre_rijn</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The preceding comment was actually made by User:82.93.135.105 (who may or may not be User:andre_rijn, but if he is, it's his second "keep")). Regarding its content: Yes, a "starting organisation" does not deserve a Wikipedia entry until it has managed to become notable. The "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strida.html" title="Strida">same article</a>" is already proposed for deletion, and unless someone turns its greater number of Google hits into some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, I doubt it's going to survive long. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 09:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article about a bunch of friends going on vacation. Totally nonnotable and also OR and unverifiable. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 12:33, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Open your eyes. This is not about a few friends going on vacation. This is about a movement, an idea, a concept. It may start with a few people. But like every movement, it has to start somewhere. Word is spreading, and it is already growing. People have started to show an interest in getting out there and doing some worthwhile things in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>This is designed to motivate normal everyday people. People who are stuck in a rut. People who are bored in their mundane lives. For instance several million overweight americans who don't even have passports, have never even seen the next door state, and couldn't tell you where Iraq, Vietnam, Germany or Japan are on a map, despite their contribution to the last hundred years of world history.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, if people in the world slowly but surely do something more with their lives, and experience other cultures, and see what the rest of the world is all about, then maybe, just maybe, they might be more tolerant of the rest of the world. They might open their minds, and have less aggression towards the unknown. Is that such a bad thing?</p>
<p>I understand you might not be able to see the bigger picture now, but why don't you just give it a chance to grow? --- The above several paragraphs were left unsigned and are from <span id="Mikeprocter13" class="plainlinks">Mikeprocter13 &#160;(talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikeprocter13_9ac9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikeprocter13">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">logs</span></a></span>)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> although it should be a category probably, this is the kind of thing that people would actually want to look up on some occasions. in my mind the "cruft" excuse NEVER outweighs the need for wikipedia to be a reference.

<li><b>Keep</b> and remove any speculative content. The war on cruft has its place, but the rule should not be that any article that starts with "List" is removed as cruft.

<li><b>Delete</b> as completely idiosyncratic non-topic. We have no article on Fictitious Jews... because fictitious Jewishness is not an encyclopedic concept. If you don't agree, then try writing an article on Fictitious Jews. In general, there shouldn't be a "list of X" unless there is an article on X, and the article should be written first, the list begin as a part of the article, and only be broken out when it becomes too big. As is, alas, usual for so many lists, <b>none of the entries are sourced</b> and the article therefore completely fails to meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. Is this a vacuous criticism? No. Picking one at random, the entry for Leopold Bloom has no citation. It's linked to a Wikipedia article, but, of course, Wikipedia articles are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">considered reliable sources</a>. And if we look at the article for <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_Bloom_cc29.html" title="Leopold Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a>, not only does it not cite a source for Bloom's being Jewish, it <b>does not even say that he is Jewish.</b> What it does say is that he is "the only son of Rudolf Virag (a Hungarian Jew from Szombathely who had converted to Protestantism and later committed suicide) and Ellen, an Irish Catholic." That might make him Jewish according to the definition used by... oops, never mind, I don't want to trigger Godwin's law... but not by most definitions. So, the list is unreliable, and due to failure to cite sources there's no quick or easy way to sort out the valid entries from the invalid ones. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Since when does Wikipedia delete articles and lists that are fun and useful to people, especially pertaining to a certain ethnic group, just because others don't like the list or the ethnic group? If you don't like the list, don't read it. If you don't think it's useful, don't use it. If you think such lists pertaining to different nationalities and ethnic groups are "silly" -- then don't read them. A lot of people enjoy them and find them useful. I was sorry to lose my separate list of Jewish SuperHeroes, which was merged with this list. But this list is just fine.Myst3 19:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right, hopefully a consensus either way will be generated by this AfD. There is still the problem of the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29_a7ce.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 7)">Big Brother (UK series 7)</a> article being too long. If this section isn't split off, maybe some other section needs to be split instead. The only other sections that look suitable for splitting off are Chronology, Title sequence and Criticism. Title sequence looks a bit small to stand on its own and Wikipedia generally doesn't have Criticism of... articles. Maybe Chronology would be another option for splitting? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 14:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ARGH!!! Do you know how many times I've suggested that? There's mixed opinions on it though. The Chronology was split twice early on, and although there was a consensus to keep the page that went up for deletion, it still got deleted. Looking at it now, the page as it was did have a bit too much detail; but people still won't agree to just split the chronology. If you want to bring it up again on the BB7 UK talk page and see what sort of response you get, feel free (as if I'd want to try to stop anybody from doing anything). --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 14:16, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it might be a good idea to have another discussion about the Chronology...perhaps at the end of the series? With the House Next Door, however, it isn't really notable on its own, but in the context of Big Brother, it is quite notable. You get the same kind of dilemma with the other split-off articles — with the nominations table, for example, a group of people nominating each other over a period of several weeks isn't notable, but if they're in the Big Brother house, it is notable. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 14:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I won't oppose the deletion if it does in fact contravene the policies of self-promotion. Recently - because of the success of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%27s_Next_Top_Model_75c1.html" title="Canada's Next Top Model">Canada's Next Top Model</a> - I've been requested to speak at a lot of events. As the event organizers take proposals to potential third-party sponsors a lot are asking what Modelresource.ca is.</p>
<p>I tried to be fair in what I wrote (not listing numbers of visitors, for example), but as I re-read it I can see how it might come across as vanity or blatant advertising. If you can suggest revisions I'm open to that, otherwise, as I said, I won't oppose deletion if you feel there is no place for it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangle14_8191.html" title="User:Dangle14">Dangle14</a> 13:59, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main issue is that you have no sources other than the website itself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of London's more notable streets. As for comparison with Ave. H, Ave. N, etc, since it is a major link between two of London's main streets a better comparison might be with <a href="../../../2/3/r/23rd_Street_%28Manhattan%29_83a7.html" title="23rd Street (Manhattan)">23rd Street (Manhattan)</a>, <a href="../../../4/2/n/42nd_Street_%28Manhattan%29_c284.html" title="42nd Street (Manhattan)">42nd Street (Manhattan)</a>, or <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Park_South_fa83.html" title="Central Park South">Central Park South</a> - all of which seem to have articles, as do many of NY's other main cross-streets.Vickers presumably mentions it as the site of the Philharmonic Hall - it's also the site of London's (and the UK's) main synagogue. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This image in this article is NOT the headquarters of ICP Systems and has no link to the company in any way. The article itself is accurate apart from the picture (which should be deleted). ICP Systems is based in the UK and associated buildings are not listed, and there are also no available pictures published, to maintain the confidential integrity of the organisation. I am glad that the above user has identified this problem. The image should be removed from the article and Wikipedia's server so that the image cannot be accessed.

<p>Even after contributing 11 years in the industry and being in the top positions in notable companies, if I can't find a place in programmers list then I can't help it. If I can't post about myself then it's alright but if everything else is fine then any of my friend can post, isn't it? If working with IBM, for Toshiba, Verisign, Microsoft and many more giants don't cater any value then I definitely wasted those 11 yrs. As far as PMI's PMP certification is concerned, that's amongst the top most certification and they audit the credential even before putting us for the tests.

<li><b>Comment</b>: there's a whole category of Summer Camps. Some have better articles than others (and some have more <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> than this!) ... regardless, is there a consistent policy on summer camps?

<dd>The burden of proof is for notability. The question is, why is this summer camp notable? And yes, I would like to see most of the camps listed in the category deleted, because I can't see how they're any more notable than the pizza joint down the street, or my Uncle Ned's house. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The issue isn't notability, it's whether or not the article is encyclopedic. Notability offers a helpful guideline in considering encyclopedic value, but it is not the core issue. It's always helpful to refer back to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. In the context of this particular article, how is the information not indiscriminate? How is this article not simply a directory listing?

<li><b>Delete.</b> It's hard to decide on this one. I would say keep if maybe some important person went to summer camp there and it changed their life and made him/her discover the cure to cancer. But really, who cares? If someone wants to immortalize their (no longer existent) summer camp, they should start a web page. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanBeach_bb3f.html" title="User:NathanBeach"><span style="color:#08457E"><font face="courier">--nathanbeach</font></span></a> 02:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, after considerable reflection. I also had to think hard on this one. Thanks for the replies to my comment above. I have to say, without <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> provided by the author(s) to establish <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a>, this (and any other summer camp articles that likewise don't establish notability) should be deleted. There <i>might</i> conceivably be cases where a summer camp article could be encyclopedic. But I fail to see that this one qualifies. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 19:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I pondered my own comment, above, re-read the article, thought some more, and decided that the fact that this was once the "largest private day camp in Canada" is probably not enough to make this article encyclopedic. The fact this camp is now defunct mitigates the one "notable" fact. No prejudice to anyone who can improve this article or show the historic value of this camp before the AfD runs its course. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:31, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If you've bother to even look into the article today (July 27, 06) they seemed to have rid their entry of such things as minor notable characters (ealier catagorized as 'Other's' in the Notable Characters. They've also decided, apparently, to reject the fact they are popular. In the introductory section they say they are simply an ORPG site with minor popularity which was earned through-out advertisemant and 'spamming.' Also, if the site was non-notable...why are you debating it's fate?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although its origin is problematic, the article itself is useful in providing an explanation for a term people are likely to encounter online, and resources (via the external links) for moderators who may consider adopting the technique. The first time I encountered the article was when I looked up the term myself, having seen it used, but having had no idea of the history of it or how it's done. Notable writers <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Scalzi_1451.html" title="John Scalzi">John Scalzi</a><a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003724.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003724.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_David_3258.html" title="Peter David">Peter David</a><a href="http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/003682.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/003682.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> have both mentioned the term in their blogs, and there is some evidence that the term is spreading into other, less precise usage<a href="http://www.thehawkeye.com/columns/Saar/Saar_1218.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thehawkeye.com/columns/Saar/Saar_1218.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. There are numerous references to disemvoweling online, and sourcing is a problem solely because of strict application of no blogs, no applets, etc. provisos. Since changes to this policy are under consideration, it is probably better to wait for resolution of that issue than to delete this prematurely. The other problems with this article have more to do with interpersonal issues than anything inherent in the article inself. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 19:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The change in the status of blogs as sources is still being drafted, and hasn't even been proposed yet. At this rate it may be months before it comes to a vote, and when it does I'm sure it will be controversial. Until such time as blogs are allowed the existing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy is active. Maybe we should delete the article now, and resurect it if and when blogs become reliable sources, or when a non-blog source is found. For a mere definition of "disemvoweling", Wiktionary would be the proper location. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's great that the first thing you came to for research was Wikipedia, but the term still doesn't have any <i>veryifyable sources</i>. Blogs are <i>not</i> concidered to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Why? Because anyone can have a blog. The term is used in the fourming community only, so we can't say it's a well known term. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a></sup> 21:33, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Anyone can have a blog, but not all blogs and items found on them are equally unreliable. If a notable NASA scientist, for example, reveals on his blog that the rings of Saturn have newly-discovered properties, the fact that the info is on a blog does not invalidate the news. That is why blogs by notable people are being considered for inclusion in verifiability. In this case, several of the blogs one might cite fall into this category. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 22:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A neologism used by very few people is still a neologism used by very few people, even if a few of the users are notable. Just because a person is notable doesn't mean every word they produce is. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:42, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> In that case I would say that even though the guys at NASA, we can't believe <i>anything</i> to do with science until it is A. verified by several notable scientists AND B. published in a well known scientific journal/paper/RELIABLE newscast. All things in science are considered THEORYS until they are verified by other scientists.

<li>I'm happy to tell you that you are wrong. One dividing line between reliable sources and the abyss is the presence of an editing staff. Many internet sources are considered reliable, such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon.html" title="Salon">Salon</a>. Neither being in print, nor killing trees, nor sweating ink, nor paying postage are necessary. It isn't about paper; it's about editorial review. One person writing a blog and one person issuing a thesis in a self published book are equally unreliable. World-wide, there are millions of bloggers. Even a thousand references are insignificant in the blogosphere - three plugins and a few hundred mentions are barely small blips on the blogosphere's radar screen.

<li><b>Comment</b>. To echo Will Beback, neologisms stop being neologisms when they achieve widespread use. Based on only a few hundred hits, I don't see how this can be called widespread even within the blogosphere.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just a thought here: Would disemvoweling be better coupled with a list of moderation techniques used on blogs, guestbooks, message boards, listservs and the like? Moderation techniques are not simply used on people who refuse to remain civil; they're applied to spammers and kids who think it's funny to leave "you're stupid"-type comments everywhere. I have other thoughts on this, but this may not be the place since the topic is disemvoweling. <a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> 14:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article discusses a useful technique. Just because the technique is new and hasn't been widely discussed isn't a good reason to avoid discussing it. Trying to define the article as being about a neologism is, IMHO, wrongheaded: it isn't about the word, but about the actions that caused the word to be invented. There should be at least one reliable source here: the article currently mentions that Arthur Hlavaty mentioned the technique in some print publication. If we can find out what this publication was, it might well qualify. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 00:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "very little of the wording from early edits exists." As we say where I come from in Maine, "Pushaw." In fact most of it is exactly as it was written in the first place. We added a context section that is now gone even though some still want it. The real question is this: can an "inventor" of a term in an online only community write her own article of significance? is it significant and encyclopdedic because she says so and has fans to back her up? That's not NPOV. Moreover, this is the first version:</li>

A lot of what we associate with her text is actually an edit or addition to it. Even the first paragraph has been greatly changed, and the spelling bit is not at all what she wrote originally. As for my own small contribution, what survives is basically the "For example" bit. As <a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> says, a lot of people have written and rewritten this. What's more significant is that the article is getting better, less TNH-centric and more accurate, partly because of this AfD. It would be a shame to delete it, now that it's so much improved, and so much of the problematic material (vanity as well as subjective) is gone.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article discusses a useful technique, one that I have used myself to moderate various weblogs and that many other weblog moderators use as well. It should be noted that one of the major opponents to keeping this article has himself been the subject of disemvowelling, which may explain his antipathy towards it and his attempts to get it deleted from Wikipedia. All his modifications to this article come directly after this technique was applied to him. Documentation is available on this point. While the impulse to prevent people from hearing about disagreeable things that happened to them in the hope of wiping out the disagreeable thing is understandable, that's no reason for attempting to delete it from a reference work. --72.79.1.138 17:43, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's true that Marky48 did not initiate this AfD, and previously directed his entergies toward changing the article rather than deleting it. The claim "They all know each other" is incorrect, however. Aside from my being familiar with TNH's online writing, and one personal friend, there is no one in all this with whom I had any prior contact whatsoever, aside from occasionally reading online comments. Nor has this anything to do with whether the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 00:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "The record will also show I didn't nominate it for deletion, nor do I know the editor who did. I don't think the support group can say the same."

<li><b>Comment</b> I have certainly not seen any calls to arms, or whatever you want to call it. I am an infrequent reader of THN's blog, but since I rarely comment there, and rarely read other peoples'comments, I wouldn't be able to recognize anyone from there, unless they were well known to me for other reasons.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I said that part of what you said was correct, and part was incorrect. Continually stating that everyone who wants to keep the article is in cahoots with each other does not make it so, or invalidate the article itself. Whether the article stays or goes should depend on whether it is accurate and useful, not on who said what or who knows whom. A number of people have found it to be useful, and the accuracy (or at least verifiability, despite disagreements on this point) seems to be improving. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 02:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>"Marky48, I would say that your allegations border on personal attacks, and you should perhaps tone them down." Well, that's a very subjective claim. You make my point nicely. You read her blog and now come to support the owner. Case closed. I would caution you not to make accusations and give quasi-orders to others. It further seals your personal bias. I've never said no one should come comment. You should dial back your rhetoric pardner. One thing is certain: if the outcome rides on votes hordes will come to support it from knowledge of the blog community in question. The word is out. That's vanity too.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> 23:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In other words, this is a very good example of the perrils of not assuming good faith. Oh, and if you are not aware of it, "giving quasi-orders" as you call it, is part of what we do as editors - don't you ever leave vandal or spam templates at other peoples' talk pages?

<li><b>Comment</b> "Disemvoweling" is, of course, a gerund of the verb to "disemvowel." The older usage, which still involves removing vowels from words but often for different purposes, would make a great addition to the article, with juicy non-blog citations to boot.

<dd><b>Comment</b> on the idea of rewriting the article only to refer to "splat out" self-censorship/"TXT SPK": I don't think these ideas are really notable enough to deserve a wikipedia article, at least not to themselves. What more can you say about either than a single sentence? They should perhaps be mentioned at wiktionary, but I don't think it would be a good idea to have a whole encyclopedia entry on them. Wikipedia, as somebody kindly pointed out above, is not a dictionary, so we shouldn't be aiming at a dictionary definition. Which is why I feel that ultimately, cataloguing uses of the word that don't refer to the same technique the article is talking about is a pointless activity. Yes, they should probably be mentioned. But it isn't really relevant to the core of what the article is about, which is a forum moderation technique. Likewise, I'm not certain it's critical that we include the information that Arthur Hlavaty was the first person to use the term in print (presumably that's in reference to the technique being discussed... the print edition of the Jargon File probably contained the "splat out" definition and was published a few years previously). Although I'd <i>still</i> like to know where it was printed and what he said about it... this is almost certainly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that so far we haven't followed up.</dd>
<dd>As to the idea that wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information, and that therefore this topic (as a little-known technique practiced only by a small proportion of forum moderators, a group which isn't particularly numerous to start with) shouldn't be covered, I'm still far from convinced. The topic isn't an instruction manual. It provides information about why the technique is used, and discussion of the merits of different approaches to performing it. It used to include, and hopefully will again some day when we can find suitable sources, a discussion of the merits of the technique.</dd>
<dd>If there were another article that it could be merged into, I'd support that, but I don't see one that's appropriate. The technique is useful. Knowledge about it is spreading, and more and more people are going to come across mentions of it and are therefore wondering what it's about. We've seen a few comment on this thread here. Therefore it is useful for wikipedia to contain an article on the subject. That the article presently lacks sources is a problem, yes. It's one that can be fixed, I'm sure: I mentioned one possible source in the last paragraph that we need to follow up and cite. There may well be others. Others will almost undoubtedly come along in the future.</dd>

<dd>The Guardian supports its use in referring to TXT SPK; the others are just intentional typos, rather than having a meaning. (Would disemvoweling HAL change it to HL?) No reference to its use in moderating boards. comp.risks suggests use (with splats) for self-moderating; but it still only talks about single, objectionable (to someone) words, rather than phrased. There's no source for the definition in the article, so a <b>delete</b> is still in order. A rewrite, leaving nothing of the existing article, seems a possible alternative. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That was me that mentioned the Straight Dope and the Jargon File above. Based on <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/" rel="nofollow">the Straight Dope site</a>, I believe that that column was included in the book <i>Return of the Straight Dope</i> (Ballantine Books, 1994, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0345381114</a>), but I don't have access to a copy to be sure about that. Similarly, if it's in the Jargon File, it's probably in <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i> (MIT Press, 1996, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0262680920</a>). If either of those books include the word, then they ought to qualify as RS (along with comp.risks, where I'm happy to see someone finally agree that that counts as a RS). <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoriSmith_8697.html" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> 23:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It was likely a word that fell out of use until the practice was reborn only modernized. As a potentially historical term the article could be rewritten both to reflect the past usage and to reflect the modern usage of the term.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm still not sure why the history of use of the word is even relevant. The article isn't about the word, but about the technique that is described. If we want an article about history of the word's usage, I suspect wiktionary is a more appropriate place.

<dd>Because the impression that I got from the article was that she invented the whole she-bang which is obviously false as the practice existed in the 18th century as a form of moderation.

<p>I am the author of the Javette article. (I read that I could remove the prod tag once I edited the article, which I did extensively.) I have attempted to use the examples of Sanka, Nestle's, and Starbucks to edit this article, knowing that these are acceptable entries. Could someone explain the difference between Javette and these mentioned articles so that this article can be improved upon. Thanks. --Javette Coffee 17:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is one (there may be more than one) difference that comes to my mind between Javette and the articles you mentioned. There are no rules against writing articles about yourself, however it is discouraged. In other words: "You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved."

<p><b>From the author again</b>...To the above critic...I would bet that Starbucks (actually their PR company) had something to do with the Wikipedia entry...with all of the history and the photo of it's 1st store...it's a good bet. (That's the way it works when you hire a PR Co.) I was under the impression that Wikipedia was a forum to introduce new innovations to the market, but maybe I was mistaken.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You were mistaken. Wikipedia is definitely not "a forum to introduced new innovations to the market." When you created the article, you should have noticed that above the edit box, it says "Wikipedia is not an advertising service. Promotional articles about yourself, your friends, your company or products; or articles created as part of a marketing or promotional campaign, may be deleted in accordance with our deletion policies." We have a formal policy that says <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a> that says "Wikipedia articles are not self-promotion." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:31, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought who better to write an entry than the person who understands it best.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fine as far as it goes, but a Wikipedia editor can only use his or her expertise to help in organizing, interpreting, and presenting material. Everything that goes into an article is supposed to derived from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">material that has been published by reputable sources</a> and the source must be cited.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To the critic below...Thanks for the crack on the Entrepreneur Magazine article. It was a really great day for us when a small company is recognized by a national magazine for it's innovative idea. Recognition is verification that you're on the right track.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good. In a year or so Javette Coffee may be a suitable topic for an article... if the story can be told by, say, citing articles in food magazines.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Go ahead and delete the article. Wikipedia and Javette are probably not a good fit for each other. --Javette Coffee 20:16, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article started out as an obvious advertisement. It has moved in the direction of an actual encyclopedia entry, but hasn't gone far enough. It is still an advertisement. The author did assert it's notability, so CSD doesn't apply. Also, the author removed my prod tag so here we are.

Yahoo Shopping says "This merchant is not yet rated and reviewed." entrepreneur.com and about.com each had an article about the company, but even entrepreneur.com didn't think it deserved it's own article (the article was about three other companies).

<li><b>Keep</b> (a little bit weaker than ordinary though). WP:WEB is not really applicable here (just happens to be a game that uses web browser as the platform). The game itself, and materials released by the developers, can be used as the primary source - though, of course, multiple sources are always <i>good</i>, I'm just saying that in case of no controversy, it's enough to trust the primary source. (Is someone denying World of Warcraft has bazillion users, for example? If so, how do you propose we verify their claims?) 1500 players, which the article claims, doesn't sound <i>too</i> big, but I think it's in the green.

<li>'<i>Delete<b>, or</b></i> <b>transwiki the stuff Wikt doesn't already have</b>. It doesn't matter that Wikt doesn't typically carry lists; the GFDL allows the list to be broken up into individual entries as Wiktionarians get to them. It only remains here because of the comparative obscurity of Wiktionary to many of those on previous AfDs, and an apparent feeling that Wikipedia must carry everything, even while Wikimedia offers a wide range of options. It does fail one of the guiding content guidelines that exists for a good reason -- that the articles that fall into such a category offer nothing encyclopedic about their contents beyond the outline of a meaning. It's true that WP:NOT isn't a straight jacket, but it does offer pretty good advice for a range of good reasons. This list is quite distinctly without anything above a bare-bones content, whereas the Sexual slurs article is a much better, if <i>very</i> weakly referenced at present, example. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 23:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Well maintained, well referenced article that demonstrates the uses of sexual slurs. Complaints in previous AfDs focused on references. Well, this is an entirely new and far more scholarly approach to the subject. As shown by many of the references, this is a serious area of academic scholarship and should be covered here (note that the sexual slurs article was spun off from this list). <b>Does not fail any policy</b> as WP:NOT specifically permits glossary pages. I would, though, invite those who are piously spouting off about policy while praising the sexual slurs article to consider sourcing that article, as it currently fails WP:V. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:02, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well now, that wasn't very pleasant, was it? Also, what do the previous AfDs have to do with this one, where neither the nominator nor the other editors actually talk about the problems they raised? <i>Academic scholarship</i>? Which of the references is an academic paper, as opposed to say.... a dictionary? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:08, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The previous AfDs have obvious bearing. They pointed to problems with the article and the problems were fixed. However, survival of two AfDs indicates support for the underlying validity of the concept. Many of the references I have added are from academic sources and, in fact, every item on the list could be sourced from academic sources, as I proposed months ago on the talk page. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:16, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but this AfD does the pious spouting you identified, rather than complaining about references; which is to say that it challenges the underlygin validity of the concept far more directly than before. Alright, <i>one</i> of the sources is academic<i>ish</i>. But I will be quite shocked if you can find any academic paper (rather than news report or those famed dictionary entries &lt;/spout&gt;) containing analysis about "cockgobbler", for example. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 00:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are aware that unsourced entries are generally removed from the list, as has been infinitely discussed on the talk page (hence, I have removed your <i>cock gobbler</i> entry). Regarding your point on references, I have never used a "news source" or internet "dictionary" as sources. I have used Duke University Press, Australian Institute of Criminology, NYU Press, "<i>Social Forces</i>" and other high level printed sources. I am thus somewhat surprised that you do not consider these to be "academicish". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:44, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't object to your sources or find them in the least inadequate; they are very good, reliable sources. The NYU one I hadn't spotted as I just looked throught the ones at the bottom; likewise "<i>Social Forces</i>". The Australian Institute was the academicish one I referred to. On re-visiting the Duke Uni Press one (which I only Amazoned quickly at the time), it is indeed academic. So there are more such sources than I had thought, I'll agree. Nevertheless, the bulk of them do come from dictionaries; which again are perfectly fine as sources (as long they're not of the Urband variety!). Probably your considerably better-than-average sources would find a warmer home in the relevant articles, some of which exist for certain terms, and for the others there's the lack of referencing in Sexual slurs that we've both been at pains to point out. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> - <a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">tk</a> 01:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - The censors are at it again. Note how they very selectively apply Wikipedia's policies to go after slang lists with a sexual orientation, while leaving Wikipedia's multitude of other slang lists in place. By the way, the subject fields which this list spotlights are sexual and minority discrimination, and therefore the terms may be of interest to practicioners in the specialized fields of litigation and anti-discrimination activism, for they would need to become familiar with these terms. The list may also be of interest to programmers who may need to create profanity filters for servers and websites. Writers also may find a need for a list such as this, as an encyclopedia goes into more depth than a mere thesaurus, and this list links to quite a few related encyclopedia articles. Getting back to the "other slang lists" issue, there are many slang lists on Wikipedia, so even though there is a policy against slang, there is an even stronger precedent for inclusion of lists of slang.

<dd>Have you even read the talk page for this glossary? The editors there have gone through a great deal of effort to verify every word on the list. So your statement that it is not verifiable is complete and utter shash. And since these words are part of subculture venacular, they are entirely encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7EList_Expert_7862.html" title="User:List Expert">List Expert</a> 09:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Announcement:</b> I've started a discussion on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Slang_glossaries" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#Slang glossaries</a> to discuss the fate of slang glossaries (such as this one) and to discuss whether or not the policy should be ammended to reflect the defacto acceptance of slang glossaries on Wikipedia. They are here, and based on the results of AfD discussions like this one, they seem to be here to stay. So shouldn't the policy be updated? It would sure save a lot of time and effort wasted on fruitless AfDs.

<li><b>Comment</b>. A number of lists of words have been nominated for deletion in recent days which are, in principle, indistinguishable from others which have not been so nominated (see my comments on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_loan_words_in_Sri_Lankan_Tamil_d613.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil</a>). These cases need to be considered together - we need to be consistent on what we allow and what we don't. In my opinion, this is crying out for <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_915c.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion">centralised discussion</a> so we can thrash out a policy on <i>when</i> a list of slang, or word origins, or linguistic lists generally, is encyclopaedic and when it isn't.

He was not "some two-bit reporter who was on for five years and vanished" instead he was some two-bit anchor who languished in a televison backwater because he didn't have the talent to get a network job.

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> has grown beyond simple collection of translations and becomes more organized, "encyclopedish". See e.g., <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Swadesh_lists" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Swadesh_lists">wikt:Category:Swadesh lists</a> and take a look into Template talk:Swadesh lists.

See also <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:insane" class="extiw" title="wikt:Wikisaurus:insane">wikt:Wikisaurus:insane</a> for other interesting developments in wikitionary. So IMO it is time to move most of such lists there. For example there was a move to convert artices like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Russian_origin_dd85.html" title="List of English words of Russian origin">List of English words of Russian origin</a> into wiktionary categories, like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Russian_derivations" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Russian_derivations">wikt:Category:Russian derivations</a>.

They are here, and based on the results of AfD discussions like this one, they seem to be here to stay. So shouldn't the policy be updated?

On the other hand, I think that articles on provincial agencies could potentially be kept if they have received enough coverage.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The WP:PORN BIO proposals have not been accepted by the community yet. One key point of discussion is that the "100 videos" test would exclude all but one (maybe two) gay porn stars if applied in the way that Feydey is trying to apply it. Are we going to say that Wikipedia does not accept articles on gay porn stars as a matter of policy? This article was nominated for deletion 1 hour and 12 minutes after it was created, leaving very, very little time for it to grow into a worthwhile article. Furthermore, I believe that, as the star of several films that focus on Latino men, he qualifies under Item 8 of the <i>proposed</i> criteria: "Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche." <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeromacnoo_1a90.html" title="User:Zeromacnoo">Zeromacnoo</a> 12:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This policy wasn't followed; it couldn't possibly have been given the short time lapse between the creation of the article and its nomination.

<dd><b>Response</b>. I'll say it again, as has been said many times before, you <b>cannot</b> judge a gay porn performer's output by straight porn standards. As I noted above, Mr. Torres's output for 2004 is hardly "A few movies"; it comprised 16% of the output of one of the studios he worked for, and 21% of the other. Both are niche studios within the gay porn genre (which some would argue is a niche itself); he more than meets the requirement of item 8 in the draft of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)</a>; his output in his niche has been prolific. You want to use the <i>proposed</i> guidelines, fine—he meets them.<font color="#FF6600">—</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 20:34, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It <b>does</b> matter that it's a proposal.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Regardless of the detail, it violates the POV policy. This thing is full of opinion (e.g., "excellent"). No matter what, Wikipedia is not supposed to be a collection of every detail on earth.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, where else could I retrieve information about the organization and festival? The point is I can change all of the text that sounds like rhetoric, but the fact is, Freewaves deserves to be documented, it's part of the history of Los Angeles film festivals. If Sundance is allowed to stay, Freewaves should also be allowed to stay. It should be <b>REVISED NOT DELETED</b>. User:Freewaves

<p>Art Dreco is as good and valid a performance art concept as The Church of the Subgenius, SCHWA, and anything Andy Kaufman ever did including his untimely passing. Its roots can be traced to the very heart and soul of Dada, not to mention Mama - especially YoMama, but I will admit, not YoYoMa who is in fact a cellist. Look it up if you don't believe me. To dismiss Dreco as a conceit by one mad individual does a great disservice to all the other mad individuals who have given so much to the movement - and taken so much from its detractors. The short-sighted criticisms of a few bitter rivals (you know who you are...) only proves my point. Long Live Dreco! When Wikipedia is but a faint bzt bzt bzt echo of cyberdust, I promise you - there will still be Art Dreco. You'll see.

As page author I'd like to clear up some misconceptions of some earlier postings.</p>
<p>Art Dreco is not the work of any artist. A cursory look at the Art Dreco Institute website reveals work spread out over two centuries and created on every continent.</p>
<p>Art Dreco is not a commercial or promotional endeavor. The Institute has existed since 1973, has been listed in the Encycopedia of Associations, since 1976 and has been reported on in numerous magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs.</p>
<p>It raises valid aeshtetic, philosophical and artistic issues. In order to value, understand or appreciate this art movement a sense of humor is important...

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is priceless. The concept itself is a work of art. The beauty is obviously in the eye of the beholder. It needs work, but it should not be deleted.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The idea of censoring, ignoring or eliminating the definition of an art form such as Art Dreco because of a difference in taste,some personal pique or someones idea of sociopolical/artistic correctness strikes me as reminicent of the recently devolved Soviet attempts to limit its citizens' exposure to and participation in anything but exclusively Kremlin approved art, publications and other personal expression. Such limitation, while growing more dangerously prevalent in these fear driven days of neoconservative domination, are inconsistent with the intention of this republic's original comittment to basic freedom of expression and should be exposed and resisted whenever uncovered. Limitation of intellectual/informational choice is especially ironic and antithetical to the rationale for this Wikipedia's open-source existence. As a University Professor at a northeastern graduate faculty and as a Visiting Professor at a bay area Jesuit university, I have referred to Art Dreco as a jazz-like American art form and listed its Art Dreco Institute as a source and resource in each class syllibus. Its samples and examples communicate the rapidly evolving nature of our creative/production-related culture and helps portray the ideal of individualism in a society moving towards anti-intellectual artistic conformity. Dada had a similar history: obscured at its origins by a totalitarian necessity to demand and define 'realism'. Other historic examples of such artistic limitations include the violence that erupted at the debut of Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring' and book burnings following the first publication of Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'. The recent banning and derision of The Dixie Chicks (some of their cd cases having become good Art Dreco examples) by disinformation and censorship along with allegations of anti-patriotic/un-Americanism has unfortunately appeared here (with certain ominous echoes) for those not predisposed to the influence and lessons of history. Art Dreco's proponents and its many collectors are much better sources than I am for in-depth analyses. It clearly has many of its roots in humor and I was happy to be able to find it with some of its best and most classic commentary in this Wickipedia entry. As a suggestion for those who have made its authenticity an issue, I dig back a few decades for a phrase often used by young people directed at adults who were unduly obsessed with their limit and control&#160;: "Get a life". Were I to see that homily stitched on linen or stenciled on dayglo paper, I would likely consider it Art Dreco and would likely add it to my personal collection of classics (now including an African-American curb jockey, a rusting change box from the old Los Angeles 'Red Car' street car line....and a collection of backyard incinerator pieces from 1940 pre-smog-abatement back yards now an 'alternative living space' for a family of cats. Art Dreco is where you find it; a most art-lover-friendly form. I was pleased to find the Art Dreco listing here, and hope it remains a part of this valuable collection of information not always available in more limited and restrictive publications.

<p>A story featuring Adventure Eddy was published in magazine for students on a summer program in Paris in 2003. Exactly the same story was published in 2004.

I, the creator of those pages, made them for various reasons but among them are the following.</p>
<p>A link to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Germany_df99.html" title="King of Germany">King of Germany</a> should not link to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_monarchs_8b0c.html" title="List of German monarchs">List of German monarchs</a>, because it gives the someone innacurate impression that these persons were German, or even German momarchs the list also gives the false impression of the existence of some "German" superstate from 843 onwards. (The term "german" in it's modern meaning doesn't appear until the late 15th century)</p>
<p>When people click on a link of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Germany_df99.html" title="King of Germany">King of Germany</a> they should not be linked to a page containing German emperors who in some cases lived and entire millenium after they did. No, instead they should be linked to the Kings of Germany, and just that. Note that I'm planning to expands the 2 pages I made, so that they become real articles, instead of semi-lists. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 09:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Hi, at present there is no encylclopedic value in the two articles nominated by Srnec. If they are turned into redirects in their present form as I recommend, it is reasonable to turn those redirects into full articles when you are able to. I agree with you on King of Germany, note however that it wasn't nominated for deletion and could itself be turned into a full article. The information that is currently contained can always be re-pasted again if it is needed as it exists in the larger <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_monarchs_8b0c.html" title="List of German monarchs">List of German monarchs</a> article. Perhaps there would be scope for renaming the main article List of Germanic monarchs. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 10:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I wouldn't rename the list of German monarchs to something with Germanic [...], the meaning of german and germanic are just too different, and the article would just explode.</dd>

<dd>But I agree with that proposition, they will temporarily be turned into redirects, until I have recreated those 2 articles in a way that they add more value to wikipedia.excellent.</dd>

Since it shows itself within the first few paragraphs not to have been checked from grammar mistakes ("who's" when it should be "whose") I can't imagine that it can be considered a terribly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not consider any of the sources to be excellent, but I do feel that they are reliable and are all from publications. With the exception of the Newsweek story, I would not add any of them, to say George W. Bush or John Kerry, given the wide availability of source on both men. However, the amount of information available without original research on Watts is rather limited, I feel that in proportion to the topic and difficulty of finding source on him the sources are quite good. The sources also distinguish themselves in that, while there are some discrepancies between them they agree on the basics where their subject matter overlaps.</li>
<li>I do not particularly care for that source myself; especially the format the document is in. A <a href="http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/520.article.print" class="external text" title="http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/520.article.print" rel="nofollow">better-organized html version of the article</a> appears on the Florida Baptist Witness website. I chose the text document only because it is the original source of the article, but I have no objection to substituting the present version for the html one. The Southern Baptist Press distributes stories to smaller more localized Baptist publications, giving it a very high readership. In spite of the poor archive format and the grammatical error, I think that it can be considered a generally reliable source of information on an article about a Baptist evangelist. These types of grammatical errors are common in smaller publications, and while it may not inspire confidence, for it does not cast doubt on the content of the article just the grammatical compotence of its author. If you have deep concerns about any of the other sources, please bring them to my attention as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I had no trouble finding sources about Watts independent of Clary's website and have used them to expand his article, complete with inline references. This man served as the leader of the Oklahoma NAACP for sixteen years, and is respected by members of both the civil rights and Baptist communities. He was a major figure in the civil rights movement in Oklahoma. State wide figures are considered notable by wikipedia guidelines. It has been asserted on the article talk page that Watts was a member of LBJ's civil rights commisson. The only online source I found for this was Clary's website, a source that I chose not to use at this time, but I see no reason to question the veracity of the claim. Such accomplishments make him notable in his own right—his connections to more prominent people only makes him more notable and it easier to expand and reference his article. I'd like to ask those that have already voted to please review the current version of the article. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 19:58, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
