<dd>I was figuring on moving it back to my user space if the consensus is for delete (which I assume it will be). But some day, we will look back on the couple of days in October 2006 when Elephant (wikipedia article) was on Wikipedia as a golden age. So, not enough keep votes? I say not one keep vote more. If it is marked to be deleted, we are enough to do our cause loss, and if to survive, the fewer keep votes, the greater share of honour. He that shill live this day, and see old age, will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors, and say "Tomorrow is Elephant Day". Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember, with advantages, what feats he did that day. And Elephant day shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for the to-day that votes to keep with me shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition; And gentleman on wikipedia now a-bed, shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Elephant (wikipedia article) day! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This is a toughie, but the self-reference is too self-serving. Better to appear self-effacing and self-regulating, and thus preserve our self-esteem. A note in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> might be appropriate -- or it might not. I think the litmus test has to be: If you asked a regular watcher of Colbert about him, would she include "wikiality" (without you prompting her) as part of his bio? I think not. This article is only of note to us because it is about our encyclopedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. You know Wikipedia has spun out of control when there's a Wikipedia article about another Wikipedia article. Seriously, you've GOT to be kidding me.

<dd>The material is clearly inappropriate for the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> article, as the history of a wikipedia article about elephants is not information which is notable to know about elephants.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to note that, as others have said, the potential problem with this article is <i>not</i> that it violates <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. Mentioning this material in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> article would of course be a self reference problem. But a separate article is not. A wikipedia article <i>about wikipedia</i> is allowed to talk about wikipedia. The question, then, is whether the wikipedia article on elephants is a notable topic for an encyclopedia article. It seems to me that, what with the Colbert reference and its easy verifiability, it is at least as notable as, say, the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Atlantium_31bd.html" title="Empire of Atlantium">Empire of Atlantium</a>, which constantly survives deletion votes, or, say, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victreebel.html" title="Victreebel">Victreebel</a>.

<li>Has this article attained sufficient notability to be the subject of a wikipedia article? That would be exciting, as it might suggest that I have attained sufficient notability for a wikipedia article to be written about me, as the author of said notable article. I think, however, that it would be confusing to have a wikipedia article about another wikipedia article that no longer exists. If Elephant (wikipedia article) (wikipedia article) is to be created, I think it can only be in a context where this article is kept, or I fear its notability would be questionable, and it might itself be subject to deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 22:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article exists because, back in August, people were trying to get the stuff about Colbert into the article <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a>. I determined that while this material was inappropriate for the article on elephants, it would be perfectly appropriate for an article on the wikipedia article "Elephant," and created such a page in my user space to do that very thing. Then, a few days ago, I moved it into main name space, judging that the time was right for a wikipedia article about a wikipedia article. Sadly, I seem to have been mistaken. Also, the article, while self-referential, does not violate <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, in that it is an article about wikipedia, which is allowed to talk about wikipedia. It is not unverifiable, either, in that the Colbert material is referenced to news sources, and the material about the article itself can be checked against the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> article history, which is surely a reliable source for the history of the Elephant article, I think. The only potential problem, as far as I can tell, is notability, or the question of whether the Colbert incident (which is apparently considered to be notable) should be described in an article about the wikipedia article on elephants.

<li>It seems to me that such a claim would be untrue, and simply a sneaky way of trying to get Mr. Colbert's evil, wikipedia-hating falsitude into wikipedia through the back door. Only verifiable, well-sourced information about elephant articles on wikipedia should be included in this article, not "hilarious" jokes inspired by known wikipedia-hater Stephen Colbert.

<dd>I think most people are voting this be deleted because of the precedant it sets. All other instances of articles about articles are about the incident, not the article itself. As I humourously attempted to point out above, allowing articles of the format Pagename (Wikipedia article) is essentially opening the door to a system of endless self-reference, as <i>Pagename (Wikipedia article)</i> is itself a Wikipedia article, and hence a suitable subject for another article, which could then be the subject of a 4th article... This idea might make an excellent joke on uncyclopedia, but on Wikipedia it is probably not the best plan. Though if someone wanted to write an "<i>Editors of <b>"Elephant" (Wikipedia article)</b> (Wikipedia article)</i> in the news" (Wikipedia article), I'd love to see it. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 10:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many people are voting on dubious bases like verifiability. And I don't think that avoid self reference actually deals with this issue - articles that are explicitly about wikipedia subjects are allowed to mention wikipedia. As I've said several times, I think the only clear issue here is notability. It seems to me that, having been discussed in various mainstream media outlets, the wikipedia article on elephants is <i>arguably</i> notable enough to have its own article. Certainly the information about Colbert has been judged to be notable for discussion in <i>other</i> wikipedia articles. This article, then, provides more context on the elephant article which was Mr. Colbert's target, thus allowing people to more fully understand its history before the Colbert incident, for instance. Now, this is arguably ridiculous (clearly everyone else seems to think so, and if I am honest with myself, I suspect that I think so as well), and if we want to have a policy banning wikipedia articles on wikipedia articles, that might be a prudent idea, and this deletion discussion might provide a good precedent for enacting one, but there is, so far as I am aware, no specific rule of that nature at the moment, just the normal notability requirement. As to Uncyclopedia, it sucks. A few days of this article being on actual wikipedia is far more amusing than just about anything on Uncyclopedia, which is almost universally prevented from being funny by the "too many cooks spoil the broth" problem. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 12:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

All I'm contesting is <i>whether we need an article of its own on this topic,</i> and I'm not citing any other criteria in this debate but <i>common sense.</i> My view is that this is mergeable material at best. <b>Not every newsworthy incident is worth a new article.</b> I'm definitely <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_DelEssay_d916.html" title="User:Wwwwolf/DelEssay">against deleting articles by policy-pounding</a>, but I'm also against keeping articles <i>just because</i> they satisfy some criteria. If the article sparks "Who gives darn in 100 years? Isn't this really insignificant?" reaction, we should really consider the need of the article and think that it's probably mergeworthy. Let's compare: Seigenthaler case essentially sparked the big media debate about Wikipedia's reliability and editor responsibility, and contributed to the development of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy. That was a major news event that had <i>implications</i>. Elephant case was a minor segment where some random... TV guy or something... tells folks to vandalise Wikipedia and Wikipedia <i>takes normal precautions</i>. In the end of the day, nothing new has happened, except that now we have an injoke. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough. I had no expectation that this article would survive for very long on its own, and most of my comments here have been more playing the devil's advocate than anything. I'm satisfied that there's a consensus to delete. Would it be acceptable if I move the page back to my user space and then delete the redirect? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 15:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has now been on wikipedia main space for approximately 5 days. After 1 day, a proposed deletion notice was put up. I took that off a day later than that, and somebody almost immediately nominated it for proper deletion. It has been up for deletion for three days now.
