<li><b>Delete</b> User Bschott has tried to delete the Deletion notice and there are reasons to believe that he is from the company.

<li>Well, 1) it's my first time fighting a deletion 2) I am not going to give out personal information like that on the interwebs. There is no way to confirm where I work so what is the point? I could work for the City of Fargo, work for the company, be a proud citizen of the city, or just have an interest in RFID 3) and it seems that a majority of people disagree with your opinion Stan. In any case, as pointed out, this is a discussion on article and has no bearing on if it will be deleted or not.

<li>Comment: I would gladly update the page, but I am unsure of what you would concider in need of verfifiable sources? The company website, which is linked in the article, and the two other IPO related articles can confirm anything on the page. Actually, since they filed for IPO, the FTC would have a public copy of the Filing on the internet, which explains every minute detail about that company. Would a link to that be good enough for the Verification? I mean if it's good enough for the FTC and Nasdaq... --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">Bschott</a> 21:47, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Google Test (using <i>"alien technology corp"</i>) gives 20,000+ hits. Among them (without doing an exhaustive read), there seem to be "multiple non-trivial published works" by independant sources. Though this isn't a rigorous test of Criterion #1 for corporations, it shows that Alien Technologies at least comes pretty damn close at worst. The article should be improved per Zos above, and I do think the listing of the Board should be removed as non-notable. Additionally, the exhaustive listing of "investment partners" should be removed as non-notable (as far as Wikipedia is concerned) and replaced with a prose section on <i>major</i> partners of significance outside the walled garden of RFID tech.

<li>Saxifrage, could you cite a Wiki policy regarding your note? Why does it has no bearing? Specifically: <i>"These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus."</i> StanMan 20:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those policies guide what we may <i>write</i>, not what we may write <i>about</i>. I can't cite you any policy because there is nothing in the deletion policy about this. It doesn't mention bias because bias isn't relevant to the deletion policy. The closest I can find that even mentions the difference between what problems warrant deletion and what problems warrant fixing-by-editing is the second paragraph of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>:
<dl>
<dd>"Articles and text which are capable of meeting these should usually be remedied by editing, but content which fails inclusion criteria for Wikipedia, is incapable of verification with reputable sources, or is in breach of copyright policy, is usually deleted."</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>An article being edited by a biased editor doesn't fall under inclusion criteria, verification policy, or copyright policy. Furthermore <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott">User:Bschott</a> is not the sole contributor to the article, only the most recent of many according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alien_Technology&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alien_Technology&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article's edit history</a>. Even if he was, that would not warrant deletion. Consider an example: if the sole contributor to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> was Bush himself, should we delete the article? No, because it is an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. Instead, it should be edited to conform to our content policies. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:51, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
