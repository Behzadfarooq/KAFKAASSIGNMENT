<li><b>Keep</b>. It is the worlds first internet feature film. Name another film where all communications were done online, by people who were not qualified, had no experiance and had no budget. The experiance was gained not through college, not through University but through the internet. Its composers, special effects artists, editors, cameraman and even actors were all obtained online. Its production log was updated weekly with video, music, acting and editing, giving back to the people and the sites who helped create the film. Upon the films release it was hosted exclusively online and for free, once again giving back what had been taken. The film would not be possible if it were not for the internet. Cheap low-budge or not, a feature on this size (over 100 individuals and websites contributed to the 75 minute film) has never been completed before. If you can prove otherwise then I shall retract my claim. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBign2003_ed51.html" title="User:Bign2003">Joe</a> 17:06, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - "Strong Keep"(who are these creeps?) Yeh, a strenuous <b>KEEP</b>. The article could be re-written by someone with a better grasp of English, but I say it's a keeper. I have just read an article and interview at the BBC website as well as a lot of other positive response online. The film is an internet first and many agree. The amateur use of Green Screen technology has no doubt influenced scores of other amateur film makers to put their ideas on to tape. This does not appear to be an advertisement or anything tricky. Voters should research this more thoroughly. Notability demonstrated with full valour. keep 'er!!--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffDeHart_3340.html" title="User:JeffDeHart">JeffDeHart</a> 11:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I assume you are speaking to both of us. I'm very sorry for the personal attack. As Crossmr pointed out, I am a new user. So when she/he personally attacked me and my comment, I retaliated. I get the feeling that Crossmr takes pleasure in doing these deletions. I hope that you reprimand Crossmr as she/he is obviously a well experienced wikipedia person. I am just getting started. I was actually very shocked to have my comments rubbished by a bitter person like that. Next time I retaliate against a personal attack from someone such as Crossmr, I will try not to roast them as badly as I did in my comments.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've just looked this up as we were learning about it in my Film course at The University of Kent. We were actually encouraged to download it. I knew that it would be on Wikipedia, but to be deleted? I was weary about leaving a KEEP comment because if you look up, you will see that everytime someone leaves a KEEP comment there is a follow up that tries to trash the POSITIVE people. What is with that? Some very hateful, upset people on Wikipedia. It's hard to fathom. This is a great film. Everyone in my class is well aware of it. The film is not racist, political, hateful or mean, yet there are such mean comments and spiteful sentiments above. It's very odd. Bad vibes boys! cheer up! This article is a keeper! This film has sold more copies of Adobe Premiere than Adobe could ever hope to! Only notable independent film makers make it on to the BBC website. Good film. Good company. Seem like nice guys... and yes, they've made themselves famous! KEEP! A <i><b>fervent keep</b></i> or a <i><b>strenuos keep</b></i>! haha. P.S. If someone is going to follow up my comment with a snide remark, then I'm going to have to assume that this is not a genuine delete but probably someone with some score to settle against someone that had something to do with this film. The comments on this page are pretty rude.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Justin, you seem to be new here. So, first, please don't attack people personally here (trashing the positive people). It's one of the wikipedia policies. Second, please read the guidelines on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> to figure out what constitutes an article that can be kept on Wikipedia. Third, it could be the best film in the world, but if we can't verify it (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) then we can't keep it, as anybody could write the same thing about their film. That being said, the BBC source seems to have merit. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2006/03/21/joseph_tan_feature.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2006/03/21/joseph_tan_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is the article, so I'm going to say <b>Keep</b> as well, with a note saying that it should be cleaned up (notably, "first internet movie" - that's a clearly false statement). --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 20:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>And while that one source may have merit, notability requires it be published by multiple non-trivial sources, in addition there has been nothing to support the claim that this is the world's first internet film. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:25, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi COLOURBURST! Thanks for your constructive criticism. I honestly do not want to hurt anyones feelings are day anything nasty, but I had a read of the page before I left my comment and it is shocking how the NOs seem to love deleting! Yeh... the internet's first movie? Not so sure about that one either. There are some grammar problems in the article, but the movie is well known and that's pretty good considering it's been released this year. Perhaps it WAS the first FULL-LENGTH internet film... I have no idea. My <i><b>KEEP</b></i> was because I have personally learned/heard about the film in Uni and the BBC have picked it up and they seemed to wnat to further the film's success so good on em! Also, the film is FREE so I can't see this article being a SELLING tool... although drug dealers always give the first one free too! oops bad joke! Look... these guys did some breakthrough stuff and I felt that the comments on this page really were too far gone. Some spiteful people. That's all. I expected to see the words KEEP or DELETE and then the reason, but you get a bunch of bitter nonsense. Is Crossmr real admin? Seems like a kid.</li>

<dd>This user added a lot of information around this. Notably the director and the company involved (Which appears to be the director and a few individuals). The directors page was removed before and then recreated, I believe the companies as well (I know the directors for sure, I have a hard time remembering which stuff gets recreated on my watch list, and this was around a week ago). I believe this was the first time this one was created, it was put up for speedy but an admin decided to err on the side of caution since it made a vague claim to notability (which the author has yet to support even though he said he would). The piece was proded, prod was removed, and now we're here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 20:48, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ha.. ok Gotcha.. Crossmr IS admin and has just threatened me with suspension/blocking or whatever because I said I thought he was a kid? Who knows.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't see any PERSONAL ATTACKS within my comments and believe that the warning has no merit or platform, but I will refrain from making any statements about Crossmr again. Obviously you cannot rebute a personal attack made by admin. seems unfair, but ok. I'll play along. Sorry to anyone offended.</p>
<p>Colourburst, this page has been deleted before? how can you see that? Is it the same nominator? can't wikipedia prevent repeats? deleted articles from coming back? 6 month block on a deleted article's title or anything?</p>
<p>This film is known amongst the film community everywhere. Kent Uni is not the only course using it as a reference.</p>
<p>You only have to type it into Google to see that there are more than 'a few' reviews, articles and references.</p>

<li>No I'm not an admin, I have no idea where you got that impression. Any user can leave appropriate warning templates on another users talk page. Articles are only protected from recreation in the case of frequent recreation. I.e. its deleted, and recreated shortly there after, deleted and recreated again. Usually after 2 quick recreates its protected from recreation for awhile. Regarding personal attacks, the general attitude of your first comment was uncivil and aggressive and clear on who it was directed at.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 21:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
