<dd><i>This reads more like a blog or discussion page than a proper encyclopedic entry. The use of the "one crit. one rebuttal" format is potentially misleading, and the tendency on this page to make blanket generalizations about what one or the other side believes is dangerously close to the kind of straw-man arguments commonly used by TV pundits. I would recommend deletion, because the topic of the page is presented in a non-Wikipedian way (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider_or_social_networking_site" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a blog</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">or a site to respond to criticism</a>). <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclevername_7a7f.html" title="User:Noclevername">Noclevername</a> 01:48, 4 February 2007 (UTC).</i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm almost embarrassed by this vote since I have some underlying issues with paranormal subjects being addressed seriously on Wikipedia, but my own POV aside this is a well cited article which I presume was split off from a main article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> for space. As such, it's logically laid out and strongly footnoted. It could use a strong re-write, it could benefit from a more objective tone in the introduction, it could certainly do a better job of introducing and discussing each subsection -- but all of that can be addressed by editors, no reason for AfD in my opinion. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 02:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> An article's temporary content is not a reason to delete it; the article has good potential even though it is a bit <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapy</a>. All ya gotta do is take out the soap! Lots of people (like myself) who don't know a lot about parapsychology are going to wonder what is so controversial about a lot of it, and what specific arguments have been made for or against it. This article is where they will find this information. <a href="../../../v/-/m/User%7EV-Man737_9c52.html" title="User:V-Man737">V-Man737</a> 02:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The way it has been framed is original research. The title is POV. Most of these references can or should be used in an article about ESP. For and against arguments for ESP extended into a debate about parapsychology is synthetic argument.-<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMsHyde_99ac.html" title="User:MsHyde">MsHyde</a> 03:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As I said on the talk page, the topic is a good one for an article but the chosen format needs to be changed as does the focus. i believe the editor who created the article is perfectly capable of reformatting it and changing the focus to the topics I outlined in my discussion on the talk page here: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticism_and_response_in_parapsychology_b373.html" title="Talk:Criticism and response in parapsychology">Talk:Criticism and response in parapsychology</a> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">Lisapollison</a> 03:28, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Markeer. Perfectly acceptable topic. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 04:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> because it is a valid topic for an article. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> article should discuss the field of parapsychology itself with a summary of the criticism, but the criticism itself has a great deal of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> and source material of its own. It has its own history, its own key players, and so on. I strongly recommend a re-write, however, and a title change to <i>Criticism of parapsychology</i>. The re-write should change it from a criticism and response format, and soon, for several reasons. One, it really does seem like it's leading the reader towards one intepretation. Two, it suffers from stylistic problems where it looks like a forum, blog, or a collection of notes, and doesn't read like a fluid article. All of these things aren't a reason for deletion however. They're reasons for a re-write. That seems to be the general consensus thus far, even among the delete votes. The calls for delete (from what I read) are all based on style and content, not topic. The article itself shouldn't be deleted. --<b><a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENealparr_0e08.html" title="User:Nealparr"><span style="background:#000;color:#fff">~Nealparr~</span></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../n/e/a/User_talk%7ENealparr_39bc.html" title="User talk:Nealparr">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nealparr_5991.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nealparr">Contribs</a>)</sup> 05:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Markeer. Being badly written is not a reason to delete. The article, IMO, needs a title change and a complete rewrite for the reasons others have suggested here but that should be discussed by the editors on the article's talk page not at AfD.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 05:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While the style in which the article is written is not suitable for a Wikipage, and there are more than a few weasel words, the topic is notable, the pro-parapsychology text is accompanied by citations and is mostly evidently not WP:OR, and there is a good coverage of the issues at hand which is not POV pushing. Keep it, but re-word it. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfectblue97_ef11.html" title="User:Perfectblue97">perfectblue</a> 07:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move to userspace</b> I can see that Martinphi put a lot of work into this article, and reading it I found it to be very interesting; but before I even looked at the talk page or this AFD I knew why it was up for deletion. It does not read like an encyclopedia article, but more like a college essay. It is a well written, well sourced essay, but an essay non-the-less. Don't get me wrong; I like this article. But I don't think it belongs on Wikipedia; certianly not in a criticism/response format. I'm suprised that no one arguing for the deletion of this article has yet pointed out the relevant page from the Manual of Style, the one that says that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EPro_%26_con_lists_a531.html" title="Wikipedia:Pro &amp; con lists">Pro &amp; con lists are considered harmful</a>. With that in mind, there is a lot of material here which could conceviably be used to craft a break-away article from the main <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> article, so I don't want to argue for blanket deletion. Rather I think the solution in this instance is to <b>userfy</b> it to Martinphi's userspace for a rewrite. It needs to be rewritten so it's not in a criticism-response format and so that it's less essay like and more encyclopedia like. ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 14:51, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep but cleanup</b> - Useful discussion and should be kept, but is very essayish, and the conclusion is POV. It needs work, but so do many other articles. Perhaps WikiProject:Paranormal could take it on as a group project? <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 16:55, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and merge relevant criticism into main article. It's basically a list of "answers" to strawman arguments, a POV fork which violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> and gives the impression that the critcism (which is made up of strawmen to begin with) has been decisively rebutted. Criticism/controversy should be incorporated into the main <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a> article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Kinbote_6728.html" title="User:Charles Kinbote">Charles Kinbote</a> 18:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This article has some problems with conflation. There are 3 fields of Parapsychology: ESP, Telekinesis, and "ghosts". There are three things that are being criticized: whether parapsychology is a valid field of study, whether the results are valid, and whether the results prove anything. Following these divisions would help eliminate the "blog feeling" that a lot of deleters have noticed. It might also help this article come a little closer to the truth: some parasycholgists (mostly esp researchers) have used good methods, others clearly lack understanding of the scientific method (I saw some <a href="../../../e/v/p/EVP_694e.html" title="EVP">EVP</a> researchers on TV who were hilarious) -- Some "skeptics suffer from <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientism.html" title="Scientism">scientism</a> and are therefore easy strawmen, but there are some legitimate qualms some scientists have. The article also lacks a historical perspective which is a flaw that the main parapsychology article also has. It needs attention from an expert, but it is not OR nor is it really NPOV. It should prtobably be merged with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_skeptical_view_of_parapsychology.html" title="The skeptical view of parapsychology">The skeptical view of parapsychology</a>, Maybe some of the project Paranormal people can agree to help this article.</li>

<dd>This can be resolved by editing the last few paragraphs in order to remove the "conclusion" as per Manual of Style guidelines for page format.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Markeer. This article is not a POV or Content Fork, it is instead a “spinout” article that falls under <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_fork_160a.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="WP:POV fork">article spinouts, summary style</a>. The main parapsychology article is currently 42KB long and growing - larger than the Wikipedia recommended size of 32KB, the main body of prose is slightly smaller in size, but still in range for spinoffs. Criticism of parapsychology is a notable and relevant subject. I agree that the article needs a rewrite and should be renamed, but it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 21:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No-one has, I believe, argued that the topic 'criticism of parapsychology' is neither notable nor relevant. The main arguments against retention have been whether the article, as written, constitutes a valid, neutral article, or that it exists and has been formatted to be a <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apology.html" title="Apology">defence of a position</a>. Deletion does not preclude re-creation under the same or a different title; the issue is whether the article is valid now, and if not, it is salvageable in its current form. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillC_aaf9.html" title="User talk:BillC">talk</a></sup> 00:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Note:</b> Thanks BillC, I guess my response wasn't clear in that regard. I do believe the article is salvageable and can be fixed in short order. The current contents are interesting, and I do not believe it is sufficiently "bad" enough to warrant deletion while being re-written. Until then, we can add the {{ActiveDiscuss}} tag to it. If we all put in as much effort there as we did here, it would be done already...&#160;:) I mentioned notability and relevancy because, first, they are a key focus in AfD discussions; and second, there seemed to me to be some question in a few of the above comments as to whether or not the subject needed its own article or was a sufficient topic to warrant an article - perhaps I was reading a bit too much between the lines. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 00:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Note:</b> In reviewing the Deletion Policy section <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deletion_policy.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Deletion policy">"Problem articles where deletion may not be needed</a>, this seems to me to fall under number six: "<i>Article needs improvement</i>" and number eight "<i>Article is biased</i>", rather than What Wikipedia is not.
