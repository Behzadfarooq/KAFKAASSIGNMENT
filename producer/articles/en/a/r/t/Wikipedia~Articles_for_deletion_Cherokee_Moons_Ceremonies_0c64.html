<li>I actually tried "Cherokee moon OR moons ceremony OR ceremonies" and other combinations on Google, and checked several web pages. There are several moon ceremonies at different times of the year, but I found no reference to the importance of 13, nor of its relationship to turtles, nor of turtles being sacred (note that the latter claim has been removed from the article). This is why references were asked for (which would not necessarily have to be web references). Groeck 05:18, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I note the following <i>Ceremonies played an important part in the life of the tribe. The Cherokee celebrated a series of seasonal ceremonies and festivities that corresponded to the food cycle of the tribe. March was the first of thirteen moons and the feast of the deer. April’s celebration focused on strawberries, and the next harvests were “little” corn, watermelon, peaches, mulberries, and then “great” corn. In the eighth moon, our October, the festival featured turkey, followed by ceremonies for bison, bear, ducks, chestnuts, and finally nuts that were used in bread. Most of the seasonal ceremonies declined in importance in the eighteenth century, except the one held in late summer that coincided with the ripening of the late crop of corn. The Green Corn Ceremony lasted several days and had significant cultural and social connotation.</i>, which may be about the same thing, from <a href="http://www.chattoogariver.org/Articles/2004Su/Indians.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chattoogariver.org/Articles/2004Su/Indians.htm" rel="nofollow">Chattoogariver.org</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - yeah it might be easy to simply delete this article, but this article is but 2 hours old right now and while there isn't much context, I highly doubt that it is all made up. Sure there aren't alot of sources, however, google is not the end all and be all of human knowledge. I think this page has a place here on WP, and I think it was nominated just a little too quickly. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 06:22, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I strongly object to the claim that this was nominated too quickly. The majority of deleted articles are speedied or AfDd within a minute of their creation. This is extremely important, as if bad, unverified, information remains on the 'pedia for some duration of time it only serves to lower the general accurateness of WP.

<li><i>The majority of deleted articles are speedied or AfDd within a minute of their creation.</i> Yeah, obvious crap like "Johnny Teabag is the greatest guy in the world LOL!!!" or "Bumfuck Nowhere is an up and coming high-school band in Ottumwa, Iowa".

<li>My point was that just because I nominated the article soon after it was created doesn't make it an invalid or even a bad nomination. There isn't any duration of time that an article has to exist before being eligible for AfD, and keeping this article for such a reason is incorrect. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 23:17, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would like to draw attention to some of Gadugi's edits of this AfD, which are now buried in the edit history (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23808257&amp;oldid=23808031" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23808257&amp;oldid=23808031" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809647&amp;oldid=23809581" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809647&amp;oldid=23809581" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809846&amp;oldid=23809767" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23809846&amp;oldid=23809767" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23814308&amp;oldid=23813957" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FCherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;diff=23814308&amp;oldid=23813957" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). I think they certainly qualify as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, especially the bits about me being an Irish steel worker (never been near a steel foundry in my life), and the bit about me being blocked for disruption.

<p>Oh my god, I just saw an ILM forming. You posted comments I was a hoax and marked a perfectly valid article for Afd in bad faith. You also bragged on your talk page about being an Irish (Steel) "Blue Collar" worker. Dont post content on Wiki if you dont want it copied and edited. I removed those comments I made because they were inappropriate. I see conduct like this on SCOX all the time but now I see it here. ILM Alert. Gadugi 08:29, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>O.K. I've had some sleep, and now can respond fully. First: I have never said that you are a hoax anywhere. If I may draw your attention to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies_0c64.html#Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cherokee Moons Ceremonies">top of this page</a>, I say, "Probably a hoax." This was a guess based on the content of the article, how unverified it is, and the fact that it is appartently not notable enough to exist anywhere in the internet except for Wikipedia, and the internet is a big place. Second: You apparently do not understand WP policies, as evidenced by the edits mentioned above and your immediate assumption that this article was nominated in bad faith. Third: You continue to say that I violated some AfD regulation and that your article is "valid" (and is therefore, I can only presume, immune from AfD), but if you see <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> you'll find that I haven't violated anything and that policy is on my side, at least in terms of nominating the article. I suggest that you relax, re-read this AfD, and read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, and <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and see that I haven't done anything wrong here. If, after doing that, you still feel that I have, then at least cite some WP policy that puts me in the wrong. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcap_a87c.html" title="User:Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 16:38, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You called this article a Hoax and me. You probably should actually read the articles before voting Afd. You keep quoting Wiki policy, yet Google shows 31,000 hits on this topic, then you quote NPA policies, while it was you who attacked by posting an Afd to the article accusing the author of being a hoax and a fraud without ever having read it or inquiring. Why don't you just admit, "I was lazy and was attacking Jeff because I do not like him based on the stuff I saw on the internet, and I pounced the moment I saw him post this article and I was in the wrong, AfD withdrawn." Instead you keep justifying your actions when everything you claimed, all of your reasoning, your research (or lack thereof) all indicate you did not even attempt to verify information before voting, and you were in the wrong from the start.

<p>Not to mention his suggestion that Fvw had been reverting his edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;oldid=23811490" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cherokee_Moons_Ceremonies&amp;oldid=23811490" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, something which the page history shows to be false. <sub>- Unsigned post by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.19.128_6197.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.19.128">82.15.19.128</a>.</sub></p>
<p>Also calling me "SCOX ILM Member" in the previous edit. I'm sure calling someone a member of a lynch mob counts as a personal attack.</p>
