<p>This page is completely original research and self-reference. To meet Wikipedia's policies, this article should not be included unless notable media sources have covered it and those articles can be cited.

Most of the articles in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedias_by_language" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedias_by_language" rel="nofollow">"Wikipedias by language" category</a> should also be evaluated to see if they should be deleted or moved to the Wikipedia namespace as well, since most of them have no non-Wikipedia/Wikimedia citations and include a lot of orginal research stuff that only a Wikipedian/Wikimedian would know. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 23:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>The alexa rank of metawiki is not 600</b>. Alexa considers *.wikimedia.org to be the same site, so for example all traffic to *commons* is included in that number. Also, upload.wikimedia.org is included, so it's an excersise for the reader to determine why wikimedia.org doesn't have a rank as high as wikipedia itself. Metawiki is actually very low traffic. I'd highly doubt that it would cross the 100,000th point on Alexa by itself. The varrious funraisers logos and such which are pulled from wikimedia.org sites by the wikipedias are what causes a lot of this number. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ameta.wikimedia.org&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ameta.wikimedia.org&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">quick google search</a> shows that meta is almost entirely unlinked outside of Wikimedia sites. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 21:44, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the entity is notable then it shouldn't be difficult to find notable (not some random Wikipedian/Wikimedian's blog) non-Wikipedia sources to verify everything that's discussed in the article. But I really don't think that Meta-Wiki is an encyclopedically notable site. It's notable to Wikipedia, but not so much to the general public (which is what the Wikipedia namespace is for). And since as far as we know it hasn't been reported on in any notable source, anything that anyone writes there is gonna be ORIGINAL RESEARCH from their experience with Wikipedia/Wikimedia. On the other hand, if a newspaper was to interview a Wikipedian and report on it, then we could turn around and write about it and cite them. That's at least supposedly the standard for the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, but for some reason those rules are being ignored for all the peripheral Wikimedia-related articles. And it violates NPOV for Wikipedia to hold its own projects to a different standard than those of others. So for all those reasons, it's pretty clear it should be deleted from Wikipedia (and moved to a Wikipedia namespace project page if need be). <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 04:42, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment RE: Alexa and IAR</b>: Its supposed Alexa ranking was cited, but that raking was misleading, as Alexa gives the same exact rank to a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdomain.html" title="Subdomain">subdomain</a> as it gives to the main domain. So meta.wikimedia.org <a href="http://alexa.com/search?q=meta.wikimedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/search?q=meta.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> gets the same exact rank as wikimedia.org <a href="http://alexa.com/search?q=wikimedia.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://alexa.com/search?q=wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also, User:Zoz cited some other Wiki-Media project website articles, but if some of those are just original research and self-reference, then I think they should be deleted too. I think there's a very strong case for keeping the main <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article, as Wikipedia is a major website which has recieved extensive media coverage and can thus be written citing those sources. The same goes for any other Wikimedia website where notable sources have written about it which can be cited. Someone said that it should be kept on the basis of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">"Ignore All Rules,"</a> but I don't see how violating self-reference, original research, and NPOV - to include an article about a site which hasn't been shown to be encyclopedic - benefits Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 18:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm starting to pack my bags for this site, and let me leave you with some words of wisdom till I come back: This article benefits the site because it is part of the site, it's part of a beautiful project that "makes the internet not suck." I will not stand by idley while it's being cut down but it's own rules. It's extremly important because it is the project, and the project, last time I checked: is relevant. I am keeping the overal aestics of the site up by ignoring the rules, since the rules would kill Wikipedia, and creating one massive downfall.

<dd>wm.org probably doesn't link to meta because it's solely for project coordination, not education, and so most people won't need it, and the ones who might want to go there know how. As for the Alexa ranking, sure it is, it means it's a high-traffic site, and as long as it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, there's no reason not to have the article. Googlebombing does not increase a site's Alexa ranking, as Alexa rankings are based on the amount of visitors to that site (which they measure using their toolbar).

<dd>You still haven't shown how Meta-Wiki meets <i>any</i> of the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Has the site "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself"??? (If so, then show me where) Has "the website or content won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation"?... (if yes, which ones?) And is Meta-Wiki "distributed via a site which is both well known <b>and independent of the creators</b>" (Wikipedia is well known, but certainly not Independent of Wikimedia). And finally, WP:WEB notes that "Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article."

But that's assuming Meta is under Wikipedia in the hierarchy. However as the name suggests, Meta is contains <i>meta-content</i> so it's rather the parent of Wikipedia than it's child.

(If a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdomain.html" title="Subdomain">subdomain</a> is notable then the whole <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_name.html" title="Domain name">domain</a> is; if the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> is notable then <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">it's inventor</a> is etc.) --<a href="../../../z/o/z/User%7EZoz_d0ff.html" title="User:Zoz">Zoz</a> <i><a href="../../../z/o/z/User_talk%7EZoz_2d49.html" title="User talk:Zoz">(t)</a></i> 20:45, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The analogy fails. If Wikipedia is the building, Meta-Wiki is at best the scaffolding, not the architect. Theory of relativity is to Albert Einstein as Wikipedia is to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, not to Meta-Wiki. "Meta-things" do not automatically inherit the notability of the things themselves; there is no stipulation on Wikipedia's notability or verifiability guidelines saying such, and common sense suggests that "notability isn't inherited" is indeed a correct and necessary thing to keep in mind in this situation, just as much as it is for any other ("a certain lavatory of the White House" does not inherit the notability of "the White House"). To meet the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, citations are needed (and, obviously, ones outside of the site itself!) to confirm its notability. Why should we hold our sister-sites (more like estranged-crazy-aunt-sites?) to a <i>lower</i> standard than we hold other websites? If anything, we should hold ourselves to a <i>higher</i> standard, to circumvent <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self-referential</a> bias. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 20:55, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I used analogy only to prove that "meta-things" of notable topics inherit notability. I didn't mean to relate Jimbo to Albert or anything&#160;:D. The point is that Meta stands higher in the hierarchy than WP, <i>even if WP is far more notable in itself than Meta</i>. --<a href="../../../z/o/z/User%7EZoz_d0ff.html" title="User:Zoz">Zoz</a> <i><a href="../../../z/o/z/User_talk%7EZoz_2d49.html" title="User talk:Zoz">(t)</a></i> 21:05, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But it <i>doesn't</i> stand higher in the hierarchy, in any meaningful way (i.e., in any way that relates to notability at all). And I specifically demonstrated why your analogy fails to show why notable topics <i>don't</i> inherit notability, not to relate Jimbo to Albert either. The notability of an article must be established <i>in its own right</i>: simply saying "Meta-Wiki must be noteworthy because Wikipedia is noteworthy" is weak reasoning. If it's as notworthy as you imply, it should be fantastically easy to find reputable sources galore to add to the article, and then the issue will be settled. As of yet, that hasn't happened, so notability hasn't yet been established to a sufficient degree to merit an article; try harder. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 21:11, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think anyone who has become involved this discussion is seriously contemplating the complete removal of the information from this site. The question is rather: what would the best place for this material? In it's own article? Merged into another article? In the Wikipedia namespace? Maybe a merge and redirect is the best option, but <b>merge and redirect do not require an AFD.</b> At the very most one would start a discussion on the relevant talk page—and possibly not even that. Suggesting that the article should be merged or moved is not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, but <i>creating the AFD in the first place</i> looks very much like it.
