<li><b>Comment:</b> Please note that I will be making no further edits to this or any other page on Wikipedia under this or any other account, as this nonsense has shown me that the amount of proportion of arguing one has to do to the actually useful edits one makes is way too high, and I don't have the time or the time or tolerance for frustration for something so ultimately frivolous. This article has enough sources, and it's your choice whether to vote to delete or to go out there and cite it properly.

<li>Sourcing a triviality surely isn't the point. The subject is not notable as a poker player (and just to anticpate the obvious, his online accomplishements were due to cheating, which makes them non-poker accomplishments). He has one casino final table in a tournament, and isn't even old enough to play ring games in a major US casino poker room. The cheating incident is mildly interesting, but *he* is not, and merits no article. Two sentences about the incident in the poker cheating article are the appropriate place to mention the incident. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:31, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please refrain from removing my citations from the article while at the same time claiming I'm not providing any.

</ul>
</li>
<li>(edit conflict) The added source from bluff magazine fails to establish notability in my mind because the article is not primarily about the subject (Justin) but instead about the practice for which he was guilty. The second is an apology by him, thus also fails to establish notability. Unless there is a published article more directly about him, I think he is not sufficiently notable. --<i>best, kevin</i> <b>[</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">kzollman</a><b>][</b><a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">talk</a><b>]</b> 22:32, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> I think <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has clearly been met and then some. The issue here is notability, and that's it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is much longer way to establish notability and verifiability than just quote several online sources. To make references valid, the <b>sources themselves</b> must be proved to be notable. It is not my business to check whether the quoted website is not run by Bonomo's or Grindingteeth's boyfrend in his garage. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Give me a break, Mikka. There's no such thing as a notable sources policy. And if you want to argue that sources are run by Bonomo or Gridinginteeth in some kind of bizarre conspiracy to delude Wikipedia into including an article, then it definitely IS your business to look into it; you're being dismissive of the hard work that another editor put in to trying to meet your own demands. <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">Don't bite the newbies</a>, but even if Grindingteeth wasn't new, you need to be more <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. But anyway, Here: Source 1 is from Bluff Magazine, which is a print magazine with a website. The magazine is a real magazine, with a decent Amazon sales rank. Source 2 is from CompatiblePoker.com, a website with a 200K Alexa rank; not bad, considering that it's a niche site that caters to Mac and Linux poker players trying to play online, yet doesn't offer games itself. They have bios of only 13 online pros, and the link is the one for Justin. Source 3 is a repost of Justin's apology from his website; it is hosted on a site about honesty in online tournaments. A quick websearch reveals other sources from <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/5408790" class="external text" title="http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/5408790" rel="nofollow">msn.foxsports.com</a> (yeah, I know it's Fox but *I* think it's still reliable), <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_33/b3896121_mz070.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_33/b3896121_mz070.htm" rel="nofollow">BusinessWeek online</a> (before the cheating incident), another <a href="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_02_28.asp" class="external text" title="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_02_28.asp" rel="nofollow">Bluff Magazine</a> article; passing mention, but lists Justin as one of 6 "players to watch", and another <a href="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_01_25.asp" class="external text" title="http://bluffmagazine.com/magazine/2006_01_25.asp" rel="nofollow">Bluff Magazine</a>; this time a profile of him.

<li>Please don't pretend that the <s>original</s> editor acted in good faith, as that is very offensive to editors who do and have. Frankly I don't know what you think the above proves, or even why you mention it. There is no dispute a cheating incident involving this person took place, and is mentioned in places around the web. The point is whether this person merits an article, and given after all this time there are only two sentences that are far more appropriate to either the online poker article or the cheating at poker articles, that pretty obviously answers the question. The person is a footnote of a footnote. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 06:59, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read what I was responding to (Mikka's comment), and you'll see the point. And I don't know who you mean by the "original editor," because the article was edited by some dozen users before you nominated it for deletion. However, I certainly do assume good faith of the editors who try to improve the article in response to community demands. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">We're supposed to</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 13:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Definitly notable to most poker players. <a href="../../../b/b/x/User%7EBbx_da7b.html" title="User:Bbx">bbx</a> 07:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable and I question the assertion <i>Definitely notable to most poker players</i> since, if that were true, verifiability &amp; sources would be out there in, so to speak, spades. Which it isn't. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 19:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. So when did Wikipedia fall into the hands of these strict, authoritative, big-brother types who say "No no no!" to every minor article and edit, using the one-size-fits-all excuse of "Notability"? (No personal attacks notwithstanding, I point a big fat finger at <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">User:2005</a> as the embodiment of this negative attitude). I, for one, envision Wikipedia to be a source of ALL knowledge, big or small. In fact, I am the creator of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unity_Young_037b.html" title="Unity Young">Unity Young</a> article, who is much less notable than Justin Bonomo, but who became (humorously) famous after ONE single bout on ESPN2. Does the Unity Young article serve the community of curious people who stop by Wikipedia to see if there's some info about her? YES! And I will fight anyone who wants to delete THAT article. Just like I will fight anyone who tries to delete this one here. Thus, I join with my fellow Wikipedians who wish to keep the Justin Bonomo article. We are not strict disciplinarians. We want free, open knowledge. Immense, vast, all-encompassing, searchable knowledge. I used to be a random user who searched Wikipedia for ANY and ALL knowledge. As long as there are curious people who come to Wikipedia to search for "Justin Bonomo", to see what Wikipedia has to say about his cheating, then that is notable enough for me (and most others). This article shall remain. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloudreaver_a68f.html" title="User:Cloudreaver">Cloudreaver</a> 21:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>These two points</b> are so important, let me re-emphasize: SEARCHABILITY and CONTENT. If enough people SEARCH for it, Wikipedia should have it. And focus on increasing CONTENT, the more content the better. The more entries the better. 1,000,000,000,000 entries on Wikipedia, I say. Let the knowledge and information flow.<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloudreaver_a68f.html" title="User:Cloudreaver">Cloudreaver</a> 21:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seriously.&#160;:) But s/he is making a point that is well-established in policy: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:43, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took up this cause and advanced this philosophy only after I myself was a victim of deletion. And it wasn't fun. It sucks. <b>Suppression of information is a reprehensible action</b>. So thanks to Mangojuice for showing me this page: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. I will <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">BE BOLD</a> in adding content.
