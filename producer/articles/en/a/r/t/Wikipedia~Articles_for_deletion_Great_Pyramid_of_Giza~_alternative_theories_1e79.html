There's all kinds of crazy stuff written about pyramids (such as this article as it stands), but some of the craziness is at least notable, in the same way that some JFK conspiracies are notable.

<li><b>rewite / build</b> This is in the process of being re-written and has received some initial amendments. However, some people would serve themselves and (more importantly) the audience of Wikipedia greater if they examined the mainstream version they are necessarily protecting, examined the evidence offered in some of the alternatives, and didn't simply dismiss something just because Graham Hancock also wrote it in a book! This page can and is being re-written - it is a process, just as some tweaks to bring neutrality were necessary and made to the 'main page'. Build the page, correct the bits that are not NPOV, and allow it to house the bits that otherwise will overflow to the 'standard theory' page. It is, after all, mostly arguable theory on <b>both</b> sides of the coin. FYI I am perfectly capable of writing neutral prose, although i do have my opinions; sometimes they sneak out. I'm sure you wouldn't do the same...--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenesisBlade_eebe.html" title="User:GenesisBlade">Genesis</a> 17:29, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thought I'd have a go at trying to rewrite the article to achieve NPOV and remove unverified evidence, but I had to give up after only a few paragraphs. The article is just too POV (e.g. "<i>These archaeologists claim that this amounts to sufficient evidence to state their model as though it were fact.</i>") and makes both "extraordinary" and EXTREMELY VAGUE claims without citation (e.g. "<i>The problem for any dating is that the age of the rock is of no help...</i>") . You'd have to remove so much of it to get it into an encyclopedic state that you'd be left with no more than a few lines. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 07:41, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> NPOV doesn't mean it must adhere to the standard point of view, yet in this case it has to state itself as different from the standard. Making any mention of its claims (apparently, dating an ancient building based on the discovery of a small amount of circumstantial evidence, from debris found excavated near by, DOESN'T comprise an extraordinary claim then?) is interpreted as against the neutral, yet its actually just against the common view. Not so long ago, the NPOV was that women were less important than men... to suggest different would have been considered outlandish, and any proof offered through logic considered unsubstantial. Things change. Sometimes. FYI what is 'wrong' about the statement 'dating the rock is no help'? it's a fact, surely! Dating the age of the rock is completely useless in dating the age of a building! this is an example of an un-neutral viewpoint taking editorial action on a piece; the veracity of the statements doesn't actually matter.--194.73.217.241 (Genesis) 09:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the sentence again. As it stands here. Or in the article. It seems entirely counter-intuitive in both cases. IANAArcheologist but surely the purpose of dating is to <i>determine</i> the age of the rock, so how does that statement make any kind of sense? <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 13:56, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>...they don't date the rock itself; they don't date the actual building!? They date circumstantial evidence from the surrounding area; usually this has some authority, because the finds are clearly related. However, in the circumstances of the Great Pyramid on the Giza plateau, the evidence has been very meagre to come by. Thus they have found very little by way of viable archaeological finds, with nothing substantial to tie them to the actual building of the pyramid. Usually, with tombs, they have plenty of evidence by way of carvings or painting on the walls, non-gold artefacts left by the raiders... they have actual evidence tying the location to a person or event, even a god. It is not the case with the Great Pyramid. The question raised in some of the alternative theories of the age has been how valid the dating of these finds is. Yet, according to all the above, and discussions elsewhere, stating this is deemed outside the NPOV. That is to misconstrue, however, the meaning of NPOV. Neutral is not merely the mainstream view. Neutral is balance between opposing valid arguments, where they exist, and having the articles not express personal opinions. It is also exposing weaknesses in arguments where they exist. I am endeavouring to do the same to the alternatives, but at the moment I spend more of my limited time defending their right to exist than doing this. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenesisBlade_eebe.html" title="User:GenesisBlade">Genesis</a> 16:37, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
