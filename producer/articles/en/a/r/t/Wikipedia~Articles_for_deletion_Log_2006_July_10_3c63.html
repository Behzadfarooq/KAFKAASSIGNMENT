<p>Note from the writer of the article - this article is a synopsis of the story "The Bronze Ring". Its encyclopedic value lies in the fact that Wikipedia has a page on Andrew Lang which lists all his color fairy books, including "The Blue Fairy Book". If the title is clicked, the table of contents are listed. Many of the stories have been summarized, but several have not. The Bronze Ring was one that was not summarized until I did so recently. It has no copyright violation. It was summarized from my personal first edition of the Blue Fairy Book by Andrew Lang. Can you advise me on improving it? I'll try to put in links that go back to the other Wikipedia articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nssanes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nssanes_79e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nssanes">contribs</a>) 00:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Let me explain: I punch in the term in google and I at least look at the first 30 or so hits. If those are irrelevant or from other non-notable websites, then I put the game up for deletion (after having prod-ed it first). But, I doubt if I should mention that all in my AfD.

<li><b>Keep</b>. POV forking is when someone copy-pastes an article at a different title and starts editing it to make it present a different point of view. Such articles are usually extremely similar to the original and very newly created. I am absolutely <i>not</i> convinced that this article is a POV fork. First, this article was created on 13 September 2001, making it one of Wikipedia's oldest. If it does duplicate other articles, I think it is the other articles which are at fault, not this one. Second, there are sections here which I cannot find in either of the articles cited as being duplicates, for instance the section on magnet schools. Finally, neither <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">education voucher</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">alternative education</a> will cover that there are some school districts, such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Schools_f611.html" title="Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools">Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools</a> which have school choice even though the parents can choose to send their child to another "normal" school and not alternative education schools. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The first version of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">Education voucher</a> had as its entire content "The topic of education vouchers is a quite distinct one from <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">school choice</a>, q.v." - on this evidence, the two are different topics, but if one is a fork, it isn't this one that is a year older than education voucher. <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">Education voucher</a> is also a daughter article of <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_choice.html" title="School choice">school choice</a>. The first non-redirect version of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_education.html" title="Alternative education">Alternative education</a> to contain anything more than a stub template (from January 2006) was "Alternate education is an umbrella term referring to a number of approahces to the education of children other than standard classrooms, such as <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_schools.html" title="Alternative schools">Alternative schools</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeschooling.html" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a>." Again we see that that article is both newer and a different topic. Article is clearly <b>not a fork</b>. It is incomplete, it ignores forms of school choice such as that in the Boston, Massachusetts public schools where parents get to prioritize among existing public schools (as part of the desegregation effort), independently of the existence of charter and other private schools. If it is currently POV, that is not reason for deletion - it needs to be hopelessly and inevitably POV. This is clearly a topic about which a NPOV article could be written - so go write it. And as to the claim that it is entirely favorable, the "Criticism" section contains arguments against - it is the successor to the "Arguments Against" section that was created in March 2004. In my conclusion the only true portion of the nomination is "very controversial school choice concept" - it is neither a fork nor 100% advocacy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

"School voucher" is the neutral term; "school choice," like "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_tax.html" title="Death tax">death tax</a>" and "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-to-work_law.html" title="Right-to-work law">right-to-work law</a>," is a propaganda term. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:36, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I can understand people having a problem with the Support and Criticism section, but I spent a good amount of time creating the data and definitions part. AFAIK, no other entry in Wikipedia provides a definition of the different kinds of School Choice out there. One specific example would be of Tuition Tax Credits, which are different from Vouchers. Also, this article tries to provide pertinent examples of each kind of School Choice. By contrast, the Education Voucher doesnt even have a reference to the Milwaukee School Voucher program which is the largest such program in the USA. I am sorry if I am a litle defensive, but I think that the info (if not the Pro/Con sections) is valuable and unique. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougRisk_2661.html" title="User:DougRisk">Ian Lewis</a> 16:59, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A wikipedia contributor notices three years of work, makes an entry (which I made a few corrections to), and it's going to get dumped because I'd prefer to finish the thing before promoting it and getting the project name all over the place? As the author of the comic in question, I strongly object to the "notability" argument. That aside, thanks to Adashiel for pointing out the comixpedia link - I'd never have known about it otherwise. I vote the wikipedia entry gets kept - it's a notable (to me, anyway) source of traffic to the site. --<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolios_162f.html" title="User:Solios">Solios</a> 04:34, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Look, I'm the author of the comic in question and I don't care if you delete its entry. I didn't even add it in the first place (I did add an example comic though). However, if you're going to delete it, delete it. I'm not about to play the "not notable and lets not list why other than Alexa which is just spyware anyway" bullshit game. Hahnchen, if you think my comic is gonna be another notch on your deletion belt you're sadly mistaken. I'll delete the page myself (and I did) before I let you use it for your own obnoxious purposes. Also, let me submit that what is and isn't notable is subjective. I'm not saying my comic is. Its four months old, thats barely enough time to have gotten a solid footing reader wise let alone gain notability. However, using stuff like Alexa and going "I dun rede it" and acting like having a page on the Wiki is some sort of holy goal for webcomics to achieve is just plain idiotic. What ego! We're not important enough to decide what should go on the Wiki but YOU are. If you're serious about Webcomics on Wikipedia then get some real standards and stop playing childish "I'm king of the hill" type games with it. At any rate, I deleted the page myself and I will continue to do so until its gone for good. Play your stupid ass games with some other comic.Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>If everyone here ignored the Alexa data used in the nomination, it'd still get deleted, it's here as circumstantial evidence, take it or leave it, some might find it helpful. I don't read <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> either, and don't plan to nominate it. A Wikipedia page is NOT the holy grail for webcomics, it is at the top of the checklist, not some impossible goal. We do have real standards, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory. Yeah, editing an encyclopedia using an internet pseudonym is all ego. I'd like others to get rid of and nominate webcomics too, but no one ever does this. I nominate them in bursts, and in between every one, the list has grown and the signal to noise ratio fallen. If you didn't care so much about your Wikipedia page, you wouldn't have bothered with your petty inter protest on it, telling everyone how much you don't care and how alternative you are. Save it for Petition Online. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:08, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>My problem isn't that its up for deletion. I don't care. DELETE if it isn't wanted. Just don't act like it was hubris on MY part for it being up in the first place. Also, your nominations of comics seem by and large rather arbitrary. Need I remind you the thrashing the webcomic community gave you when you nominated Checkerboard Nightmare for deletion? I also made no mention of how "alternative" I am or think I am. But I digress. I guess you and webcomics in regards notability are like Congress and porn eh? You know nothing about them but you know it when you see it. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>No you didn't claim how alternative you were, maybe you should? I never claimed it was hubris or vanity on your part. I wasn't even involved in the CxN nomination. Well, the list of webcomics is so incredulously large, it has been claimed that I was just "shooting fish in a barrel", this time I just picked 4 random unnotable webcomics beginning with the letter A. Arbitrary grouping? Maybe, but they're pretty accurate nominations. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:21, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Heres the thing: If you're picking them AT RANDOM then you are being ARBITRARY. End of story. You can't use Alexa and you can't actually make an argument AGAINST most of the comics you nominate. And "not notable" isn't an acceptible argument considering the vast scope of information available on wikipedia. Admit it. You're just a troll who found his niche and anyone be damned who tries to fight him on it. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>You're being incredibly petty and quite bitter here, its a wikipedia article. I can actually make up very good arguments against the comics that I nominate, hence their ensuing deletion. I'm not being arbitrary, I'm not going to go nominate Megatokyo or Penny Arcade, nor would I want to really. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, you'll see that Wikipedia isn't a web directory.

<ul>
<li>And yet you actually never do. Its always "ALEXA! NOT WEB DIRECTORY!!! BLARGH!! STOPA PICKING ON ME!!111" If you had a leg to stand on people wouldn't get so mad at you. Championing an un-popular opinion (all the while playing the role of the vigilint watchman) doesn't qualify it, sorry. We're not talking about listing every variation of the "whacky Megaman recolor adventures" here so stop being obtuse. If you can't actually make an argument, just say so. If lack of information is the problem (and thats the ONLY wiki rule web comics entries seem to be in violation of) then contact the people who run the comic and ask them if they want to expand it, or delete it. I don't see how you can claim to be acting in the best interest of this catagory when you're not willing to work with the people who actually MAKE the stuff being catagorized. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>If by people you mean some easily incensed webcomic fans, you'd be correct. It's to do with the harsh way I put my nominations across, I'm not the only one to nominate webcomic articles, Abe Dashiell does it a lot too, but he's a nice guy about it. I've probably never come out with the "stop picking on me" line, being that my arguments are generally a lot better than whoever wants to pick on me, and that I care just a little bit less. I'm sure my actions don't qualify with you, but remember, I do care just that little bit less. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>(after edit conflict)</i> - I see you've altered your comment to include some "whacky megaman recolor adventures" in. So they're not notable are they, is yours? You never mentioned it. The point you make about rational arguments? Try it out yourself. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Webcomics and furries, probably the 2 most over represented topics on Wikipedia. If this webcomic involved startrek fandom, then we'd probably have it all.

Well you don't have to imagine, since the webcomics launch in late 2004 and with 50 strips under their belt, their webcounter shows 6000 hits!

<li><b>Weak Delete.</b> Although this actual term is specific to one bus company, the concept is becoming more popular with bus companies globally. To answer Xrblsnggt's point, the issue is that these buses _don't_ have to run to a tight schedule. Let's say you expect 120 passengers an hour on a particular route. You can either run a bus that can carry 60 passengers every 30 mins - which means that it has to keep to the schedule accurately, the passengers have to know what that schedule is, and, if they miss the bus they intended to catch, they have a 29-minute wait ahead of them; or, you follow this concept, run a bus that can carry 20 passengers every 10 minutes, so that the passengers don't need to know exactly when the buses run - they just Turn Up at the bus-stop, knowing they'll have a maximum wait of 9 mins, so they can Go at their convenience rather than the convenience of the bus company. Perhaps something about the concept could go into the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_rapid_transit.html" title="Bus rapid transit">Bus rapid transit</a> article? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 10:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>/<b>Strong Merge into <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_physical_constants.html" title="Fundamental physical constants">fundamental physical constants</a></b> This is not made up by an Average Joe, it really was a term/concept coined by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Pohl_416d.html" title="Frederick Pohl">Frederick Pohl</a> in his <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heechee.html" title="Heechee">Heechee</a>/<a href="../../../g/a/t/Gateway_%28novel%29.html" title="Gateway (novel)">Gateway</a> sci-fi saga (the original trilogy is terrific soft sci-fi, and was one of my teenage favourites).

<li>I would give it the title physical coincidence, by parallel with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_coincidence.html" title="Mathematical coincidence">Mathematical coincidence</a>. Pohl's example is the identical apparent sizes of our sun and moon; I have cited the near-equality of the gravitational constant and the age of the universe (in natural units).

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, I'm not a scientist or mathematician on any kind. But based on what I remember of the Pohl's books, Gosh numbers are not just physics/astrophysics coincidences but also values underlying basic laws of the universe which are apparently arbitrary yet also vital to the survival of life as it is. The key plot point in the Heechee saga is this <b>Spoilers ahead</b> - an advanced race of aliens called the Heechee have left their technology behind and have apparently vanished. In fact, they're hiding from an even more advanced race of aliens which have been around since before the Big Bang, and are trying to reverse the Big Bang, so that they can "re-roll the dice" for the gosh numbers which came into existence with the current universe (their lives were based on the old gosh numbers, and the new gosh numbers are apparently unbearable. For a scientific discussion of [gosh numbers in this way - one in a science magazine and not based on my memories, see this <a href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:HNX-O-alCBAJ:www.zinkle.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n1_v15/ai_12699267/pg_2%3Fpi%3Dznk+%22gosh+numbers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" class="external text" title="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:HNX-O-alCBAJ:www.zinkle.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n1_v15/ai_12699267/pg_2%3Fpi%3Dznk+%22gosh+numbers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" rel="nofollow">cached article</a>.

<dd>My latest note emphasizes that the concept is <i>not</i> just about coincidences. And the article link shows it has been used by a noted physicist in a popular science (and scifi) magazine<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

The use in the Pohl story gives as the main example that minus 40 degrees Celsius is the same as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. That has nothing to do with fundamental constants of the universe as claimed in the present article. There are no known examples of unexpected relationships among the fundamental constants, so it is not possible to expand the article with examples. Apart from the fact that the concept of the article is not the one described by Pohl, there is no good reason to single this out among all the ideas described by Pohl in his many novels. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

No doubt this article needs to be improved greatly, but that is the nature of a wiki, not impulsive deletion. I welcome an entry on this game because it is clearly unique and a neutral description of it would be helpful to those interested in what it's about. Let's not waste more energy with debating deletion; let's be constuctive and make changes. Unverifiable content can be removed and a more succinct description could suffice. --BFR 19:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_mathematics_articles_%28A%29_7e39.html" title="List of mathematics articles (A)">list for the letter A</a></b> alone is larger than all the lists I've built combined!!! And then there's the mathematics topic lists and the list of mathematicians (which is 166 kilobytes long!). That food shouldn't be afforded similar treatment doesn't make any sense, especially considering the central role it plays in all of our lives. If the approach is okay to take on the far broader subjects of Mathematics, Philosophy, Biology, etc., then why isn't it appropriate for the narrower subject of food? Your stance doesn't make any sense. Please explain. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 20:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I think is unmaintainable is that there are way too many food-related topics, because one could include list of foods, food agencies, meal types, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_caterpillar_5cd0.html" title="User:Green caterpillar">Green caterpillar</a> 21:05, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you think that is too many articles? And what is unmaintainable about it having that many articles? What difficulty in managing the page does that present? As pointed out above, Math is far larger, and those guys maintain it just fine. What makes you think that this list will not be any easier to maintain than the huge multi-scope list of mathematics articles? The Math articles list contains thousands upon thousands of links. So how can you conclude that the food list will be too large, when it won't be anywhere near the size of Math? --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 22:20, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, someone could distantly relate almost any article to food, and there would be a lot of disagreement on what should be on that list. For example, users might debate whether articles like <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">feces</a> should be on the list. I predict there would be a lot of confusion and edit wars too.</dd>

<dd>However, I am thinking of a solution.

<dd>It's much more clearly defined what a mathematics article is than what a food topic is. A mathematics article is an article that is mainly about math. What is a food topic? Does it include farming related articles? Does it include articles about every plant or amimal you can eat? Does it include every dish that has it's own article? I'm if we start to include all all those it's easy to make a list that is longer than the mathematics list within a few days.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the mathematics list is partially used in the development of better mathematics articles, the food topics list isn't (at the moment). -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 00:24, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also have strong familiarity with the subject the list supports as well, as my edits to the article <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_extension.html" title="Life extension">life extension</a> clearly show. I carefully constructed the list to support this subject, and every item on the list pertains in a direct and important way to the study of life extension (anti-aging) or the life extension movement.

Meanwhile note that based on their user contributions, those who voted to delete the list may not have a strong familiarity with the subject, and that a casual glance at the list by an editor inexperienced with this interdisciplinary field of applied science may not be a good indicator for deletion.

<li><b>commentary continued:</b> The above policy applies to lists as well as to conventional articles. There are some extremely large lists on Wikipedia, and some have grown so large that they have been split up into several pages. This list on life extension topics compares favorably with the indices of books on the subject. Because of this, the list should be kept, and refined over time as we learn through trial and error how to optimize the list's support of the featured subject. I didn't create it to be cruft, and I'm committed to making the list as useful as possible. It is incredibly frustrating to have some stranger who is unfamiliar with the topic come along and kill it with an axe rather than constructively discuss how to improve the list on its talk page. No effort whatsoever was taken to improve the approach, just "Articles for Deletion." Yeah, that's real constructive. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 18:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>With that being said,</b> why don't we discuss how to modify the list so that it optimally supports the theme subject? What has to be done to the list to make it valuable enough to keep? No objections other than potential future size have been presented, so I have no idea where to begin. And since I was closely following the instructions from <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, I'm completely baffled as to why you would want to delete the list. Is there something political going on here? The reason I ask is because here is what the guideline article has to say about creating a list:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lists on Wikipedia have three main purposes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Information</dt>
<dd>The list may be a valuable information source. This is particularly the case for a structured list. Examples would include lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists.</dd>
<dt>Navigation</dt>
<dd>If the user is browsing without a specific research goal in mind, they would likely use the <b>See also</b> lists. If the user has a specific research goal in mind, and there is only one or two words that are used to describe the research topic, and they know exactly how to spell the word, they would probably use the search engine box. If the user has some general idea of what they are looking for but does not know the specific terminology, they would tend to use the <b>lists of related topics</b> (also called <b>list of links to related articles</b>).</dd>
<dt>Development</dt>
<dd>Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The <b>lists of related topics</b> give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written.</dd>
</dl>
Like categories, lists can be used for keeping track of changes in the listed pages, using the Related Changes feature. Unlike a category, a list also allows detection of deletion of pages from it, and, more generally, a history of its contents is available.<br clear="all" /></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>As you can see</b>, I've created this list of related topics as a navigation tool, and to be a survey of the subject area (hence its informational value), and also as a tool to indicate the state of the 'pedia in that subject area (notice its redlinks). It also serves well for monitoring this subject just as mentioned in the guideline. I've done everything by the book, yet here we are. I respectfully request that you reverse your positions and give this (and the other lists I have created a chance to prove themselves useful). Please give this matter some thought. Thank you. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 18:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First of all, the number of redlinks is minimal, they're basically in the "Theories of aging" sublist. Second of all, a list has to have some added value above just navigation, because that alone is perfectly doable with the help of categories. The added value usually comes from either a maintainance perspective or a navigation perspective. Given the nature of this list I would say it was created with the second perspective in mind. However, to be useful from that perspective requires the subject list to be narrowly defined, very long list are not useful in this case, and that is simply not the case here. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 01:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>The redlinks are minimal only because you nominated deletion before more could be added.

<li>In whatever way you look at it, the number of red-links will always be dwarfed by the temendously huge number of existing articles that should be on the list given its underspecified topic. -- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 06:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>that does not diminish the list's usefulness pertaining to redlinks. And the topic is not underspecified.

<li>I am not arguing that (and incidentally, am on your side. I tire of seeing AfD's that want to delete one arbitrary article out of a huge precedent-setting group of similar articles). I said that because, if this were turned into a category, then you'd have someone doing a Category for Deletion because the category was "original research" or such—in the view that categories are purely categorical (ie. member "x" of category "Life Extension" implies that "x" extends life), and are not mechanisms for grouping items about a topic. In CfD's I've participated in, the above view seems to lead to someone saying "it should be a list". So you have made a list, and now someone wants to delete <i>that</i>. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr">Outriggr</a> 23:34, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I was sympathetic to the view that it could be a category (and I do think that there <b>should</b> be a life-extension category), but the list is too broad for that or any category and yet is useful as a tool for those interested in finding relevant subjects (as I am).

<dd>Jessamyn is noted in the library world primarily as a blogger, and also as an ALA Councilor (she just finished her three year term). I am in the library world, and I have never heard of Michael Lorenzen. If you want to use a Google test, I think you will find there is no comparison between Jessamyn West and Michael Lorenzen on that basis. (You might check my results as well - "rory litwin" - and you will see the kind of results a non-notable can get in the library world.) Michael Lorenzen is one of thousands in the library world in terms of notability. Lots of people write articles. If you look at Jessamyn's articles for deletion discussion, you'll see that it was close, and a deciding fact seems to have been that she was selected as one of a dozen or so bloggers invited to attend the 2004 Democratic National Convention as bloggers in the press corps. So, it seems to me that Jessamyn survived the articles for deletion vote mainly because of her notability as a blogger. She was one of the earliest bloggeres and is very well known in the profession for that. There aren't any other Wikipedia articles on contemporary librarians who are as non-notable as Lorenzen; his article is really an exception, in my opinion. The others are either actual professors, ALA past-presidents, historical figures, etc. <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 13:22, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I don't think 64 hits in Google Scholar meets the professor test. Compare professor <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathleen_McCook_a337.html" title="Kathleen McCook">Kathleen McCook</a>, who I think is notable in the library world. (kathleen mccook library gets 292 hits in google scholar.) <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 13:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, most of Lorenzen's articles were published in state and local publications, not national publications. He is probably very well known locally and somewhat known nationally, but notability requires a little more in an encyclopedia, IMO. <a href="../../../r/l/i/User%7ERlitwin_4943.html" title="User:Rlitwin">Rlitwin</a> 14:06, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is it neccesary to remove an article that largely mirrors a feature of collectible car magazines, a section that discusses what models and toys have been made of a car? On what basis does this article deserve deletion? Who has it offended? Why is the information contained, namely fairly specific and cited information deemed of no consequence? Is this not merely an act of malicious hostility against an editor??<br />
I haved scanned <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and I can find no statements supporting your assertion. You may well not want to import eBay, but that policy is not reflected in the text. Is there some other place where you can cite a prohibition on a page which associates real cars with their reproductions? It DOES say that wikipedia is not to be a battleground, which you and othters appear to be trying to make it be. The list is verifiable, it is NPOV, and cited. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 07:07, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Speaking for myself, I see no "malicious hostility" by <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> against anyone. Point of fact, he raises the issue of notability, which is per WP policy and not addressed by the above comments. I note that <a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> is in fact <a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">User:Wiarthurhu</a>, the originator of the article in question, a point not obvious from the way the sig is designed. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 08:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - just a quick point, while I'm neither supporting or opposing this vote, you state that notability is "per WP policy". <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">It isn't</a>. I'm not saying that AfD's shouldn't be judged by that criterion, but it's a common mistake to assume that lack of perceived notability is actually a WP policy (the only mention of notability/importance in official policy is the CSD which states that if an article doesn't <i>assert</i> its importance, it's a candidate). <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 13:05, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> If this was an absolutely stellar, complete and insightful description of the phenomenon, it would be OK with me - after all, there are many minor TV show characters or even pokemons (!) who have their WP entries, and they are really good and I'd say add to WP's unique breadth. But this is a rather poor attempt. I would advise the user to try to develop it in the namespace and later get some impartial users to review it before moving to Wikipediaspace.

<li><b>Keep the article</b> There is a big article on <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> that focuses on a very narrow audience, promotes one company, one product, and there are tons of eBay Barbie items. Using the same logic that is voced by those that want to delete this page, then the Barbie articles, as well as all other toy collectible pages, should also be eliminated. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is a guideline -- not policy. The only requirement is a Google search test.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - yeah, VERY narrow audience indeed... Barbie continues to have a huge influence on contemporary lifestyles in a large part of the world, is not only a huge brand and perhaps the best-selling toy ever, but also a very important icon of popular culture of the last few decades. I'd say if we were to bury a time capsule for post-WWII times, Barbie would be one of the first items that should go in. Quite the contrary to a collection of miniature cars from various manufacturers that don't even have too much in common. And please do not pretend to be more than one person, this can lead to <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>.

<li>I was going to add some more content to this article, but then I found this page. I did not know that the requirements included <b>absolutely stellar, complete and insightful description</b> of the subjects. I am new to this, but from what I have seen so far that hurdle would eliminate most of the entries in the WP. Categorizing toy cars by their original auto manufactures is very useful. I know many hobbyists that build their collections in that way. They do not want everything from a particular source, but by the type of make and even model that holds their interest. For example, topical areas are common in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamp_collecting.html" title="Stamp collecting">stamp collecting</a>. Moreover, it looks some people hold Barbies very dear and a <b>huge</b> influence in their lives. I guess that <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weepul.html" title="Weepul">Weepuls</a> and most of the other objects listed in the toy category not only have stellar and insightful articles, but they also are more notable in our culture than part of the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_car.html" title="Toy car">toy car</a> hobby.

<dd>Technically speaking, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, "The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it." That said, frankly, if we were to hold every Wikipedia article to the rigorous standard of requiring every fact to be cited, we would be lucky to have .1% of the articles that we have now. The policy is good, but it's certainly not a "non-negotiable policy," as Nooorii refers to it. (Also, I just find it ironic that Nooorii refuses to deviate an inch from the verifiability policy but does not even come close to following the traditional AfD process.) <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 08:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right so I have commented it out right now even though this is as of right now an unverified and overglorified dictionary definition. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENooorii_688d.html" title="User:Nooorii">Nooorii</a> 08:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> I'm beginning to lean more and more to thinking that this is a bad-faith nom. Nooorii - Bwithh added two links to Google Books in the AfD debate, and even a cursory inspection of the results should confirm that this is in fact a notable term. Did you simply not see Bwithh's post, or do you continue to insist that this is an "unverified and overglorified dictionary definition"? <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 08:47, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, agree the term and concept are important and widespread, the most convincing delete argument for me is that this is more a definition than an encyclopedic entry, but I think the article barely makes it over the line into more than a definition, and more importantly provides the scaffold for further encyclopedic additions.

<p>As an historian at Oswego State University (New York) I can assure you that the FBI actively investigates the Deutsche-Italiano Alliance. No connection has ever been made to these people to suggest that the crime organization does exist, but remember, J. Edgar Hoover denied the existence of organized crime in America for over 50 years. Check the U.S. Census records, these people exist. Don't forget that Al Capone was never proven to be a gangster, but we don't delete his page do we? User: Jgarrison</p>

I can't speak for the FBI, but I'm finding zilch on the "Deutsche-Italiano Alliance", or Frank L. Baker, or Arthur L. Baker, et al. I note the only external link goes nowhere, and a search for the alleged "Washington County War" only turns up the Old West story about Billy the Kid. Sure, the people probably exist - with a name like Baker? Good thing the gang isn't named "Smith"... - <strike>but the sweeping generalizations and lack of citations speaks hoax, or even an attack page</strike>. And yeah, Al Capone was never "proven" to be a mobster, but there are lots of newspaper articles and bios identifying him as such. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:45, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> A search of the FBI website turns up 66 references to the Mafia, 17 for "Al Capone", two for "al Queda" (keeping in mind the myriad possible transliterations into the english alphabet), and zero for "Baker Crime Family", "Arthur L. Baker", "Frank M. Baker" or "Deutsche-Italiano Alliance" et al. I get a couple of hits for "Arthur Baker", he's an FBI Special Agent. I would not expect the FBI to publicly discuss ongoing cases, as one possible explanation for the names not appearing on their website. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 15:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I live in Adirondack Park, New York, about 45 minutes away from Granville. I don't know anyone personally from this area, but I can say this much, these people do exist. When you live this close you hear some of the stories of the acts of violence that these people have committed. It would be an atrocity if you delete this article, for the accusations stated therein are true, as true as many of the Bigfoot or Champ stories are.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - The latest edit to the article adds a new name, Klaus Speer. This person appears to be an actual crime figure in Germany, but the citation itself fails to verify any connection to United States. The material on Speer in this article is also copyvio from the cited weblink <a href="http://www.organized-crime.de/Speercv.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.organized-crime.de/Speercv.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There are two sentences added, one which states a link to U.S. organized crime (no verification again), and a second which alleges Speer was the inspiration for a movie character (no citation given). Lastly, I rechecked for a "Michael Darius" in the NYPD, and found 27 Ghits, all for a character by the same name and occupation, from the novel "A Mourning in Autumn" by Harker Moore. Google turns up nothing, still, for "Michael C. Darius", beyond this article. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 07:08, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To the User Tychocat, I'm not sure if you think you can outsmart everyone, but I have read this article. If you search for a person in the NYPD, you are searching in the New York City Police Department, not New York State. I believe that you are aware of this, but were bothered after you had found out that the author has a degree which says that he knows more about history than a lot of other people. I never read that book, I'll bet that you did. However, if Michael Darius' occupation was as a New York City Police Detective, then he really doesn't have the same occupation as the man alledged in the article, does he? If you want this article to go away, I suggest you stop trying to outsmart a Ph. D. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Freed_4765.html" title="User:Mike Freed">User: Mike Freed</a></p>
<p><b>Comment</b> - The new material just added by yourself nominally lists citations, but as a scholar you ought to know the proper format for a book citation is to list the entire title, author, year of publication, and publisher, which would allow for proper verification. Just listing the last name of the author and the year of publication as you have done, doesn't lend itself to any fact-checking, which you should also know. I've also done some checks in Google Scholar, and cannot find Beuys (1967), Kollmar (1974), Busch (1992), Boettcher (1975), Steinke (1982), or Mätzler (1968). Fatigue set in before I could complete a search for all of the citations. But, no one by the name of Boettcher had any scholarly publication regarding crime listed in Google Scholar in 1975, likewise last name of Steinke in 1982, or Mätzler in 1968. I welcome a check of my findings so far by any experienced editor, and if I'm wrong I will cheerfully change my nominations. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. The term is notable, and appears in scholary discussions, e.g. in <i>Kathleen Blee: "Inside Organized Racism: Women in the Hate Movement"</i>, in <i>Colin Flint (ed.): "Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A"</i>, in <i>William Pfaff: "The Wrath of Nations: Civilization and the Fury of Nationalism"</i>, it's a topic in the <i>HON 302A Contemporary Fundamentalism</i> seminar of SUNY Plattsburgh, and in <i>Richard M. Dorson, "The Eclipse of Solar Mythology", Journal of American Folklore Vol. 68, No. 27 (1955)</i>. The article in question does not do a very good job of discussing the topic, though, but gives a one-line definiton with some mentioning of the <i>Pan-Aryan National Front</i> web site, which does get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=vps&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22pan-aryan+national+front%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=vps&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22pan-aryan+national+front%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">365 Google hits</a>.

Nobody voted keep. There is actually not much <i>to</i> merge, since this article lacks any citations from reliable sources. The article seems to exist primarily as part of the YTMNDers' Googlebombing campaign, as a consequence of which the site has had to be blacklisted due to repetaed spamming. In the context of a global analysis of criticism of scientology, I'd say this is of striclty limited significance; it does not appear to be by any credible or respected critic of Scientology (of which there appear to be several) and does not appear to bring to light any novel arguments, analysis or cases. Essentially it's just a single presentation of the usual knocking copy about Scientology (admittedly a soft target and well worth knocking). No evidence is presented of notability beyond the YTMND community. The copyright status of the sounds and images is, as usual with YTMND, somewhere between unclear and questionable. I would say we should simply delete and redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_McPherson_0813.html" title="Lisa McPherson">Lisa McPherson</a>, since that is the bulk of the content. Incidentally, this is actually one of the better YTMNDs, it even has references, it's just not provably significant outside that community. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:43, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP and Stop the Madness</b> This page MUST stay here this time. Spare me your "vanity listing" horsesh*t. I am not related to Warren Kinsella at all. I am just a journalist, radio show host and punk rock enthusiast since many years ago and The Hot Nasties SURE ARE one of Canada's great punk rock act. They do have a 7" and it's called "The Invasion of the Tribbles" and it sells for about 200 $ on eBay most of the times since it's very rare. It's been put on Frank Manley's "Smash The State" Canadian Punk Anthology LP and 7". There were NOT an "unknown high school band" like Arthur Ellis, whoever he might be, says. Like the Fits, Genetic Control, the Dishrags, they were one of those who defined Canada's punk rock sound. So, Mark Bourrie, please STOP asking for deletion just because of a little conflict you have with Mr Kinsella. I know punk rock way more than you do and my record collection is bigger than yours. You destroyed my work once, I sure won't let you do it twice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.226.160.237 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.226.160.237.html" title="User talk:24.226.160.237">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.226.160.237_e08f.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.226.160.237">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>Not bad faith nomination. Is every ex-political aide going to have a Wikipedia page for a high school band? The "punk rock scene" in Calgary, Canada, isn't notable. This band put out one self-issued EP twenty five years ago and none of the band members went on in music. The band is mentioned in a book: an autobiography of one member, who is notable for being an aide to a Canadian politician 15 years ago, before the guy became Prime Minister.<br />
Summary: no air play; no major performaces; one self-published album; fringe band of high school kids. "Canadian Punk Band" says it all. CRzRussian may say this is personal, but all I'm asking people to do ius look at the entry, see if it's wiki material, and put their opinion here. Leave personality out of it. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Ellis_81bb.html" title="User:Arthur Ellis">Arthur Ellis</a> 13:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Will somebody ever shut-up that jerk Arthur Ellis/Mark Bourrie&#160;? The Hot Nasties WERE influential. When author Frank Manley, who wrote “Smash The State&#160;: A Discography of Canadian Punk, 1977-92”, decided to release a 7” with influential punk songs, the Hot Nasties is one of the bands he picked among HUNDREDS, along with the Fits, Arson and the Rock and Roll Bitches. The Calgary punk rock scene wasn’t notable? Well, the Golden Calgarians, the Sturgeons, Riot 303, Color Me Psycho, Eye on You, Enemy Mind Feel, Beyond Possession, Forbidden Dimension, Silicone Injection and Verdix ALL hailed from Calgary. And the fact that the band has one self-released EP and was a “fringe band of high school kids” is a reason for deletion? Well, then 75% of all punk rock bands must be deleted cause that’s what punk rock was about: young folks playing loud and obnoxious music so no label wanted to sign them, so they had to do it themselves and self release their albums. That’s what D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) is all about and it’s an important part of punk rock. None of the band members went on in music? UNTRUE. Alan McDonald played in the Sturgeons. No Air Play? Do you know ANY early punk bands who got Airplay? That IS the reason why punk bands SELF RELEASED their albums. Mentionned in ONE BOOK? NO, it is AT LEAST mentionned in two books, i.e. the Frank Manley book I stated before. Again, this guy Arthur Ellis doesn’t know a thing about punk rock so his opinion on that subject shouldn’t matter. He just wants to cause trouble about everything linked with Warren Kinsella. See the Warren Kinsella listing and how it was locked only because of user Arthur Ellis’ manoeuvers. This IS wiki material and PLEASE stop giving some importance to that guy Arthur Ellis on all topics related to Mr Kinsella. 205.237.53.91 18:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 205.237.53.91 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.237.53.91.html" title="User talk:205.237.53.91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.237.53.91_3345.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.237.53.91">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Please check the contributions of the IPs before deciding. You will find Ian King misrepresents them. This is a band that existed 25 years ago in a small market in rural Canada. It never left te market to tour. It self-produced one EP. None of its supporters have been able to show it had any shows in any venue at all. None of the band members made a significant contribution to any aspect of the music industry afterwards. One song has been re-recorded by another Canadian "punk" band, which issued the recording on its own label and has not been shown to have any following outside the very, very narrow niche of Canadian retro-punk rock. When this page was offered up for speedy deletion earlier this month, there was not one single comment, and it was actually deleted. Now Warren Kinsella has managed to muster up a few friends, along with the page-writer and his socks.<br />

<p>Nominating all these articles - although they all seem to have a decent amount of content, it's mostly bloated and isn't very meaningful. The articles in question are about <b>non-notable</b> characters in the manga and anime series <i><a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach</a></i>. Wanderweiss and Luppi (Bleach) aren't even properly named according to the naming conventions. These characters are non-notable because they basically appear for a handful of chapters (or pages, in D-Roy's case), and die. They have few (if any) distinct personality traits, and exist mainly for the sake of fighting the series' protagonists. Although I have personally improved D-Roy, Edorad Leones, Ilforte Grantz and Shawlong Qufand (see edit histories), I now feel that the effort was not needed and that these articles have no place on Wikipedia.

<dd><b>If merge, merge by categories</b> I do admit some characters has too little backstory and information that they may not really require a separate article, but even if this article is to be merged, merge it into something like the "Hollow" article, since the Espada are hollows anyway. Of course, such merging may provoke cries of image removals, but on the other hand, keeping the images may cause the article to grow too big. That is all I'll say. 155.69.5.236Wakipudeo155.69.5.236</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think they don't have enough backstory and unique information to stand alone, but I don't think they should be merged into already large articles like the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_8f0f.html" title="Characters in Bleach">Characters in Bleach</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Hollow (Bleach)</a>.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Lists of Bleach Characters by Race might be the most sensible option if we were to divide them, since the current system within the Bleach Character article is by location of residence, which doesn't make much sense imo. However, I'm not sure that image removal is really a concern here. If one of those characters were to be in a flashback, or have survived somehow, or otherwise gain notability within the series, then I don't think there's really a shortage of scanned manga pages with the text shopped out, and they could be easily replaced. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think none of these articles should be deleted, especially Wanderweiss, as its very likely he'll become more important later on. He's probably an Espada and is still alive and likely will remain so due to his lack of fighting in the current assault. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.127.50.229 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.127.50.229_43e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.127.50.229">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Anyone going to the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanderweiss.html" title="Wanderweiss">Wanderweiss</a> page is almost certainly going to be a reader of the manga. It would be of no interest otherwise. So, ideally, the page should be made <i>useful</i> with <i>the manga's audience</i> in mind. Here is a list of important information on Wanderweiss' page which the average reader might not know off-hand:
<ul>
<li>He was human-sized as a hollow, prior to becoming arrancar. This suggests that he was a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html#Menos" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Vasto Lorde</a>. This would make him freakishly powerful, and certainly more significant than D-Roy could have hoped to be.</li>
<li>And, um...</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Merging the article and turning the page into a redirect does not prevent the page's recreation if and when (probably when) we know and care enough about him to warrent it. What we are trying to do is set a precidence. Specifically: If a pages is filled with nothing but useless information, <i>even for the relatively few readers who actually care</i>, then the page should not exist. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.

Take the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html" title="Hollow (Bleach)">Hollow (Bleach)</a> page for example. Creating a new page for each individual type of hollow would be pointless and actually hurt the core article. – <i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 21:37, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I'm the one rewriting the <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgefest.html" title="Edgefest">Edgefest</a> article, and it's going to be completely different than its current incarnation (including the 2006 listing being removed).

<dd><b>Comment</b> The point is that large amounts of indiscriminate information unbalances the encyclopaedia and is not its role. Such lengthy lisitngs are fine on an Edgefest website but not here.

<p><b>Delete</b> 1: According to the talk page, this is copyright text for which only conditional permission has been given for use. 2: sources are not given for most of it - it'd be better to clear the article and start afresh with sourced examples. I don't think that this is in principle a bad subject for Wikipedia, though categories might well be better, and the name of the page is certainly bizarre (though this may be a cultural idiom). <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudomonas_e71a.html" title="User:Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a> 13:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. If a category is created to replace it (which I personally don't think is necessary), it'll need to have a more descriptive title; I don't want to get into the politics of the issue and suggest it includes words like "rape" or "victim", but something more than mere "survivor" is necessary. "Abuse survivors", perhaps? <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 14:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it were my decision, I'd have a number of subcategories, since lumping disparate groups together is probably not helpful. In general I think that the term "surviving" is most usefully used of something that would normally be fatal - which some of these may well be, but others may not. I suspect this may be a US idiom, though, as I say. <a href="../../../p/s/e/User%7EPseudomonas_e71a.html" title="User:Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a> 14:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was reluctant to say this earlier, but I'm glad to see that I'm not alone in considering the modern euphemism of "survivor" for "victim" to be taking entirely the wrong direction.

<li><b>Delete</b> for bizarre vagueness.

<p>Was tagged for CSD-A7, but the article is long, researched well and the editor is committed, so probably deserves more than a snap judgment. <i>However</i> - the article also doesn't appear to be asserting notability; it appears to be a bit <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ball</a>-gazing; it also, from the talk page where the author is detailing his edits, appears to be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I'd like community input on this one, please.<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 14:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will leave this up to you to decide, I would just like to point out that <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Realms_Entertainment_ae4d.html" title="Iron Realms Entertainment">Iron Realms Entertainment</a> has had a stub for 2 years now, while ours was quickly promoted out of that status. As for the crystal ball gazing, the editor Crashaddict spoke with Ryan(CEO) and myself(CTO) about many things to make sure they were accurate. Most of his other information came from our official forums, wiki, and blog and thus is accurate and things that we have already completed. The company has been around since 2003, and Ilyrias will be released at the start of 2007. Our official forums have almost 7k posts and received over 1.3k unique visitors last month, in our genre that is more than most games have in players. I hope that gives you enough information about the two things you were concerned about. PR Baram 15:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I find this article quite useful and it has attracted quite a bit of players to join up on PR. It would be a shame to delete it, when some supporters of Persistent Realms work so hard to keep it up to date. Just being a player. 205.214.210.31 16:12, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As PR is very open in its development and tries to include the community’s ideas and wishes for the upcoming game, I find this article very useful for people that would like to know more about the company and how it came to be. 193.154.218.24 17:48, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Any article here deleted regarding PR will have to be recreated, as I can predict that after Ilyrias opens, it will become one of the largest MUDs on the internet. Given the company's dedication to its players, and all of the recent updates to the game, I'm awaiting the day when the game opens, having none nothing about it one month ago. 216.166.206.18 17:54, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The issue, I think, is that it would make more sense to merge the MUD article with this one rather than vice versa, but that both articles contain enough distinct and unique (but still useful) information to warrant separate articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> Both articles should be kept distinct, as, although the mud is part of the company, the company is not simply the mud.

<p>Reading some of the things for notablility I have done the Google and Alexa tests. Unless I did them wrong, a search for Persistent Realms returns 667k hits on Google and 83,759 hits on Alexa. PR Baram 13:02, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Putting "Persistent Realms" in quotes weeds out all the unrelated pages on other MMO topics. You get 1,300 on google that way, and it looks like the majority of those are various links to your own website (the forums specifically.) Alexa ranking (not search hits) is 5,227,388. Anything above 100,000 is so sparesly linked that the rankings aren't even reliable. <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 13:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>This is a promotional page for a non-notable product. The rankings on TMS are meaningless (indeed, PR Baram has stated on the forums that just a few people voting every day are all it took to get them there), and nobody that I'm aware of pays any attention to them as rankings of anything but how much traffic you're exchanging with TMS. Persistent Realms is a company with no released products and an unreleased product with no buzz that doesn't come directly from the company itself. OneThousandYears 19:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Miss quoting at it's best. On the TMS forums I said it only required a couple people to start voting, which brings in more interested people. In 5 months time we went from unknown to being brought up in conversations on TMC and TMS, a large chunk of IRE's Lusternia are active members on the forums, discussions about us brought up on most of IRE's forums as well. 245 active forum members, most of which visit the forums multiple times a day, nearly 7k forum posts in that time. Then there's the perspective player made wiki for us, discussions on other peoples blogs, player made IRC chat room(which is used all the time), and was even offered the IRE online radio station(player made and run) to be given to us instead of IRE. Far from unknown. PR Baram 04:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> to delete, with the strong caveat that this should NOT be pointed to as a precedent for any other such nominations. I find a couple of problems with this discussion which seem to create a situation which may or may not reflect actual consensus: (1) incivility (very severe in some cases) on the part of some "keep" voters; (2) internal spamming by <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a>; (3) the large number of articles here and large number of corresponding proposed remedies.

So our discussion ought only to be limited to the first 2. Also it must be noted that by grouping all the articles in one AfD, the decision is expected to keep or delete them all, not pick out specific weak articles (ie Surfing (Counter-Strike)) and delete only those. Those advocating the keep position do not necessarily approve of all articles, but since forced with the option of keeping all or deleting all, we see at least one good article in the list we want to keep, and therefore have to keep all unless the nominator decides to relist all individually.</dd>

In the game Counter-Strike there simply is no "right" way to play a map, there is no "walkthrough", no "how-to" beat a map because either team can do an infinite number of things to which their opponents have to adjust. What the article has is (A) a description of the map, (B) an overhead view of the map, (C) some screenshots, (D) professional criticism against the map being balanced for both sides, (E) listing of some trivia regarding the map, including the translation of an opera song that can be heard in one section. Which of those 5 counts as a "strategy guide"? If I were to describe the Roman Coliseum, wouldn't the article have the same aspects? (description, blueprint, pictures, archictectual criticism, trivia) Since the nominator concedes that these maps are notable (as the Coliseum is notable) then there is no reason to object to the format.</dd>

<dd>Regarding cruft, we opposed to deletion respond that cruft is a highly subjective term, and that since notability was conceded these articles cannot be cruft. On the first, we can be sure that one man's featured article is another man's cruft. I could just as easily consider the Roman Coliseum cruft since I am an American with no interest in classical architecture or string theory as cruft because I don't know what 12-dimension space time means, but there are even more obvious targets on wikipedia (ie <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire_5989.html" title="Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire">Simpsons_Roasting_on_an_Open_Fire</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_problems_solved_by_MacGyver_8ef1.html" title="List of problems solved by MacGyver">List_of_problems_solved_by_MacGyver</a>, etc) that stay here. Secondly, the <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">cruft guide</a> that the nominator linked defines it as "selection of content is of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans of the subject in question." Since the nominator already conceded notability, therefore we don't have a "small population" and therefore this isn't cruft by that definition. The guide also states that "there is no firm policy on the inclusion of obscure branches of popular culture subjects. It is true that things labeled fancruft are often deleted from Wikipedia. This is primarily due to the fact that things labeled as fancruft are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral - all things that lead to deletion." So cruft cannot even be considered as a reason for deletion... it only sometimes leads to deletion under another policy. As for "poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and non-neutral", this must be judged on each article individually.</dd>

<li>The "keeping will do no harm" argument is tempting for <i>every</i> AfD, but keeping non-encyclopedic information is not wikipedia's mission. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> lists a number of categories of "indiscriminate information" which wikipedia does not collect, including video game guides. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:03, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I heavily dislike people painting AFDs with broad strokes like that. It was closed as no consensus <b>because there was no consensus</b>. I see just as many substantive votes to keep from valid and even long-time contributors as there are for deletion. I also strongly dislike broad statements like <i>A map of a level is game guide material. There is nothing that can be extraced from these of any /encyclopaedic/ value.</i>. The same can be said for say, a plot summary of Hamlet. Another argument is that <i>this is only of interest to a small group of people</i>, well that is true. I don't think anyone just beginning to start playing CS would come here for info on the maps, and anyone that has played the maps once doesn't need our articles. Would someone that has never heard of CS use/need/want these articles? Probably not. However, the same arguments can be made for obscure mathematical and scientific articles. Have you ever heard someone say <i>mathcruft</i>? Thus, this argument boils down to 'I don't like it', which is obviously subjective and pointless. You could go on with <i>well you wouldn't find this in Britannica!</i>, but that is an idiotic argument--why should we limit ourselves to what previous encyclopedias did? Another argument made is that they are unreferenced or original research. In some cases, this is true. However, this is not really a reason for deletion. We delete things that are unverifiable, not unverified.</li>

Kotepho has a valid point that the delete voters are hiding behind one word "cruft," which really amounts to "I don't play the game and would never read these articles." I don't watch the Simpsons, yet there is a synopsis of each episode on Wikipedia. I don't bother to learn string theory, but I found a lot of articles relating to the topic. If you're going to use the word cruft as your reasoning, you better define it much more rigidly than how it's being tossed about. I (and others) have put a considerable amount of work into most of these articles, making maps and finding content. The computer gaming center in my town uses these pages frequently when trying to gather info about the maps and select the right ones for their tournaments. That's notable enough to keep. There is no reason to delete pages that people visit frequently. Deletion policy is for screwball topics that no one will visit except the article's author. Moreover, we've already had 2 votes on this issue in as many months. There is no reason to keep bringing this up over and over until the vote goes your way... articles surviving a deletion vote should be immune from further attempts. And strike all votes that use "per nom" or "cruft" as their reasoning. Have to do better than that, since there is already a lot of cruft that is staying on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 20:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nominator clearly indicated the rationale that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a strategy guide</a>, which is a specific bullet point under <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>. This seems quite clear to me, and I'm not sure why you, Kotepho and others don't see it as a "valid" reason -- it's clearly laid out at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I changed my "cruft" vote (which was, for me, simply a shorthand for "indiscriminate") to reflect that more clearly, but I think the sentiment of most voters is clear enough.

<li>To be honest, the fact that they are maps rather than walkthroughs makes them <i>less</i> valuable and encyclopedic in my opinion: that is, they do not even rise to the level of a strategy guide. As an analogy, probably a quarter-million cars use the roadway my desk overlooks, and yet detailed maps of it would not be suitable for wikipedia -- although wikipedia contains a fine general description. Detailed content like maps of CS or detailed roadway information belongs in a separate wiki, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not</a> in wikipedia.

<li>That is an interesting argument, and I'm inclined to agree. Two things, though. (1) Some of us are intimately interested in the CS map content and have been striving to make quality articles. If there were people similarly interested in the major street outside your office, who added pictures, descriptions, comments on its uniqueness, and a history of the road, that is probably bona fide wikipedia material. (2) Now David Bergan in Sioux Falls, SD isn't likely to stumble upon that street article... but you would have to agree that if you did it up right it would notable to a significant number of people (ie everyone who drives it). And if David came along on a mission to delete street-cruft, you would probably feel resentful because of the 10+ hours you put into the article just to have some hick in the Midwest insult your work by calling it cruft and try to bring it to an irretrievable delete. You knew the subject was notable when you started the article (because of the plethora of drivers), but feel upset because a group of people who don't drive that road are telling you your project sucks. And you know that the article gets a fair amount of hits because your fellow businessmen discuss it with you (as the computer gaming center in my town discuss the CS map articles with me). &#160;::::*Today, as is, I still have to vote to keep. As sane as your argument seems, the maps are notable (played a lot) and the content doesn't violate the WP guidelines. There still is no valid reason to delete.

<li><b>Strong Delete all</b> per nom, because WP is not a gaming guide, because blanketing everyone who expresses opinions against this as a person with a vendetta is specious, because saying to keep because you like it is just as invalid as saying delete because you dislike it, because saying "all or nothing" and then citing a prior AfD is about as good an idea as citing a prior AfD and saying "we've been through this before so keep because it survived last time," (although in this case I guess "nothing" is acceptable to me), and because attempting to compare these maps to mathematicians or other articles of that nature doesn't actually work, as mathematicians and the like made documented, lasting contribution that somehow furthered society at large. While CS has obviously had its own cultural impact, I welcome anyone to show me how <i>individual maps</i> can claim the same. GassyGuy 21:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There is an article about every episode of Season 5 of 24. Yet we are debating to delete pages that explain _the most played_ maps in computer FPS's. These maps are ones that <b>ALL</b> serious gamers know about/heard of. There is massive ammounts of culture, references, and history behind these maps. They make up the heart of CounterStrike, the most popular first person shooter out there. And you guys want to delete that, yet making a page for _every_ episode of 24 and Simpsons is okay? Just think about what you guys are talking about, this is a ridicoulous arguement, you might as well delete about a 3rd of Wikipedia if you delete these. You have to understand, de_dust is the most recognized computer map of all time. Any serious gamer who sees it can easily say "Counter-Strike". When they reach this kind of popularity, it _IS_ worth keeping. There are articles on wikipedia that are a lot worse and need a lot more attention than this. In no way should these be merged or deleted, it would violate the goal of wikipedia in many ways, because these maps truly do mark a serious spot in computer gaming. --<a href="../../../r/a/k/User%7ERake_0dc0.html" title="User:Rake">Rake</a> 21:52, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - episodes of 24 have plot, story, actors who appeared, and so on. A MAP of a level has no plot, no mythology, no backstory, nothing. It's just a map. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/</i><b>/</b><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:36, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> To the point about the maps above, like I said, each of these maps have their own history, because they were all developed under different circumstances, are are in no way similar (well, save the Dust series). Each one can easily spark a conversation between two gamers (Who has the best advantage, best rushing route, good camping spots, good sniping spots, etc.) No, we are not making a game guide, we are simply explaining the maps that make Counter-Strike, well, counter-strike. You can't just group all of these maps together. While they are all for counterstrike, a battle fought on Dust is extremely different and has a completely different story behind it than a battle fought on Aztec, for example. Individual maps definately DO have their own cultural impact, ask any serious gamer about dust or aztek. Everyone who here is saying that this is becoming a game guide I guess is not a CounterStrike gamer, because if they were, they would know that each of these maps adds their own bit of tactics, ideas, and culture to Counter Strike. --<a href="../../../r/a/k/User%7ERake_0dc0.html" title="User:Rake">Rake</a> 21:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> Since I assume this is a response to me, given the use of the phrase "cultural impact," could you please supply me with a source that details an impact of an <i>individual</i> map had as opposed to the game as a whole? Barring that, I am strengthening my opinion on the basis that almost all of these keep votes are saying "cruft isn't a valid argument" and giving impassioned "I play this game and I love this map, therefore keep it" speeches without addressing any of the other points, e.g., why an individual map is at all important in its own right. I'm sorry, but the fact that it's of interest to a group of gamers means it belongs in a game encyclopaedia, <i>not</i> a general one. Show me why it is of importance to the general population.

<li><b>Delete</b> (Note: though I wouldn't necessarily disagree with a transwiki or merge, I'm not voting that way so as to reduce the chance of this being closed as no consensus.) If we were writing a Counter-Strike strategy guide, this would be vital info. Since we're writing an encyclopedia, though, this is simply unnecessary. Most (all?) video games don't need an article about each individual level, stage, map, or mission. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as per the original AFD. I made my comments clear there, but will reiterate my arguments here. Counter-Strike is the most popular online FPS ever, and is the number one team FPS game at professional <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esports.html" title="Esports">esports</a> tournaments (and has been for some time). I do not endorse the keeping of every single FPS map, but I think that official counter-strike maps are definitely notable, my comment at the previous vote noted that the current server and player counts for each specific map runs into the thousands at every single second of the day. Another comment I'd like to restate is that these maps are not static unlike say the maps in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_3.html" title="Quake 3">Quake 3</a>. Counter-Strike has had a constant changing map roster as part of its iterative development cycle. Maps are retired due to balance/quality/popularity issues, if you want to follow the development history of counter-strike, then looking at the map articles definitely helps and this is what makes them encyclopedic. If you want to find out the history behind <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-strike.html" title="Counter-strike">Counter-strike</a>, then you're going to have to study the map list. And another point on its popularity, there are many more people out there who would want to read an article on a counter-strike map than say some computer game based webcomic like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a>, or an esports team like <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a> and yet I think those who are interested in Team 3D would find articles on the arenas in which their victories took place interesting. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:37, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There's some differences to maps in Super Mario World. Some which I have picked up on in my original comment. Super Mario maps are fixed, they've not changed since the first game was boxed. Counter-Strike maps haven't, they've evolved with the game, tried new things out and are part of Counter-Strike's developmental history. I think this is something to note down due to Counter-Strike's long history, if you check out the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a> article, you'll see a release timetable chronicling the game's various releases and big changes made. It however, hasn't managed to note down the changing map cycles in the game, nor how the maps themseleves have changed as this is quite hard to research. The other point I made was about professional gaming. Recently, Complexity Gaming recently won the Summer CPL competition, and that news is covered by <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotfrag.html" title="Gotfrag">Gotfrag</a> <a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/33432/" class="external text" title="http://www.gotfrag.com/cs/story/33432/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I think whoever is looking into competitive gaming will want to find out about the maps in which these tournaments took place, in this case <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_inferno.html" title="De inferno">de inferno</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_dust2.html" title="De dust2">de dust2</a>. Ask a Super Mario fan what map 4-3 is and he might not be able to tell you. Ask a none-counter-strike playing FPS fan what de_dust is, and he will know it. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:34, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It has been amply demonstrated that these articles are not mere strategy guides to playing the levels, they contain information on the maps creators, histories, why they are notable in the development of multiplayer gaming, etc. That discounts the "Wikipedia is not a video game strategy guide" argument towards deletion. The number of people playing these maps and a simple Google search proves that these are DEFINITELY notable. And "But it's cruuuuuufty" is not a valid reason to delete. There's a lot of esoteric information on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit," not, "the free encyclopedia that only people who are interested in everyday, common mainstream pablum can edit"</li>

<li><b>keep</b> cruft is described as being of interest only to a <b>small</b> fanbase but as can be seen from checking the steam status page, there are 115,600 people playing CounterStrike and CounterStrike Source this very second and that figure is only a fraction of the total number of players (due to different timezones and each player only playing for a few hours) which is probably in the region of 1.2 million. so the cruft argument is null. CounterStrike is a cultural computer online phenomena and as such deserves to be noted in Wikipedia along with descriptions of the maps that it is played on. calling these map descriptions game guides is misguided and wrong. yes there will be information that may appear to be like a guide but it is just part of the description of the map not a walkthrough of "how to complete this level" as that would be impossible to do for a game like CounterStrike. a guide for CounterStrike would basically read "don't get shot, shoot all the enemy". IMHO it would be tragic for an encyclopedia with the scope of Wikipedia to delete the entries for such a ground breaking and immensely popular online phenomena as CounterStrike based on the "per nom" votes of people who have no insite into it. some of these maps are so popular that they have even been converted to be used in other online games (de_dust and aztec, among others, have both been converted to be used in Day of Defeat) and this must surely be a sign that CounterStrike maps are worthy of recognition. thankyou for your time --81.79.138.151 02:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)prone ranger</li>

<li>There are some interesting issues here regarding notability and verifiability. Is it reasonable to use a computer game as a source about the computer game itself? Or is that original research? Does a computer game qualify as a published source? I'm not really sure. I often write articles about books and then I tend to devote a large section to summarizing the contents of the book. Is summarizing the content of a book original research? Hardly. Should summarizing the content of a computer game be treated differently? Hmm, well, a computer game is in some ways less accessible than a book. For one thing you need to have a certain type of computer in order to play. But on the other hand we accept any book as a source no matter how inaccessible it is. In <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gosforth_cross.html" title="Gosforth cross">Gosforth cross</a> I used a relatively obscure 1913 book written in Icelandic as a source. No-one seems to have a problem with that, but it is undoubtedly less accessible to the general Wikipedia user than Counter-Strike is.</li>
<li>As for notability I'm sure there are many more people interested in Counter-Strike maps than in <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Acta_sanctorum_in_Selio_0025.html" title="Acta sanctorum in Selio">Acta sanctorum in Selio</a></i> which I wrote a few days ago. Before I wrote that article its title had exactly <i>one</i> English language Google hit. No-one ever wants to delete my articles on medieval literature, no matter how "crufty" they get. The Google comparison isn't entirely fair, though, because "Acta sanctorum in Selio" gets two English language Google Books hits (both of them good reliable sources) where "Counter-Strike maps" get none.</li>
<li>Is there precedent for using computer games as a source? I think there is. If you look at the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> featured article you'll come upon sentences like this: "In the next game, <i><a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow_dbf4.html" title="Pokémon Yellow">Pokémon Yellow</a></i>, Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle are not available at the beginning, as all three have already been taken by other trainers; instead, the player starts with a <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>. A Bulbasaur becomes available later in the game, as a gift from an non-player character in <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerulean_City_835b.html" title="Cerulean City">Cerulean City</a>..." My guess would be that this information comes simply from the game itself - which is, indeed, cited as a source in the references section.</li>
<li>Taking all the above into consideration and assuming—perhaps generously—that Mark made the right call in promoting <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a>, I think a decent case can be made for the notability and verifiability of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_maps_845e.html" title="Counter-Strike maps">Counter-Strike maps</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 10:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One thing I didn't think of when I wrote this is that it's much harder to give a citation to a specific part of a computer game than to that of a book or even a film. You can cite the page numbers of a book, the time period of a film (in the specific DVD version of it your citing) but you can't really cite information such as specific factoids about a map in Counter-Strike in an elegant way. You'll have to say something like: "Load the map and start the game, if you start in the typical counter-terrorist spawning location then go forward for about 20 seconds, then turn left, jump over the boxes, go inside the window, go down the stairs and out again, through the street and turn right.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I beg to differ. FPS maps have both fictional and real histories, nearly always have a plot and backstory (the CS maps certainly do), and surely have characters (or, more precisely, roles).

<li><b>Bad Faith Nom and Strong Keep</b> The articles are not written as streategy guides but more of descriptions of locations in a very popular game series. Surfing is not so much a how-to as it is a explanation of a technique. Surfing can be compared to an article about the act of <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a>; they're not how-tos but explanations. Sure they can be cruft-prone, but as can a lot of articles. ANd i highly refute the argument that RPG locations are any more or less notable than FPS Maps. IN a generic sense they're same thing; virtual spaces for a video game. Just because rpg's tend to have more backstory doesnt mean an FPS map is any less notable. CS maps are pretty notable as they are really not that many popular ones. They're just a few that everyone plays over and over gaain. And given the large user base i'd say that makes them pretty encyclopedic. --<b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsinio_de8b.html" title="User:Larsinio"><font color="LimeGreen">larsinio</font></a></b> <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarsinio_d8b0.html" title="User talk:Larsinio">(<font color="orange">poke</font>)</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_larsinio_1d82.html" title="Special:Contributions/larsinio">(<font color="DodgerBlue">prod</font>)</a></sup> 17:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Come on, we've already had two AfD nominations... this is getting ridiculous. Let us examine the nomination:
<dl>
<dd>1. It is stated as cruft. This one is simple enough: "Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion." (From <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECruft_0d94.html" title="WP:Cruft">WP:Cruft</a>)</dd>
<dd>2. The nomination also contains flat-out lies. There are no "how-to" elements of these articles. These articles are not game guides, nor do they read anything like them. I am adamantly opposed to having strategies and the like in Wikipedia, and I actively remove anything that could be considered strategy guide material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The nominator (who is an admin) has had at least one other person complain about him nominating pages as "game guides" without merit <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html#Complaint" title="User talk:Proto">User_talk:Proto#Complaint</a>, and acts in quite an <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">uncivil</a> manner, with his insults to others' work (referring to some of these articles as "bastard children" and "terrifying," and statements like "a concerted effort by the Counter-Strike article contributors to keep their nice cruft."</dd>

<li>Varco and others - Proto has been extremely civil in my opinion (everyone has actually considering the feelings on both sides), especially considering the aggressiveness of the opposition. Rather than insulting editors, it is usually best to simply make your arguments about the articles, rather than about editors of different opinions. Proto (and all of the other editors here of course) are voicing what they believe to best for Wikipedia, so enough with this "bad faith nom" stuff. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:37, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies if my tone comes across as aggressive. But you have to understand that as a contributor to these articles, it is extremely frustrating to have to go through the AfD process every other week. As for <i>ad hominem</i>, just calling a spade a spade. You can find proto's personal crusade on his own user page, and that is precisely the thing that clouds one's objectivity.

<dd>You, Proto, conceded notability. That doesn't mean that cs_office is as important to the history of the world as The Last Supper, but in the eyes of Wikipedia they are both article-worthy. I use analogies like the coliseum and the louvre because just about everyone knows about them and they can grasp the analogy immediately. My point wasn't "if these maps go, then so does every piece of art." My point was only that there is a reason why we should use separate articles, because there would be too much content if we filled up one page. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 14:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Is "I concede notability" synonymous with "notability is not the issue here"? If so, the answer to your question is the sentence it precedes. Regardless, notability is not the issue here. Game-guidity is, which brings me to my point: if I wanted to make a game guide, how would I gather the necessary information? I would look to an encyclopedia to garner this research. A COMPLETE encyclopedia, I should say. And that, I believe, is what Wikipedia strives to be. We needn't fill Wikipedia with every imaginable bit of information in the universe, but we should be able to recognize that these map articles are encyclopedic, not game-guidic. They are game guide enablers, not game guides themselves. John Bergan 05:35, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I commented before on a previous AFD why a merge would not be suitable as well as some comments made at <a href="../../../c/o/u/Talk%7ECounter-Strike_maps_550c.html" title="Talk:Counter-Strike maps">Talk:Counter-Strike maps</a>. The reason why a list of Counter-Strike maps would not work in the same way as Multiplayer in Halo: Combat Evolved works is because of Counter-Strike's history. Halo comes out with a map, and it's static, unchanged from the first version. Counter-Strike is different, it's incremental delivery means that the maps have all evolved over time, their developmental history is important. For example, I know that <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_inferno.html" title="De inferno">de inferno</a> would not have become one of the most balanced tournament maps had a new corridor been introduced in parallel to the main street. (I can't source this right now, which is why I haven't added it to the article). I also know it has gone through various rebuilds and retextures. 3 different versions have been released and are played simultaneously online, one for <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Counter-Strike%7E_Condition_Zero_8461.html" title="Counter-Strike: Condition Zero">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Counter-Strike%7E_Source_e320.html" title="Counter-Strike: Source">Counter-Strike: Source</a>. To cover all this would lead to an amalgamated article being incredibly incredibly long and hard to navigate or keep track of. To cop that off, Counter-Strike has had many more maps in its map cycle than both Halo and List of maps in Battlefield 2 - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 15:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hahnchen, are you saying the fact that an unstable map used in a computer game had an extra corridor added is <i>not</i> gamecruft? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 16:44, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, you'd probably consider the entire Multiplayer in Halo: Combat Evolved gamecruft as it tells you of the features found in a map. The corridor addition might sound cruft, but the addition of an extra route is why it's used in professional competitions. If you want to follow the development history of Counter-Strike, you have to look at the development of the maps. These maps are being played simultaneously across 3 different games, the changes in between these versions are worth noting down. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:46, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was on vacation, and I would not have noticed unless I found the message notification on the top of an article I was reading. Again, Proto, here you are being uncivil by not notifying significant contributors to the articles you are trying to delete, and then having the audacity to accuse <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> of spamming for doing something that <i>you yourself</i> were <b>supposed</b> to do. "It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the article that you are nominating the article."

<li><b>To ChipperGuy</b> - Note that while Proto and other edits don't have issues with notability, others do. Just because Proto says that notability is not an issue for him, doesn't mean that everyone who thinks that the maps are not notable should have their opinions discounted. Also, please consider placing your comments at the end of a discussion, rather than addressing them on a point-by-point basis throughout the article. It makes it easier for editors to read and helps provide an understanding of the flow of discussion without having to check timestamps for everything. Just my couple o' cents. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 06:44, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And just to clarify, the fact I didn't mention notability in the AFD nomination does not mean that I consider the maps to be particularly notable. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 10:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be irregular to accuse a man of one crime, and then when he gets to court, the jury decides to make up another crime for him and send him to jail on that. The original nomination summary never mentioned notability, the nominator himself said it's not the issue, and when pressed for a third and final time (on the talk page) he again said that the only issue was the WP:NOT violation on grounds of it being a game-guide.</dd>
<dd>But even IF notability is an issue for voters, it can be debunked simply by a google search or a reckoning of the players on the Counter-Strike servers that host the maps. It's like the street analogy bikeable brought up. Millions driving the street assures us that the information is relevant to the lives of millions of people. So if someone were to make an article detailing the street's history and uniqueness decorate it with a top-down map and a few pics of what it looks like, it is obviously notable. Same here, except we have players instead of drivers. Kindly, <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 14:55, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Wickethewok. I'll try to make most of my posts at the bottom from now on. And I agree that whether a person believes that the map pages are notable is not a reason to discount his or her vote. However, if poor notability is the ONLY accompanying reason for a vote, then it should be counted the same as a vote with no reasoning given. "Delete, these maps are not notable" should be treated the same way as "Delete, I hate fun" or "Delete." Why? Because Proto has argued that "notability is not the issue here."

<li>Nominator suggests <b>Delete:</b> because:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Although a few of the names mentioned, "jillions," "bazillions," etc. undoubtedly have some kind of real existence, the article is not about particular names, but about a concept. As written, it reads as a personal essay and original research. It is reasonable enough as far as it goes, but it is <i>not</i> a distillation and synthesis of well-known, published material from reliable sources. In fact it cites no sources at all for the body of the article. Nothing suggests that "indefinite and fictitious large numbers" is a coherent concept about which there is a body of published material.</li>
<li>The list of names is questionable, mixing up familiar names like <i>kajillion</i> and <i>bazillion</i> with unfamiliar ones for which no source is given, without distinction. The list of names is an invitation to contribute original coinages, small-group in-jokes, personal locutions, and <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">things made up in school one day</a>. There's no attempt to separate the "real" ones (informal and jocular but widespread) and the "made-up" ones (limited to small groups of acquaintances). AHD4 does have entries for <i>zillion,</i> and <i>gazillion," and perhaps others, but you wouldn't know it from this article.</i></li>
<li>Some of the information in the article appears to be inaccurate, which, together with lack of references, confirms an impression that there's been little research. For example, it says that "zillions" "seriously" refers to "all the possible -illions" (i.e. the collection of all number names ending in -illion). It's unsourced, I couldn't quickly find any reference that says this, and AHD4 defines "zillion" merely as: "Informal An indeterminately huge number."</li>

<li>That would be a step in the wrong direction, because it would require a separate article for each possible word that could be used to denote an indefinite large number. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

<li>I appreciate the entry and the example provided in order to understand the term acrosticdoublespeak. Advertising a book because it's name suits the need for an effective description is helpful and humourous. To me, the casual brower, the advertising element is a non-issue, and in fact does spark intrigue as a person interested in looking into this clever form of humour. However, I am unaware of Wikipedia's policy on the matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 57.68.50.33 (<a href="../../../5/7/2E/User_talk%7E57.68.50.33.html" title="User talk:57.68.50.33">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_57.68.50.33_119a.html" title="Special:Contributions/57.68.50.33">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I think that the entry for acrosticdoublespeak should remain. It appears to be a valid subgenre of humor, as evidenced by the Journal of Irreproducable Results. One could argue that any Wikipedia entry is an advertisement of some sort, but if the subject matter exists and is part of our culture then it should be listed. The whole point of Wikipedia seems to be that it is an encyclopedia that does not have to limit its entries. Acrosticdoublespeak has the requisite validity to remain. <b>Do Not Delete</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Todd2albright (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Todd2albright_a26e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Todd2albright">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Analysis</b>. Studying the style of the two comments it is clear that they are speaking with the same voice. The account from which the second comment was posted has been activated, today, for this purpose. Superficially there are 30 Google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Acrosticdoublespeak&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Acrosticdoublespeak&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">here</a> but they are all recycled from Wikipedia or the book's website. I do not object to the concept of advertising but rather that this term has simply not been adopted independently which it needs to be to make it encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 19:12, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The purpose of Wikipedia is to present to the e-loving masses a broad compendium of extant knowledge. Being that knowledge is structured around ideas, the question is, "What constitutes a relevant idea?"
<p>At the risk of over-simplifying, I believe that three basic requirements have to be met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The idea is novel</li>
<li>The idea represents a genuine contribution to our current thinking.</li>
<li>the idea bears the potential for future germination.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Acrosticdoublespeak admirably fulfills these 3 criteria, a fact which, alone, should merit its inclusion in Wikipedia.
<p>However, the nasty truth be told, it is not always easy to judge an idea in an independent manner. For this purpose, we sometimes feel that secondary confirmation or validation is required.</p>
<p>While Acrosticdoublespeak admittedly does not shine in this regard, it certainly does pass,. The book was excerpted in The Journal of Irreproducible Results; furthermore, it served as the foundation for a 3-credit class in Penn State University.</p>
<p>For those reviewers who somehow feel that inclusion of Acrosticdoublespeak is an affront to the very dignity of Wikipedia, please allow me to end this comment with two very simple questions, "Can you name a more innovative form of satire that has come forth in the last 30 years&#160;?" and "Exactly how many leading universities have to utilize a text and how many of the world's oldest and most prestigious journals of scientific satire have to excerpt a work before it is acceptable to Wikipedia?" <b>Do Not Delete</b>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Skoncey dm (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skoncey_dm_9613.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skoncey dm">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>About the so-called Analysis</b> Just because I created an account on the same day that I submitted a comment should not belie the fact that I am a consistent user of Wikipedia.

I believe that terriersFan's implications are unwarranted. Perhaps rather than looking into the people who post comments, TerrierFan should look into the person who created acrosticdoublespeak. As one who posts articles on scientific matters, TerrierFan might be interested to know that the creator of this form of humor has written several articles for the journal Nature and has been cited in academic literature many hundreds of times. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Todd2albright (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Todd2albright_a26e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Todd2albright">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>With all due respect for the dead, being killed in Iraq in the course of duty is not notable enough for a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am in agreement that the "average" death of a soldier is not notable enough - the circumstances surrounding his death are noticable.

<li><b>KEEP</b> for now lets wait for more evidence to appear in court from the investigation to see if in time he will be notable because he was only killed out of revenge or it was just a random killing because he was a U.S. soldier then he should be merged with his two other soldiers that were kidnapped and tortured and killed.--<a href="../../../b/n/g/User%7EBnguyen_a2bd.html" title="User:Bnguyen">Bnguyen</a> 20:28, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> As tragic as this is, as tragic as this war is, or any war, the soldier is not notable enough. Imagine listing all soldiers who died in WWII. 13 million from the Soviet Union alone. I understand from the comments above that there is something which could turn out to be notable around the killings, only in that case would I support a merge - however I am in doubt whether it would still be notable, and I doubt that the current court investigation is notable. Things like these tend to happen in wars all the time and there have been A LOT of wars (I haven't heard of this particular case before actually).--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable">Konstable</a> 03:34, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>These articles are all sub-stubs that were added in mass quantities by User:Modernmillie. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers">User:Redvers</a> was tagging them for wikification and I was wikifying them. As I went along I prodded a bunch that aren't close to asserting notability. Those prods were removed today. This is an example of the kind of article I'm talking about: Embassy Theatre is a medium-sized venue in Skegness, England. That's it. And most of her stubs were the same content</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Queens Theatre in Barnstaple, England is a medium-sized theatre presenting a varied programme of music, comedy, and theatre.</dd>
</dl>
<p>With just the name, location, external link, and seating size (when given) changed. Sometimes the "varied programme" also might have included pantomime or ballet. But other than that, it was the same thing. So I'm nominating these as being sub-stubs and not anywhere close to <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7EStub_4d03.html" title="WP:Stub">WP:Stub</a> standards of giving other editors a solid foundation for continuing the articles. I know this is an odd reason to delete, but I think the mass creation of sub-stubs with no notability asserted for the theatre is inappropriate.</p>

<p>Artist does not appear to be notable; Google turns up fewer than 10 unique hits on "'gerard richardson' naval artist" and article author has history of vanity entries/edits. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 18:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
All right now. What do "Whos Who In American Art", The Smithsonian Library" and these notable collections have in common? The Kennedy Presidential Library, Lyndon Johnson Ranch, Hearst Corporation, US Naval Museum, etc. They believe that Gerard Richardson is a quite notable artist. If this artist can appear in Whos Who in American Art and can not appear in Wikipedia, then you might reconsider your editorial opinions on artists.</p>
<p>In addition, I resent the arrogant and insulting statement by HumbleGod, whatever juvenile handle that might be, from saying that I have a history of vanity articles. I proposed the artist James Williams into Wikipedia because he is a superb and recognized contemporary artist. That is why he was commissioned to illustrate a book that I wrote. In addition, it is duly noted that someone has eliminated the awards from the original James Williams aricle that I had written about him. How interesting. Hard to document, when the documentation is deleted...</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the article that I wrote on a basketball team that achieved a state and national win record that has survived for fifty years is not vanity, it is a sports record! The reason that I was a member of that remarkable team does not make it less true. Leave out my name if it will make you feel less strident in your "editing"</p>
<p>It would seem to me that editing should be concerned as to whether the subject matter of the article is worthy, accurate and educational, rather than the editor trying to insult a sincere contributor -Allen Autry</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, addressing the nominator's comments about vanity edits: one of the original editor's contributions was an article he had written himself, and another was on an artist he had commissioned for works he was writing. Both of those create the <i>appearance</i> of vanity because of the editor's personal stake in the work. That's why the key with that article is showing <i>other people's</i> citations/opinions that the artist is worthy of inclusion. That's done in this article.</li>

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. I'm taking some liberties with this one, since there is no specific speedy delete criterion that I can think of, and any admin is welcome to undelete and reopen the nomination. There are no references given in the article and it appears to be based on an "erotic" story of rape, incest, slavery, torture etc. that can be found by searching Google with the title in quotes. I prefer not to link to it. The site is not that horrible, but the section that the story is in appears to be an area for the sickest stuff. I'm not saying that the author was acting in bad faith. He may have believed that it was a well known story and he pointed out the impossibility of it happening. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:13, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was the one who originally created this article, but upon further research, I strongly believe that I was mistaken to do so. The principal reason is that this organization, if it can even be called that, is <b>non-notable</b>. Apparently they have only three active members (M. Sansum, H. Baldwin, and R. Lloyd, all of London). They are not and have never been registered as a political party in the <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm" rel="nofollow">Electoral Commission's Register of Political Parties</a>, and therefore have never run candidates in elections. They do not have and have never had a street address, instead taking mail from a PO box or a member's home address. They have neither a telephone number nor an Internet presence. They do not even have a bank account in their own name (as I found out when I mail-ordered their pamphlet). There's no record of them having published anything with an <a href="../../../i/s/s/ISSN_0f3e.html" title="ISSN">ISSN</a> or an <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a>. In short, for all practical purposes this group is simply three disgruntled ex-members of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_Great_Britain_1500.html" title="Socialist Party of Great Britain">Socialist Party of Great Britain</a> whose main activity is to attack the <a href="../../../s/p/g/SPGB_d59c.html" title="SPGB">SPGB</a> through word of mouth and a photocopied A5 pamphlet. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 15:58, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b>: Obviously a group that actually existed, and brings out a publication. The exact membership figures in this posting is not verifiable. Albeit small, the split of SPGB had reprecussions on the WSM at large, including the expulsion of the Indian section of the WSM. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 16:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was never a "split" in the Party; there was simply an expulsion of a few undemocratic members in 1991. As to the membership figures, it's indeed verifiable to anyone who (like me) has attended one of their "meetings". For anyone who doesn't live in London, however, it's difficult to verify that this tiny group exists at all! So perhaps we can add <b>non-verifiable</b> to the reasons for deletion, since you brought it up. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 16:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry to hear that this grouplet disappointed your expectations. However, you yourself confirm that is is a political group that hold public meetings and that publish a periodical. As to the definition of a split, I'd say that the expulsions clearly qualifies. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 16:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First my word isn't good enough for you, then it is. Well, let's set my word aside for the moment. I challenge anyone to find some third-party publications, apart from my own Wikipedia article, which document the existence of this group. If the group is sufficiently notable to appear in a few third-party books, newspapers, and/or encyclopedias, then I will concede that it's notable enough to appear in Wikipedia. But after having scoured Google and my local libraries for information about them and come up empty-handed, I'm convinced that there's too little evidence to meet Wikipedia's notability and verifiability standards. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 16:42, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, yes there is. There are a number of reasons why something that exists might not have a wikipedia article. My recommendation of delete is based on lack of notability, this is normally behind my delete recommendations at AfD. Let's not turn this into a discussion of inclusionism vs deletionism. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 08:54, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> just because we have the disk space for the article doesn't mean it belongs here. The article may be verifiable, but it is not, as of now, verified. Show me some proof that this group is more than three people, and that the aforementioned "paper" is more than just a glorified zine. The burden of proof is on those wanting to keep the article. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 19:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the article can be verified by reference to their magazine and articles passim. The notability is of interest to those who engage in leftwing trainspotting, groups like the ICC, CWO, and a host of other well known (in trainspotter circles) fractions, factions, grupuscles, etc. would also be excluded despite the part they play in the political ecology. I could add at least one more name to the list of active members, and they scertainly once had more, so there is historical interest --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Deathy_3dfd.html" title="User:Red Deathy">Red Deathy</a> 08:40, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b>. There may be many parties on the far left but their infinite varieties are highly instructive about the state of left-wing politics. The original SPGB is the longest standing far left party of all (1904). This group may not be so large now, but has previously had a significant enough following. It is covered in Paul Mercer's Directory of British Political Organisations and in Barberis, McHugh and Tyldesley's <i>magnum opus</i>. It used to run press adverts attacking the "Socialist Party of Clapham". The reason they are not registered with the Electoral Commission is that (1) the SPGB is and their registration would be ruled out for being confusing; (2) they haven't run any candidates in elections and don't need to. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 08:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Poisonous Poets are one of the biggest acts in British hip-hop, and suggesting them for deletion is in my opinion ludicrous.

<li>You created both the tragedy and comedy articles, so in practice you could use either one to justify the existence of the other. If this is deleted, I'll probably nominate tragedy next. As for the Shakespeare article, I don't have a problem with it because it's maintainable and finite. However, all of these pages need new names. List articles should start with the words "List of," per WP naming conventions. Also, "on screen" is an idiom. I think something along the lines of "List of film and television adaptations of Shakespeare plays" would be better. But I digress. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">djrobgordon</a> 13:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The author does not attempt to classify this entry as an actual word, and makes reference to the fact it is not included in <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionaries.html" title="Dictionaries">dictionaries</a> nor an official curriculae, although it may be referenced as found in actual use, and then makes reference of those <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=computerology&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=computerology&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">places</a>, even disqualifying it as a term officiated by post-secondary institutions in the statement: "This is an increasingly commonly used term, most people actually beleive that it is an actual description of the computer field, and aren't aware that there <b>is no official "Doctorate in Computerology</b>".</p>
<p>Whilst research on the author shows that they themselves use the term as part of their own company name same author also makes references to all other companies (that I could find) that also make use of same name. One must remember that this is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>, and will be updated from time to time by authors beyond the current author's control.</p>
<p>Also quite evident is that while the article is somewhat critical of "elitism" in particular programs the flurry of activity in this particular delete request is also due to mailing list distribution to the same post-secondary culture to which it labels as the original reason for such term not gaining use in post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>I have often noted that <a href="../../../-/o/l/-ology.html" title="-ology">-ology</a> is for some reason reserved for medical and biomedical sciences, although it is not restricted. I must also note that <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technologist.html" title="Technologist">technologist</a> is a legitimate word; and in effect this is based on the same root and latin suffix.</p>
<p>I find it somewhat distasteful that the post-secondary community of the University of New South Wales would take up the fight with such vigor at an article which points out potential <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitism</a> in their ranks; and such responses vindicate the author. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.71.0.218 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.71.0.218.html" title="User talk:70.71.0.218">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.71.0.218_77d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.71.0.218">contribs</a>) 08:31, 11 July 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p><b>Do not delete</b> Atifkazi - This League is legit, and was a significant league which lasted almost 2 years since sept 2004 to july 2006, it correctly displays the events of the league as I was the chairman of the league. The website does not work as it seems the free webhost went bust in october or november of last year. It would be quite poor of wikipedians to delete this article without looking at the facts properly, and undermining an extra curricula activity of a college, and to allow future generations to look at previous activities taken place in the college. The company you are talking about, is based 2 minutes away from the college, but i dont know what it has to do with the legitamacy of the league.</p>

<p>Non-notable company. A preliminary attempt to determine notability was conducted through a straw poll (found here) because I didn't know if it was kosher to start an AfD when I myself wasn't sure how I'd vote at that time (it seems like a nomination is a de facto "delete" vote, and possibly a bad faith nomination otherwise, so while I may be wrong I wanted to play it safe). No one who participated in the straw poll thought the company was notable, so it's now becoming an AfD to decide the ultimate fate of the article. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../i/c/a/User_talk%7EIcarus3_9890.html" title="User talk:Icarus3">Hi!</a>)</sup> 18:01, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In all circumstances, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with a minimum threshhold of significance below which articles are not included. You may disagree about where that threshhold is or whether a certain article meets it, but nevertheless others have given that threshhold the name "notability", and it is a valid criterion for deletion. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 06:21, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Shircago is a professional group of a capella musicians with great voices (I'm a speech pathologist with specialty in voice and disorders). Shircago has existed for several years and has recently begun distribution of their CD at a reputable retail store, Tower records. Those who work for Wikipedia obviously have not bought the CD nor realize that Shircago is one of the few worthy young American Jewish pop artists. The type of music they play has been dying, similar to the Shadow Play in China. It is important for the Jewish people to keep that music alive. And Shircago obviously has the right qualifications given that the Jewish Community of Chicago knows the name of the group, and members look forward to attending their concerts - most recently at the Jewish Folk Festival in Chicago. Wikipedia would be making a mistake by deleting this reputable group from their Encyclopedia.

It isn't a MySpace page. The band has existed for 10 years and is known to audiences in Chicagoland and beyond. The group is a representative of an important up-and-coming expression of religious music in a genre that is accessible to all ages, so the proper course of action is to <b>not delete</b>. --Wolverine94 21:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)Wolverine 94, 4:38pm CDT, 11 Jul 06</p>
<p>I would be more convinced that this isn't a MySpace page if that huge picture wasn't emblazoned across the top of the article.

<dd>The fact that there may be a bit of vanity in the motivation does not automatically disquality this entry. I think the attention this group gets in the Chicagoland area and beyond puts it above your typical small band. They have been featured in one of the largest U.S. newspapers for being part of a newer movement of more ethno-religious-popular music (I read the Chicago Tribune article with interest). I think stumbling on entries like these is what keeps Wikipedia so interesting (although again, would not like to see every 'boy band' included). Since there is more than a little doubt and debate, I would certainly <b>keep</b> this entry.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.135.56.21 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.135.56.21_96cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.135.56.21">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I hear the evidence everyone says and it first looked unarguable, but then I looked at the source code of the article because the AFD box had grown a tumor or siamese twin with another box attached to it and then I noticed below the tumor and a few spaces was {{future television series}} and then in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Upcoming_television_series" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Upcoming_television_series" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Upcoming_television_series</a> there's a lot of shows. Well, it appears this kind of thing gets kept so I'm hoping this is all reason enough for everyone to change their votes to keep. Let me just point out and I looked in that category and I picked a random show in there and *it had no source at all*! The article here for deletion at least has a source of proof. If this one should go, then most of the shows in this category should be AFD'd, especially the ones without references. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 22:17, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>In addition to what InShanee says, notice what is clearly written on the Category:Upcoming_television_series page: "Please include a link to the official website of the show or a page on the website of the television station. Absent these, a link to an IMDB profile is acceptable. Note that Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Information should be verifiable. When using this template consider carefully if the article should be in a encyclopedia or not."

In the end, however, the wine is not notable enough for inclusion. In order to be included the subject should be the subject of multiple articles in media. The article asserts three mentions, reviews in The Wine Advocate, The Wine Spectator, and The Washington Post. The issue is whether being the subject of a review should count as being the subject of an article. If it were to count, Wikipedia would have a lot of articles on wines as the first two publications review hundreds, even thousands of wines a year. So a review of a wine in one of these publications cannot count as the wine being the subject of an article for purposes of notability. The Washington Post publishes fewer reviews and has a broader circulation, but even if this review were to count as being the subject of an article, this would not satisfy the multiple articles requirement. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 23:56, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is offensive and outrageous. We have enough to contend with--now we have people being paid to do nothing but spam, and probably in more and more sophisticated (i.e. sneaky) ways. I think this type of activity may be legally actionable if taken to certain heights, some area or tort law could apply such as intentional interference with business. I am changing my vote given the insidious basis for the edits and suggest that User:Kimcray be <b>permanently banned</b> as acting with the ultimate in bad faith, with goals that are fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of Wikipedia and as a precedent that should be set at the earliest possible time. I do not suggest this lightly but with sober reflection--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Although I agree with you about this being offensive and outrageous, I do not think she is all that sneaky or sophisticated. She mentioned on the new user help page that this is what she was doing. Hell, the article didn't even mention the Robert Parker review in The Wine Advocate until Idp added it. How incompetent do you have to be to try to promote a wine and not mention a postive review from Parker? Ultimately, though, I do not believe that the conduct of an editor is dispositive on whether an article should be kept. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 00:48, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't implying that she was sneaky, quite the opposite; a person who admits the activity she did is about as far from sneaky as it gets. I was suggesting (admittedly without perfect clarity) that once we have not isolated incidents but a cottage industry of people being paid to do this, it will become ever more sophisticated. While I agree that intent behind edits should not often be used as a basis for deletion, you'll note, for instance, that WP:AUTO is applicable regardless of how NPOV seeming a self-written article is. In this case, the nature of the edits so taints the material that I would vote to delete it if it was sourced to the teeth.

<li><b>Comment</b> The quotes were all from third party wine reviewers, all of whom do serious reviews that are frequently noncomplimentary when wines deserve it. A 92 is high and these phrases are often used to describe wines that score like this. So it's not like this is a case of compiling "I loved it; it was much better than Cats" type promotional blurbs. If something sucks, we can describe it accurately without it being an attack page. If something's good, as this wine seems to be, we can describe that accurately as well without the article being an ad. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 05:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Whilst my instinct when previously editing the article (and I thank those who have commented kindly on my edits) was that Amuse Bouche had the potential to be considered notable, I'm now a little more reticent about the article. User:Zirka1 refers to a number of articles concerning wine producers, but the one which strikes me as most comparable is <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penfolds_Grange_8f07.html" title="Penfolds Grange">Penfolds Grange</a>, an Australian producer also dubbed a 'cult wine' - however, whilst the Grange line is responsible for a number of decades worth of notable vintages, the praise for Amuse Bouche (however illustrious, and obviously, Parker is the ultimate in this field) centres on a single, very recent vintage. As <a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhgettaboutit</a> said, google searches are probably lacking as barometers for notability of wine. I'd view a more accurate barometer as being a clear record of consistent mention in both the mainstream press and the wine press. Though the 2003 vintage of Amuse Bouche garnered some serious praise from some very influential sources, the lack of a more extensive track record means that, discarding the blatant advertisements of User:Kimcray, the only admissible material in the article is the brief but intense praise for one vintage. That's just not enough to merit an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/d/p/User%7EIdp_61da.html" title="User:Idp">Idp</a> 21:02, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Right, but what's important here is not the size of the criticism, but the size of the total article. Otherwise, you can break it up if it's a topic in it's own right, but here that easily fails the test. Apply a test like <i>If <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loose_Change_%28video%29_a1f5.html" title="Loose Change (video)">Loose Change (video)</a> was unworthy of an encyclopaedic article, would Criticisms of Loose Change be worthy of an article?</i> - the answer here is clearly no, so <i>Criticisms</i> shouldn't get it's own article until the size needs of <i>Loose Change</i> demand it. Whereas even if <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> was a very short article, one could still justify forking out <a href="../../../c/n/_/CN_tower_3532.html" title="CN tower">CN tower</a> because even if <i>Toronto</i> wasn't worthy of an article, <i>CN Tower</i> still would be. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, in that case we have a list that <i>has</i> to rely on original research. This article, on the other hand, references the Family Media Guide website, which (while perhaps not always accurate) does have the quoted statistics and sets the guidelines that this article was formed around. (Remember, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says we're aiming for "verifiability, not truth.") What we need to do with this article is eliminate <i>any</i> word count NOT provided by FMG's research. This means the "Fuck's" column needs to go and the "FPM" column needs to be revised to reflect the FMG research. If the movie hasn't been researched by FMG, get it off the list. With this done, I think it should satisfy WP guidelines just fine. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 01:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Before I forget to mention this....Having been shown this page in the other AfD, I've been cruising the talk page over the last few days. I had suggested finding another source for the other word counts that FMG did not provide, but the only steady one I could find is IMDB. The problem there is that Premium members of the site can submit trivia, where the Fuck count is located, and I wouldn't be surprised if these members were using WP as a source! Around and around it goes. Thus, the only easy solution I can find is to just stick with FMG results and ditch the rest. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 01:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the list, and delete the nominator.&#160;:) The list has survived 3 snipe attempts already. Wikipedia is supposed to be uncensored, so quit trying to censor it. The nominator is obviously offended by the subject matter of the list. But so what. <i><b>KEEP!</b></i>. I've seen most of the movies on the list and found the comparison enlightening. The list is anything but arbitrary. How much swearing is in a movie contributes to its tone and intensity. The list is the <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richter_Scale_65ff.html" title="Richter Scale">Richter Scale</a></b> for movies, and gives a rough indication of how much each movie will shake you up! Knowing the movies' level of swearing can help you pick what to watch based on what you are in the mood for. The list is innovative, informative, fun, and a perfect example of why Wikipedia stands apart from all other encyclopedias. You won't find anything like this in the Britannica. It's a keeper. <i>Put the list on your watchlist guys, 'cuz they'll be gunning for this one again.</i> --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrinity_Skyward_84af.html" title="User:Trinity Skyward">Trinity Skyward</a> 05:13, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's worth mentioning that this article has improved after every AfD nomination to date. The first nomination led from the Guinness-like "record" page to the current "list"; the second established a consensus that verifiability could be met; the third provided a good resource for so doing (FMG). And I'm hoping that this one will lead to my recommendation, the elimination of all non-verifiable (i.e. non-FMG) records in the article. In other words, even though I think this article should stay and I suspect it will, I'm glad it was nominated again. The only thing bugging me is that its biggest problems were being discussed and worked out on the article's Talk page when this was nominated. But if the AfD discussion pushes it forward, all the better. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 06:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I went ahead and changed the chart (thank goodness for sleepless nights) to remove all non-FMG content and reorder appropriately. The downside: far fewer entries. The upside: as far as I can tell, the list no longer threatens to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>

<dd>Other notes:
<ul>
<li>Fucks Per Minute count still relies on old data and will have to be recalculated (by someone else, I'm done with it!)</li>
<li>I removed the ranking column temporarily to make it easier to adjust the chart; however, as one user noted on the article's Talk page, it may be better this way, as it's easier to maintain and add more entries. I'll leave this decision up to others.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, verifiable. As well, even though the article didn't previously mention this, the school dates back to 1879, quite old for schools around there, so there's got to be lots of interesting stuff to say about the school.

<li><b>Keep</b>. That a school has been in continuous operation since 1879 is surely notable in its own right. I see pretty much NPOV and sufficient notability to say keep. It needs further work.

<p>Reason the page should be deleted</p>
<ol>
<li>Conflicting and nonextent premise: The article is conflicting by title to begin with: the article treats Jews as a race, but then claims them to be Persian (which are non-semitic) as well (e.g. being origianlly Latino and AngloSaxon simultaneoulsy). It's a false notion.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>: Completely idiosyncratic non-topic: The article's title should read something like Jews of Iran to correspond with the article's content. The current article addresses exactly just that, not Persians of Jewry (which is an absurd thing by definition anyway).</li>
<li>Political platform and POV: The <u>entire</u> article is a politically charged and bashing piece against Iran, providing arguments and opinions without presenting any balancing counter arguments and/or evidence. An encyclopedia should not be a political platform.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>: Original research: Article is largely sourced on Lewis and Littman, hence not factual. All and any opposing sources have been deleted repeatedly from article. Even Jewish sources against those presented. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 22:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Now let's see if I get slated for this. Uncle G and Dionyseus seems to imply a keep as it exists in wiktionary, but I feel this is not relevant as it is for dicdefs and WP is for articles.

<li>I mean that I know of no society that does not have this concept. Whether we need this article or not is one point. Whether the article has sufficient quality or not is another. The community will judge both aspects and reach a consensus. It is well worth your while strengthening the article in the interim period, and hoping that your article will prevail because it both asserts notability and is viewed as required. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 23:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is an odd one, and no mistake. We already have decent articles on competitions/contests, lotteries, game shows and such, and the subject area of this article seems too ill-defined to pin down to solid concept - are we to include, say, bounties as a "prize"? Wikipedia already has an article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prize.html" title="Prize">prizes</a> (itself a borderline dicdef, but that's another matter), and after all, what is a cash award but a "prize" too? (How many competitions have we seen trumpting "huge cash prizes"?).

Anyway, please inform us why you want to delete this article. Just to remind you some AfD policy: <i>Good arguments for deletion are: "unverifiable" (violates WP:V), "original research" (violates WP:OR), and "non-notable" (for example, for a person, does not meet WP:BIO). The argument "non-neutral point of view" (violates WP:NPOV) is often used, but often such articles can be salvaged, so this is not a very strong reason for deletion. The reason "unencyclopedic" is not an argument at all but just another way of saying "should be deleted".</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>.JeDi 19:36, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ok. This ad <b>is</b> notable. I didn't discovered it on TV but someone told me about it. I then downloaded it on Internet, and saw it several times on TV. I talked about it with friends, I looked on internet about the making-of, and I really enjoyed it. Like it or not, it is now part of pop culture. I understand when ask me not to make it a U.S.-centric thing, but I'm sorry, you think this ad is not notable? I guess it's because you live in a country where the World Cup and all its feria didn't make it. If now I put an AfD on <i>Got milk</i>, how would you react? I really don't know <i>Got milk</i>, and I don't care. It was not shown <i>anywhere else</i>, not in my country at least, but I can understand that it is "important" for you to have it on Wikipedia.
