<p>Subject is only borderline notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is often mentioned in the news but apparently only because of alleged improper sexual relationships (e.g. <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0640,cramer,74593,6.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature_full.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-09-28/news/feature.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). Since the subject or his publicist has been blanking most of the article and he's only notable due to a single incident, this entry should be deleted. I disagree with the talk page reasoning that "Bruce McMahan is notable on account of wealth combined with the fact that the legal conflict between him and his daughter has made him a public figure" - there aren't that few multimillionaires who are more notable than him. (Google "Bruce McMahan": <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=uhF&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Bruce+McMahan&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.sg/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=uhF&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Bruce+McMahan&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyingtoaster1337_9f8e.html" title="User:Flyingtoaster1337">Flyingtoaster1337</a> 21:54, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's clearly notable. He's 1) "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" and 2) "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated."</dd>

<dd>You argue that "Since the subject or his publicist has been blanking most of the article and he's only notable due to a single incident, this entry should be deleted." That's a poor justification for deletion. It shouldn't matter whether an individual wants the information on Wikipedia or not. <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExeunt_5da0.html" title="User:Exeunt">Exeunt</a> 22:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note from Type Five:</p>
<p>I agree with Flying Toaster and the Wiki editor who removed this entry last round. Perhaps subject is clearly notable in the mind of poster Exeunt because he is a related party to dispute in question and trying to do damage. How does he know about a PR firm, how was he contacted via email, how is that he refers to the damage to this person's reputation as justifiable in user talk. If this is indeed notable, then Wikipedia should list all wealthy people, and all people who have been accused of sexual impropriety, include all tabloid newspaper and televison content on this database. In my humble opinion, poster is biased with an agenda, not a true contributor to Wikipedia. I am the one who in a good faith edit accidentally blanked the article which I corrected. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by TypeFive (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TypeFive_eace.html" title="Special:Contributions/TypeFive">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>So you're telling me you're a neutral contributor with no ties to Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine &amp; Regenstreif LLP who just happened to blank the page for the third time after it was restored? It's disingenuous (very lawyer-like!) to accuse me of being someone with an axe to grind with McMahan; I frequently edit Wikipedia, have no agenda other than improving this project and protecting it from <i>private interests</i>, and I have the advantage of not being a sock puppet and lawyer hired by Mr. McMahan to protect his image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and the funny thing about the subjects of tabloid stories--they're notable. What's true and notable about their lives would make it into a good Wikipedia article about them. <a href="../../../e/x/e/User%7EExeunt_5da0.html" title="User:Exeunt">Exeunt</a> 22:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Anything with this much controversy must be notable. The article seems to be suffering from edit wars by interested parties. At this point we have one solid reference, but should have more. The corporate bio is good background, but not sufficient to establish notability. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Be careful what you are accusing people of TypeFive, it is ironic to accuse someone of being 'not a true contributor to Wikipedia', and then fill your comment with poor logic, and not sign your post correctly. As for the article in question- Exeunt, you say that there is much coverage, <strike>do you think you could link to/cite some more directly?</strike> As for the matter of whether people WANT the information on Wikipedia, if information is properly sourced and relevent, removing it constitutes vandalism. It is not for the subject of the article to decide what is in it, otherwise all murderers would demand that the articles on them ommitted the fact that they had killed somebody. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 22:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry if I am not up on all the protocols of Wikipedia as far as signatures and did not post accordingly.

<dd>I can, when the sources are not reliable, and the material is defamatory. This isn't the New York Times publishing something, but a much more minor paper.

<li><b>Update</b> - Okay, the Dealbreaker.com article just references the Broward-Palm Beach New Times articles, so it's not useful. That should be stricken from the article. And the Villiage Voice article is exactly the same as the B-PBNT article, written by the same author, so that one's out. It's looking a bit weaker, but the two B-PBNT articles and NY Post article still support it.

<li>I don't agree that the Village Voice citation should be removed (a) it predates the New Times article (day, hours?), but more importantly it demonstates broader editorial oversight of the writter's allegations.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Murray_da3a.html" title="User talk:Kevin Murray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevin_Murray_2c9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevin Murray">contribs</a>) 00:27, January 28, 2007 (UTC)</small>

<p>I am not able to answer you Kesh. I have sent two lenghty responses regarding your question, but they are not going through due to an editing conflict of some sort.--<a href="../../../t/y/p/User%7EType_Five_d1f4.html" title="User:Type Five">Type Five</a> 00:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC) I will try again. Wikipedia policies regarding biographies of living persons presume that the articles can affect the subject's lives (two parties in this entry), show some degree of sensitivity, are unbiased which I don't believe the author is from his comments and references to law firms, etc.), presumption of privacy, criteria for non-public figures, justification, verifiable sources of high quality, etc. Kevin, I am not kidding about anything, I am a newcomer, I admitted that I blanked a page before I understood how to improve an article, and I was unsure of how to do the signature. I will try to keep this neutral however.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your efforts at trying to explain. There are a few misunderstandings here, though. First, the policies state that the <i>article</i> must be unbiased, not the editors! I have my own personal biases on many subjects, but I still try to maintain neutrality in all my edits. I do have some concern that the reference cited are not of high quality, I'll grant that. And it needs rewritten to be more encyclopedic. However, as of yet, I don't see that it violates policies. It's weak right now, and if the references <i>are</i> shown to be of poor quality, then I would agree that it should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 01:17, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Type Five, my appologies. Welcome! You are wrong on this though, and with all due respect, you are trying to push rope uphill at this point. The best that can be done is to try to diversify the article to demonstrate the subject's finer points. Rich doesn't make him notable, and incest doesn't make him notable, but the two are sysnergistic. Per WP guidelines what is noticed and documented is notable, and this poor fellow has definately been noticed in major way. Good luck with mastering that signature function! --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm happy to help build this article to include more than the scandal, but don't see much more well referenced information available through the obvious sources. Can we expand the information on his charitable work and his leadership in the investment community?

<li>New Times and Village Voice are one in the same company. I retract my argument that the two references demonstrated broader editorial review of the same contributing writer.

<p>If you click on discussion on the article page today there is a warning box regarding controversial and potenially libelous content for bios of living persons. In an effort to create an encylopedic quality quality article, the entry is now really reading like a tabloid. The vibrator entry is particularly troublesome. I suppose the subject matter (wealth, sexual accusations, lawsuits)is interesting to some, but I still feel the article is what Wikipedia is not.

<dd>So you argument is 'Wikipedia is not a tabloid, therefore we don't talk about controversial topics?' Something else that Wikipedia is not- Wikipedia is not censored.
