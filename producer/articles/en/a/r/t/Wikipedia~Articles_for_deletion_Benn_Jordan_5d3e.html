In addition, it could really use third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <b>Neutral</b> for now.

<li>Wikipedia is not an advertising service. Promotional articles about yourself, your friends, your company or products; or articles created as part of a marketing or promotional campaign, may be deleted in accordance with our deletion policies. For more information, see Wikipedia:Spam. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Opuszczony (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Opuszczony_c960.html" title="Special:Contributions/Opuszczony">contribs</a>) 2006-10-11 20:09:32 (UTC)</small>

<ul>
<li>How does appearing on a few compilations and mostly self-released or short-run records meet notability standards? Previous unverifiable claims of using "homemade software" (see earlier versions of entry) that have been cleaned up also lead one to believe that the artist is using wikipedia as a means for shameless self-promotion to create the illusion of greater notability. There is but one external source or citation within the entire article, currently a dead link. No offense meant to the artist, but what is the baseline of this idea of notability? By this precedent, anyone who has released a recording at all seems to meet its standard. solidarnosc dla robotników. 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You tell us. The criteria are <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Do the research, look for sources that tell us about this person, and apply them. But notice that nowhere did Opuszczony mention notability. And, as I said, and as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam</a> says too, deletion is not the sole recourse for promotional articles, which is the only criticism that Opuszczony did level at the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:16, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Benn is a notable artist in his genre. The article could use some cleanup, yes, but I don't feel deleting it is a good solution. --doofsmack 00:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> The reason this deletion request exists is because of vandalism from teenagers on a message board, and has little to no merit. This artist has released a lot of significant albums, many of which are available through mainstream distributors (Best Buy, Amazon, etc) in America and Europe. A couple minutes research will show you that he has a significant following as well as attention from the media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore he has toured around the world and composed music for many popular television shows, advertisements, and films. This page has been copied on other sites such as answers.com, about.com, and other information databases. That alone should tell you that this information has a place here on Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.167.26.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.167.26.171_3ee8.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.167.26.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I just want to warn you that articles being copied onto other sites isn't evidence of notability, or lack of it being evidence of lack of notability. about/answers/etc copy the whole of the wikipedia database from time to time and host it on their own servers, which means any article that is on there was in the database at the time they copied it. It doesn't mean anything else. As for significant, <i>who</i> says they're significant, and have they put their opinions in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>? That's the question I'm asking in the procedural nomination, and nobody wants to answer it for some reason (I can't because I'm not familiar with the breakcore genre). If you guys know that much about him, you can surely find sources (since you claim he's toured around the world, one of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s criteria). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> His tour information can be verified on many sources, for example: <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5" class="external free" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>lists the following information about this large American tour: "THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN have also announced a full North American headlining tour, their first since late 2004. The tour begins November 6 in Ottawa at the Babylon Club and includes HELLA (through November 27), THE BRONX (November 28 onward), BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, HORSE THE BAND and THE FLASHBULB."</p>
<p>On the events page listed on his website, he has some past tourdates listed in the frame: <a href="http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm</a></p>
<p>Here is another article I found about him (and not just a review) from the Pittsburgh City Paper, a widely circulated and respected newspaper for the area. URL here: <a href="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/archive.cfm?type=Music%20Previews&amp;action=getComplete&amp;ref=5737" class="external free" title="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/archive.cfm?type=Music%20Previews&amp;action=getComplete&amp;ref=5737" rel="nofollow">http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/archive.cfm?type=Music%20Previews&amp;action=getComplete&amp;ref=5737</a></p>
<p>Here is a link to Discogs.com, which uses more rigorous voting method to verify artist's releases: <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Flashbulb,+The" class="external free" title="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Flashbulb,+The" rel="nofollow">http://www.discogs.com/artist/Flashbulb,+The</a></p>
<p>Although this is missing a lot of information, here is an IMDB page made for his film composing work: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/</a></p>
<p>Here is a link verifying that this artist is sponsered by a major music software company: <a href="http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/2006/Native-Instruments-Native-Lab-Kore-Tour.html" class="external free" title="http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/2006/Native-Instruments-Native-Lab-Kore-Tour.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/2006/Native-Instruments-Native-Lab-Kore-Tour.html</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, this artist has extensive releases listed and supplied everywhere from iTunes to Amazon to retail stores. It's clear to me that he most definately has a place here on Wikipedia.</p>

<li>I vote to <b>keep</b> this. Benn has definitely distinguished himself enough to warrant his own article - and this can be cleaned up (I wouldn't mind doing it myself). Same goes for his albums; they are all very unique. <font color="red">«&#160;</font><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlagwerk_b6fe.html" title="User:Schlagwerk"><font color="gray" size="4"><sub><b>S</b></sub><font size="1">CHLAGWERK</font></font></a><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchlagwerk_91f6.html" title="User talk:Schlagwerk"><sup><i>Talk to me!</i></sup></a> 04:04, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
