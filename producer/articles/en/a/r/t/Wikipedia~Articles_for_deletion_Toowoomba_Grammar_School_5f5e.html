<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. This debate has been extremely contentious, just like the other debates about other high schools. The result is split down the middle, with some vehemently arguing for deletion, and others vehemently arguing for inclusion. There has been a lot of commenting on people's votes, and there have been claims of vote stuffing. Since this article has been on VfD for a very long time now, I will close it. Deletion requires a consensus, and there does not appear to be one. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 07:17, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>No grounds for deletion, other than being a pointless substub with negative potential of becoming encyclopaedic, and most likely vanity too. <b>Delete</b>. Look at it this way - if we include an article on this school, we <i>have</i> to include an article on every other school in the world, to be fair. Schools are so numerous, that if we embarked on such a drive, we'd easily hit the 2 milliojn article mark, but it would be at the expense of improving coverage of other areas. Think about it - someone hits "random page" repeatedly and gets nothing but pointless school substub after pointless school substub; are they going to take WP seriously as an information source? If you think that WP is an encyclopaedia of some value to someone, especially in areas where buying a full set of Britannica might be out of the question, vote <b>delete</b>. If you think WP should turn into some kind of a joke, a parody encyclopaedia with nothing but worthless substubs about the world and his wife, keep voting <b>keep</b> on crap like this. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 21:20, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So every time we include an article of a certain type, that obliges us to embark upon a drive to include every other article of that type? We have articles on American towns with a population of less than 100, is there a drive to include every of settlement in the world? Wikipedia should aim to become a valuable encyclopedia, rather devoting itself to impressing "random page" users. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:07, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Suit yourself, but ultimately it's the "random page" users that are best placed to gauge the overall value of WP, by not looking for specific fields. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 18:50, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Random page users may be able to gauge the average value per page, but wikipedia's true value is what people can find when they are actually looking for it. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:25, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, it's OK to keep this page because nobody will be looking for it, and therefore nobody will realise that it's useless? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 23:15, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b> i agree that it isnt ideal to have a link for every school in the world, but the toowoomba grammar school is one of the original 'great state public schools' in australia. in the days when the australian government funded 'elite' schools around the country to compete with private schools. I dont have any proper data about the school available to me, but it would be great to see a proper history written for the school, or perhaps just lumped into a historical thread about the greater public school system of the late 19th century. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanubis_1355.html" title="User:Danubis">Danubis</a>

<li>"Subject deserves and article" is neither here nor there, because these votes are about the <b>article</b>, not its <b>subject</b>. The <b>subject</b> may be deserving, but this article has now had 3 weeks on VfD, and it is still no better. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 23:34, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
