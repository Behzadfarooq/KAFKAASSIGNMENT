<p>When an unregistered user clicks on a link for a non-existent article such as <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_State_Library_726e.html" title="Kansas State Library">Kansas State Library</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kansas_State_Library&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kansas_State_Library&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">you get this</a>, which as of this writing, does not mention <b>Kansas State Library</b> anywhere.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Daily pages</span></h2>
<p>As several editors have already noted above, AFC has become so long that it is unmanageable. Building upon <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGod_of_War_d84c.html" title="User:God of War">God_of_War</a>'s work above, AFC now has daily pages. All new submissions are directed to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_Today_638c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today</a>. Every day <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">User:Uncle G's 'bot</a> will rename <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_Today_638c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today</a> to another name (listed in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_List_7b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/List">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/List</a>), and then blank the redirect to create a fresh page for today. This at least will chop the submissions up into lumps of manageable size, that don't take minutes to render. There still remains the question of how to archive processed and rejected submissions. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:34, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Very nice. One minor problem: can the ===Sources=== line be plain text? As it stands, the Sources subheading means you have to edit body and sources separately, or else the whole page, to manage the entry for an individual topic. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 14:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note that the article <i>name</i> will be a second-level heading, whereas the Sources section is a third-level heading. Editing the second-level heading will edit body and sources together as one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:51, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You make a very valid point. Due to the very nature of the MediaWiki software, we have often encountered category-related problems here. I'm afraid there's no easy technical solution. However, there are two workarounds:

<li>You can use the {{cl|category name}} template. In your case, you could use {{cl|Seafaring films}}.</li>
<li>The requests here are always looked at by real people and not bots. This means that so long as you can express what it is that you are asking for in the AFC proposal, we can accommodate the request.</li>

<dd>Too wordy. The words "Guidelines regarding articles about" would be repeated 6 times. As with all instructions, the longer it grows, the higher the chance the user will not read any of it. Our best chance of getting the users to not only read the instructions and to abide by them is to make it as terse and simple as possible. How about this as a compromise?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semi-protect?</span></h2>
<p>Today, two users mistakingly added their article requests to the AFC page rather than use the addcomment link on the page. One of those users did it by blanking the entire page. I'm quite positive that these were NOT intentional acts of vandalism, but rather new users who are unfamiliar with the system making honest mistakes. The problem is that the issue wasn't fixed for over <b>4 hours</b> -- and it's not the first time this has happened. This reflects poorly on Wikipedia and leaves a bad first-impression on new users. Given all this, perhaps semi-protection is in order in this case.</p>
<p>I'll grant you that <a href="../../../s/p/p/WP%7ESPP_ae93.html" title="WP:SPP">WP:SPP</a> states quite clearly that it "is not intended for pre-emptive protection of articles that might get vandalized.". However, I'm thinking that this is also a good <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> candidate as well. The intention of semi-protecting AFC is not to <i>prevent</i> anonymous users from participating, but to ensure that new users <b>can</b> participate. For 4 hours today, during the Western Hemisphere's "prime time", anonymous users couldn't use AFC at all. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 06:41, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Would a rework of the page do a better job that semi-protection?</span></h3>
<p>Looking at how the page source is organized, it looks loke there are several things that could be done that might help as much as the proposed semi-protection. The first thing is to move the header/instructions into a template similiar to <a href="../../../p/r/-/Template%7EPR-instructions_ae88.html" title="Template:PR-instructions">Template:PR-instructions</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFAC-instructions_4470.html" title="Template:FAC-instructions">Template:FAC-instructions</a>. This would move information that should be fairly static out of the line of fire and make it easy to watchlist the template to see if any changes occur. The second thing that should probably be done is to move the <i>Today's submissions</i> and <i>Older submissions</i> headers into the transcluded pages instead of having them in the top level page. This would change the behaviour of the [edit] tag associated with the header to cause an edit to be of the transcluded file instead of the top level file. As this problem appears to be caused by newbies, removing this point of confusion should reduce the frequency of problems. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 13:09, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd actually guess that it's the templates and transclusions that are causing the confusion. I think people come to <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_0d2b.html" title="WP:AFC">WP:AFC</a>, see other people's submissions on the page (they're actually on <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_Today_51a1.html" title="WP:AFC/Today">WP:AFC/Today</a>), click <i>edit this page</i>, fail to find the place for submissions, and finally get confused and blank the page. If the <i>edit this page</i> link they're accustomed to using on other articles were gone, then they'd look around, read the directions, and click on the big <i>Click here to submit your proposal</i> link. That link is also the only way they get to see <a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAFC_preload_90e9.html" title="Template:AFC preload">Template:AFC preload</a> which gives them even more instructions. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 14:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page semi-protected</span></h2>
<p>I have been convinced by Meegs' arguement above that semi-protection is worth a trial to see if it will help resolve the problems. As the purpose is to force anons and new users to use the link provided on the page instead of preventing vandalism, the usual {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotected_2018.html" title="Template:Sprotected">sprotected</a>}} template has not been placed on the page.

AFAIK, it is not in any form of print media, but Wiki itself references GSO as evidenced here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=governmentsecurity.org" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=governmentsecurity.org" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=governmentsecurity.org</a></p>

<dd>From what I've seen, the vast majority of the submissions are clearly not worth creating. Some have too little text, some are blatant vanity or obvious jokes, and some are even copyvios. So the reason an article submitted here is not created is usually that the request was reviewed and declined. I myself only find an article worth creating once per a week or two. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 17:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">this system is totally and completly unworkable</span></h2>
<p>Someone deleted (vandalized) the page and deleted tens of article creation requests - NO ONE noticed!</p>
<p>The only reason I noticed is that my request vanished.</p>
<p>This system i.e. one big page, just doesn't work. There is no way to track which pages were rejected, or anything.</p>
<p>How about creating some sort of sub namespace, where users can actually CREATE the page. Then if approved the page is copied to the main area, and the page marked done.</p>
<p>Or the page can be marked denied, etc. (Presumably by using categories.)</p>
<p>This way each request is by itself and the whole system becomes far more manageable.</p>
<p>You would just look at the category page for uncompleted requests, denied ones, and if you want completed requests.</p>

<li>The background colour needs changing to something lighter. I couldn't read the text without highlighting it!</li>
<li>Perhaps we could include a link to my templates for responding to requests. Giving good reasons as to why the article creation is not going to happen is sometimes a pain, and this would provide a certain uniformity to the requests as well as making it easier to respond.</li>

<dd>I'd used a 12-bit color specification that I saw elsewhere on WP, but have never used before – it must not be interpreted the same in our two browsers. I've now switched to the standard 24-bit spec, choosing D0D0FF and BBBBFF, which are about as pastel as I can tolerate. If the colors are still not great, please edit them yourself (the same goes for any content problems you might see too, obviously). About your templates, if they are to have official status, we should move them out of your userspace. I also have a couple comments on their wording if they're going to be used by others.

<li>As for the content, I have a number of minor things to suggest once they're in the template space.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page use problem</span></h2>
<p>Sorry for putting this request here. I read Help: Starting a New Page which says "Anyone, including you, can write for Wikipedia! Just type a title in the box below, click "Create page", and start writing" and "'Create page' takes you to an edit page to enter the new text" and under "Starting a page through the URL" it says "Using the URL for the new page displays the default 'no article' message (see MediaWiki:Noarticletext). The default page has the usual Edit this page link, which can be used to begin adding content" but it did not. After typing in the title of thearticle I was atempting to create it went to an "Article not found" page which says "As an unregistered user, you may also submit the content that you wish to have created". So I clicked the "edit this page" tab but the identical page just comes up again. So clicking the "submit the content" link I went to "Wikipedia:Articles for creation" where it says "To request the creation of an article with text you wrote, post it here" but I see no way to do this. Wow what a loop!</p>
<p>So anyway the page (or just a stub to start) I was requesting the creation of was on the "National Cattlemen's Beef Association" <a href="http://www.beefusa.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.beefusa.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I was going to include this quotation from said association (it appears at the bottom of every page of the site) "NCBA... working to increase profit opportunities for cattle and beef producers by enhancing the business climate and building consumer demand" which I find quite telling - especially the "working to increase profit opportunities for cattle and beef producers" and "building consumer demand" part.</p>

<dl>
<dd>That's interesting; there's no discussion that I know of. Probably the only effect most established, registered users have noticed is the beneficial one of fewer new articles immediately in need of deletion. Aside from the plight of anonymous users, it's difficult to appreciate the downsides to the policy, such as the absence of the good articles that anons might otherwise have started. My guess is that the only people opposed to the policy who weren't during the previous debate are unregistered users (or users who wish return to unregistered status). If you'd like to find out if there is interest in a new discussion, a post at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a> is probably the way to go. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 11:16, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many thanks to all those responsible for creating the afc top, afc b, and various afc reasons templates! This should help immensely in getting this list cleaned up faster, by reducing duplication of work. I'd tried to help out here a couple months ago, but the whole page was just a mess, and the only comments really found were the ones saying it'd been created already... so all the proposals I was reading were garbage, and had probably already been reviewed by 3 other people before me, meaning I was just wasting my time. Now with this new stuff, I can quickly skim the page to find the proposals without the little box, and easily insert a reason why it was or wasn't created, standardizing the whole thing. Much easier!

<dd>This same idea came to me a few months ago, and I must admit, I decided it was a terrible idea: that it would burden the reviewers, slow-down the work, and drive away desperately needed volunteers. It also did not seem to make sense to facilitate the rejection process when it did not appear that we had enough eyes to process every submission. I think I was wrong, though. On top of looking spiffy, the templates' prevention of redundant reviewing probably makes it all worth while. Good job, Harry and Kevin.

In my declinations, I sometimes encourage the authors to resubmit their articles once they've addressed my comments, but I'm not certain that's something we want to direct at everyone. If you think this is a big enough problem — and worth the extra volume — we could add 'do not edit, resubmit if improved' to the top/bottom templates. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 00:52, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dislike the "please do not make changes" clause. While I understand the intent, it does place a finality to it that I think is inappropriate. Declines were never meant to be absolutely final in the AfD sense. Any editor who wishes to create an article that another reviewer has declined should have the ability to do so. The template gives the false impression that once any reviewer has declined the article, that it is the end of discussion. I <b>strongly</b> oppose that. Because of that, I'm removing that clause pending further debate or resolution. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 19:51, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The new templates really speed things up. But there still seems to me to be a problem: When I can't make up my mind whether an article is appropriate, I usually just skip it. (And looking at other editors' patterns, this seems to be a common reaction.) The {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_top_6a9e.html" title="Template:Afc top">afc top</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_b_20e0.html" title="Template:Afc b">afc b</a>}} templates make it easier to pick out the unprocessed ones, but it still seems pretty easy for an unprocessed article to get visually lost in a crowd of processed ones. So I've experimentally created an {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_maybe_c17c.html" title="Template:Afc maybe">afc maybe</a>}} template, which displays an alert box in the article. {{afc maybe|This seems like it's on the very edge of notability}} displays this:</p>

<dd>I like the look. A potential functionality enhancement: What if the template also included the page in a "Article creation requests needing attention" category? Currently, an editor has to page through the whole archive if he or she wants to find old requests that weren't handled. So any request that isn't resolved within a few days of its creation is probably going to fall through the cracks. Putting the archive pages containing problem requests into a category could lead editors right to the appropriate archive pages; and once all the "afc maybe" tags had been handled and removed, the archive page would automatically disappear from the category. Or would this be an inappropriate self-referential category? <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 17:01, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revised AFC preload template instructions</span></h2>
<p>I revised the HTML-comment instructions presented to users when they use the link in the instructions to start their article. I tried to simplify things, make it clearer where the article and the sources should go, and emphasize that they should <b>LIST AT LEAST ONE SOURCE IN THE SOURCES SECTION AND NO "GOOGLE" DOESN'T COUNT AS A SOURCE ARGH DAMMIT</b>.</p>
<p>Okay. I have released the tension. I am now calm and placid like a gentle lake.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Also, I removed the instruction that tells people to put [[]] around their headline. The theory is good, but the majority of users were getting it wrong, I couldn't think of any clearer way to explain it, and it seemed to me that the inconsistency resulting from users' varying attempts to comply with this were making things harder than if they just didn't do it. Besides, the less thought our beloved newbies give to where the brackets should go, the more brain capacity they'll have left over for listing something in the "Sources" section. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 19:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going to suggest the same thing. It's irregularly maintained (I often forget to do it).

Yes, approving or declining an article was somewhat easier without the templates; but it took so much longer to find the unprocessed articles in the first place that it wound up being a slower process overall. And there's only two templates that are really important -- {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_top_6a9e.html" title="Template:Afc top">afc top</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_b_20e0.html" title="Template:Afc b">afc b</a>}}.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inappropriate articles by registered users</span></h2>
<p>When a registered user submits an article that's blatantly inappropriate (an advertisement, a personal attack, etc), I would encourage reviewers to decline the article in the normal way, rather than using the {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_reguser_2e6e.html" title="Template:Afc reguser">afc reguser</a>}} message to tell them that they can create their own articles. Yes, you're stating the obvious, but a lot of these people wouldn't otherwise bother to <i>learn</i> the obvious.&#160;:) This would seem to be a logical application of the <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> principle -- if someone appears to be trying to damage the encyclopedia, don't educate them as to how to do it better. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 18:15, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change in placement of afc top</span></h2>
<p>Currently, we've been placing the {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_top_6a9e.html" title="Template:Afc top">afc top</a>}} marker above the section header in users' articles. This looks nice. However, I'm going to suggest that we instead place it just <i>below</i> the section header, even though it doesn't look as nice there, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps all the markup related to a submission within that submission's section. Currently, the "afc top" markup winds up in the previous section, making it more confusing to edit or remove the markup later.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It makes reviewing long pages quite a bit faster. With the current MediaWiki engine, if you edit a section and place new content above the section header, then when you save your changes, you'll find yourself at the top of the page. Then you need to scroll back down and find your place. (You can avoid this by doing all your section edits in a new window, but this is a pain too.) If you edit a section and leave the section header at the very top of the section, then when you save your changes, you'll be placed back at the section you just edited. (Note that this only works for sections with unique titles; if you edit, say, a "Sources" section, you'll be placed back at the first "Sources" section in the article when you finish your edit.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, this is also another reason <i>not</i> to ask users to place their article titles in [[wikilink brackets]]; if the section's title contains brackets, the section IDs wind up mangled in such a way that IE and Firefox won't correctly place you back at that section after you finish an edit. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 18:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

He thinks (I hope I am paraphrasing correctly) that we should decline all submissions from registered users, and points-out a new reply template, {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_reguser_2e6e.html" title="Template:Afc reguser">afc reguser</a>}}, that exists for just this purpose. I presume the template's creators agree, but I do not.</p>
<p>Well over ninety percent of what comes into AfC is not suitable for Wikipedia. For just the reasons that anonymous page creation was disallowed and this service created, we are <i><b>lucky</b></i> if registered users submit their crap here instead of creating new articles. It is a bit sinister, I know, but this is one tremendous practical benefit of this page. In the past, there was even some discussion of encouraging all new users to use AFC as a filter.</p>
<p>That's one reason. The other is that when the rare article-worthy submission does come along, we should make sure it is created, no matter who submitted it. In all of my time at AfC, there has not been a registered user who habitually uses AFC. In other words, they all leave the project, figure it out, or are told within a very short time. A comment in the accept response is just as effective at educating these inexperienced users as a declination. A note on their talk page is even better.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that we get rid of this template altogether. When used on poor submissions, it encourages something we don't want and neglects to give constructive criticism; when used on good submissions, there is a chance that it will not be seen or heeded, and that the quality article will never be created. Creating the article and educating the user is the way to go. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 23:31, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linking AfC title</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I think it would be better if the titles of proposed pages were linked, but as noted above there were prblems with inexperienced users incorrectly placing the [[ ]]'s. I was wondering if there was a way to put into the link which users use to propose a new page some text which makes [[Insert page name here]] appear in the subject bar. I couldn't find a way to do this (in the very limited time I spent searching), but I had another idea: It is not compulsory to use the subject box to make a headline, so if the template included in the body of the request were to be changed to have the page title, as a level 2 headline, included in it, with instructions, the request would appear properly and with a link. To see what I mean, go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Martinp23/afc&amp;action=edit&amp;preload=User:Martinp23/afc&amp;section=new" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Martinp23/afc&amp;action=edit&amp;preload=User:Martinp23/afc&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (on my user namespace to leave a message on a test talk page. To see the code itself, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_afc_d53d.html" title="User:Martinp23/afc">go here</a>. Is it worth including do you think - I'm aware of not making it too complicated, so I've tried to make the headline stand out and provide clear instructions.

<dd>I think that unfortunately there's a couple potential issues with this idea. 1/ It's something else in the already-cluttered text box, which could just confuse things even further. 2/ It means that if somebody fills out the top header, and then fills out the instructions in the textbox, we end up with 2 headers on each section, which will just make things very jumbled on the page. 3/ As somebody else mentioned above, having the header as a link confuses Firefox and makes it a lot more work to markup long pages one section at a time, because it prevents Firefox from jumping back down to the section you last editted. So all in all, I think it's a lot of extra potential confusion for a fairly small benefit (that's of even less benefit to those of us using Firefox, since it just makes our lives harder). --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 13:02, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Splitting up the AfC instructions differently</span></h2>
<p>Currently, our great-looking instruction boxes at the top of the AfC page have the "how to submit your article" instructions on the left, and the "how to review articles" instructions on the right.</p>
<p>From looking at the AfC queue over the last few days, it looks to me like we have two distinct audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newbies. These are people who use the AfC mechanism because they get herded towards it when they try to create an article. They sometimes have good ideas, but they have very little understanding of Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Experienced anonymous users. These are people who understand perfectly well how Wikipedia works, and can write elaborate articles, but they prefer to remain anonymous when they create their articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the two audiences need different instructions.</p>
<p>The newbies need extremely simple directions: "Click here. Write the name of your article here. Write your article here. Write your source here. Click the save button." For these users, every extra concept that we add to the directions could be counterproductive, because it could draw their attention away from the really important stuff that they need to understand. For example, the current Step 5 in the creation instructions, which talks about stub templates, probably flies about 30 feet (10 meters) over these users' heads, and just distracts them from the important stuff in the earlier steps.</p>
<p>The experienced anonymous users can handle more complicated instructions, and there are a number of extra things that we could and should tell them in order to make our lives easier, like "If you include stub templates and category references, please comment them out," and "Please use '===' rather than '==' for your subject headers."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think the instructions for reviewers should be rewritten and expanded a bit as well, to better reflect our practices. (As an obvious example, they currently give little attention to how to correctly <i>decline</i> an article.)</p>
<p>So here's what I would suggest we do (I'll try to draw up a mockup tonight): Rather than putting article-creation instructions on the left and article-review instructions on the right, we instead put newbie-level article-creation instructions in a box of their own. Then, below that, in the current two-column box, we put the information meant for more experienced users -- the advanced-level article-creation tips on the left, and the article-review instructions on the right. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 20:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Just beware of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_Creep" class="extiw" title="meta:Instruction_Creep">Instruction Creep</a>. Instruction Creep is bad. Remember that the longer the instructions are, the more likely that the user will not read any of them. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 04:06, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd like to echo and amplify this. Two sets of submitter instructions sounds like a very bad idea to me. I do agree, though, that the existing instructions may already be too complicated for many. I propose just simplifying them; take out the "no stubs" step, for example. Let's have just the newbie instructions. There aren't nearly as many experienced submitters as you think – most are just matching patterns and emulating existing articles. Instructing them not to use stubs or == headlines, will decrease the effect of the critical instructions (notability, copyright, sources).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, regarding the reviewer instructions, rewriting them is fine, but I strongly suggest that they not be moved from the top of the page. In the months before they were moved there, I spoke to many editors who said they could not find them and as a result made critical mistakes. If anything, they should be simplified too, if you ask me, though it is not nearly the priority it is for the other side. The essential points are <b>a)</b> <i>credit the submitter when creating an article</i> and <b>b)</b> <i>remove copyvios</i>. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 10:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've done a rewrite of the top of the page that I hope reflects everyone's consensus. It keeps the current structure (submission instructions on the left, review instructions on the right), but separates the advanced-level submission instructions into a separate area below the "Click here to start" link. It also revises the review instructions a bit to reflect our current practices; hopefully I haven't fallen victim to instruction creep here.

<dd>My pleasure! Just take a look at how many times I've posted with an edit summary of "formatting"... that generally means changing header levels.

<dd>Just as an aside, in the case of a multi-section article, I usually don't bother changing the header levels; I just add the decline template and the {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_b_20e0.html" title="Template:Afc b">afc b</a>}} to the bottom section, then add the {{<a href="../../../a/f/c/Template%7EAfc_top_6a9e.html" title="Template:Afc top">afc top</a>}} to the top section. It momentarily causes a minor glitch in the page display, but it's so much faster than editing every section in a long article that I think it's worth it. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 23:20, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For that matter, in the USA it's still September 3. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:41, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The submissions come in at a tremendous rate; <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_Today_51a1.html" title="WP:AFC/Today">WP:AFC/Today</a> is archived every 24 hours in order to keep it at a functional size.

<p>The easy answer is that the date of the archive is the date when the archive is made. The reason for this is that is much easier for the bot that makes the archive to slap down today's date on it when making it. Therefore, the archive made on and dated 4 Sept will contain submissions from 3 Sept. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 04:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Idea -- a wizard</span></h2>
<p>I've been noodling about some ideas on how to make the AFC more "newbie friendly". I've often said that bombarding users who haven't even created a username with a ton of rules, guidelines, etc is a great way for them not to read of any of it. I still believe that is true. Some of the recent changes to AFC's main page has certainly helped, but I had an idea on how go one step further -- a series of small pages that guide the user through the process, asking a few questions (answered by clicking Wiki-links) to narrow down the kind of article they plan on writing and presenting only the notability information they need to know. I might just put a few pages together as a proof of concept. If they don't work out, I'm sure I can talk Meegs into speedy deleting them for me since I'm mopless. Any thoughts?&#160;:)&#160;:) <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 07:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I understand that sometimes the tag itself is the reason the article was declined but that should be clear from the discussion and not the tag itself. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:01, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely agree with you Martin. The AFC page is flagged as having a backlog, and I think that clearing that tag counts as dealing with the backlog. That request was rejected, it will never exist in that form, therefore it should be detagged. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisfow_9c03.html" title="User:Chrisfow">Chrisfow</a> 18:07, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I removed it now. That backlog is hard enough to work through as it is&#160;;) One more down, too many to go yet... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 18:24, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marking backlog pages as completed</span></h2>
<p>Am I supposed to do this? Is there anyway to do it? In the list of backlog pages for AfC, some say completed after the page title in the summary list... I've just closed the last article on a backlog page, but can't seem to find a way to now mark it as completed... Any suggestions? Thanks! <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 21:50, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not quite sure about this. I am not working on the AfC but on the backlog at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_which_may_contain_original_research_471f.html" title="Category:Articles which may contain original research">Category:Articles which may contain original research</a> which seems to work different. Also I am a bit new at this but what I do is I inspect every page on the backlog and see what I can do to either resolve the issue myself or motivate the editors to work towards having the {{<a href="../../../o/r/i/Template%7EOriginalResearch_5c79.html" title="Template:OriginalResearch">originalresearch</a>}} tag removed. The reason I was interested in the AfC archive was because sometimes the tag gets stuck on the proposed articles and aren't deleted when the request is denied. Well, it happened on that one article anyway and I wanted to be sure of how to deal with it. But basically judging from the response I got it seems like it would be a good idea if you remove such tags when patrolling the AfC backlog so the tags don't clutter up the other backlogs. Happy editing and thanks for the help! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 22:06, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Can't you just choose edit at the top of the page and edit it like any other page? Seems like what everyone else is doing. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 22:23, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How bizarre - there wasn't an edit button (it looked like a watchlist, for example), it just had a "special page" tab. Now I've gone in again it can be edited. Must have found some other way of listing the backlog last time.

<p>RTS Can someone edit the RTS table for me, I saved the page but forgot to get a preview.</p>
