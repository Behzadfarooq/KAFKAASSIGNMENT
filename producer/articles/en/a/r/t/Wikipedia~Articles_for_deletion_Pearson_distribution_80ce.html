<dd>Could I ask that people doing cleanup--whose work I greatly appreciate--please avoid using the VfD process on subjects of which they do not know enough to evaluate an article?

<dd>At present the article says nothing about what the Pearson distribution looks like, but it is better than the last version which was a substub stating little else than the fact that it was a distribution.

<dd>Well the original was "The Personal Distribution is a Probability Distribution. It can be varied in many ways. There are a number of types." It's not much, but it's unquestionably a valid stub. This article should not have been nominated. It might have been better to pop a math-stub tag on it--and correct "Personal" to "Pearson", of course. VfD should never be used as a substitute for cleanup. Although it's very tempting because you get these dramatic death-bed cleanups, it's too risky a process and we've lost a lot of reasonable stubs because nobody on VfD that week happened to know the subject well enough to do cleanup or even assess the stub's value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 08:01, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your comment delves into the controversial aspects of immediatism vs. eventualism. The question of whether substubs should be kept and expanded, or just deleted until someone cares to make an article with more content is open to debate. My view on it was that "it can be varied in many ways" and "there are many types" didn't really say much, and that the article in that form was not useful. All distribution functions I have seen can be varied in some way or another. The rewrite is a bit better (that's why I voted to keep it), although I still miss a formula defining it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 08:10, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My comment delves into nothing else but Wikipedia policy. We do not delete reasonable stubs (and what we see in the history is a reasonable stub) on subjects with encyclopedic potential. A family of statistical distributions has <i>de facto</i> encyclopedic potential. This article should never have been listed. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 10:41, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, I cleaned up the article a bit. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pearson_distribution&amp;diff=12922539&amp;oldid=12908960" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pearson_distribution&amp;diff=12922539&amp;oldid=12908960" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Unfortunately, I am no math expert. So I am not sure if the article should include all of the types in the family of the Pearson Distributions <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonSystem.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonSystem.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonTypeIIIDistribution.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonTypeIIIDistribution.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonTypeIVDistribution.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PearsonTypeIVDistribution.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

I added the probability density function of the Pearson type III distribution to <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearson_distribution.html" title="Pearson distribution">Pearson distribution</a>, which can be found in <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramowitz_and_Stegun_930b.html" title="Abramowitz and Stegun">Abramowitz and Stegun</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As Doc Glasgow has said, it has been entirely changed from the original. However, even as "borderline jibberish", does it merit a VfD, rather than a vote for a tidy up?
