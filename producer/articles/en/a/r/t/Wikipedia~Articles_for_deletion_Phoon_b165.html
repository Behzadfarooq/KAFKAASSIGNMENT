</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I am enthusiastic about learning how to produce a viable article. Admittedly I do not fully understand, but in this case I wish to provide an excellent definition/article. Though the site (www.phoons.com) is indeed "minor" it was once a Yahoo! Pick of the Week, has been written up in international newspapers, magazines, etc. and has attracted viewers from all over the world.<br />
<b>Significantly</b> a simple image search on search engines reveals people posting this pose and referring to it as a phoon. There ought to be a location where people can get an explanation as to the origins of the naming of the pose. I don't think many of the people using the term even understand why they are calling it that. As to "multiple languages" eliciting an "ROFL" -- which seems inappropriate -- Volunteers from several countries have put in significant hours of their own time making the site accessible to others. It is not a commercial site, is maintained solely by its creator, and grows by submissions from others, like the Mirror Project, or others.<br />
How does this differ from <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>? This word "stuck." <b>All</b> words are invented. If you can list an article on the uncertain origins of the word <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">shit</a> which garners increasing worldwide use and understanding, adding Phoon with an absolutely certain and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verfiable.html" title="Verfiable">verfiable</a> origin (and not <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a> as erroneously asserted above), and widespread use should not be an issue. --David R. Darrrow drdarrow <small>— Drdarrow (<a href="../../../d/r/d/User_talk%7EDrdarrow_4c09.html" title="User talk:Drdarrow">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Drdarrow_6b6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Drdarrow">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>
<dd>Guilty as charged, (so far)... However, I am very interested in contributing to other articles. I think Wiki is a fascinating tool and phenomenon, and would enjoy being an ongoing contributor. Hang in there with me.</dd>

<li><b>Worth your considering?</b> ...Regarding "I am still less than convinced of its notability, as it seems to be documented on one minor website that collects photos of this pose," can't the same be said about "geocaching"? It's fully described on its own website, so "why mention it in a wiki page?" While geocaching is a far greater phenomenon, still, not everyone has heard about it. It is, likewise, a made-up word. Yet, it is wiki-worthy as a current phenomenon.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I'm the author of the <a href="http://www.phoons.com" class="external text" title="http://www.phoons.com" rel="nofollow">phoons.com</a> site; my brother initiated the wiki page that started this discussion; that was his own choice. He noted I might want to chime in with additional thoughts. My guess is that the proposed deletions here have more to do with those individuals disliking and wanting to distance themselves from the idea of phooning. That's completely fair to dislike phooning. However, I'm thinking that disliking some phenomenon is not reason to delete it from the wiki. (I don't get why there are wiki pages dedicated to TV cartoons for elementary school kids, for example, but who am I to say it shouldn't be there?)</li>
<li>Just two days ago, a guy named Zack wrote to me out of the blue and ask why "Phoon" was <i>not</i> in the wiki. Adults are interested in this topic, too.</li>
<li>By the way, to get a sense of how "phooning" has crept around the world, search <b>Flickr</b> for the tag '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phoon" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phoon" rel="nofollow">phoon</a>' or '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phooning" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=phooning" rel="nofollow">phooning</a>'. Search blogsearch.google.com for <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phoon&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" class="external text" title="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phoon&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" rel="nofollow">phoon</a>, <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phoons&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" class="external text" title="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phoons&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" rel="nofollow">phoons</a>, <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phooned&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" class="external text" title="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phooned&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" rel="nofollow">phooned</a>, and <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phooning&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" class="external text" title="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=phooning&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs" rel="nofollow">phooning</a>.</li>
<li>Search <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=phoon&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=phoon&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">Google Images</a> category.</li>
<li>An argument was made that there is a minor website collecting photos of the poses. Yet if you scan the 'net as I suggested, you'll find that it is the <i><b>primary</b></i> collection, while others maintain their own collections (some large, one in Norway, one in Italy, and others small (individual Flickr accounts)).</li>
<li>Lastly, I recommend visiting phoons.com and selecting any picture AND observing the category names at the bottom of the picture page. Follow a category of interest and I think you will understand why other viewers have been drawn in and why the word 'phoon' now sticks in their head...<b>and</b> why Phoon is thus worth considering as viable.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if some editors, including the original author, like the sound of the word, it is still a wholly non-notable and nonsensical neologism.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:17, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">User:Anthony.bradbury</a>. Seems to be a neologism, and not necessarily the best term for that pose. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Perhaps it is a neogolism, but whether it is a coined term, one that few if any of the comments/voters above have ever heard, is not inconsequential. In the minds of many (see links in John Darrow's paragraphs above) it is a word <i>describing</i> the specific pose. The purpose, depite A Rubin's objection, is <i>not</i> to give a name to the pose, rather to give a definition and origin of the word/sound which has, internationally, attached itself to that pose. It is not the claim of the author or his brother that the pose was invented by him, rather that the word was, and has a noteworthy origin, and that this resource recognizes it. <b>Argument</b>: <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleenex.html" title="Kleenex">Kleenex</a> did not invent the facial tissue, but because of advertising and brand recognition has in the minds of most English-speaking people <i>become</i> the word for <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_tissue.html" title="Facial tissue">facial tissue</a>. --drdarrow 22:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Phoon appears to be well-known enough to have its own Wiki Page. I find the anti-Phoon sentiments on the previous comments to be curious. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.35.226.228 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.35.226.228.html" title="User talk:66.35.226.228">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.35.226.228_9ab9.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.35.226.228">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I find this whole phooning business to be entertaining, and I will probably try out the pose for my next photoshoot... but there is no verifiable notability in the article. Please find references to significant publications discussing phooning and include them as inline citations within the article and voila, you will have yourself a wikipedia article.
