<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate source of information. Fails to point out notability; it's just a shopping mall. Are we going to give every mall an article?

<li><b><s>Delete</s>Keep</b> If it were notable it would be easy to source. There would be published articles on the notable aspects.

<dd>I count seventeen newspaper hits in a database search, so I'd say it meets the first one.

Thirdly, guidelines are not laws, which is why I'm making a case for why I believe the article should be kept on its merits. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 08:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Roselands is over 40 years old, was Australia's first large shopping centre of its type, was the largest in the southern hemisphere for many years, had Australia's first "food court", and we have a wonderful old image in Commons. There was a lot of text about it in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Bros._ce45.html" title="Grace Bros.">Grace Bros.</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roselands%2C_New_South_Wales_fae2.html" title="Roselands, New South Wales">Roselands, New South Wales</a>, so maybe this article was previously merged? Anyway, I've added the above to hopefully shore up its notability a bit. I have to agree with Rebecca... the article was a bit of a mess, but I think Wikipedia stands to miss out on a lot of interesting historical information if articles like this are constantly merged and deleted under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or G11 or whatever, rather than people cleaning up or researching. <s>PS. is that ballot warning really necessary or justified? (I've removed it).</s> --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 12:32, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Encyclopaedias are not for "interesting". Encyclopaedias are for "<i>notable</i>". There are things which may very well be interesting, but that are not notable, and hence do not belong on Wikipedia. And notability must be <i>referenced</i>, not vouched for, so (according to guidelines) <i>multiple</i>, <i>independent</i>, <i>non-trivial</i> references are needed to establish notability for this shopping centre. Can anyone provide them? --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 18:50, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Canley has given you five very good reasons why it is notable, including at least one that should be indisputable (largest in the Southern Hemisphere for a long period). There is a very clear difference between believing that something that should be deleted and making a logical case for it and simply being querulous, and you're well and truly in the second category at the moment. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 23:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) I <i>have</i> provided "multiple" (2), "independent" (local govt and trade association) and "non-trivial" (see previous) references, and that's just online ones. So what's the problem? I don't think "all shopping malls should be kept", and I don't think they should "all be deleted or merged". I think this one, as is stated in the intro, is verifiably notable (historically, culturally and commercially) on its own merits, and these are backed up by the references.</dd>

<dd>The two references you brought forth following the nomination indeed combine to back up a specific claim, that this has been the largest austral shopping centre for a period of time, and that may be reason enough to keep the article indeed. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 10:57, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think Canley and Rebecca have already established notability for this, but can I ask how this is a "corporation" as established under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>? Surely <a href="../../../p/l/a/Wikipedia%7EPlaces_of_local_interest_4265.html" title="Wikipedia:Places of local interest">Wikipedia:Places_of_local_interest</a> would be a more appropriate category (although it is more than "local" interest, as it was the biggest shopping centre in Australia for a long time...) <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 13:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I concur on notability. As for your question, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria apply to economic entities in general (don't be fooled by the abbreviated page name), including malls. As for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Wikipedia%7EPlaces_of_local_interest_4265.html" title="Wikipedia:Places of local interest">Wikipedia:Places_of_local_interest</a>, that is a "how to" on creating and maintaining pages for locally relevant entities; it is not concerned with notability, and contains no notability criteria. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 16:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
