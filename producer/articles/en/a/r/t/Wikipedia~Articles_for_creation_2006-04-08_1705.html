<p>Haddadin (or Haddadeen) is the name of an Arab Christian tribe originally from the southern part of greater Syria (what is known now as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan). The tribe claims to originate from Yemen. Elders of the tribe claim that the name is related to the city of Al-Hudaydah in Yemen, where the tribe comes from. Some claim that the origin is related to the root Haddad which means Judge in classical Arabic. For many centuries the tribe lived in Shobak, and then Kerak. Some historic sources indicate that the first Arab resistance against the first Crusades came from the Haddadin tribe. Late 19th century part of the tribe moved from Kerak a city in southern Syria to Ma'in a city in the land of Balqa (middle of Jordan). Many Arab Christians in Jordan, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon claim to be originated from the Haddadin tribe. Palestinians originating from the city of Ramallah and Syrians originating from the city of Safita claim to be originating from this tribe. The tribe belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church until about 1900 when one of its leaders converted to join the Greek Catholic Church. The tribe was active in the public life of modern Jordan.

<p>Shevington Sharks play their home games at John Rigby College and train at Shevington High School each Tuesday and Thursday at 7.00pm. they would dearly love to play their games in the Standish/Shevington area but quite simply there are no pitches for open age rugby league. Shevington Sharks ARLFC are a local club who represent not only Shevington but Standish and the surrounding area also, and a vast majority of otheir players/members are actually from Standish. They are also currently looking at setting up a junior section and have one of their coaches in touch with all the local schools which culminated in a festival of rugby in June taking place. All the junior schools in the Standish area took place in what turned out to be a great day.</p>

<p>Jewbu (somtimes spelled Jewboo) is a portmanteau word that combines "Jew" and "Buddhist." It is not considered pejorative or politically incorrect. The official definition is, "a Buddhist of Jewish descent who wishes to form a synthesis or reconciliation between their newfound Buddhist spirituality and the Jewish tradition in which they were raised." In casual discourse the term often includes Jews with a superficial interest in Buddhist spirituality or culture.</p>
<p>First recorded instance: Klinkenborg, Verlyn. <i>The New York Tmes Book Review</i>. July 24, 1994.</p>
<p>A recent study in the United States revealed that Buddhism recruits the highest number of followers from young Jewish Americans.</p>

<p>Alden Park is a historic apartment complex in the East Falls region of Philadelphia, PA. It is situated in a very peaceful location of the city only blocks from Fairmount Park. There has been construction going to improve the building for the past year, which makes it very hard to sleep past 8AM on the weekdays. It is not uncommon to wake up to the sound of a jackhammer and the sight of a construction worker outside your window.</p>

<p>This applies to all sensory modes however the current empirical research has focused solely on the Visual and Auditory modalities. These studies they found that during the mind would have enhanced recall when a presentation included both auditory and visual sensory modes Vs. Visual only.</p>

<p><b>Newism</b> Ok, this “Art Movement is the most significant of the end of the 20th Century”, Max Doerner cited and predicted it in his book of 1933 “The Materials of the Artist and Their Use in Painting” ( the use of Synthetic Resins as mediums for artists in the future…). This Art Movement it is called: NEWISM. This Movement is a result of the use of a new and a revolutionary medium called Plastic Paint Medium, which was created by a Cuban Contemporary Artist: Josignacio in 1984 in Havana, Cuba. This technique consist in the use of epoxy resins as agglutinating medium and pigments as colorants, obtaining as a result, a real plastic finish with a totally new visual effect called for the first time in 1985 Newism by Cuban Art critic Leonel Lopez-Nussa and has been followed by the critic and art students all over.</p>
<p>In 1996, in the Museum of Art of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, one of Josignacio’s artworks : “3 O’clock”, was awarded with The Best in Show price at the Hortt 38 Juried Art Show, the oldest and most prestigious annual show of Florida. Former director of Museum of Art, Dr. Kenworth W. Moffett called this technique: "This new technique is the result of the marriage of art and technology", and renowned Cuban intellectual Dr.Jose A. Portuondo said: “Josignacio is the artistic representative of the Plastic Era”,</p>
<p>“This Plastic Paint Medium is a real revolution in the painters technique field, and the new visual effect that it is derived is, no doubt about it, A new and a very important School, named New Ism, Plastic Ism or whatever you want to name it, it does not matter…..”. Dr. Roberto J. Cayuso (art critic and publisher).</p>
<p>In early 80’s in Connecticut and New York also appears a group of painters called “The New New Painters”, which began to work with a new kind of experimental new acrylic painting, obtaining similar visual effects to the ones of Josignacio. Today there is a place located in Toronto's Queen West Gallery District, the Museum of New New Painting and this is the first centre devoted to the exhibition and study of this controversial art movement. The aim of the museum is to create a space that is open to all, where the New New painters can be studied and discussed. Original pieces are on view, and a library of books and catalogues has been assembled, documenting the history of the movement.</p>
<p>The New New Painters group are: Lucy Baker, Steve Brent, Joseph Drapell, John Gittins, Thomas Fertig, Roy Lerner, Gruters, Marjorie Minkin, Graham Peacock, Irene Neal, Bruce Piermarini, Jerald Webster.</p>
<p>Please take notice that this could be called the biggest change in the medium of Western Painting since oil replaced tempera in the early 16th century, most of the technical innovations have been made by the American paint maker Sam Golden, and his son, Mark.</p>
<p>1-Key dates when the art movement was active: The NEWISM was born in 1984. 2-Geographical information: La Habana, Cuba in 1984. 3- Characteristics for which the art movement is best known: The use of innovative painting mediums such as Plastic Paint Medium, a new real visual effect. 4-Key artists linked with the movement: Josignacio, Lucy Baker, Graham Peacock, Roy Lerner, Joseph Drapell 5- Other relevant information: This also has been a movement in North America and Canada since the early 80’s called The New New Pinters.</p>

<p>Walt Disney Classics is a series of videos created in 1984 by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_Home_Entertainment_1be1.html" title="Walt Disney Home Entertainment">Walt Disney Home Entertainment</a> to release animated Disney features to video because of the large demand at the time.</p>
<p>The released 22 animated Disney features to video from 1984 to 1994 (up to 1998 in Europe and Japan), starting with <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbo.html" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a> in October 1984. The line officially started in the {United Kingdom|U.K]] in July 1985 with this release and the video premiere of <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio_%281940_film%29.html" title="Pinocchio (1940 film)">Pinocchio</a>, which was also out in the US and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>Who Are the New Orleans Blaze?</p>
<p>Well, the Blaze is a women's full-contact, semi-professional football team; one of the first in Louisiana. The Blaze is a licensed team with the National Women's Football Association (NWFA). The league was formed in 2000 by Catherine Masters, CEO/President, in Nashville, TN. The league started with two teams, and in the 2006 season there will be 40 teams across the country. Also in the 2006 season, the leagur will be looking forward to fulfilling arrangements with The Football Network, Google Videos, and some motion picture deals in Hollywood. The 2005 Championship Game drew over 5,000 fans to the University of Louisville Venue. The Blaze are proud to have been in the play-offs for their 2005 efforts.</p>
<p>TheBlasze hve been in the league for four years, previously operating under another name. The team was featured by the league as most improved franchise in 2004, when the new owners took control of the team. The team has been featured in The Times-Picayune, Fox 8 News with Patrick Evans, and Cox Metro Sports hosted by Darryl Green. The team has also shown their presence on Disney Radio, KKND, 106.7, and co-hosted on SUNY 106.1.</p>
<p>The season begins for the team in November, with conditioning, training, and mini-camps. The Blaze play four home games and four away games in a regular season.</p>
<p>The Blaze have held many members of the league all-star team in the past two years, including Lisa Lunsford (linebacker), Rontashala Williams (running back), and Chris Zboril (quarterback). These players stats put them above the rest of their peers in the league.</p>
<p>The team will be on hiatus in the 2006 season, playing only two exhibition games, due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
