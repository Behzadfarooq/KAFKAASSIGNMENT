<li><b>Delete</b> - I know some folks don't care for the use of the word "cruft" in discussing articles to delete, bu this is cruft. A list of various superhero franchises by how long, if all filmed components of the franchise were run start to finish, it would last. Thoroughly unencyclopedic, and any bits of data that might actually be useful (like the number of episodes in a series) should be included in the articles on the series themselves. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - 'Cruft' is not a wikipedia policy, nor is the fact that a single editor finds the information useless a reason to delete. Certain readers may well find it interesting and informative to compare the depth of several canons. (After all, why is number of episodes so clearly more useful? Long 1 hour per episode series cannot be compared to a series consisting of 10 minute shorts. From internet downloading to buying dvds, and given multi-episode arcs, episode number has little meaning after original broadcast, whereas total length does.) The info is verifiable, and besides, has passed AfD before (see first nom on the scifi listing). Nothing has changed to warrant reopening that decision.--<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 01:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The nomination for the scifi one is mis-linked on that article. This afd should also be merged with the other similar one (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series_bd53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lengths of fantasy film and television series">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lengths_of_fantasy_film_and_television_series</a>), since the issues involved are the same. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 01:08, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>BBC News is completely independent from BBC Drama, and is, I believe, forbidden by its Charter from giving its own programmes preferential treatment in news coverage.

See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_longest_running_U.S._television_series_77ff.html" title="List of longest running U.S. television series">List of longest running U.S. television series</a> for how "longest running" is used in the industry context.

<li>As further comment, there doesn't seem to be any real criteria for what material is counted toward these "total running lengths". While the disinclusion of Corman's 1994 ashcan <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fantastic_Four_%28film%29_5900.html" title="The Fantastic Four (film)">Fantastic Four</a> is perhaps justifiable, the Superman listing is missing substantial material, including any of the animated material (the 17 <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281940s_cartoons%29.html" title="Superman (1940s cartoons)">Fleischer cartoons</a>, the 68 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_%28TV_series%29_6332.html" title="The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)">New Adventures of Superman</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281988_TV_series%29_6aa7.html" title="Superman (1988 TV series)">1988 series</a> or the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">1996 series</a>) as well as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%28serial%29.html" title="Superman (serial)">1948</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_Man_vs._Superman_1fb1.html" title="Atom Man vs. Superman">1950</a> serials or the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_and_the_Mole_Men_967b.html" title="Superman and the Mole Men">first theatrical feature</a>. As further evidence of the difficulties involved with actually computing running time, that first theatrical release was re-cut as the pilot for the first TV series, which is counted. Should the movie be counted separately? The Batman material suffers from similar arbitrary standards of inclusion (missing, for example, the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legends_of_the_Superheroes_dca8.html" title="Legends of the Superheroes">Hanna-Barbera live-action specials</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28serial%29.html" title="Batman (serial)">1943</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_%28serial%29_1831.html" title="Batman and Robin (serial)">1949</a> serials and several animated runs). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:40, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>However</b>, this isn't something that I can fix by editing. The problem is that I can see no way to come up with a total runtime number without resorting to original research. So many of these sources exist in versions with different lengths, that an effort to list all the possible totals would itself approach article length for some of these franchises. Let's look at Superman. <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_and_the_Mole_Men_967b.html" title="Superman and the Mole Men">Superman and the Mole Men</a></i> had a 58 minute runtime. It was recut and retitled into two 26 minute TV episodes. Do we count 58 minutes, 52 minutes, or 110 minutes? The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281978_film%29.html" title="Superman (1978 film)">1978 film</a> had a 143 minute theatrical release, a 188 minute International Edit, a 182 minute ABC television broadcast, a 151 minute DVD cut, and a 127 minute VHS/Laserdisk compressed version. Then there is <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_II_cbf4.html" title="Superman II">Superman II</a></i>. Do we add 127 minutes for the original release, 151 minutes for the television premiere, 144 for the ABC recut of the television premiere, 116 minutes for the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman_II%7E_The_Richard_Donner_Cut_0e82.html" title="Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut">2006 official studio recut</a>, or some combination of those values. Now our total -- from just three movies! -- might be 295, 301, 306, 311, 312, 317, 319, 322, 323, 325, 328, 329, 330, 336, 339, 345, 346, 347, 350, 352, 353, 354, 356, 360, 361, 362, 364, 367, 369, 373, 377, 378, 380, 381, 384, 385, 388, 390, 391, 397, 404, 405, 408, 412, 414, 419, 425, 436, 442, 443, 449, or more if we count the Donner cut as a separate movie from the Lester film. When we add the 68 6-minute <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_%28TV_series%29_6332.html" title="The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)">New Adventures of Superman</a></i>, do we just add 408 minutes?. They were not broadcast as standalone programs. 36 of them bookended <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Superboy_5267.html" title="The Adventures of Superboy">The Adventures of Superboy</a></i> short in the <i>New Adventures of Superman</i> program, while the rest were broadcast along with non-Superman material in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Superman_Aquaman_Hour_of_Adventure_46bc.html" title="The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure">The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_Superman_Hour_a87c.html" title="The Batman/Superman Hour">The Batman/Superman Hour</a></i>. Does the entire runtime of these programs count? If not, do the Superboy shorts from the first season count as Superman content anyway? What about material that includes Superman alongside other characters? <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Friends_75d8.html" title="Super Friends">Super Friends</a></i>? <i>Nearly every</i> franchise has this problem. Without a means to reconcile it, I cannot envision a way to assemble these articles in compliance with WP policy. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:23, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seems fixable to me. I would include either the longest length or the length of the most widely available version, or the original version, or all three, depending on the circumstances. If I was unsure, I'd bring it up on the talk page, or just include it all with the proper annotations. You do not, however, total two presentations of the same material just with different cuts. It should only be included once in the total, even if you can get different totals depending on what cuts you use to create the sum. The same with your questions about the Superman animated material. If you're not sure it should be included, bring it up on the talk page, get the consensus of other editors as to the proper presentation of the information. To me, your arguments make for a good reason to present this information in the fullest and most complete manner possible, not a reason for deletion. Sure, you can get different numbers, but you can get different numbers talking about casualties of war, or the costs of natural disasters. Or even the census. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW, I felt I should add that your concerns are also going to apply to the articles of the material in question anyway. There is no doubt in my mind that articles on movies/tv shows should include run time information. This is information that's included on the box of the movie/television show. Yet there will be problems like you mention in the article itself. Thus your concern also applies there, and since it will have be resolved for those articles, I don't see it as a particular problem for this article either. Might be difficult at times, depending on the circumstances, but it can be done. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It refers only to specific classes of information that have already received consensus among editors to discriminate against inclusion. Statistical lists, however, are not currently included under that section of policy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, that being said, I do have some concerns about the list possibly having arbitrary inclusion criteria, since it says it includes "popular" shows and films. It seems likely that there are numerous other shows that <i>should</i> be included, but aren't (eg where are all the Spiderman shows? Flash?). Not to mention that I'm not sure why the list is focussed narrowly on superheroes to begin with. Why superheros and not "sci-fi/fantasy"?</dd>
<dd>I'm also concerned about upkeep of this list. It seems to me this information is only useful if it can be kept current. But the current list is only as of May 26, 2006. So it appears that noone is updating the list, and even if someone <i>does</i> update it that's no guarantee editors will keep updating it over and over regularly every week (as would be necessary to keep the information accurate.</dd>
<dd>So even if you assume the information might be <i>useful</i>, it looks like the list has somewhat arbitrary rules for inclusion, is oddly framed as just a list for superheros, and can only be kept useful by constant, regular editorial updates. Sounds to me like a recipe for problems - I unfortunately recommend deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to reply to Josiah and Otto -</dd>
<dd>Otto, sorry we aren't seeing eye to eye since, if I recall correctly, we usually go the same way on afd/cfd. Guess we can't agree all the time, eh? Either way, feel free to post your comments on the WP:NOT talk page where there are a couple of discussion threads on the topic of just how broadly to interpret WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE. I've made similar arguments there that I did here, and it is an interesting policy topic in general beyond just this article.</dd>
<dd>Josiah, normally I'd agree that it's better to improve an article than delete it. However, my concern is that this particular type of article is only useful if it is intentionally and regularly updated. "Incompleteness" isn't a deletion criterion, but articles and categories do get deleted on occasion if they are determined to be too difficult to <i>properly</i> maintain or their information is determined to be inaccurate or misleading. In this case, the list in question hasn't been kept properly up to date, having sat for a year with no updates at all. I'd be more inclined to recommend Keep if I felt comfortable that the article could maintain its information in a timely and more complete fashion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to put it one more way, if I thought the maintainence problem was short term and could be fixed in a reasonable amount of time, I'd be ok with the article. But my concern is that the lack of maintainence is due to a long term, systemic problem with the list that probably can't or won't be corrected. But hey, if someone can prove me wrong, go for it! <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact that the superhero list hasn't been would therefore seem to be more a question of whether there are wikipedians with the interest and inclination than an intrinsic problem with this type of list.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'll try to stop responding to every posting, but I just thought of an alternative to deletion; the article could be <b>moved</b> to something like List of long-running science fiction film and television franchises (and, perhaps, List of long-running superhero film and television franchises) with the content restricted and focus altered accordingly.

<li><b>Delete</b> for two reasons: 1) <b>Notability</b> of show's running times has not been demonstrated by referencing "multiple, non-trivial 3rd-party reliable sources". One BBC and one Guardian source do not make a strong claim, not-to-mention the ambiguity of "longest running" as mentioned by an editor further up this page. That the Wikipedia article itself has been mentioned elsewhere is a <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self-refernce</a> and is not evidence of notability in the Wikipedia sense. 2) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">User:Serpent's Choice</a>'s frankly <i>bloody fantastic and well-considered argument</i> above illustrates exactly why these sorts of lists will forever have problems bordering on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> which can NEVER reasonably be fixed. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 13:01, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I still believe this could be a useful collection of information, and it's not, properly speaking, an "indiscriminate" collection. It does require cleanup. It's true that the facts can be found in various other articles, but I think there may be some value to collecting them in a single place for ease of comparison. That value admittedly seems rather limited to me (hence "weak" keep), but that's just me. Serpent's Choice presents the best argument for deletion, but I feel the key points could be addressed through consensus among the list maintainers -- in fact, by defining precisely what is included and how, they'll also be making the article less "indiscriminate." I doubt I'd shed many tears if it were deleted, but it seems worth a shot, considering. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 10:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is hardly crufty at all, useful list, not indiscriminate, certainly has a place on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Not paper!</a>) - too valuable to delete. <span style="font-style: Tahoma; font-size: 84%;"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></span> 01:20, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While a list of longest running insert-genre-here may have some worth, I think this in particular is too narrow a genre to offer a valuable or notable comparison.
