<dd>Comment: Agreed, it was over the top but a lot of editorial time is spent voting for deletions on articles that are written by the subject of the article. In general I believe if you have to write your own article you are not notable.

<li>This one's my fault. Various government agencies, including the <a href="http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/understanding/history/05_griffins_fed_cap_design.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/understanding/history/05_griffins_fed_cap_design.htm" rel="nofollow">National Capital Authority</a> use the 'Capitol' spelling. I checked the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/legis/cth/consol%5fact/pa1974120/s4.html?query=%22capital+hill%22" class="external text" title="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/legis/cth/consol%5fact/pa1974120/s4.html?query=%22capital+hill%22" rel="nofollow">Parliament Act 1974</a> and found I was wrong. I would however argue that there is enough confusion over the name to keep the article as a redirect and move the information about siting the new parliament to the correct article. It may be a good idea to refer to the confusion in the correct article. The confusion is widespread enugh that Hansard itself (although not the parliamentary website) uses 'Capitol Hill'. The main Canberra article and a number of others will also need correction. I also think there's a case for listing Capital Hill on the Capitol Hill disambiguation page. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol.html" title="Capitol">Capitol</a> is not a US spelling, but a separate word meaning legislative building. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgri_a5f5.html" title="User:Algri">Alan</a> 06:40, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't believe there is any confusion over the spelling of "Capital Hill". However, it could be mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Hill%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_bc2b.html" title="Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory">Capital Hill</a> article that Burley Griffins' design included a design for a "Capitol" building to situated on a "Capitol Hill". However, that aspect of his design as never enacted, and Kurrajong (the original name for the Hill) instead became Capital Hill and home for Parliament. It should also be noted that Burley Griffin was an <i>American</i>. As for the disambiguation page, a "for similar/other, see" header could be included, but Capital Hill shouldn't be listed. I agree a redirect should replace the article (which would be obligatory if merged).--<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/15px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="8" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie"><font color="green"><b>Cyberjunkie</b></font></a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie"><sup><b style="font-size:74%;"><font color="gold">TALK</font></b></sup></a> 07:42, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> As brought up on <a href="../../../i/n/e/Talk%7EIneedhits_50cc.html" title="Talk:Ineedhits">Talk:Ineedhits</a>, what is the minimum size to be included on WP? Where is the line between notability and non-notable start? IMO, the article isn't written as an advertisement so it can't be deleted as advertisement. Perhaps not in the style of wikipedia, but that doesn't merit deletion. From <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> I find this:
<dl>
<dd><i>Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. <b>Further all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable.</b> External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example).

<li>Since Hoary put this up for VFD and JamesBurns vote delete based on advertising, I ask you two what exactly is not third-party verifiable...or did you not attempt to verify it?

<li>I didn't attempt to verify it. Yes, it's probably all verifiable, and it doesn't obviously fail any acceptability criterion. Odd, though, that a company whose business is boosting other companies' hits has to wait for its boss to create its own article on WP. (Couldn't any of its customers, etc., have done this?) Certainly it's permissible, even praiseworthy, to write articles about the business one knows best; to demonstrate the absence of a desire to advertise, <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayCook_f1f5.html" title="User:ClayCook">ClayCook</a> may wish to write or contribute to an article about at least one of his company's rivals. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:58, 2005 Jun 26 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I've never heard of any of those restaurant chains, but perhaps that doesn't mean anything: I guess that they're US, that you're in the US, and that they haven't yet arrived in the part of the world where I happen to be -- which might well be lucky from an urban design PoV. I don't think I wrote "if it's notable enough then someone else would have written it". The institution whose LAN I am now using -- my employer -- didn't have its own article when I first looked, even though I was sure that it qualified; precisely because I work here, I didn't supply an article. I waited a bit, and then returned to find that other people had written it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:27, 2005 Jun 27 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are no unsigned comments here (yet). I think you may be confused by Cburnett's continuation of his comment (after a quotation from a policy page) in the form of a new list item. (This wasn't very elegant, but I can't think of a less inelegant solution.) Incidentally, while my gut feeling is of agreement with you, there's no rule that says bosses shouldn't create articles on their own companies, and also of course no rule that says people shouldn't subsequently edit bosses' articles in order to amend any perceived lack of objectivity. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:26, 2005 Jun 26 (UTC)

<li>Unsigned comments...did you even bother to read it? That said, there's no policies against bosses or employees creating an article about their company. It's big enough that I can't see how it's a "garage" company, so it's not advertisement. The only thing left is possible lack-of-objectivity, but that's not addressed by deleting it. <i><b>In fact, <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html#What_to_do_with_a_problem_page.2Fimage.2Fcategory" title="WP:DP">WP:DP#What to do with a problem page/image/category</a> specificially lists this as a reason not to delete</b></i>. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 14:51, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to admit, that's a better reason than the initial votes per advertisement. However, I have to question the use of "promote". <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/promote" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:promote">Wiktionary says</a>: <i>To attempt to popularize or sell a product by advertising or publicity.</i>. The article in question is no more of an attempt to popularize or publicize than the thousands of other articles about a company nor is it trying to sell a product (I see very little "market-ese" in it) and I think I've established (or more correctly: no one has countered it yet) that it's not an advertisement. And, for the record, I have zero ties to ineedhits: none. The only reason I'm arguing on it's behalf is that I don't see there's sufficient reason to delete it. I hate to generalize and exhaggerate (as I'm sure there are exceptions) but it seems that you have to be a multi-national corporation or have a 10-digit revenue to not be deleted as advertisement or self-promotion. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 18:49, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Reluctant Keep</b>: Cburnett, I am unable to find anywhere that Jimbo said that <i>all</i> an article needs is verifiability. In various places he's pushed notability, and nearly everywhere he's pushed NPOV. That is where this article <i>might</i> fail. You could possibly make an argument on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">advocacy</a>, but would have to balance that with the fact that Wiki is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">effectively infinite</a>. Also, saying that we should not have THIS article because other, better-known companies don't have one is fallacious, along the lines of "I'm not happy so no one should be happy." No one has made a valid Vfd argument for or against based on actual Wiki policies, so I see no strong reason to get rid of it. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnsinkable_392a.html" title="User:Unsinkable">Unsinkable</a> 28 June 2005 20:14 (UTC)

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The original version was a dictionary definition which had already been transwiki'd. According to the rules at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="meta:transwiki">meta:transwiki</a>, it was immediately eligible for deletion at that time. The article was subsequently rewritten into a disambiguation page for various organizations using the name "Envision". I note, however, that none of the listed entities has a Wikipedia article yet. Looking at the referenced sites, it is not obvious that they ever will get articles. Disambiguation pages are for the disambiguation of existing articles. Using them as a back door to requesting an article is discouraged.</p>
<p>I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one as a "delete" but without prejudice against re-creation if/when articles about two or more of these organizations <i>are</i> written.</p>
<p>Having said that I am calling this a "delete", I further note that the community concensus after transwiki's is shifting from deletion to the use of the new {{wi}} template. In deference to that emerging concensus, I am going to modify my decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 9 July 2005 04:21 (UTC)</p>
