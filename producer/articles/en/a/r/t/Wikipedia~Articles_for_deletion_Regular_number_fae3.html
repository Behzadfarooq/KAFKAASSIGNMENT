<li><b>Comment</b> why does its presence on Mathworld make it a "legitimate search term"? While Mathworld has its uses, the fact that it has all these articles giving silly definitions for concepts that mathematicians don't find useful or well-motivated is absolutely a bad thing.

<li><b>K33p</b>. This is CLEARLY a standard math term. No researcher uses it, e.g. no relevant hits on <a href="../../../m/a/t/MathSciNet_454d.html" title="MathSciNet">MathSciNet</a>, but IT'S IN MATHWORLD. It shouldn't even matter what sources MathWorld cites, or if they cite anything!!! We're talking about MATHWORLD here. And for those of you trying to smear MATHWORLD, let me point out that it is NOT a "self-published resource". The ONLINE version may be run by Wolfram who employs Eric Weisstein, editor in chief, and Weisstein himself writes many of the entries, but CRC PRESS, a fully <i>independent</i> entity and publisher, publishes the book form. Take that, Trovatore! Finally, we have <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/about/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>MathWorld continues to grow and evolve with the assistance of thousands of contributors. Careful oversight of all aspects of its content and interface by creator Eric Weisstein, and more recently with able assistance from MathWorld associate Ed Pegg, Jr., provides an exacting level of quality, accuracy, and consistency. As a result, MathWorld is considered not only the clearest and most readable online resource for mathematics, but also one of the most reliable.</p>

<li>This is certainly not a common usage in mathematics, as a bit of Googling for "regular number" shows.

<li><b>Comment</b> Following Septentrionalis' findings above, I came across <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/Recip.pdf" class="external text" title="http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/Recip.pdf" rel="nofollow">this document on Mesopotamian maths</a> (it's a PDF), that goes into more detail about "regular numbers" in its 2nd section (page 1). Importantly, the article generalises the definition of "regular numbers" beyond base 10 (whereas Mathworld talks only about decimals). If this WP article is to be kept, it would appear to me that the right thing to do would be to generalise the WP definition the same way for any base, or redirect to the appropriate existing article that does this job, if there is one (i.e., <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_expansion.html" title="Decimal expansion">decimal expansion</a> apparently wouldn't fit the bill here). --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 03:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_representation.html" title="Decimal representation">decimal representation</a>. No point generalising to other bases, as every rational number is "regular" in any base which is a multiple of the prime factors of its denominator, and no irrational number is "regular" in any base, so the generalisation simply duplicates the distinction between rationals and irrationals. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 11:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. We have to avoid generalizations, even if they are easy, unless they are well documented (because original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is not allowed). The paper on Mesopotamian math doesn't even have a reference to who uses the phrase <i>regular number</i>; it seems in that paper that the author is just using the phrase as a bit of local notation to help the exposition. You might think the author is trying to claim that <i>regular number</i> is a well known term, except that it isn't. I think nobody has exhibited a use of <i>regular number</i> as a defined term in a published monograph other than Mathworld. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 13:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Here's how it looks to me:
<ul>
<li>The link in the article's history to <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA">WP:MEA</a> suggests the article was, in fact, created specifically because a corresponding article existed on MathWorld. The MathWorld article, in turn, cites two entries from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and two books.
<ul>
<li>One OEIS entry (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117920" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A117920" rel="nofollow">A117920</a>) lists Weisstein as the author.</li>
<li>The other (<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A003592" class="external text" title="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A003592" rel="nofollow">A003592</a>) actually uses the term "terminating decimal". Both OEIS entries refer back to MathWorld.</li>
<li>The book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691099839" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691099839" rel="nofollow">Gamma: Exploring Euler's constant</a></i> is apparently cited to justify the term "finite decimal", and not "regular number", although it is ambiguous. But in fact, Amazon's "Search Inside This Book" feature does not find "regular number" in this book, while it does find "finite decimal" and "(non-)terminating decimal".
<ul>
<li>Checked my copy of Havil's <i>Gamma</i> and I can confirm he does <i>not</i> use the term "regular number". <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 08:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140080295" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140080295" rel="nofollow">Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers</a> is not cited in the context of the term, but of the interesting integer sequences. (Interesting? Well, if they say so.) Again, "Search Inside This Book" finds "finite decimal" and "(non-)terminating decimal" but not "regular number".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The links above to "regular number" above on this AfD seem to be something related, but quite different. In both places, a regular number is an <i>integer</i> of the form 2<sup>a</sup>3<sup>b</sup>5<sup>c</sup>. It does not apply to arbitrary rational (or real) numbers at all, it has to do with ancient mathematical practice. They do not however appear to be local notation, as suggested above, because in fact they both cite:
<ul>
<li>Papers by A. Sachs from the <i>Journal of Cuneiform Studies</i>&#160;: "Babylonian mathematical texts I: reciprocals of regular sexagesimal numbers" (1947) and "Babylonian mathematical texts II: approximations of reciprocals of irregular numbers in an Old Babylonian text" (1952). And if this is not the source, then I surmise it is something else in this discipline. I surmise that the mention above of Conway also ultimately refers to these Babylonian techniques, which, I repeat, is a totally different context from the "regular number" of the article as it stands. 192.75.48.150 15:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: The last extensive comment by 192.75.48.150 has convinced me that the current article is describing a neologism created by Eric Weisstein. At best, we could try and rewrite the article to reflect the <i>perhaps</i> well-known use of "regular number" in the study of Babylonian mathematics. But I think given that this usage seems to be fairly restricted to Sachs and some people quoting him, there is doubt as to how widespread it is. I have a suspicion that "regular number" may be used just as (in)frequently in other contexts. Additionally, nobody here is really knowledgable about that subject, so I'm leery of biasing this discussion on future rewrites. I think the best thing is just to delete and if someone writing about Babylonian mathematics needs an article on "regular number", then it can be created and written appropriately. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 16:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. No citation has been offered (not even Mathworld) for the generalization to other bases. Generalization seems like original research <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> to me. I would appreciate it is somebody who is in favor of generalization could explain how such an article would meet the original research criteria and the verifiability <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> criteria, which says <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</i> <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> 21:51, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Repeating point made above ... my own objection to including generalisation of "regular" to other bases is that it is both trivial and uninteresting. Every non-integer rational number is "regular" in an infinite number of bases - it is simple to determine which ones - and not "regular" in an infinite number of other bases. No irrational number is "regular" in any base. Only integers are "regular" in all bases. None of this is rocket science&#160;! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 07:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm no math-head, but is it possible (I ask genuine math-heads) that <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/Recip.pdf" class="external text" title="http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/Recip.pdf" rel="nofollow">the PDF I mentioned before</a> could be in any way be cited? TBH, I got the feeling on finding it that this 'regular number' stuff was obscure to the point of 'specialised/obsolete'. Maybe Mathworld only mention it out of some archaic tribute or other? And I am not really (again, as a non-math-head) convinced at the end of the day that this is a particularly standard term for a current and non-ancient notion of what it describes. Mathworld alone, in this case, is not enough IMO. And generalisation definitely needs proper sources. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 22:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, thank you for checking. Indeed, I concur the citations in Mathworld leave much to be desired (the principle editor Eric Weisstein, I am not conviced always reads the citations in mathworld; I take them to be suggested further reading rather than references). Additionally, I never heard the term "regular number" while I was getting my BS in math. Having said that, mathworld is not given to the creation of neologisms in my experience. I am not convinced the article is comprehensive in its descriptions of useages, but further checking on MathSciNet indicates thirty articles which use the term "regular number." There are several references to TA Springer's "Theory of regular numbers." I have not had time to look up and digest these references (and they may use a different definition). However there seems to me to be evidence the term is used. --<a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeaDrinker_0ad2.html" title="User:TeaDrinker">TeaDrinker</a> 22:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
