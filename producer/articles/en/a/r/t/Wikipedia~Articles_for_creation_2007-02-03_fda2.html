<p>Also known as: Crab Bucket Syndrome and “bucket of crabs” (ie. “like a . . .”)</p>
<p>The “crabs-in-the-barrel” theory refers to a group of people who discourage or attempt to sabotage the success of another member of the group, causing a cycle of failure. The term is based on the belief that crabs placed in an open barrel will not escape because they will pull each other down, each crab attempting to be on top, meaning none of the crabs will succeed in escaping.</p>
<p>This theory is often used in reference to members of a once or currently oppressed social class who are unable to encourage or accept the achievements of a similarly disadvantaged person.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-03_fda2.html" title="Edit section: Controversy in African-American Usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy in African-American Usage</span></h3>
<p>In the study of post-colonial and post-slavery African or African-American communities, it has been suggested that a “crabs-in-the-barrel” mentality has created a cycle of failure. This belief is controversial and has been both supported and discouraged among scholars, as there are have been strong examples of both supportive and dysfunctional black communities over history.</p>
<p>In a May, 2001 article for Ebony magazine Lerone Jr. Bennett, refutes the theory in relation to African-Americans, saying that the general idea of black family brotherhood is what helped slaves survive years of mistreatment.</p>
<p>New theories on “slave-mentality” such as “post-traumatic slave syndrome” coined by Dr. Joy DeGruy-Leary, suggests however that generations of slavery and racial oppression, with little opportunity to heal has caused some African-American communities to perpetuate feelings of helplessness and self-loathing, which can lead to expressions of anger directed at oneself as well as others. Communities that suffer from this issue would find it diffcult to encourage success, which may explain the supposed cycle of failure or “crabs-in-the-barrel” notion that exists in such communities.</p>

<p>59.144.71.203 03:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC) Hi friends,</p>
<p>If you are going through this page you must be having a fairly good idea of sumalatha&#160;! she always hoped if she could take out the suma and add a Mangeshkar after! Born in Madras,brought up in Bombay and Andhra Pradesh in India,She had a very cosmopolitan upbringing and hated people who asked her what caste she belonged to. She also hated routine and monotony and could never take to formal,rigid training of any kind be it music,dance or anything!Though she bunked school a lot,She was pretty good in studies and had a good aptitudes for languages which has helped a lot later. Well,later is when She joined films at the age of 15 after winning a beauty contest in Andhra[Guntur]. So,studies ended and she was back in the place where she was born-Madras now Chennai.Her first film was a tamil film and she couldn't speak a word of it! She went to act in all the South Indian language films and this is where her natural flair for languages helped.She can speak 6 languages now! She has travelled nearly all over India and made a few, very good friends. Among her good friends in the film industry,She count Chiranjeevi, Suhasini and Vishnuvardan. In the year 1991 she got married to the man she fell in love and who also was her costar-Ambrish.</p>

LIFE</p>
<p>Childhood, Education, Military Service, Occupations</p>
<p>Swen Hans Wilhelm HEYCK was a son of the historian Eduard HEYCK (1862-1941), a grandson of the novelist and poet Wilhelm JENSEN (1837-1911), a great-grandson of the mayor of the city of Kiel, finance minister of Schleswig-Holstein and administrator (Landvogt) of the island of Sylt, Schwen Hans JENSEN (1795-1855), and a great-grandson of the journalist, writer and literary historian Johann August Moritz BRÜHL (1819-1877). After stays in Freiburg, Heidelberg, Donaueschingen and Munich he attended "Gymnasien" (classical high schools) in Doberan/ Mecklenburg, Berlin and Munich and graduated in 1910. After a three-year's internship at an import/export company in Hamburg he emigrated in 1913 to Argentina, returned to Germany, however, in the fall of 1914 after the start of First World War and served first with an artillery unit and later as a pilot and flight instructor in France and West Prussia. He was decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class and awarded a "Purple Heart". Hans HEYCK married in 1916 and had four children.</p>
<p>After working in various occupations, among others as a full-time employee of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei (German National Peoples' Party) in East Frisia, hobby farmer in Bavaria and teacher at an agricultural college in Diez/Lahn, Hans HEYCK in 1931 became a full-time writer in Bad Aibling/Bavaria and from 1935 also in Reit im Winkl/Bavaria. He joined the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party) in 1931.</p>
<p>Career as a Writer</p>
<p>Hans HEYCK began to publish poems and short stories during the First World War (1914-18). Starting in 1925 there followed contemporary, later historical novels which dealt mainly with Prussian history. His most succesful novels were "Friedrich Wilhelm I.", "Der Grosse Kurfürst von Brandenburg", "Der Grosse König", and "Das Welpennest, Ein Buch von Siedlern, Tieren und Kindern." In total Hans HEYCK's books had sales of about 500,000 copies, almost all before 1945. After 1945 his novels were not very popular. The only substantial work which HEYCK published after 1945 was "Clausewitz. Ein Lebens- und Zeitbild" with a printing of 5,000 copies. Hans HEYCK was also a poet and was awarded the "Ring of Honor for the German Poem of 1955".</p>

<p>In 1984 Mark Hucko proposed an alternate cosmological theory, so-called Multi-Level Universe theory. This theory takes into account expansion of our level of the universe, which many believe to be the only one, as well as a finite beginning of our level of the universe, which we refer to as the big bang.</p>
<p>According to the Multi-Level Universe theory, higher levels of the universe keep falling into lower levels and so on at infinitum. According to Hucko the matter that keeps falling into a black hole while is seemingly falling into an infinitely small and dense place, from inside the black hole there is another perspective.</p>
<p>From the point of an observer inside the black hole the point of creation of the black hole appears as a big bang, as the beginning of his level of the universe. And all the matter falling from the higher level into the black hole, for the internal observer expands his universe. And as long as more matter keeps falling into his level of the universe from a higher level of the universe, his level keeps on expanding. As his level keeps on growing it starts losing matter into black holes within, i.e. into other even lower levels of the universe. At a point when the amount of matter falling into his level from a higher level equals to the amount of matter which this level loses to lower levels, his level of the universe stops expanding. When the amount of matter lost to lower levels (through falling-in into black holes within) exceeds the amount of matter falling in from the higher level, his level of the universe starts collapsing.</p>
<p>According to Mark Hucko, matter, energy, space and time, MEST for short, cannot exist one without the other. They are in fact different aspects of the same thing: MEST. So the more matter falls into a black hole, with that matter falling into that black hole falls in also the appropriate amount of engergy, space and time. So in fact the more matter falls in (accompanied by space) from the view of the internal observer his level of the universe keeps getting bigger. While for us black holes appear to be infinitely dense for an internal observer they appear infinitely large and empty, just an empty expanding space.</p>

<p>The Color Chill</p>
<p>It’s an ideal artist name simply because it evokes the idea of seeing sound. And with The Color Chill you don’t need LSD or any kind of hallucination. Simply sit back and let the music do its work. This purveyor of chillout, lounge, drum-n-bass and downtempo is a master craftsman, weaving spells with his musical composition.</p>
<p>Chilled</p>
<p>How should this kind of music make you feel? The way it makes The Color Chill’s Nicholas Scott Bailey feel: “relaxed, thoughtful, happy and chilled out.” There’s no denying that listeners will receive the same benefits when they kick back and soak up the music of The Color Chill as it unleashes its marvelous ambience on fans and they float away into space.</p>
<p>Go With The Flow</p>
<p>An able artist will have those moments where the creative process gets moving and the music just flows. It stems from natural talent, which The Color Chill has in huge doses. “Just relax, don’t rush parts so that they suck.” The Color Chill just goes with the flow and lets the music unfold of its own accord. He also strives to stick to his guns artistically. “Write music that you like. It does not matter what other people think.” That’s the secret to satisfying both yourself and your fans. So prepare to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Constant</p>
<p>Dedication prevents Bailey from ever stepping away from the creative process. It must always be active and new music is always waiting to be born. “I try to sit down every day and think of a new idea. Just lay it down and try out new parts until they fit.” His devout drive to write music keeps his talent honed to a razor’s edge. Just listen to the music.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>The music for a new album is awaiting release so listeners can hang on the edge of their seats, ready for a blast of fresh artistry. The Color Chill is currently working with A&amp;R Select, the leading independent A&amp;R firm in Hollywood, CA.</p>
<p>Review</p>
<p>“Few have mastered the textures of downtempo and chillout the way The Color Chill has.” – A&amp;R Select</p>

<p>Michael Mottola was born on December 24, 1988 with Down Syndrome. This was a devastating blow to the entire family. Despite these difficult circumstances, Michael would grow to become a courageous, special boy that would touch the hearts of many. He would especially come close to a man by the name Joe Connors.</p>

Joe Connors was the local High School Baseball Coach. Michael wasnt fortunate enough to make it to High School, but he was passionate about the game of baseball. He went to every practice for 2 years straight. He would often get teased by members of the team. They would call him "retard" and ask "wheres your retard wrangler?" Little Michael had no idea what was going on. This is when Joe decided to step in and stand up for this special boy. He took him under his wing. He would invite him to his house every day for dinner, with Michael's mother's permission. Joe would begin to teach special Michael the game of baseball, as well as normal behavior.</p>

As Michael grew older he became more connected to coach Joe Connors. The Mottola family beacme more trusted in Joe and his influences on Michael. Joe became so close that often he held sleep-over parties.</p>

Pretty soon just casual sleep-overs turned into day-long "day care sessions". Little did the Mottola family know Joe Connors was a unregistered level 3 sex offender. One day when Mrs. Mottola went to pick up Little Michael she found him bent over on hands and knees being sodomized with Joe's pennis. Joe quickly fleed the house, and is still to this day being searched for by New Hampshire Police.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-02-03_fda2.html" title="Edit section: Omaima Nelson">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Omaima Nelson</span></h2>
<p>Omaima Nelson (maiden name Omaima Aref)born in 1968 and had lived on the prifery of "the city of the dead" in Cairo as a child.She was one of eight children in her family and was raped at ten and then again at eighteen,she was also physically abused from a young age. She moved to America in 1986 to escape her home life in Cairo for a young american however their relationship did not last long. In the autumn of 1991 she met William Nelson who was 33 years her senior, but nonetheless they fell in love. William was an ex-convict in jail for drug trafficking and tax-evasion, however was polite and kind to Omaima, she had said to her close friends "It was really nice, he was a gentleman". They were married on the first of November 1991 however after only four weeks of marriage something went terribly wrong. On december first at 9:15 am Omaima went round John Popovich's house and explained to him that she had been abused and raped by her husband. She had cuts up and down her body and marks around her wrists from being tied up by her husband. After hours of tending to her wounds and listening to her story at 2:05 pm John had no choice but to call the police. Officer Danny Hogue, former member of the homicide department, arrived half an hour later and began to question Omaima on the days events. She told the officer that her husband was now on a bussiness trip to Florida and she was not sure when he would return. Officer Hogue then, due to the nature of the report, asked to search her Corvette, in the boot of the car he found a black plastic bag, in which he found meat and internal organs which he could not tell whether they were animal or human. omaima claimed that someone was trying to set her up but officer Hogue realised the gravity of the situation and left one officer with Omaima and John whilst he went to search the Nelson apartment for evidence. Finding no answer at the house he forced his way into the front door, the handle of which was bloodstained. Inside he found boxed and black plastic bags in each room suggesting that someone was going to move out, the clothes hamper was filled with a bloodstained sheet and there was a large butchers knife in the kitchen sink. Hogue immediately secured the premises and called for back up on Frank Rudisill, for a case of "possible" homicide. They picked up Omaima Nelsonfrom John Popovich's house and took her for an interview at the police station in which she told them a story which was nearly incomprehensible, due to the pace and wavering of her speech. She added and removed details from her story of rape and voluntarily removed her clothes to show the detectives her wounds. she stated that she had also given a man a lift to the laundrette and he may have been the one who had left the bag in her boot. Later on in the day John popovich was called in for questioning, he said that Omaima had told him that she had killed her husband. He said that she had tols him that he had been trying to rape her but she got her hand free and hit him over the head with a lamp and then persisted to stab him with a kitchen knife. she had then cut his body into pieces and then asked Popovich to dispose of the parts and clean up the apartment fo $75,000 and two motorcycles. She denied this to the detectives and added that she had recieved a threatening call telling her to look in her kitchen and asking whether she wanted any hamburger. Omaima started to breakdown at the apartment yelling that William Nelson had cut up women before and that he had made her really ugly by cutting her. They concluded the interview at 10:00pm that night and then procceded to check the bins outside the Nelson's flat. They found more plastic bags which they opened to find in one human legs severed at the knee and in another human male genitals. In a cardboard box wrapped in newspapers thay found a pair of severed human hands which had been cooked in oil to remove the fingerprints, the left ring finger had been hacked off also. There was blood on the underside of the mattress of the main bed and shoes placed over all the bloodstains on the carpet. They searched the freezer and found William Nelson's head frozen behind packets of peas, it had been lightly cooked as the jaw was charred and scalped. Omaima Nelson was arrested at 5:55pm on the 2nd of December under suspicion of murder. the neighboors stated that they had heard the garbage disposal running all night and "chopping" moises from the apartment. It was later confessed by Omaima that she had been the one to start the agressive assault between husband and wife and had eventually beaten William to death with an iron. She also told a psychiatrist that she had worn all red to disect her husband as she was obsessed with the colour of his blood. Ob the stand she told the judge of her painful circumsision at the age of six without aneasthesia. It was later found that there was about 130 pounds of William Nelson missing wehich Omaima later confided to a psychiatrist that she had cooked and eaten with a barbeque sauce saying "i like him tender". There was insufficient evidence to put her down for first degree murder however they convicted her of second degree murder and the assault of another man named Orville Whittaker a year earlier. She was sent to jail for 27 years to life and will not be released until well into the 21st century</p>

<p>Rodolfo Lana Jr. – 2006 Palanca Awardee and the youngest member of the Palanca Hall of Fame. He studied Communication Arts in the University of Santo Tomas and was a member of the Philippine Educational Theater and Telon Playwrights Circle. He considers his meeting with Rene Villanueva, who had become his mentor while in Santo Tomas, as the turning point of his writing career. His literary style integrates and balances the commercial and literary elements as some of his works were made into films like, Sa Pusod ng Dagat (1998), Muro Ami, and Jose Rizal, all were directed by the renowned Marilou Diaz-Abaya. The Milagroso, which won the 2006 Dulaang Pantelibisyon Award, was also shown in GMA 7 starring Cesar Montano. At 34 years old, Jun considers winning the 2006 Palanca Award as one of his greatest achievements in life. But besides being a prolific writer, he is also a film director with Mano Po 5, which had become an official entry for the Metro Manila Film Festival, as his major work. Despite his ability to bandy between being a playwright and a director, he still considers himself first as a writer. Indeed a writer who directs.</p>

<p>Prospective on Teresa of Avila (1515-1582. She was known as a mystic during the sixteenth-century. During this time, the Catholic Church was standing firm against Luther and other Protestant believers. In this effort, The Council of Trent, which was made up of Catholic Church leaders from all over Europe, came together to strengthen their foundational beliefs. At this time, the Catholic Church took on a renewed strength that ignited passion in people such as Teresa. Teresa felt the need to run off to become a nun although her father was against it. She was determined to use her newfound passion for Catholicism in her efforts to bring about reform for women. She did this by assisting in the opening of new convents that would further promote the faith and passion of the Catholic Church. Teresa was deeply devoted to God and spent her lifetime trying to serve Him through prayer, work, and obedience.</p>
<p>Teresa most likely gained her recognition through a book she wrote called, The Way of Perfection. It was a mystical writing that brought about the title of “Doctor of the Church” for Teresa. In essence, it was a book of prayers. It was well received by the Pope and deemed worthy of studying. Another one of Teresa’s writings was called, The Interior Castle. She wrote this book after being inspired by a Carmelite Friar, also known as John of the Cross.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, Teresa served God in the Carmelite Order and St. Joseph’s Convent. All throughout her life, she remained focused on her calling to a lifetime of service, and was a great example to all women, Spain, and the world.</p>

<p>Falling Sand Game is a series of popular java games based on 4 different kinds of sand: water, sand, salt, and oil. Among the other tools in the game are eraser, cera (wax), wall, fire, plant, and&#160;???. The interaction of the particles such as burning, dissolving, and growing are the basis for the enjoyment of the game. Some versions of this game include zombies or human bodies that have their own abilities, or a namejuki (japanese for slug), aptly named for its interaction to salt. Other versions emphasize the burning affect, such as the addition of napalm, nitroglycerin, and C4 plastic explosive.</p>

<p><b>Guju Soc</b> was the brainchild of two current <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_College_713d.html" title="Imperial College">Imperial College</a> medical students, Samit Unadkat and Neil Chotai; its foremost ethos being to promote Gujarati culture within the university. A recent university poll aimed at identifying numbers of students from ethnic minorities found that Gujaratis overwhelmingly topped the survey<sup>1</sup>. Having witnessed the success of Tamil Soc and with the inception of the highly vocal Punjab Soc, the two have found their idea to be a runaway success. Despite backing from both Gujaratis and non-Gujaratis alike, they have faced stern opposition from the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_College_713d.html" title="Imperial College">Imperial College</a> Union who have yet to make the society official. However, having recently interviewed the dynamic co-presidents, it appears that the society is growing in popularity by the day. With membership being limited through www.facebook.com, Guju Soc has still managed to attract more than 100 members. Estimates forecast that if made official, this figure could increase ten-fold.</p>
<p>The society hopes to encourage greater understanding of <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati.html" title="Gujarati">Gujarati</a> culture through dinners that focus on traditional food, “bhajan” or hymn nights and parties. On 21st January 2007, the Chotai and Unadkat were asked what to expect from Guju Soc in 2007. Although keeping their cards close to their chest they did reveal that an introduction service shall be launched to provide an alternative medium for like-minded <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujaratis.html" title="Gujaratis">Gujaratis</a> to meet, away from the watchful glare of the Gujarati parent to find their soul-mate. The two cupids added that full details including venues and eligibility shall be revealed later. <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_College_713d.html" title="Imperial College">Imperial College</a>, the new Venice?

<p>On January 25, 2007 Ohio University President McDavis and Athletic Director Kirby Hocutt anounced that OU would be cutting Men's Swimming and Diving, Men's Track and Field, and Women's Lacross. The reasons stated were Title IX and a $4 million debt incurred by the Athletic Department.</p>
<p>This has caused outrage on the Campus of Ohio University. The Student Senate and Stusent Athlete Advisory Council is upset due to the lack of student involvement in the decision. "Save Our Sports" signs are posted around campus and many articles supporting the teams affected have been written in the Ohio University Post and local news papers. Many students are also upset because the AThletic Department are continuing with plans to build an indoor football traing facility costing around $20 million dollars but can't support four varsity sports. And as for Title IX Dr. Brand of the NCAA has been quoted saying "‘I certainly hope no University cuts sports to comply with Title IX. There are always alternatives. The NCAA is always ready and able to work with an athletics department to identify acceptable alternatives to cutting sports. It should not be the case that men's participation opportunities are diminished to comply with Title IX."'</p>
<p><br />
Men's Swimming and Diving along with Men's Track have consistently had the best Team GPA's and Graduation rates of all the Men's Varsity Teams at Ohio University.</p>

J.M. Ledgard is an influential Scottish novelist born in the Shetland Islands, in 1968, and educated in England, Scotland, and America. He has been a foreign political and war correspondent with <i>The Economist</i> since 1996 and is a contributor to the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. Ledgard's first novel, Giraffe, was published to widespread critical acclaim in 2006 by Penguin Press in America, Jonathan Cape in Britain, and Heloise D'Ormesson in France. Dutch, Czech, and English-language paperback editions will appear in 2007. While some reviewers found Giraffe stilted and sombre, the majority singled it out as a visionary masterpiece. The novel was named 2006 Book of the Year by the Library Journal, and as a novel of the year by newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic. Giraffe is based on a true story, uncovered by Ledgard. In 1975, on the eve of May Day, Czechoslovakian secret police dressed in chemical warfare suits sealed off the zoo in the small Czech town of Dvur Kralove nad Labem and orchestrated the slaying of the zoo's entire population of forty-nine giraffes, the largest captive herd in the world. No reason for the action was ever given, and Czechoslovakians understood that they were to ask no more about it. Ledgard recounts the story of the giraffes from their capture in Africa to their deaths far away. The <i>Library Journal</i> found Giraffe to be "a profoundly affecting novel that will wake you up and break your heart." The <i>Independent</i> in London described it as a "superb novel, filled with compassion, yet never sentimental." The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> likened Giraffe to T.S. Eliot's 'Wasteland', while the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> thought Ledgard's prose closer to that of Italo Calvino. Other reviews drew comparison with the German writer, W.G. Sebald. The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> argued that Giraffe is "a potent, disturbing dream, as if Radiohead's 'Idioteque' had mixed with something by Haruki Murukami." The <i>New York Times</i> was "continually reminded of Harold Bloom's remark about all great books being strange." According to Penguin Press, "Giraffe marks the debut of an unforgettable talent. At once vivid and unearthly, Giraffe is a meditation on suffering, on the strangeness of vertical creatures, and on the inhabitants of a middling totalitarian state, sleepwalking through the ‘communist moment’."</p>

<li>I've created the article much as submitted, but since it seemed to be more about Ledgard's novel than about Ledgard, I've created it at <a href="../../../g/i/r/Giraffe_%28novel%29.html" title="Giraffe (novel)">Giraffe (novel)</a>. I added a redirect from <a href="../../../j/2E/m/J.M._Ledgard_70cf.html" title="J.M. Ledgard">J.M. Ledgard</a> to that. I kept only three of the links, picking those which seemed to me the most informative. I made a few minor changes in line with the new title. Thanks very much for submitting this information.
