<p>This page is just another attempt of Alberuni to spread his political bias on Wikipedia. You do not, for example, see a page on Palestinian Revisionism. During any conflict, there is a tendency for people to "cover up" things they percieve to be harmful to their case.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 00:20, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete. No such belief exists. Someone has rewritten the article on Holocaust denial, and attributed these beliefs to Jewish people. It is not appropriate for fictitious material to be accepted in a peer-reviewed encyclopedia. To whom can one appeal? I now know that anyone can contribute, but who are the reviewers who check for this sort of thing? I would like to contact them, by regular mail or e-mail. Previously I identified myself as <i>Been to New Jersey, and knowing what I am missing, and not missing it.</i>, but perhaps I should add that I have <i>Been to Columbia, and knowing what I am missing, and not missing it.</i>.</li>
<li><b>Invalid listing.</b> Bias is not a reason for deletion, as set forth in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, and pages are not required to be balanced by other pages. <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">User:Yoshiah ap</a> hasn't listed any other valid reasons (his main objection seems to be that it's written by Alberuni), so I contend this VfD listing is invalid. <a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">--style</a> 12:55, 2004 Oct 26 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, or alternatively <b>Redirect</b> following Mirv's suggestion. Highly POV and appears to be original research. Also, author appears to be resisting any attempts to NPOV it or make it useful. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:30, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. You will find that bias is not a valid reason to delete a page. As for your claim this article is original research: How?

<li>The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> is not exhaustive, merely illustrative. And the idea that the examples represent "Zionist Revisionism" is original research on Alberuni's part; for it not to be original research, rather than presenting his own thesis, he would have to present the work of others who describe the examples given as "Zionist Revisionism". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 17:31, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Abstain. The topic certainly exists. Just as Josiah pointed out, it happens in any conflict. I agree that the article is highly POV. It would probably be better to redo from scratch, with some more distant, concrete examples of revisionism. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJericho4.0_ecbb.html" title="User:Jericho4.0">jericho4.0</a> 02:52, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>Agree with Jericho4.0, <strike>but vote for <b>Keep</b></strike>. Cleanup needs to occur, but topic is valid and not, I don't think, coverable in any less of a POV title.. except perhaps "Claims of Zionist Revisionism"? Hmm. Covering the other side(s) is, of course, welcome as well, as the Palestinians certainly produce their share (perhaps greater) of propogandic, ahistorical nonsense. --<a href="../../../p/g/u/User%7EPgunn_d038.html" title="User:Pgunn">Improv</a> 08:02, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Redirect</b> to the article mentioned by Mirv. I forgot to mention my vote. My reason is that we do not create a page for the "revisionism" done by people in every conflict, now do we? Additionally, there is no Palestinian equivalent, and as Jayjg said, it appears to be original research.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 02:14, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because there is no article Palestinian revisionism bears no relation to whether this article should be removed. If you Josiah beleives there is such a thing, then I would urge him to start the article. I also beleive this is a valid topic, as in the article specific examples are cited. The article badly needs NPOVing however, though this has never been a reason to delete an article. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:50, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. As we have many of Zionist Revisionists right here (hello, <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a>, and the rest of "hasbara" troops) the subject is worth exploring. The title is clearly NPOV (more NPOV than the lumping of revisionists and deniers together under <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>.) POV complaints about contents should be made at the article Talk. HistoryBuffEr 00:47, 2004 Oct 29 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>. An article with topics this sensitive needs both sides represented equally — both accusations and rebuttals on all issues. As a <i>non</i>-Zionist (but not pro-Zionist nor anti-Zionist), both pro-Zionist and anti-Zionist views must be portrayed in equal mutual balance, or it will be an endless can of worms with more VfDs. Both pro-Zionism and anti-Zionism have publishable arguments as well as their share of occasional vitriol. Let's maintain a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation, because (in my opinion) nihilism is caustic and only catalyzes more nihilism. There is a difference between calm argument and screaming matches, and the latter need <i>never</i> exist, no matter how angry someone is. Ever. And keeping the issues in separate articles just invites confusion and screaming. So, you have my vote. It is emphatically final. Period. Get on with your lives. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 02:36, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>KEEP. This is actually an important phenomenon in it's own right and includes myths such as: Palestine doesn't exist, there are no Palestinians, Jordan is Palestine, Palestinians were not expelled by Israel, Palestinians are economic migrants from neighbouring countries, Arabs didn't exist prior to the 6thC etc. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Ball_5435.html" title="User:John Ball">John Ball</a> 12:14 29 Oct 2004.</li>

<li><b>Rename or merge</b> to Revisionism in the Israel-Palistine Conflict. Wikipedia should explore all claims in an NPOV manner, and in this case, that can only be done in a balanced article.

<p>HistoryBuffEr is talking about the fact that the paragraph you quoted was added to the policy by me, and quite recently at that (BTW, HistoryBuffEr, Josiah was probably not aware of this fact and you really <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">should</a> explain it before attacking him). Therefore HB is right in that quoting the policy may be inappropriate here. <i>However</i>, HB is wrong in assuming I changed the policy somehow — I merely clarified what was the de-facto policy before. <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 16:09, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment:</b> it appears that this was moved to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism_in_the_Israel-Palestine_Conflict_e3f1.html" title="Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict">Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</a>, but then a copy and paste move was done. There are now <i>two</i> articles, with only one listed on VfD. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 04:53, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct. I had moved the page and edited it in an attempt to make it NPOV, but the redirect was deleted and the edits undone by user Alberuni.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 07:12, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, so what do we do now? This is now complicated by the fact there is a similar article called <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_history_denial_a513.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian history denial">Israeli-Palestinian history denial</a>. I have half a mind to take this entry off VfD temporarily, attempt a merge and then relist. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:44, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I redirected it to the article mentioned by Mirv--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 19:32, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User:HistoryBuffEr deleted comments by User:Viriditas, which were restored by Jayjg, in the vote tally area. I was under the impression that was against the rules - was I wrong?--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 02:36, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wrong claim, check history: the Viriditas comments were merely moved from Tally Total to comments below. HistoryBuffEr 17:15, 2004 Oct 31 (UTC)</dd>
