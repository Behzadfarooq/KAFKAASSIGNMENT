<li><b>Delete</b>, <span style="border:3px solid black;padding:0px 2px;">NIИ</span>cruft. I've been reading the Meathead Perspective for almost seven years, and it's pretty funny if you're a fan, but as a person he isn't really notable enough for Wikipedia. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 12:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, article has undergone significant improvement. Non Notable fancruft is deleted because it attracts poorly written articles, and the article is certainly of a higher quality than a lot of articles on more "important" issues. The article has managed to attract serious editors (who are keeping the vandals well under control). We also aren't deleting the articles on other internet personalities just because most of the talk relating to them is (surprisingly) on the internet: <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddox_%28writer%29.html" title="Maddox (writer)">Maddox (writer)</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucker_Max_6cdf.html" title="Tucker Max">Tucker Max</a>, etc. Sure, they're more popular, but notability is not the same thing as popularity. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBills_5132.html" title="User:GeorgeBills">GeorgeBills</a> 14:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Urg, I didn't even know that (the published book thing). I guess the point I'm trying to make is that internet sources aren't automatically non-factual, and given that many of the articles here currently only contain internet sources, only using internet sources shouldn't be an automatic deletion criteria. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> also notes that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" and I think the inverse should be true: ordinary claims don't need peer reviewed papers for proof. There's nothing in the Meathead article that isn't believed by that articles editors, with reasonable although not indisputable evidence, to be true. There was an April Fools joke in the article previously, but it was removed and I think that shows that the articles editors are happy to remove non-factual material. Also, the main point of the article is that someone calling themself Meathead is writing a popular series of essays (etc). The actual site itself should be good enough for that reference surely? I guess my arguments are:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The article is referenced above the standard of the majority of the articles here, and while those references are internet references, they are reliable for the fairly ordinary claims that they're covering.</li>
<li>The number of fanboys / fangirls spamming the last AfD is regrettable, but the admin who reviewed that AfD discounted their opinion anyway, and popularity is hardly grounds for deletion. The nominations argument that the "only reason this page survived deletion last time is that his friends [...] posted here to vouch for his continued relevance" is thus irrelevant.</li>
<li>The vandalism on the page is also regrettable, but it's being dealt with (the majority of it coming from one persistent IP vandal, on a one week ban last I saw), and frequent vandalism is also not a reason for deletion (or we'd be deleting <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Dafa_3572.html" title="Falun Dafa">Falun Dafa</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Bush_724d.html" title="President Bush">President Bush</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, etc).</li>
<li>Some of the arguments for deletion of NN articles clearly don't apply here: that they don't attract editors, that they clutter cats, that the article tends to be overly biased (the article makes no PoV judgements as far as I can see, but I'll go over it again to try and make sure).</li>
<li>Wiki isn't paper, and so as far as I'm concerned, non-verifiability is the main argument for deleting NN pages. The article doesn't reference any scientific journals, but for some subjects, subjects which a reasonably large minority group of people are going to find interesting and informative, that isn't going to happen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBills_5132.html" title="User:GeorgeBills">GeorgeBills</a> 16:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, it doesn't mean it automatically needs to be deleted... but there are no verifiable, reliable sources provided (as Bschott mentioned) and nobody asserting this should be kept has advanced a compelling, logical reason why the guidelines should be ignored in this case.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:07, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> My arguments for the page being referenced well enough for what it covers are above, and I guess the admin that reads this will decide whether they make sense or not... Bschott only said that the article "possibly" fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, but I would like to know why you think this? I've just changed the word "humorous" to "comedy" (because humorous implies that everyone finds his work funny, and comedy merely implies that the intent of his column is to be funny), but that was a pretty minor change. Is your NPoV complaint something fixable? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeBills_5132.html" title="User:GeorgeBills">GeorgeBills</a> 17:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Alright, what do we have here. Lets look at the reasons shall we: "Meathead is not known outside the Nine Inch Nails online fan community. The only reason this page survived deletion last time is that his friends at the Nine Inch Nails fan forum <a href="http://www.echoingthesound.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.echoingthesound.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.echoingthesound.org/</a> posted here to vouch for his continued relevance. Outside that limited sphere of online NIN fans, Meathead is unknown and irrelevant." Alright, here are the facts. Except for Trent Reznor, EVERY other MEMBER of NIN is UNKNOWN and IRRELEVANT outside that limited sphere. Please tell me mr. reporter, do you know ANYONE who is a part of NIN except for Trent Reznor? Oh please, go on. Do you wiki search and reply. Meathead is not only a fan, but a mutual friend of Trent Reznor. No, i dont mean to say that they are dating or some sort, but that Meathead is been an important part of NIN. If you were a fan, you would know that. The first "excuse" you guys had was that there are no links when you search for "Meathead Perspective" in google. We'll... let me show you: <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?q=Meathead+Perspective</a> Oh look, what do we have here? More than 1000 pages including www.nin.com itself! Second of all, Trent himself has bookmarked Meathead's page in www.nin.com under the resources section. <a href="http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nin.com/resources/index.html</a> Hell, i even have a feeling that if you guys keep putting up this article for deletion, Trent himself will comment on his blog and will say "Stop deleting this page!" cause no matter how much fun meathead makes of NIN, it really brings fans closer. NIN has one of the most loyal fans out there, and pages like Meathead's Perspective and theninhotline are bringing fans more closer. It would be a shame to see articles deleted for lame excuses. You know what, why don't you delete the important articles instead of this. Here. Let me help you get started: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucks.com" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucks.com" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucks.com</a> or better, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ouzounian" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ouzounian" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ouzounian</a> Look at this MotherFragger... he is just another INTERNET person.. why does he has a freaking Wiki? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Max" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Max" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Max</a> Woah cool... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Carapetis" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Carapetis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Carapetis</a> WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY!!!

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Your <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> really makes us want to count your vote more. And if you have so much against all the other articles, feel free to AfD any of them. It's the same process that was undertaken for this article. Feel free to add the two albums you refer to into the main article, it would be best to reference them to something like AllMusic or Amazon or whatever too. — <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevragnarok_789a.html" title="User:Revragnarok"><font color="#696969">RevRagnarok</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevragnarok_52e4.html" title="User talk:Revragnarok">Talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revragnarok_e131.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revragnarok">Contrib</a></sup></span> 18:59, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
