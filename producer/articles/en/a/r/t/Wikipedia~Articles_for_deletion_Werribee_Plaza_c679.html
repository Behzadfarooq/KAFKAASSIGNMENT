<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no evidence given whatsoever that this is a particularly big shopping center, nor is there any sign that it is considered a landmark of any sort. I don't think Wikipedia's credibility can survive the creation of an article for every large shopping center in every suburb of every large city in the world. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 06:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no assertion of notability and I can't find any. I don't know where the points above about "sounds like a really big shopping center" come from. From its website and everything I've read it's your common or garden shopping center with nothing to distinguish it from any other. It has exactly the same generic list of retailers too. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 09:24, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No Vote</b>, there are many of these on the site. I'm not entirely sure why someone would need to look up a shopping centre on an encyclopedia, but deleting this one would require people to go on a crusade to delete all the rest of 'em, too. --<sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User_talk%7ERiana_dzasta_b0bf.html" title="User talk:Riana dzasta">T</a></sup><a href="../../../r/i/a/User%7ERiana_dzasta_07ef.html" title="User:Riana dzasta">riana</a><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Riana_dzasta_06fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Riana dzasta">C</a></sub> 11:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> <i>we have to start somewhere</i>?! THe idea of going on a deletion crusade does not add to WP at all. It actually detracts, because instead of improving, you simply delete problems.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Shopping centres certainly can be notable, particularly if they are the largest in the region or architecturally notable. However, this one does not fit either category. The line has to be drawn somewhere or else every shopping arcade in the world could be included. You voted 'Keep' - what was it about /this/ arcade that you thought was sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in a serious encyclopaedia? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 19:57, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> The idea that deletion is counterproductive to WP is not sound. Keeping a minimum filter of notability will improve WP's reputation in the long run. I agree that poor articles should be improved not deleted but in this instance there is simply no avenue for constructive improvements. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:16, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is a major landmark for the local community in Geelong and Surrounds as well as Melbourne and so on. I can understand the points that you make about it perhaps not making the books elsewhere. However, as a Geelong Wikipedian I believe that it is notable and with more expansion this could become a quality article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough but if the Weribee Plaza is so important and is indeed a "major landmark", would it not appear more prominently on the websites whose sole function is to promote the city of Weribee <a href="http://www.werribee.org.au/tourism1/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.werribee.org.au/tourism1/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (Weribee Plaza is indeed mentioned in the shopping section but only in passing) or the Geelong region <a href="http://www.greatoceanrd.org.au/travellingon/werribee.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatoceanrd.org.au/travellingon/werribee.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (no mention of the plaza)? I believe that you should try and explain how the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines are met in this instance or how the content of the article could be made of encyclopedic value which, I believe most would agree, it currently is not. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 17:18, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
