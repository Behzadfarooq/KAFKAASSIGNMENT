<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm no expert at reading Vietnamese, but from the formatting (i.e., use of all caps every so often) and basic gist ("Q&amp;A"), it's likely a copy-paste job from a newspaper or website, and thus would be a <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyvio_e1c3.html" title="WP:Copyvio">WP:Copyvio</a>. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 00:22, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hello. I don't regard myself as being very good at Vietnamese (I didn't put a vn userbox on myself), but this is Vietnamese. The title says "Help/assistance: Writing a new piece". The first line which is boxed is a question which is directed towards a presumedly Vietnamese Buddhist monk and asks about the bird flu pandemic and how it is related to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">karma</a> and cause and effect. The text below is the monk's answer to this.

<li><b>Delete</b> It looks like a text dump from an existing Vietnamese Wiki page, so transwikiing wouldn't really be neccesary, but with the amount of odd diacratics I can't check that.

<li>Cow-tipping is a fairly major urban(?) legend; this is much less so.

<li>Cow-tipping, as the article is written, was probably a bad example to use. My point is simply that many of the reasons given for deletion are rather silly and if the reasoning were extrapolated a whole slew of articles would be deleted from Wikipedia. If anyone has a real interest in keeping this information around it would probably be better served as part of an article on practical jokes or vandalism incorporting current articles on <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_papering.html" title="Toilet papering">Toilet papering</a>, etc. Provided of course someone can source Toilet Tipping information.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:35, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>When I was a student on a certain sink estate there was an outbreak of people throwing bricks at the bus.

<li>This is a tough case. On the one hand, it's pretty obviously the product of an inside wiki joke, probably perpetrated by the gentlemen standing on the porta-potty in the photo.

<p>I am in fact the same SRipple from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Analog_Set_8d4e.html" title="The American Analog Set">The American Analog Set</a>. This whole issue came up (after having the page up for quite a few months) because I goofed around with a trail concept using the name <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean.html" title="Sean">Sean</a> from my page. It was an art project not meant to cause any harm. As I mentioned on my talk page, I realized after thinking about it that it was very irresponsible of me to mess with the integrity of Wikipedia's function. I enjoy this site and agree with <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> when he states that Sean Trail was, "pure vandalism."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue with whether or not I am notable...I suspect that a great deal of the content you have on your site pertaining to people currently involved in the creative arts has been added by the publicists of the people being documented. I don't see this as any less vain. It's just a tad more removed. The few bits of self-promotion that I added recently (60 self-published books in March) were mentioned to try and gain some momentum as an artist. I suspect that publicists are doing the same sort of thing to promote the latest whatever.</p>
<p>I've learned that I should respect Wikipedia for its function. If you choose to keep this page, then I will be appreciative. If you do not, I understand.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>SRipple</p>
<p>P.S. Right after this whole thing happened, I noticed someone editing a falsehood about me into my bio. I had to edit it out. I've left my response on the bio. It reads, "The bit about Fela Kuti was funny, but untrue."</p>

<p>This page was created by my best friend and I to shed some background light onto a character that we have created and written several stories about, a few of which are going to be published in 2007. We are a pair of British Humor writers from Oxford, England.</p>
<p>We don't mean to be pests, but we do feel that we have the freedom to place information on our characters here. Won't it be handy, once the stories are published, to have this page? Perhaps it seems like nonsense, but then again, I'm sure Harry Potter did too, at first. We would be very grateful if you were leave our page be. We don't mind perhaps editing it a bit, but we'd like to keep it as-is.</p>
<p>Cheers mates.</p>
<p>Also, please note, it was not "made up in school one day". We are both professional authors by trade.</p>

Further, you have also lowered your credibility by repeatedly ignoring requests to stop vandalizing and deleting AfD tags.

<p>While I do understand and respect the Wikipedia community, and the content and quality guidelines therein, I do not see any real harm in allowing our article to persist. And even if, as you say, we use this page as a means of promotion, what harm is there? We won't be generating any financial benefits from this, as the stories are being published in a local Oxford humor magazine free of royalty, as we also have not copyrighted or syndicated our characters or stories. If anything, the only consequence of allowing the article to persist, would be more traffic to the website, and I hardly deem that to be an undesirable side-effect. Furthermore, it is a negligible possibility that anyone apart from my partner and I will view the page for well over a year, so, I say again, what harm is there?</p>
<ul>
<li><i>the only consequence of allowing the article to persist, would be more traffic to the website</i>... Again, advertising is not the purpose of Wikipedia. As the author, your purpose on AfD should not be asking "Why not keep this article?" but answering "Why keep this article?" --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 03:51, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that's a rather elementary question. "Why?" "Why not?" We're not children anymore, my friend, but that particular argument could render us as such, and go on for an indeterminable amount of time. I simply fail to see why you cannot just allow us our one article. It's not bothering, intruding, or linking to anyone elses. You've probobly allready wasted more than a fair share of your time. As to the purpose of Wikipedia.. I was always under the impression that it was a community-driven encyclopedia or articles posted by users on topic which they find interesting, and have a knowledge of. If there can be a Wikipedia page for a novel, there can be one for our as-of-yet unreleased stories, there is absolutely no real difference there. And like I said, it has the possibility of generating traffic for the rest of the website, which is hardly a detrimental attribute. To be honest, I'm starting to think of the restriction on our article as, dare I say it, a tad fascistic. While I can certainly appreciate a certain amount of zeal for upholding the site's 'regulations', I hardly see it as being neccesary, or even particularly fair, to be so prejudiced against something you term 'nonsense'. I term some of those guidelines 'nonsense', does that give me the right to change or remove them? I hardly think so.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a pretty common argument here on AfD, so let me warn you that you are unlikely to gain traction with it. In any case, WP is an encyclopedia, not a repository for everything in the world, and therefore it is restricted to topics that are encyclopedic: that is, well known, reasonably important, verifiable, and objectively written. When your work is well known, we will be happy to have an article describing it. The key phrase in your paragraph above is "as-of-yet unreleased." See in particular <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what wikipedia is not</a>, including "wikipedia is not a crystal ball." thanks. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 04:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>I simply fail to see why you cannot just allow us our one article</i>: Because that would set a precedent. Wikipedia would have to allow anything and everything, and AfD would cease to exist. ... <i>It's not bothering, intruding, or linking to anyone elses</i>: Orphaned articles are frowned upon. If an article is relevant, it's safe to say that at least one other one would link to it. ... <i>If there can be a Wikipedia page for a novel, there can be one for our as-of-yet unreleased stories, there is absolutely no real difference there</i>: Yes there is. One has been released, one has not and with no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of release beyond your own claim. As has been said, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. ... <i>I'm starting to think of the restriction on our article as, dare I say it, a tad fascistic</i>: Other users and I have cited reasons. We don't know each other. We don't always agree. But we do here. Doesn't sound fascist to me. ... <i>I term some of those guidelines 'nonsense', does that give me the right to change or remove them? I hardly think so.</i>: Apples and oranges. Feel free to read the talk pages for the guidelines. They've been discussed, rediscussed, and discussed again. They're not about 100% agreement, and some people downright hate them. But they're about consensus, just like AfD. Sometimes I interpret the guidelines differently and I lose to the majority on some AfDs. That's life. So is this. If the consensus here is to delete, within those guidelines, then that's what it is. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 04:05, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If being well known is a pre-requisite for an article to stay on Wikipedia, I could nominate a rather large number of articles for deletion on that exact same basis. Hypocrisy is a terrible habit. If that is such a common argument, perhaps you should take a step back, be 'objective' yourself, and consider as to why that it is so common? I'm sure your first remark on that will be something derisive or involving a degradation of the maturity of those who use the argument. However, if many people use it, could it be, oh my stars, that it is a valid and sound argument? And, if such is the case, a sound and valid argument generating no 'traction', as you put it, is hardly a positive light to have yourself viewed in. Furthermore, what 'consensus' has been achieved? The way I see it, two people wish the article to be deleted, and two do not.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Avi is correct; cuckoldry is different from this. If a woman has sexual relations with someone other than her husband, her husband has been cuckolded. If a man shows people revealing pictures of his wife, no cuckoldry has occured, and only husbands can be cuckolded at any rate. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">Ergot</a> 17:08, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information. There are many things that have been deemed unsuitable for Wikipedia, and others who's questionability is unnecessary. This is one of those gray areas. Personally, I think this is fine (it was in a newspaper), but there are others who disagree and think more references are needed. Also, Wikipedia can't be the first place something is published. That would be "original research," which is illegal here.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Just because you might not like the use of a term doesn't mean that it should be deleted from dictionaries (that's directed at you Orwellian 1984 delete crazy psychos).

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The previous "Do Not Delete" edit has an excellent point.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This should not be deleted for the same reasons mentioned above. the use of the "n" word, or even the term wigger, this is indeed a stereotype but is not to be deleted because someone does not like it.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete!!</b> In reference to the 1984 Orwellion bikeable. The fact that you counted the hours which this page had been in existence shows yours distatste for this entry, and your distant location in Boston probably adds to the distate which you dislpay towards this article.

<li><b>This article should not be deleted.</b> It is, for all intensive purposes, similar to a stub. If anything, this article should not be considered for deletion: it should be considered for extension. References to the word chonga are difficult to find (in print, the internet, etc.) because it is not a word that has garnered world-wide usage. If you'd like references that you MIGHT be able to find, listen to radio station El Zol 95, a local station here in Miami. It's not easy to find references for a rather new term. Also, this is not a definitionesque article. If you'd like for it to be less "mockery-toned", by all means, go ahead and edit it. The way it stands now, everyone in Miami that I know that has seen the article (and in the past 24 hours, word has spread FAST) agrees that it is truthful and not in any way just a slang term with no relevance. This article contains the history, the evolution of said chonga, and is, in no way, offensive. If a girl is dressed like one, she knows what she's doing, and she knows what she's attempting to look like. If I wear a gold chain around my neck, 3 inches thick, with a spinner on the end, a thick Ecko sweater, and my pants around my ankles, you'd immediately say I'm trying to be "gangster" or "gangster-like". This is because I AM. You do not look a certain way without being able to be labeled. This is just a new label for a certain female demographic, primarily found in South Florida which has not found national usage yet. --Gmasterluis 00:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> — All these people who want to see this article become <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedic</a> (and therefore acceptable for inclusion in Wikipedia) should focus their attentions on improving the article. Is is acceptable, encouraged in fact, for the article to be edited, expanded, and improved during the deletion discussion. The criticisms levelled above by the <b>delete</b> voters are common here. Many new articles suffer these same faults. Occasionally an article can be improved enough during the deletion process to cause people to change their votes. The faults noted above are somewhat subjective, but based on objective observations. Gmasterluis says <i>If you'd like for it to be less "mockery-toned", by all means, go ahead and edit it.</i> Articles should only be edited by people who understand the subject matter, the <b>keep</b> voters here claim to understand the subject, the <b>delete</b> voters clearly do not (from your POV). So the <b>delete</b> voters need to put their heads together and re-write the article to comply with Wikipedia guidelines. And they need to do it quickly before a deletion decision is made.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> — You're still missing the point. No one is claiming that this is not a real word. The issue here is the article in question, and it's appropriateness for inclusion in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">an encyclopedia</a>. Try reading the comments and suggestions that I (and others) have posted here. Take these ideas to heart, and work to improve the article so that it meets Wikipedia standards. Coming here and bitching <i>(you) HAVE NOT YET HEARD THIS WORD THERFORE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT A REAL WORD</i> is not productive. And it won't do any good. The administrator that decides the final outcome of this discussion will not be swayed by TYPING IN ALL CAPS and moaning about how <i>you don't understand us.</i> The only issue here is the quality of the article. If you approach the phenomenon of "Chonga" from a sociological and cultural perspective, write an article from that POV, and write it at a level of quality commensurate with other articles, you will find that the word is kept, and you will win this fight. Read the comments by <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> above and use those articles as a guide to improving this one. Bringing in a bunch of your friends to scream <b>DO NOT DELTE</b> is not going to help. (And, by the way, the term we usually use here is <b>Keep</b>. Not "do not delete")<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> This article just needs to be worked on. It has not been here for very long, and requires INTELLIGENT people to work on it.

The people complaining, I don't agree with them, because they aren't making valid arguments. However, this topic should not be for deletion, as I stated before. We (people who are well aware of the term) are trying our best to improve the article and continue make it grow into a more encyclopedic source of information.</li>
<li><i><b>do not delete</b></i> this article. it is <b>hilarious</b> and is very useful to people who do not know what a Chonga is.

<p>From the actual Jay himself: JesseW and other Wikipedians, please remove the page. I've been trying to get it off here for some time now. I have no idea why it was voted on as "keep," despite my message I placed in both Editing Talk and the Vote itself saying to please remove it. Once I found out it's been up there around August, I've tried to monitor it and manipulate it from a couple of vandals (esp. one in regards to an untrue pejorative statement about leaving Texas Christian University. I am by no means a notable person and once guested locally (NOT NATIONALLY) on an NPR affiliate, not NPR itself. Thanks for bringing this to light and your consideration. I brought it to attention by asking for a speedy deletion just yesterday and it was immediately reverted by an admin to the previous update. I hope that you all will speedily remove the Wikipedia entry. JZ</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing lists do very badly, and categories do quite well. As far as ridiculously wide scope goes, "associated" with WWII is just about everyone living in one of the involved coutries in the 1940s (how many millions is that? At least 500? Mayeb closer to a billion?). Yes, I know, this should theoretically have only those notable enough for an article, but that's still shitloads (and I see redlinks and non-linkd people listed too). If we want a list of leaders and military commanders and the like we might have something, but any such list that includes the likes of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Clancy_69cb.html" title="Patrick Clancy">Patrick Clancy</a> has really bitten off more than it can chew. The only argument I've heard for why lists augment categories in cases like this is that lists can show who's missing. If there are important people closely associated with WWII who don't have articles, they are far better served with other articles and more specific lists. Not something that's so general it might as well be <a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_Listcruft%7E_List_of_people_associated_with_water_347b.html" title="User:R. fiend/Listcruft: List of people associated with water">List of people with some sort of connection to water</a>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> but <b>rename</b> to List of 2006 Hot Wheels die cast cars as better use of the trademarked term "Hot Wheels". This list does not violate the "What Wikipedia is Not". Just because such high-brow items such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hitchcock_cameo_appearances_3b1a.html" title="List of Hitchcock cameo appearances">List of Hitchcock cameo appearances</a> and the various List of people on stamps of fill in the blank <i>are</i> considered encyclopedic does not make lists of items of interest to the toy collector/hobbyist as opposed to the movie buff or philatelist <i>un</i>encyclopedic. This list is not indiscrimate per the nom. It is pretty definite and defined. The criticism that it will never be 'wikified' or expanded upon is a prediction of the future that given the debate here seems unlikely; if I'm wrong nominate it again after a period, but remember that not every list is dynamic: some lists are all that will ever occur about the subject (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hitchcock_cameo_appearances_3b1a.html" title="List of Hitchcock cameo appearances">List of Hitchcock cameo appearances</a> and there won't be any more of them). The concern about all the data coming in at one fell swoop is not surprising and doesn't sugges copyvio; collectors of Hot Wheels (or nearly anything else these days) maintain lists of the available items that may be added to their collections and check (British: tick) them off once acquired. And last, this is not advertising any more than Hitchcock's movies or the Post Office is being advertised by the other <i>approved</i> lists. I have a remaining concern which may show that this will be a maintained list: are these the <i>planned</i> hot wheels cars, or have all these been issued. If that's so, this list might be better to be made into a table, with the planned cars and a check box on whether their appearance has been verified. And to anticipate those critics who complain that "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball", as you cast your stones on that account, please first delete all references to the expected return of Comet Halley, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:42, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>comment</i> Lancer Radio is a 24 hour Broadcasted Radio Station. it is officially recognized by the Inter-Collegiate Broadcast Society it is also Registered with Sound Exchange. The Radio Station was officially recognized by the Tornament of Roses as an Official MEDIA/PRESS. The Lancer Radio was official recognized by the 2005 BET Awards and broadcasts Live the Pasadena City Council meetings. It was invited OFFICIALLY to the Inaugeration of LA Mayor Villagaroisa. Lancer Radio was recognized officially and was allowed to broadcast Live during a presentation by CA Gov Schwatzenegger. Lancer radio presents LIVE News coverage of National, Political, Sports, Gay and lesbian, and College News. Lancer radio also uses remote broadcast which many commercial radio stations do not have. lancer radio is not a class project. it is an independent chartered club which is student run. the website is up and running with in the next 3 weeks at www.lancerradio889.pasadena.edu. To consider Lancer radio as any less the Free radio Santa Cruz or Radio Caroline is idiotic. Lancer Radio is a well regulated radio station operated in accordance with FCC guidlines. Lancer Radio WAS formerly known as KPCS 88.9 Lancer radio has been broadcast for 20 plus years. it is has been officially recognized by the City of Pasadena, and the Pasadena Area Community College District. it has been invited by Schwatzenegger and Villagairosa to cover their event... and is an OFFICIAL MEMBER in good standing of the INTER-COLLIGIATE BROADCAST SOCIETY.. even many Licensed college radios do not have membership. Lancer radio has a fixed Location in a radio station with two fixed phone numbers one an official Contact Number (626)585-9285 and an Official request line at 626-792-6867.....it has talk showes and Music Programs with official recognition to air licensed music through sound exchange
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- the FCC license is what counts, and the official standards for broadcast notability don't even consider that a given. <a href="../../../w/t/b/WTBU_06ce.html" title="WTBU">WTBU</a> would be an example of a case where I would say keep (though I'm biased, I wrote the article) -- major university, World Wide Web presence, perhaps most importantly Howard Stern's first radio gig. WVBC, across town at Boston College, wouldn't rate -- I went to BC and nobody on campus even knew it existed (not to be confused with <a href="../../../w/z/b/WZBC_4cb0.html" title="WZBC">WZBC</a>, which is a major alt-rock station in the Boston market). And Radio Caroline and FRSC are notable for their own reasons -- Caroline for its years of influence on northern European listening habits, and FRSC for their stand against the FCC. Flea power stations are great. I want to run one myself. But there are other websites (such as the one I mentioned above, www.part15.us), where this information belongs. (BTW, my advice as someone with a passing interest in microbroadcasting: you'll get much better range on AM without the legal hassles of FM operation, which is really way too strict for its own good.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 23:48, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

For the record, I think the claims by this group are absurd. I don't think that should influence my thought on whether to keep or delete this article. If we can have articles on obscure <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> characters, certainly there's room for a controversial group that's been in the news and has notable people in it.

<p>tagged as speedy, but not really a speedy candidate. Much as I might want to support the British engineering industry (being a British engineering graduate) I find it hard to trace any claim to notability for this firm. No URL, Applegate listing is trivial and does not establish importance. Article as written is spam. CEMA usually means the Conveyor Equipment Manufacturers' Association, which is what most of the Googles return.

<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Ashley_e669.html" title="User:David Ashley">David Ashley</a> 16:55, 7 February 2006 (UTC) here. I'm a different guy, not a sock puppet. www.xdr.com/dash and you can see my own separate page. I never heard of AFM until I saw the slashdot article. I spent the time and read through the lectures. This is informed-layman level stuff. I'm still reeling with the implications. However I modified the page to tone down the claims, using words like "purported," and "If this theory is correct". My main reason for adding the page is because it didn't exist. I think there needs to be one. My opinion is there is a good chance the theory is going to prove out. Wikipedia can be an early source for information about this fellow. And if the article here is deleted, I think someone else will come right along and recreate it. At least let my effort be a jumping off point. Modify the article, don't wipe it out of existence.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> for now as crystalballism. I knew it sounded familiar when I saw the name. Slashdot linked this a few days ago.

<li>I hope you will consider keeping this entry. OC has more useful information for researchers than Fark.com, which also has a Wikipedia entry. Several other Wikipedia.com entries reference the election returns at OC.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am a proud member of this website, and registered merely to get across to you the point that OurCampaigns is a legitimate website. A valuable political resource with no real peer in its category. Like I said, several other "legitimate" Wikipedia articles point towards the site, so having this entry merely makes Wikipedia more complete. I've often thought of personally making the OC entry, but it seems users like those above spend far too much time finding information to delete. If anything, your wisdom should be put to use in other entries where there is inaccurate information, or entires that are considered "stubs" should be expanded. This would be of far better use to the "Wikipedia community" than trying to delete all incoming information that doesn't meet some rediculous criteria. If the arguments you all were using to delete it were true, why should we have an article on artist Van Gogh? Surely, selling only one painting in his lifetime doesn't make him a notable artist, does it? I should say right now that I do not represent the bulk of the OC community, I've always been known as the "iconoclast" and "troll" of the website because I use humor in a way to get a point across. Of course, I am reminded of some "no personal attack policy" above. If you feel that you are being attacked with the phrase "GET A BRAIN MORANS" you obviously are uncultured in the political realm, nor do you have a sense of humor. User:James Crews

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hi, this is the creator of the site. Sorry about some of the comments from a couple of our less politic users. I also didn't put my users up to this, they decided it on their own. I undertand that my site does not quite meet your policies for inclusion, and completely understand if you determine not to include it. I thought it would be helpful to provide some information to come to your decision. I'm not looking for advertising or a huge burst in traffic right now, because our server could not support it. We rely on the slow growth method. We are an extremely data intensive site, in some ways similar to Wikipedia by being a collaborative user effort. Because of this, we have a million or so virtual pages driven by a database. Many of the sites like Alexia and Google have limited information on us because I instruct them in the robots.txt file to not crawl the site. When several search engines try to crawl a million dynamically driven pages every few days it can bring the server to its knees. I am working on something to address this issue, but it will probably not be available for six months to a year. You can see the site statistics directly at <a href="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats" class="external free" title="http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/stats</a> if you wish, that show us getting between 1,500 and 4,500 unique visitors a day, 17,000 pageviews and around 40,000 hits. Those numbers increase sharply around election dates. We have gotten some press, some minor exposure on television news, but those are a bit out of date. We are a different enough site that we don't quite fit into categories for site competitions like best of blog contests as we are not a blog. We may not be a media sensation, but we are a very good data resource for people. Again, thanks for your consideration and if we are not accepted we will try again once we meet your criteria.

<li><b>LISTEN</b> Why are you Wikipedia regulars so hard headed? Listen. This was not a move for advertising. As Parker said, the last thing the site needs is a tremendous influx of users. Several articles point towards OurCampaigns. Why is the only criteria for entry into Wikipedia popularity? Are you seriously telling me something must be "popular" to warrant inclusion into an encyclopedia? How popular is the field of quantum physics? Not very, but it seems to have an entry. OurCampaigns doesn't deserve an entry because it is "popular" and listed on nerdy statistical websites, but rather because it is an expansive collection of political data maintained by every day people, much like this place. The only thing is, we are far more open minded towards data entry. You won't see anyone on OC complaining that the Slovakian presidential election wasn't "popular" enough to warrant inclusion. Excuse the "personal attack" but take your heads out of wherever they may be and look at the site before you actually judge in favor of deletion. This is supposed to be a community of intellectuals, not bickering teenagers concerned with popularity. user:James Crews

<li><b>Keep, but</b> do something about it, such as <b>rename</b> to something like "exploration (video game genre)". I'll admit that the term "non-linear exploration" was badly-conceived, but I think that this type of game is definitely a distinct sub-genre. The gameplay is definitely significantly different from other action-adventure games like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_World_902a.html" title="Super Mario World">Super Mario World</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Land_2_feed.html" title="Super Mario Land 2">Super Mario Land 2</a>--mainly, gameplay is continuous and features exploration. Some of these exploration games might not be very non-linear in overall their sequence of events--<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid_Fusion_ff2f.html" title="Metroid Fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/r/Castlevania%7E_Circle_of_the_Moon_c382.html" title="Castlevania: Circle of the Moon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a> come to mind, where path C must be taken before path D can be pursued, and so on--but the gameplay is nevertheless not subdivided into stages/levels, nor is it linearly arranged--you fall, climb, go right, go left, this way, that way so that you can find your way through the game. ~<a href="../../../g/m/h/GMH_5bae.html" title="GMH">GMH</a> <a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlenn_Magus_Harvey_59af.html" title="User talk:Glenn Magus Harvey"><i>talk to me</i></a> 20:43, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: "exploration" is part of many game genres, particularly the adventure-derivatives mentioned. Genres described in Wikipedia should exist (being recognized by more people than just yourself) before, check out <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Also, if you are proposing a new genre, it helps if you can give more examples since your original article circles all around the Metroid and Castlevania series. Those two game series are especially mentioned as action-adventure games! Their gameplay is different from the early Mario games because those are <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platform_game.html" title="Platform game">platform games</a>, not action-adventure. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArru_dab3.html" title="User:Arru">Arru</a> 14:23, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I have a distinct sense of deja vu here like this article, or a similar one has been to AfD before... This is basically a neologistic term for the <i>Morrowind</i> style videogames.

I don't think non-linear exploration is a defining genre of video games, but describing gameplay as non-linear or linear is a mainstay of game terminology. It is not a neologism, but a different term used when talking about linear or non-linear gamplay.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree about the term "non-linear exploration", problem is the contents of this page is an attempt to define a <i>genre</i> based on two game series (Castlevania and Metroid) and this term.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Busse was a professor of mine last year. His "publications" seem to have been updated to "articles" on the entry, though that issues really depends on your definition of "published" as his writings have been featured on ihaveanidea.org, tompeters.com, if.psfk.com, coudal.com and his blog site is considered a significant voice in the design field, named best in category by Applied Arts Magazine. That's uh, notable I'd say. And he's currently the VP of the GDC and nominamted to succeed Yves Rouselle as President of the GDC/BC this spring.Charlie111 23:16, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mark Busse’s qualifications have been questioned by means of the authenticity of his “Publications,” he is in fact in accordance with three of the stated criterion:</p>
<p>1. "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field." Mark’s design firm is top notch on a worldwide scale, his clients blanket the globe and stand by his product. Not only is he an internationally known Communication Designer (with awards to back him in print, interface design, and the current highly acclaimed blog.industrialbrand.com), he is also a valued member of the Vancouver art scene, having sold paintings locally and been recognized as a legitimate critic in regards to his degree in Fine Art.</p>
<p>2. "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." Mark has been actively involved in Canstruction Vancouver in support of the Food Bank since its inaugural year, he is a credited script editor on at least three indie/student films (A Beginning, Eating Crow, and Mega-force), and devotes innumerable amounts of time to the success of the non-profit Canadian Society of Graphic Designers.</p>
<p>3. "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more." A collaborative effort from Mark and Ben from IBC Published Fall 2005 in Graphic Exchange “Why should you have a blog?” in circulation throughout Canada to a lot more than 5 000 individuals. Mark’s interviews of Santa Monica’s Mike Goedecke of “Belief” and Toronto’s “Ze Frank” appear as padding on the IBC blog, but are anything but blog entries. These articles are for the betterment of the creative mind; they dive deeply into strategy, philosophy, and process, where these individuals’ mantras are made accessible to the general public. It is true that some of his articles appear on sites such as if.pfsk and blog.industrialbrand.com, but the fact that they may fall into the category of blog entry is only remotely valid, since the traffic and dedicated readers of these sites far surpass that of most published writers, as does the quality and content of the articles Mark writes.</p>
<p>In accompaniment to the above stated, Mark is on the forefront of Canadian Communication Design; he is a mentor to up and coming designers, he is an instructor at Vancouver Film School, and he is a keystone in the city of Vancouver though charitable contributions and the network of greatness he represents. I can see how some find it reasonable to consider Mark for deletion; however, he represents a new breed of writer/artist. His contributions may seem miniscule to those who are not active enthusiasts of digital culture, branding, design; this is his legacy and an understanding how influential he is may not surface until more people gain insight into his life.</p>
<p>Mark Busse’s Wikipedia page sits in a very infantile stage, it only shows crumbs of his story and appears quite vain. Revisions are needed, but it should definitely not be discarded.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> They are playing in Germany and while technically playing in another country would satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in letter, I don't think it does in spirit. Playing in one other EU country just doesn't really cut it for me. I live near the Canadian border in the U.S. and I know quite a few American bands who play in Toronto, Windsor, etc. Technically that could be considered an international tour but in reality they are no more notable for having played several shows accross the border than they were before those shows.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per itsmeltc. An American band going over the boarder to Canada would be something like an English band going to Scotland. Technically a different country, but not really international. Going from England to France, Germany, Holland, Sweden and Denmark (for example) most definately would be international.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> as per Isotope. By your standard, Jcuk, going from American Samoa (a US territory) to Western Samoa (30 miles west and similar to a passage between England and France via the channel) would be international. While the EU may not be the "US of Europe" just yet, in geographic terms it's no different than a band going on an eight-state tour (and two of those states are Canadian provinces).

<p>This is not a hoax! I use the damn algorithm every single day for my work with Oracle. It has serious problems in form as well as mathematical syntax. The 1,000 fold compression is only the result of billions of calculations per megabyte; totally impractical for any application, but tempting enough to consider research. I decided to post its existence on Wikipedia because of its limited exposure on the web. Thanks Wikipedia, in your hunt for perfection you are attacking a mathematical marvel.</p>

The factual information that exists in the first paragraph is already covered accurately in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Bulgaria_d036.html" title="Demographics of Bulgaria">Demographics of Bulgaria</a>. The second paragraph appears openly POV and xenophobic, without adding any valuable information in my opinion. It also has no pages linking to it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think "unrelentingly" is a case of hyperbole. I've seen a passing story about it on CNN. I've seen nothing on MSNBC. I don't watch FOXNews because it's not really news.

<dd>I was working at home (sick) yesterday with TV news in the background, and it was covered by CNN Headline every 30 minutes. I switched to MSNBC later in the day, and they ran virtually identical, relatively lengthy segments three times in three hours. I wish the comment was hyperbole, but it got about 100 times as Bush's much-needed program to increase the costs of college education in the US. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 21:01, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

But wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> and until the full facts are known and come out (as which they will undoubtly) I think it is best, as has often has being on wikipedia, not to write articles based purely on headlines and halfacts. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 23:13, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm neutral about this, as I don't think the tool is popular enough to have an article here saying more that can be found on its own homepage. OTOH, I don't see any particular reason to remove it either. Is it seen as advertising? What I can say is that it is gaining more and more popularity as Microsoft progressively increases the number of "hard-coded" programs bundled with its OSes. Probably most users find nLite when searching the Internet for a way to remove Internet Explorer. In any case nLite is already cited among external links in many Windows related or installation-related articles on Wikipedia such as <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipstream_%28computing%29.html" title="Slipstream (computing)">Slipstream (computing)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Removal_of_Internet_Explorer_93cf.html" title="Removal of Internet Explorer">Removal of Internet Explorer</a> and even <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>.

<dd><b>(The following are my reasons, they were also addressed in the talk page for this so the style reflects this as I pasted them here as well.)</b>
<ul>
<li>First, the sources listed for '<a href="../../../p/r/o/Producerism.html" title="Producerism">producerism</a>' are <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">questionable</a> including a <a href="http://producerism.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://producerism.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">personal advocacy</a> page set up by someone.</li>
<li>Second, (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</a>) Most of the people or groups listed as 'producerites' or whatever you call them are people, groups, party's who associate themselves with the traditional economic views of: <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_McKinley_c296.html" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>; or their party's: <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_Party_%28United_States%29_e117.html" title="Federalist Party (United States)">Federalist</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29_806f.html" title="Whig Party (United States)">Whig</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> (whose philosophy from 1861-1930's is mostly like Buchanan's today with a few exceptions) or the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>; called the <b>American System</b> by Senator <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clay_7415.html" title="Henry Clay">Henry Clay</a> of Kentucky.</li>
<li>Third, the 'producerism' article is an attack on that above mentioned system of economics and its proponents, grouping them as one and the same on all issues which is dubious to the extreme. For example, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">Conservative</a> on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_policy.html" title="Social policy">social policy</a>, but believes in a mild form of the old <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> of <b>Hamilton</b> and <b>Lincoln</b>, whereas, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Perot</a>'s ideas and those in the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America_7861.html" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> are in line with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> of economics mostly but he and the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America_7861.html" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> are neutral or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> (in some circumstances) on social policy. These men and party's and their <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> overall are not interchangeable and conflict on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_policy.html" title="Social policy">social policy</a> and therefore do not hold to a unified system such as 'producerism' at all.</li>
<li>Fourth, the personal attacks made on <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Larouche_d52f.html" title="Lyndon Larouche">Lyndon Larouche</a> (alluded to on his page here at Wikipedia) and others like <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">H.

Neither does <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> who is no different from other <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republicans</a> except he does not toe the line on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_policy.html" title="Foreign policy">foreign policy</a> (he holds to the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional.html" title="Traditional">traditional</a> policy of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_country.html" title="Neutral country">neutrality</a> expressed by Washington in his <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address_7f0a.html" title="Washington's Farewell Address">Farewell Address</a> mostly) or economics (he holds to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_%28economics%29_67c0.html" title="American System (economics)">American System</a> (Philadelphia School) of Economics of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Ben Franklin</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_C._Carey_d8a1.html" title="Henry C.

<li>Fifth, I am an educated man holding a degree in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Science_9900.html" title="Political Science">Political Science</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">History</a> with particular concentration on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_History_3d4e.html" title="American History">American History</a>. I have never heard of the word 'producerism' either in my field or in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a> before, except here and on a <a href="http://producerism.org/about.html" class="external text" title="http://producerism.org/about.html" rel="nofollow"><b>website</b></a> linked from here that is quite odd and does not contain a <b>DEFINITION of PRODUCERISM</b> that fits the men and the philosophies already mentioned <i>making this article even more suspicious</i>! The 'producerism' page wishes to give a negative impression to anyone who believes not in <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez_faire.html" title="Laissez faire">laissez faire</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> economics (Austrian School) or Planned Economy <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> economics (Marxist School) but in Traditional Capitalism or <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_System_1f67.html" title="American System">American System</a> (Philadelphia School) of economics as practiced by our nation prior to the 1970's, by associating it with such things as <i>Nazis, Fascists, Communists</i> and other negative groups whose sin was <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny.html" title="Tyranny">Tyranny</a> (see below).</li>
<li>Sixth, and this is a problem on the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> links as well...Fascism's main point is rule by an elite or single man combined with private ownership of corporations (sometimes less so as in Fascist Italy that was more <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialistic.html" title="Socialistic">Socialistic</a> in nature). Like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, it is a <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyranny.html" title="Tyranny">TYRANNY</a>, not because it attempts to regulate the economy in this way or that (as many philosophies share the same traits depending on belief see <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">Association fallacy</a> on Wikipedia) but because of its restriction on individual <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty.html" title="Liberty">LIBERTY</a> (the freedom to do all you wish to do so long as no physical harm is done to others) or invasions into ones <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privacy.html" title="Privacy">private life</a>. Not understanding this causes confusion and allows attackers of any belief system to try to lump different political philosophies through a <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</a> technique trying to discredit them.</li>
<li>Seventh, an article in <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia</a> should be as neutral as possible, simply description with true example etc. It should not be made up stuff, (any 'ISM could be proposed then!) in order to attack people like Mr. <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Larouche_d52f.html" title="Lyndon Larouche">Larouche</a> (your <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">personal page</a> states your <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">crusade</a> against another 'ism Larouchism? <b>Everything isn't an 'ism</b>!) or <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Perot_39f9.html" title="Ross Perot">Perot</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Buchanan_d9ff.html" title="Patrick Buchanan">Buchanan</a> or by association some of America's Founder's like <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">1st U.S. Treasury Secretary Hamilton</a> or America's Father's like <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">President Lincoln</a> who believed the same way as the before mentioned men on economic matters.

<dd>Comments: <b>Producerism.</b> I did not create the page on producerism, contrary to the false claim by Northmeister. The term is used in political science, history, and sociology, not as a guilt by association canard, contrary to the false and hyperbolic claims by Northmeister. Academic cites are listed on the page. <b>Conspiracism.</b> A term used in academia, and popularized by Mintz, an academic. This is another attempt by a fan of convicted criminal and crackpot Lyndon LaRouche to delete material that is critical of the type of conspiracy theories and dubious right-wing populist economic theories promoted by the LaRouchites; such as their idiosyncratic analysis of the "American System" political tradition. Academic cites are listed on the page.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 04:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Both pages have cites to known marxist oriented (see their links for proof) and left wing political sites. I am NOT an advocate for Lyndone LaRouche except as to prevent character assassination from Cbert and synarchists like him, where does that come from? and personal attacks like that with no proof is not right for a forum like this? If you see the so-called "academic" links on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Producerism.html" title="Producerism">producerism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracism.html" title="Conspiracism">conspiracism</a> page they are from the same site "<b>The Public Eye</b>" an advocacy site, not an academic site or credible source, and other authors listed write for that site. Some articles listed have nothing to do with the topic but talk of 'Populism', yet are listed as if they speak of Producerism in word. I do not make links to political sites or advocacy and neither should those links be listed as credible, they have an axe to grind just look at his diatribes against people he calls 'Right Wing'. Calling me right wing is like calling Marx a Capitalist, give me a break. Guilt By Association folks is not Facts and he does it again towards me, trying to link me to LaRouche. Check the site of his out you will see its marxist sentiment. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 14:16, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article was nominated for deletion, it has been improved. And clearly, Jennifer Diane Reitz has created two webcomics worthy of Wikipedia articles, so that is another factor to consider. Reitz is also well known among the transsexual community, giving her another area of notability. I think there are plenty of other people with Wikipedia articles who are no more notable than Reitz, so I think that with some improvement, this may be a very good article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrea_Parton_302a.html" title="User:Andrea Parton">Andrea Parton</a> 00:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A great article could be written on the subject, but this is not it. It isn't wiki-formatted, and it looks like it was cut-and-pasted from elsewhere. Finally, the "Books by Sybil Leek" section is clearly some sort of advertising-related abuse of the wiki. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 23:01, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Interesting, It looks very like copyvio from somewhere, but the many Google hits on it are all various ebcyclopædic sites. Not a bad article at all, apart from the silly list of Sybil Leek publications. I vote <b>weak keep</b> though it needs a good deal of cleanup and verification that it's not a cut 'n' shut job promoting Silver Ravenwolf or somebody similar.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> &#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 23:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I really don't agree that it is well-written, but I'm also not the final authority on that. At the very least, if it is kept, it needs to be edited for NPOV, heavily sourced (with sources other than Sybil Leek), and a section needs to be added commenting on fundamentalist Christian witchcraft mythology. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 00:33, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Reason Julian Malt 00:00, 8 February 2006 (UTC)I feel that the first essay, having been innapropriately titled, has every right to be re-submitted to the archive with a more suitable name. If you would like to provide a more justifiable reason for why it should be deleted please do so. However, i fell that this will be in vain as it is a very good essay. Please note that this is a serious point!</p>
