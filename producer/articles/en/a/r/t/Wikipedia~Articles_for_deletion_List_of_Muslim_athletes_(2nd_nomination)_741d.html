<li><b>Comment</b>. In some countries Islam begets <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Sharia</a> which governs all aspects of life, religious and secular. Every aspect of life is ruled by Islam, including athletics, hence <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_athletics.html" title="Islamic athletics">Islamic athletics</a>. Equally validly Islamic basketweaving can be written about (no fair depicting Mohammed in your basket! Must wear a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burqa.html" title="Burqa">burqa</a> when weaving outside!). Leading to List of Muslim basketweavers. I'm not sure I see the encyclopedia-worthiness of all that. What do these lists mean? As a reader, am I to get a list of people living under a specific type of legal system or people who are devout Moslems (evidence please?) or what? <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 15:44, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's not eligible for speedy deletion. The article has been deleted five times, but the version of the article deleted by the previous AFD was a bare empty list. It's since been speedied twice under CSD:G4, but I don't think it's valid for speedy deletion in the current form as it's not speediable under any other criterion now, and it's not the same as the article that was deleted before.

<li>Depicting Mohamed in the weave of a basket is an example of what Islam forbids (according to some scholars, not all). Depicting Mohamed in a basket is idolatry, i.e. an "ansab" (what, no article on that?! Probably under some other name I can't find at the moment.) <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_athletics.html" title="Islamic athletics">Islamic athletics</a> discusses other similar Islamic principles such as <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijab.html" title="Hijab">hijab</a> and <a href="../../../a/w/r/Awrah.html" title="Awrah">awrah</a>. Is using ansab as an example less civil than mentioning hijab and awrah? In an AfD is a discussion please let's find a balance between <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and tip-toeing around delicate word play that restricts genuine exchange of opinion. Or, in other words, try to focus on the issues rather than work hard to take comments the worst possible way and to get offended. You are rather quick to cite others of incivility when it is somewhat possible you don't understand the point they are making (which, again, is entirely possibly in a large part due to me not being a native speaker of English! Also comments in an AfD are written in an unusually curt form due to the need to get the point across quickly; this requires even further positive attitude (assume good faith) from the reader. Again my apologies if I was too brief in my rationale earlier.

<li>An important reason to delete all lists of this type is that there is no "authority" who can decide who is Muslim and who is not (or Christian, or Jewish, or people who love cats). Therefore, the compilation of the list is POV, which does not belong on Wikipedia. People who want these lists should set up a website for them.

<li><b>Keep</b> - As long as many <i>muslim athletes</i> are keen to relate their profession w/ their confession. How many of these people pray before competing? How many thank God/Allah after winning? How many refuse to sing national anthems before starting?
