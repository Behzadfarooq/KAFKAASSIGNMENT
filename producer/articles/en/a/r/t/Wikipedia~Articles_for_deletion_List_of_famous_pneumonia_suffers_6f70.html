<li><b>Abstain / Comment.</b> I moved the list from <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">Pneumonia</a> and take blame for the misspelling - should be "sufferers".

<li>If people really care, <b>Rename</b>: Most of these people died from pneumonia.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I don't really feel this belongs here, and that this article is in the same class as the recently VFD's List of notable people who have been stung by jellyfish. It's borderline nonsensical, and can be difficult to verify. However, if discussion is in place elsewhere, or an editor is desiring to be bold and merge/move it elsewhere, I don't want to slap a delete vote on it. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 01:55, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as it is part of the collaboration. Some of this information probably would belong in the larger <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">Pneumonia</a> article but was, in the minds of the collaborators on this project, large enough to merit its own space.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Pneumonia was likely the most common cause of death before the advent of modern <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antibiotics.html" title="Antibiotics">antibiotics</a> - mind you, we've only had those since the 1940s when they first started mass producing <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penicillin.html" title="Penicillin">penicillin</a>. Therefore, it's highly likely that a high number of famous before this would have died of pneumonia. If we left this list, in a few months it'll have thousands of names. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 04:45, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>D</b>elete. Not everything notable people do or have if notable in itself. Only cases which have created lasting media exposure, e.g. as Kylie Minogue has done to breast cancer in Australia, would be notable, and I cannot see any examples in this llist. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 20:08, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't care if it was split out from the <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> article, it should have just been removed from it. Although to answer cynical, afor the purposes of Wikipedia, if a person has an article, then they can be considered famous enough to be on that kind of list. But in this case, the list is lame and should die. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:29, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Who defines 'famous'&#160;? And if we accept this, we'll have to put together lists for all the people who were killed by cancer, measles, lightning strike, or choking on candied frogs dipped in chocolate. Not to mention famous people who died (a) in their baths, (b) in their beds, (c) in other people's beds, and (d) whilst hanging naked from a trapeze eating chocolate-dipped frogs.

<li><b>Delete</b> - pneumonia has been too common as a cause of death, not to mention as a sickness; the list would include thousands of famous historical names.

It would provide a useful starting point to consider the wild/tammed nature of elephants etc.</p>
