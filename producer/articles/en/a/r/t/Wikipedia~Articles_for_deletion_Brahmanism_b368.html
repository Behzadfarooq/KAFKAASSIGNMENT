<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, as Brahmanism is the old term for the relgion in the West.

<li><b>redirect</b>, unless someone turns it into an article on the history of the term itself.

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> - Britannica has a distinct article <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9016159?query=Brahmanism&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9016159?query=Brahmanism&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on the subject.

<ul>
<li>Both Vedic religion and Brahmanism have separate articles in Britannica. Vedic religion refers to the religion of IA people who moved into India around 1500 BC. Brahmanism refers to the religion of ancient India that evolved out of Vedism. Specifically, "Brahmanism is distinguished from the classical Hinduism that succeeded it by the enhanced significance given in classical Hinduism to individual deities, such as Śiva and Vishnu, and to devotional worship (bhakti)." <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 10:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all, this is not Britannica. The content here needs to pass <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I don't think there are any books written by the modern authors of today (other than the 1911 Britannica) that refer to Brahmanism at all. Anyway, the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmanism.html" title="Brahmanism">article</a> itself says that Brahmanism is also known as <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. BTW, the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_invasion_theory.html" title="Aryan invasion theory">"IA" theory</a> is seriously questioned by today's academics.--Babub 11:09, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Indeed IA theory may well be questioned, but that doesn't negate the need for an article about it. WP:Verifiability says: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers." I consider Encyclopedia Britannica a reputable piece of published work and hence an entry for Brahmanism automatically means that it is worthy of a place here. I'm not saying the content of the current article is perfect, but there still needs to be a separate article. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 11:16, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is an <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_invasion_theory.html" title="Aryan invasion theory">article</a> about IA theory already.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Brahminism is the term for certain real and distinct religious practices. To put it in somewhat simplistic terms, Brahminism is Hinduism as practised by Brahmins. It draws heavily from vedic and puranic traditions. On the other hand Hinduism is the collective term for all religious currents prevalent in the collective Hindu populace. To give just one example, while the worship of Sai Baba - a Muslim holy man of early 20th centuary - can certainly be called Hinduism, it will be too far fetched to describe it as Brahminism. <a href="../../../s/i/s/User%7ESisodia_a2d7.html" title="User:Sisodia">Sisodia</a> 04:35, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "distinct" religion as practised by Brahmins comes under "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>"; and, really, is Sai Baba even an argument <b>for</b> Brahmanism?

<dd>Which pretty much covers everything present in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmanism.html" title="Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a>&#160;:).

<dd>Nope, I meant that there are some people who categorise the revival of Hinduism under, say, the Guptas, as that of a particular strand of thought that did not include several modern strands that are, for example, more inspired by the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhakti_Movement_ec08.html" title="Bhakti Movement">Bhakti Movement</a> of the 11th c. So the point is that Hinduism as we know it is an agglomeration of not only forms of philosophy, but of practices and the consequent social structures; and there is place in WP for articles that examine all those various components. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 03:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Would be interesting if we have sufficient information about the term itself, like how it originated, how it went into disuse, etc. That would make a good article, as <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> suggested. An article on <i>Brahmanism as a term</i> is worth keeping, but on <i>Brahmanism as a religion/sect</i> is not, simply because there's no such religion/sect separate from mainstream Hinduism. For instance, religious followers are determined by self-description, and no one describes(/ever described) oneself as a Brahmanist. Also, there are hints of the authority of Brahmins being questioned even in the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigveda.html" title="Rigveda">Rigveda</a> (see article), and in any case, such authority has only slowly (first increased and then) decreased over centuries, so it would be hard to distinguish religious beliefs over centuries based on that parameter. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 14:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Nuttah. In addition, in response to deeptrivia, the fact that people self-identify themselves as Hindus does not mean that their beliefs cannot be systematised in some other way. <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya_Samaj_19a5.html" title="Arya Samaj">Arya Samaj</a> hinduism is distinct in many ways from other forms of Hinduism.
