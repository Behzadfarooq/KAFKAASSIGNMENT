<li><b>Comment - Note to closing administrator:</b> There has been criticism of those who have supported retention of this article who have made reference to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>, an effort to create clear objective standards for which school articles should be retained, and which should be deleted. While the guideline did not achieve consensus, it is light years ahead of any other guideline, and stands in stark contrast to the utter lack of any meaningful Wikipedia guideline used by school deletion voters, who have resorted elsewhere to rather insightful "arguments" for deletion, such as "Secondary school, ergo not notable" or "Delete all schools below the university level" or "a random public high school", with the helpful suggestion that redirecting from the schools "to really offensive sex acts" would be an acceptable alternative. It's time that we stopped the staggering waste of time playing AfD Roulette, in which nearly every single high school article (with minimal exceptions) with any meaningful content is retained, demonstrating a clear consensus and explicit precedent for retaining such articles. I recognize that there are those who prefer some arbitrarily high standard for retaining such articles, but unfortunately we have no consensus on these self-imposed made-up standards, let alone anything that approaches the comprehensive, good faith effort to do so at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. If <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is unsatisfactory, let's see an alternative standard that will achieve consensus in the community, or even the faintest evidence of an attempt at achieving such a consensus guideline. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even following the rejection of the policy cited in my original rationale (regardless of its misrepresentation later on in the discussion), I still incline towards a <b>weak keep</b>, due to its status as a selective (and therefore harder-to-get-into) school and the fact that at least one former student went on to bigger and better things. It's barely a step above the average school, but that near-step is enough for me. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Did you even read <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>? It says POST-Secondary schools are notable. I can't believe a non-notable school is getting so many keep votes.

<ul>
<li>Right, first of all <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is a <i>proposed</i> guideline. Learn and understand the difference and don't attempt to quote it as established policy and expect to be taken seriously. Second, as should be obvious, many people do believe that all secondary schools are notable, and given the fact that most such articles are kept, they appear to be in the majority. May I suggest that you remember that your opinion is just that, an <i>opinion</i>. Because it's yours does not make it correct. We are all entitled to our opinions, and because you disagree does not make us wrong. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 14:25, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It doesn't quite say that. What is says is that a school may warrant a separate article if it verifiably meets one of a series of criteria. It would be worthy of "comprehensive coverage" if it's a post-secondary school or part of a series on a particular school district (I assume "comprehensive coverage" means "an article the size of those we have on the major universities of the world"). Given that it verifiably meets the criterion of having a notable alumna (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_Pittman_8f57.html" title="Jana Pittman">Jana Pittman</a>), that may explain some of the keep votes. Not all, mind you, but certainly some. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:01, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's a common argument, which I'm very reluctant to accept. I think that we should separate the waters: if there are notable alumni from this school, then we should have articles about them and their notable achievements, not their schools. I can't also regard the fact of this school being selective as notability. There's thousands of selective schools and that is really no big deal. Besides, if we were to keep only elitist schools then it would pretty much turn Wikipedia into a vehicle for advertising those institutions, while at the same time discriminating other not-so-selective schools. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 18:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There seems to be some misunderstanding about whether a school's own website is a reliable source of information. In fact, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote it, and where the material is:</p>
<ul>
<li>relevant to the self-publisher's notability;</li>
<li>not contentious;</li>
<li>not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing;</li>
<li>about the subject only and not about third parties or events not directly related to the subject;</li>
</ul>
The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all.</blockquote>
<p>On that basis, a school's website can be a useful source of information. Sometimes school administrators lie or try to cover things up, but in general the enrolment figures or the history of the school are likely to be described accurately if incompletely on the site. (By "incompletely", I mean that a school's own history may ignore or gloss over past misconduct by students, teachers or administrators that may be relevant.) --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 06:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was going to give up on voting down non-notable high schools, but WP:SCHOOLS has been rejected and it seemed to be the only thing making these articles the least bit legitimate. There are thousands of high schools in the US alone and when you take in all secondary schools across the globe (can't even imagine how many there are in India or China, for example) do we really need to have articles for all of them? This is not a directory, we don't have articles for every hospital, every business, every police station, etc. nor do we need them for all high schools. High schools are are relatively the same and Wikipedia is not the proper source to look up there differences. Certainly, there are going to be some (very few) exceptions, but this isn't one of them. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 08:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To be fair, is there any reason to assume that the deletion of an article on a school would result in editors from that school packing up and leaving the project? Deletion of an article on a subject dear to someone's heart is hardly a "betrayal", regardless of what some contributors might want to claim at various times, and neither is a hypothetical betrayal of a group of editors particularly likely to see them leave <i>en masse</i>. As far as the claim that "all schools are notable", that isn't something that's been determined by consensus - flawed as it was and rejected as it is, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> was an attempt to codify exactly which schools were notable, and it certainly didn't result in every single school being deemed notable by a long way. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would have to see the sources that are hypothesized to give a definitive answer. My general belief is that the sources would need to contain significant discussion of the school itself.

<ul>
<li>Guinea and Equatorial Guinea, I'd delete them both. And why not toss in Guyana for that matter. What on earth does a story about someone trying to delete countries have to do with high schools? Besides wouldn't the more relevant precedent -- the fact that about 99% of all high school articles with any meaningful content survive AfDs -- justify retention of this and all such articles, based on precedent? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First of all, the deleted countries have generally been microstates with only one or two inhabitants - the point remains that if even countries don't get inherent notability it is hard to see how schools (which generally lie within countries) should. Furthermore, surviving AfD is very different than being kept. The AfDs frequently close with no consensus and are even occasionally deleted. This is despite the fact that the keeps sometimes result from borderline votestacking. Furthermore, precedent is by itself a very weak argument for keeping something - there is nothing wrong with revisiting it when necessary. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So if I understand correctly, precedent is that any microschools with one or two students should be deleted, but larger schools should be retained. And if precedent is "a very weak argument" for retention, why would you just use it to justify deletion? I agree that issues should be revisited, but we seem to be revisiting these issues two or three times each day, and the precedent that we're setting is that high school articles with a bare minimum of content are kept as a matter of course. If you look through most AfDs, the overwhelming majority of articles are deleted, often based on the votes of a relatively small number of individuals who spend much of their day participating in such AfDs, deciding if articles meet their own personal preferences. And while your general opposition to most such articles may lead you to see votestacking, what I see is that the fact that schools generate so much strong interest, with substantial numbers of people taking the time to vote for their retention, is evidence of broad support for schools. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point was that if precedent matters then one has the issue that not even countries are inherently notable. Once we have gotten to the point that entities are not inherently notable, Librarians above claim fails and therefore would require at minimum more justification. As for the votestacking issue, even at least one user in favor of keeping schools in general User:Forbidden Word, thinks that it is votestacking as well (only he seems to see that as a good thing). That schools are continually being AfDed would indicate at minimum that that there is a substantial minority which disagrees with the process. Indeed, when non-school editors comment on a school AfD they are more likely to go with deletion than retention, indicating that the prevailing consensus among Wikipedians is not to keep all these schools. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good grief, your last sentence is one hell of a leap of logic! Incidentally, I'm not entirely sure how you're defining votestacking here. Is that anyone who registers a vote you don't agree with? Because I see the same names voting for deletion on pretty much every school AfD as well as the same names voting for retention. Therefore if anyone is votestacking, the deleters are doing it every bit as much as the keepers, except they're demonstrably not getting so much support. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:30, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
