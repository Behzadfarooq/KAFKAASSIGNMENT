<li><b>Comment</b> (by nominator) The votes for merge do not address what content in the nominated article is to be merged. Since the nominated article contains no verified information, a merge would consist of a pageblank/redirect at the nominated article, and possibly creating an empty stub section at at the merged-to article.

<li>In the creator's defense, I think the only common ground these share is that these songs <i>may</i> have charted on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard.html" title="Billboard">Billboard</a> or somesuch at one point or another, and many of them are good songs. Hell, I like <a href="../../../e/n/y/Enya.html" title="Enya">Enya</a>, especially her early stuff. But, as is also pointed out here in the AfD post, there's too broad of a definition to what constitutes a "key song" to new age music, and frankly, I'm not about to go researching these songs on Billboard to see if they charted at all. That, and as per what <a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> pointed out, this looks an awful lot like somebody's iPod playlist. <b>Delete</b>. --71.216.9.26 07:53, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Reason The Sign of Four 02:43, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article has no place in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Quotes about speculated cosmetic surgery and dress code belong in a gossip magazine, not an encyclopedia. A name is less popular than it was ten or twenty years ago? That is the rule, not an exception. A married woman keeps her surname? Honestly, I wonder who wrote this article.</p>
<p>Any real controversy should be posted to the main article and discussed there. It's my opinion that nothing in this article qualifies though.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> The Sign of Four,as a procedural issue, could you please set forth the specific Wikipedia policy or policies that demonstrate why you believe this article should be deleted?

But these are matters that have come up fairly often regarding HRC. The remark about cosmetic surgery came from her Republican opponent in the Senate race this year, not a gossip mag. The Tammy Wynette and baking cookies remarks were famous fiascos and got tons of media attention in 1992 and thereafter. The name changing bit is also clearly important, as it had political ramifications in Arkansas at the time and she made a big point of restoring the 'Rodham' officially in 1993. Like her or not, HRC has taken a unique path through American life and encountered or triggered various cultural rifts along the way; this article's purpose is to document those. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 02:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In is normal to make a decision based on the topic being notable, rather than the article being notable as is, or being too dull. If we delete it <i>in the mean time</i> then there will be no stub to improve. There are many stub pages on Wikipedia - but over time they get better. Agree a picture will help - if I were not 6000 km away, I'd pop over and take one. If we keep this page, there is a much great chance someone will add a pic.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 19:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Upon my nomination of this article, I had no idea about the WP:Australia naming conventions and the article <i>really was</i> just a lot of the same from the Dubbo, NSW article with no distinction between the Local Government Area and the city itself.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamec_491a.html" title="User:Grahamec">Grahamec</a> has done a lot of work on sorting out the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_government_area.html" title="Local government area">LGA</a> content separate from the town content in NSW over the last week. He started by creating all the new articles and I expect will continue to sort out the content. This was caused by earlier editors attempting to keep LGA and town content in one article. This has led to confusion in some cases (Dubbo may not have been one - not sure) as the names often correspond. Some other states have "always" had separate town and LGA articles. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:24, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Here are some points for your consideration:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>1. The MAGAZINE is the FIRST AND ONLY ALL-INCLUSIVE MAGAZINE IN WISCONSIN. It is a milestone in itself. 2. <b>The publisher has received various certificates of recognition from the governor of Wisconsin, the Dane County executive, and the Mayor of the City of Madison</b>3. Most recently, the publisher and editor received the 2006 Journalist of the year award for the State of Wisconsin from the US Small Business Administration. 4. Asian Wisconzine is the ONLY VENUE for discussions of issues being faced by Asian Americans in contemporary America.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It was clearly started as an advertisement, and one award doesn't make it notable enough to stay. While I am sympathetic to minority groups, especially in America, I'm not sympathetic enough to let this stay. Also, this is another case of the word 'Asian' being used only to refer to people from East Asian countries, like China and Japan. Asia is a gigantic continent, stretching from Palestine to Japan, with more cultural diversity than any other continent. Please learn this. I could go on about how 'race' hasn't been an accepted concept in Anthropology since the '60s, but you get the picture. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack-Velvet_7592.html" title="User:Black-Velvet"><font face="Rage Italic" size="3" color="black">Black-Velvet</font></a> 07:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

Being a magazine isn't notable; being the first (anything)-in-Wisconsin is probably not notable; being the first (ethnic group)-(anything)-in-Wisconsin even less so. Being in a local time capsule (link given as evidence by creator) isn't notable. Simultaneously claiming it's an "Asian" magazine and "ALL-INCLUSIVE MAGAZINE" (whatever that means) at the same time sounds like grasping for excuses - not that it's evidence of non-notability in itself. Author invites people to come to Madison WI to get proof - lack of verifiability outside Madison <i>is</i> strong evidence of non-notability.

<dd>Also, I checked the claim to have been "featured" in The Weekly Voice newspaper (a Canadian newspaper for South Asian newspapers). The Voice has digital pdf copies of its editions online. The only mentions of Thakkan I can find are 1) an advertisment for the radio show 2)a letter to the editor<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22jatin+thakkar%22+weekly+voice&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22jatin+thakkar%22+weekly+voice&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. The Markham paper is a much smaller local paper and does have online digital copies or news archives beyond 14 days. However, in light of the Voice instance, I think its reasonable to think that the claim that Thakkan was "featured" on the cover of this newspaper means another advert. In any case The Weekly Voice and The Markham Economist are not weighty enough publications to support encyclopedic notability even if the features were genuine journalistic articles <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:45, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As I posted on the article, <i>In 1946, Emily Stuart helped her husband and other relatives establish a weekly newspaper called Town Topics that has been published in Princeton since 1946. On April 4, 1989, Emily Stuart, 74, was found stabbed to death in the basement of her stately Mercer Street home in a quiet neighborhood near Princeton University.</i> This family owned paper has been around since 1946. Given that its family owned, the stabbing event, and that the paper has been around since 1946, more research is bound to reveal enough information to move the article well above the notability criteria threshold. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 07:36, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as if that wasn't already a foregone conclusion. This is proof that in order to really know what to keep and what to delete, you have to have a bit of imagination, assume good faith (even when it seems improbable), and be willing to do some research. The topic hasn't changed a bit, but the perception of it has been matured by UncleG's treatment of it. Even the first two sentences are virtually identical to their original stub version.

<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b> as a simple re-hash of the product advertising. A quick search on the names of the authors cited turned up the product's advertisement hosted on an "about the seller" page at eBay. The article is a straight lift of the potted quotations in the "what the experts are saying about our product" section of the product advertisement. There is no reason to suppose that this selection of opinions is neutral, representative, or presented in adequate context. There may be an encyclopaedia article to be had on this product. But simple paraphrasing of an advertisement is <i>not</i> how to construct an encyclopaedia article. A re-hash of an advertisement results in another advertisement. <b>Wikipedia is not an advertising service.</b> It is unacceptable to host this advertisement on a Wikipedia page whilst we await a proper encyclopaedia article (if one is possible) to be written. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:31, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> For all you people who want to delete this article, do you feel India's race is clear? There has been a lot of controversy over this. Recently in 2006, genetic studies placed them closest with indigenous Australians, Southeast Asians and East Asians, but in 1994 genetic studies placed them with Europeans. Even today the debate between mostly Australasian or Caucasian exists as it did 100 years ago. The whole article is necessary. If this article did not exist, the demographics of India article would need to take one side of the debate, violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 15:23, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>This is what will happen when you delete the article. A Caucasoid advocate such as User:Sugaar and User:VeritasetSeveritas will add to the Demographics of India article that India is clearly Caucasoid. Then I will have to add that there is debate over the subject. That is why this article was originally created. A while ago I felt as ya'll do that this is pseudo-science, so I removed a link from the Demographics India article to this one. As soon as I unlinked this article from the main demographics of India article, a Caucasoid advocate wrote that India was clearly Caucasoid, so I had to re-provide a link from that article to this one. After everyone decides to delete this article, I will be the one who has to guard the demographics India article because another Caucasoid advocate will try to violate WP:NPOV and push their views about race.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 15:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> When the Caucasoid advocates comes back after this article is deleted, I will stand alone to argue with him/her. You people will not be there to argue with them. It is fine and good that ya'll feel this article should not exist because races don't exist or something, but this high-minded belief will only cause what it seeks to erase. Unless ya'll are willing to enforce this after the article is deleted, then it should stay. I will need the citations on this article in order argue and keep the subject representing all sides of the debate. The Caucasoid advocate will not listen to the oft said phrase "races don't exist" based on my word or that India is not clearly Caucasoid.--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 15:53, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Those kinds of genetic studies have similar results applying to all racial/ethnic groups, not just Indians. But as race and ethnicity is socially, politically (and bureaucratically - there was a brief period in the 1970s (if I remember right) when South Asians in the US were defined as "white" by a government census department for practical administrative rather than sociological/anthropological reasons) defined, they are only part of the discourse, and not a defining part. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 17:21, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is no person called "Vatul Gothram", mentioned in the last para. The writer of the article does not even get the name right, the given link does not work, the writer does not even know what is 'gothram'&#160;; he or she is under the impression that this refers to a person's name. Such a complete ignoramus has the cheek to write about 'racial groups in India'. If this writer can write about Indian society, then Bin Laden can become a Shakespeare professor. - Vijay</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

As odd as this article is, it isn't original research. When I saw that the only source mentioned <i>in this article</i> is Dave Barry, I almost despaired.

<p>Erect nipples is not really a slang term as much as a physiological response. This article provides no useful information and may exist just to show two photos of breasts. Any useful scientific information is contained on the <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipples.html" title="Nipples">nipples</a> page. Also, very little links to the page; I don't see a point to its existence. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 10:42, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is proposed that <b>Tiger Stadium</b> be moved to <b>Tiger Stadium (Detroit)</b> as to disambiguate it from other Tiger Stadiums. This requires four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current Tiger Stadium (Detroit) redirect be deleted.</li>
<li>The current Tiger Stadium article be moved to Tiger Stadium (Detroit).</li>
<li>Tiger Stadium (disambiguation) be moved to Tiger Stadium.</li>
<li>Tiger Stadium (disambiguation) then be deleted. <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlibirigit_3d7f.html" title="User:Flibirigit">Flibirigit</a> 12:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmmmm.... I'm struggling to determine if when someone types in "Tiger Stadium", do they mean the baseball stadium or LSU's stadium? I also wonder what the Wikipedia precendence is for moving an article to a disambiguation page? I'd say that a MLB baseball stadium has more importance than a college football stadium, regardless of capacity, but I'm not sure about a closed-down baseball stadium.</p>
<p>I guess I'm not sure that all the work that went into moving "Tiger Stadium" to "Tiger Stadium (Detroit)" was worth it, or even appropriate. <a href="../../../x/9/6/User%7EX96lee15_8d24.html" title="User:X96lee15">X96lee15</a> 22:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>That <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28Detroit%29_4914.html" title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)">Tiger Stadium (Detroit)</a> as it exists to be deleted for the reasons, it does NOT INCLUDE the edit history of the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_b9aa.html" title="Tiger Stadium">Tiger Stadium</a> article. These edit histories are essential to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>That a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">REQmove</a> be done to merge and perserve edit histories. <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlibirigit_3d7f.html" title="User:Flibirigit">Flibirigit</a> 05:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry for not discussing the "move" and sorry for not realizing how to properly move an article. I didn't think there would be anything controversial about the two major Tiger Stadiums agreeing not to hog the Tiger Stadium page. As for the edit history issue, I didn't think that would be a big deal. By moving Tiger Stadium to Tiger Stadium (Detroit), the old edit history would still always be at the original Tiger Stadium page for anyone who wanted to go back there looking for something. As you know, what I did was I cut-and-pasted the Tiger Stadium page over to Tiger Stadium Detroit. But I also did a google search to find all the instances of "Tiger Stadium" on wikipedia, and I went to a large number of those pages and changed the all links that pointed to Tiger Stadium and changed them so that they now point to Tiger Stadium (Detroit). Once again, sorry about that, but I didn't think it would be controversial. Anyway, the point is that this isn't something that is going to go away. In the years to come, more and more people will get frustrated by the fact that Detroit is hogging the Tiger Stadium page. Before the Tiger Stadium page was created on behalf of Detroit's Tiger Stadium, the creator should have searched the internet to make sure their wasn't any other major Tiger Stadium out there. Because of his or her negligence, that is why the situation is the way it is today. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwopbop_9d16.html" title="User:Wikiwopbop">Wikiwopbop</a> 06:27, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As per discussions above, I am inviting comments on whether the <b>Tiger Stadium</b> namespace should be the <b>status quo,</b> (reserved for the soon to be demolished baseball stadium in Detroit), or should it be <b>switched</b> to disambiguation page for all <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28disambiguation%29_75d7.html" title="Tiger Stadium (disambiguation)">Tiger Stadiums</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Switch</b> Even though I am sentimentally attached to Tiger Stadium as a Detroit Tigers fan, I don't think a soon to be demolished stadium is prevalent enough to keep as a main namespace when there are other existing Tiger Stadiums. <a href="../../../f/l/i/User%7EFlibirigit_3d7f.html" title="User:Flibirigit">Flibirigit</a> 10:38, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Switch</b> I must admit that I am biased towards LSU and do a lot of work on LSU related pages, but the rational, unbiased side of me still believes that a switch to the disambiguation page is appropriate. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancp_b3a8.html" title="User:Seancp">Seancp</a> 20:58, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Switch</b> Granted that nobody outside the United States looking for "Tiger Stadium" is likely to know of the LSU stadium (or even of LSU or college sports in general), but if Tiger Stadium in Detroit is going to be demolished it shouldn't be the default. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 13:10, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article is composed of normative rather than factual statements (e.g. statements that African American transsexuals shouldn't be 'lumped together' with the community as a whole), original research about gender roles in the black community and general statements that would better belong in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexuality.html" title="Transsexuality">Transsexuality</a> article. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 15:27, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure. Perhaps there is a different enough cultural mindset on this issue to warrant an article like there is with certain American Indian groups and the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Spirit_bbfb.html" title="Two-Spirit">Two-Spirit</a> idea. However I'm not really convinced of that, although I do believe there are parts of Africa that do have different cultural contexts on sexuality or gender.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Comment</b> The editor who nominated this for deletion is removing a lot of published citations from reliable sources about the history and prevalence of transsexualism. See the talk page for more. The last section of the article as it stands should probably be removed in its entirety. It's entirely original research bolstered with very weak citations. <s>I'd vote merge/redirect</s> (though the transsexuality article is already too long), but I would preserve some of the clinical data deleted today. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 20:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm planning to merge some of this into the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexualism.html" title="Transsexualism">Transsexualism</a> article and have copied some of the content to do so--of course anyone is welcome to merge anything I missed using a version before the AfD notice. Most of the references are general discussions/studies of gender roles and tranvestitism/homosexuality in the black community, or transsexuality in general and anything of value should be moved there. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 23:06, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Nothing in the content (I use that word loosely) provided herein asserts that there is anything particular enough about African American transsexuality to distinguish it from other -- forms? strains? trends? if this is notable, I can't wait for the flood of articles on Polish-American transsexuality, German-Romanian transsexuality, Arab-Brazilian transsexuality, et. al.

<li><b>Comment</b> - In the comics fan scene, this is an <i>extremely</i> notable website. When there is a new Batman film coming out, the directors and producers leak their spoilers and teasers only to this website, which causes a massive jump in popularity/notability. The sequel to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a> is just starting production, so Batman on Film is going to be an important site. Not sure if this qualifies it for wikipedia, but there it is. <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMightyAtom_d100.html" title="User:MightyAtom">MightyAtom</a> 00:57, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have nominated this subject for deletion again (I am the creator of the article) because the subject of the article wrote to me asking for me to take it down, and he barely passed "notability" requirements so I don't see that the article should have to remain, in the interests of his privacy. He has also been blanking the page but bots have been reverting it. I would ask to <b>Delete</b> at this point.

<li>Xoloz's nomination is not entirely accurate. If this was simply a reality TV contestant, I wouldn't have suggested overturning at DRV. We have other (semi-)professional pseudosportspeople on WP. Professional dancers merit inclusion if they meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> just like anyone else. Having said that, I'm not sure that Ms Sliwinska meets WP:BIO as I can't determine the importance of the competitions she won in 2001. I suspect we have <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> issues in terms of not having an appropriate degree of dance coverage, but that doesn't mean we should include people who don't meet the guidelines, it just means that it's harder to determine who does meet WP:BIO by having won notable awards in the field. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 13:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep - She is a professional ballroom dancer who many people would like to find out more information about. Ballroom dancing is becoming increasingly popular, and not just because of ABC. I'd like to know when she was born and where. I think that learning about these people increases awareness of ballroom dancing, and will lead people to click-through to other Wikipedia pages, and that's important, too!!! The more people stay on the site, the better.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Judging by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">WP:BIO</a>: the first and third links are not really independant sources, falling under "Media reprints of the person's autobiography"; the second link isn't exactly "non-trivial", being mere database entry like IMDb; and the fourth link doesn't provide more than a brief, anecdotal mention of Sliwinska in passing. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 05:38, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - While the third link could be a media reprint, the first is definitely not. It is a season by season account of her activities on a major US network show.

<li><b>Comment</b> - With respect to the ABC link, I'm not seeing the distinction. The content of the page is almost identical to the bio on Sliwinska's official website. The only real difference is the addition of her Dancing with the Stars scores, which for the most part is already incorporated into the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_with_the_Stars_a776.html" title="Dancing with the Stars">Dancing with the Stars</a> article. As for the other links, a wealth of trivial mentions does not equate to substantive coverage. Just because the show is notable does not mean that Sliwinska is automatically notable by association, even if she's been with the show all three seasons. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> is not the same thing as importance. Case in point: <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karina_Smirnoff_5bbb.html" title="Karina Smirnoff">Karina Smirnoff</a> has only been on the show for one season, but her notability has been established through references to several non-trivial works. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 06:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Of course she should be in Wikipedia. I came to the site seeking information about the contestants. Wikipedia offers an infinite amount of shelf-space for articles. Why be a snob? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.92.34.166 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.92.34.166_1aa8.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.92.34.166">contribs</a>) 04:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - As long as the article can be maintained according to content policy, it doesn't hurt the readership much to have it. While it's probably going to be stuck in stubsville for a while due to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notability</a> problem, and will likely be a magnet for fancruft and spam, that's nothing we don't deal with already.

<p>Appears to be a vanity page. The user who created it is named UGotItGear, which, coincidentally, is the name of one of Kris Mansour's businesses. The article appears to exist primarily to promote Mansour's blog and UGotItGear business.

<p>This completely unsourced article (tagged as such for 10 months), consists largely of speculative <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The lack of scholarly content is clearly characterized by the second sentence:</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'll try and get verification for the etymology discussion, but the existence and relevance of the topic as such is beyond doubt. The fact that the identity of the river is not <i>known</i> doesn't mean it's not notable <i>as a problem</i> in historical geography. Turning that incertainty into an indication of "lack of scholarly content" is - sorry - bizarre. Scarcity of web sources in English isn't an argument either - it's not the type of subject where verifiability can or should be expected to be effortless. Its being unsourced for so long is unfortunate, but it's a well-written article on an interesting topic and evidently written by someone who had knowledge of relevant literature, we only need to find it. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 11:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Further <b>comment</b>: a quick search, still only on the web, turns up that the matter has been discussed in the scholarly literature, at least by the 19th-cent. editor of Ptolemy's Geography in his critical apparatus (<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/10/Mueller*.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/10/Mueller*.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>), and by a Dutch author in a scholarly journal in the 1930s (<a href="http://www.antiqbook.nl/boox/krul/2761.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiqbook.nl/boox/krul/2761.shtml" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>). Some further hints at modern discussions (in Dutch): <a href="http://www.brucop.com/millennium/nederlands/ptolemeus/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brucop.com/millennium/nederlands/ptolemeus/" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://www.brucop.com/millennium/nederlands/toponyms/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brucop.com/millennium/nederlands/toponyms/" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. The etymological issue has almost certainly been treated somewhere too; old European river names is a topic where no stone has been left unturned. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 13:37, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you actually read the article, the further reading, and what is cited above, you'll find that the reason for that is that <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> wrote about it in xyr <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographia_%28Ptolemy%29_0ff8.html" title="Geographia (Ptolemy)">Geographia</a></i>, but scholars are unsure which actual river Ptolemy was writing about. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:03, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

Web searches find a lot of references, but every single one (their website, freewebs, myspace, forums, etc.) seems to have been written by the same person, the presumed head of this organization and author of this article, who has also removed questions or criticisms from the Talk page. In other words, massive <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">Astroturfing</a>.

<p>While Connecticut does have a southeast, there is no generally recognized region "Southeast Connecticut." The term seems to be a neologism created by eager real estate brokers and chambers of commerce. In the absence of generally recognized regions of the state, it is not wikipedia's role to pick and promote some. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 20:41, 11 November 2006 (UTC) I am also nominating the following related pages because of the same reasons.

<li>I don't really see what's wrong with using a proposed guideline in an area where no agreed-upon guideline exists. I'm not saying it's a perfect guideline by any means, but it at least represents an attempt at codifying notability for books. The number of times <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">another proposed guideline</a> is thrown about, you'd almost think there was no functional difference between proposed and actual ones. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:31, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that there is a difference there. If we say too bad about that guideline, then a thousand articles are all the sudden AFD'd. That's just a scared to set precedence one. -<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_b1fa.html" title="User:Royalguard11">Royalguard11</a><small>(<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_4f58.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11">Talk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalguard11_Desk_a7bb.html" title="User talk:Royalguard11/Desk">Desk</a>·<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalguard11_ER_5b7b.html" title="User:Royalguard11/ER">Review Me!</a>)</small> 21:34, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry, I don't quite follow that argument. Surely the same thing would occur here, where if we say that this particular proposed guideline is only that, a number of other articles on books need to be deleted? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> note that guidelines are mostly designed to reflect the practice of AfD and not to define it. The usual phrasing of that principle is that guidelines are "descriptive, not prescriptive". That being said, I won't argue this point: the proposed guideline is not perfect and has only been around for a few months. That's why it's a proposal, not an accepted guideline. But I still think it does a pretty fair job of outlining the consensus opinion about books that should or should not be kept. I encourage anyone here that supports or objects to the proposal (or parts of it) to voice his concerns since that's the only way to make progress towards a stronger consensus. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:59, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>[edit conflict] <b>Delete</b> per my rationale in the previous AfD. Being a baronet doesn't make one automatically notable, since there are an awful lot of them.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's a hoax. Have a look at the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_Baronets_d243.html" title="Brown Baronets">Brown Baronets</a> page to see that his father was not a Baronet and therefore he could not possibly have inherited it.

<li>No claim is made that Brown inherited the title from his father - he is claiming an extant baronetcy from a distant ancestor, so the above comment is incorrect, further with Conservative Tomorrow claiming 2500 members they would have far more members than Conservative Future the official wing, which is why I remember their being such fuss about the matter when I served on the National Exec of Conservative Future back in 2001/2.

<li><b>Delete and add Rockerball Competitions to the discussion</b> This is pretty much a walled garden for a non-notable sport. (Note that I wrote that last sentence before I realized that Nawlin had already used the phrase "walled garden", showing just how much of a "walled garden" this is.) Barely 1000 Google hits for Rockerball -Wikipedia, and many of the top hits are from MySpace. No asserted notability, no significant people involved in the sport, and it seems that, in the four or so years the sport has been played, only five or six teams have played it. Neither the film nor the book have even been released yet (and, of course, they're also non-notable), and the only sourcing in any of the articles are the Aussie Rockerball League, the aforementioned non-notable rockerball-related works, and Google Video, so everything fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:39, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> - First, I think that formatting is important to keep Wikipedia looking like an encyclopedia.

<dd>Yes, but the article which you stated was peer-reviewed is <i>related</i> to the main article which is the main subject of the AfD. If that goes, any other related articles have to be deleted as well. The argument is that Rockerball is not notable as a subject, so whether the stats from 2006/7 <i>are</i>, is irrelevant. Hope this clarifies things. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 23:39, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are correct in your statement the the 2006/7 event is <i>related</i> to the main article.

<dd>It can be improved, you are correct. Stylistically (is that a word?) speaking. But that doesn't improve the notability of it all, does it?

<p>Alright, I don't know if it was any of you, but I won't pay any attention to any rascists here. Since someone wrote a comment on the <a href="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" class="external text" title="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" rel="nofollow">forum</a>. Now perhaps the other person I would agree with to a certain point, but this isn't just about degrading or upgrading, this is about whether someone can write an article about a piece of art that one found wonderful. Now obviously if that piece of art were made by my boyfriend, I would have no business making an article about it. However, if a 3rd party wrote it, that's the difference. I think some of you are concerned that because I am a fan of the movie, I have conflict of interest, but then if not a fan, who can write an article? Most articles here were written by fans of their subject matter. The film was approved to be on fanfilms.net, and has been shown for educational purposes in high schools, therefore it is notable imao. MaraJade85 02:30, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I read what could not go on wikipedia, it stated clearly no advertising and no self-promotions. I have in no way promoted myself, and I don't wish to. I simply wrote an article about a film I liked. How then is that conflict of interest? I'm sure any of you would write articles about stuff you like, and how can this be considered advertising? It could if I told people to watch the film no matter what, but rather I took an analytic approach which discussed the films drawbacks and some of its historical innaccuracies. If that is considered advertising, then lets just delete the articles on other films since they discuss those films too, and while we're at it let's delete the article on the Arizona Cardinals since that article is advertising them. If all I did was praise the film and tell people beg people to watch it, then I could understand the advertising accusation. However, I took a non-partisan critical approach when I wrote the article. It is quite notable as I repeat, it has been showcased in high schools, online, it has a fanfilms.net listing (and that site does not accept all movies), it has been discussed in forums about Rome Total War and HBO's Rome, and furthermore, I found it. I don't even know these people personally, yet I found this film online and that's saying something because it would be different if I was a family member of someone in the production. However since I found it online, and so have others. In fact I've been excited about this film since like it was first announced, and this isn't just any ordinary home video, it took lots of months and to make and the filmmakers almost went broke putting their money in it, and I waited all those months and I saw the "making of" video which showed everything the filmmakers went through. Its an online movie, I love it, and I wrote this article about it. So where do we set the line between what people can write about and what they can't, between what one subjectively thinks is notable compared to what another person thinks is notable? Certainly this film has attracted attention beyond its local sphere, or else I would not have seen it, and it has been viewed in other places and discussed in other websites. Perhaps, since I'm only a fan of the movie, we need somebody else who hates the film to write the article...MaraJade85 04:55, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>I simply wrote an article about a film I liked</i> I liked the movie also, but I wouldn’t write an article about it here. You asked where the line is drawn, well this is basically it: if the film is getting more publicity from 3rd party outside sources than from wikipedia, then it could be possible to have an article, but if wikipedia is giving the film more publicity than the outside sources are, then it doesn’t belong here. There are hardly any outside sources of publicity for this film. I found a few forums related to Rome Total War and HBO’s Rome that talked about the film, but that was it. I couldn’t even find the trailer on Youtube! If you want this film to have more publicity, I suggest that these “Towne Films” get off these obscure vidiac networks (who ever goes there) and move to youtube. Though money spent should not be considered, neither should be the film's content nor potential of the filmmakers. Even if these people are future George Lucases and Steven Spielbergs, <i>their</i> earliest films when <i>they</i> went out with camcorders would not have qualified for wikipedia at the time they were made. <b>Delete</b>129.108.96.131 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article was created a long time ago and basically explains more about garage movie studios which is a growing trend, and closely related to guerrilla filmmaking. If you want, you can merge those two articles since they share a lot in common... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MaraJade85 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMaraJade85_dc71.html" title="User talk:MaraJade85">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MaraJade85_6b21.html" title="Special:Contributions/MaraJade85">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I didn't coin the term, I first heard it from my professor. Using camcorders and stuff is what a garage movie studio is, and studios like Towne Films, ARCworks (or something like that I forgot the exact name but that's another studio I plan to do an article on) they do these films on a regular basis. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by MaraJade85 (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMaraJade85_dc71.html" title="User talk:MaraJade85">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MaraJade85_6b21.html" title="Special:Contributions/MaraJade85">contribs</a>) 23:07, 11 November 2006.</small></p>

<p>According to this conflict of interest bit it says that I have to know the people personally. I've only seen these people online and read stuff on their website, I've never known them other than that. As a fan, I'm writing an article about it, just as say a Star Trek fan would write an article on Star Trek, or an Atomic Pink fan an article on Atomic Pink</p>

<p>Alright, I don't know if it was any of you, but I won't pay any attention to any rascists here. Since someone wrote a comment on the <a href="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" class="external text" title="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" rel="nofollow">forum</a>. Now perhaps the other person I would agree with to a certain point regarding the film that it may not belong with MGM, but this isn't just about degrading or upgrading, this is about whether someone can write an article about an organization piece of art that one is a fan of. Now obviously if this organization were made by my boyfriend, I would have no business making an article about it. However, if a 3rd party wrote it, that's the difference. I think some of you are concerned that because I am a fan of the franchise, I have conflict of interest, but then if not a fan, who can write an article? Most articles here were written by fans of their subject matter. The film was approved to be on fanfilms.net, and has been shown for educational purposes in high schools, therefore it is notable imao, however, since the film organization does not have any articles other than its listing in fanfilms.net, then I would consent to this article's deletion, though not to the others which have been around for a long time, and only today, after I decided to go ahead and do one for the organization as well, is this debate coming up.MaraJade85 02:38, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>So where do we set the line between what people can write about and what they can't</i> Wikipedia has <b>reams</b> of pages about guidelines of what's suitable to be included, and what's not. (This isn't.) Try reading some of them. Especially <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: a <b><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a></b>, a <b><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanzine.html" title="Fanzine">fanzine</a></b>, a <b><a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> page</b>, or a publicity venue. Lots of college kids do films, the vast majority aren't notable. Lots of videos and films get shown in high schools, few are notable. Try looking at it from a wider standpoint: Are people in , say, New Zealand or Nunavut going to go to Wikipedia to <b>look up</b> information on this film, because it's <b>notable</b> , or are you sticking an article in, hoping the same people run across it and develop an interest?

<li>It's a single event. Event-based coverage has generally not been held to count as "multiple" coverages just because the story is carried in multiple papers. The stories are not really independent of each other and don't demonstrate that the subject is encyclopedic (as opposed to just newsworthy). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 17:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would actually dispute the contention that a single incident cannot confer encyclopedic noteworthiness; that is certainly an <i>argument</i>, but it isn't one I believe to be consensus-supported. Apart from the notorious examples like <a href="../../../j/o/n/JonBenet_Ramsey_daa2.html" title="JonBenet Ramsey">JonBenet Ramsey</a>, Wikipedia has accepted many little gems on folks like <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Hagaman_9a08.html" title="Allen Hagaman">Allen Hagaman</a>; and no paper encyclopedia would ignore <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispus_Attucks_36be.html" title="Crispus Attucks">Crispus Attucks</a>, yet these people are notable for the single event of their death only. The difference in the last two is, of course, the passage of a great deal of time; but, given the popularity of collegiate sports in America, it is all but certain that Pata won't be forgotten by a large segment of US males. This is, perhaps, a sad social commentary, but that isn't our concern. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Clarification: I didn't say that a single incident couldn't be notable. What I said was that news coverage of a single event does not count as "multiple coverages" when measuring against the "multiple non-trivial coverages" criterion. Whether the single event itself is sufficient to qualify the biography under one of the other criteria is a separate question. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> You are completely wrong, and ignorant. Crispus Attuck's death was notable as he was perceived as 'defending his country' and became a symbol of the Revolution, said by some to be the 'first to die' for the Revolution. In any case, he was part of the "Boston Massacre" and so is directly relevant to the root causes of the Revolution. Bryan Pata's death was a random event. Also, Attucks died in 1770 and is still remembered. It's pathetic you would even compare the two.

<li><b>Comment</b> Geez, no personal attacks please. There was no need for <i>that</i>. And at any rate, what Xoloz said <i>did</i> make sense, you are misunderstanding. Rossami argued that being notable for one thing - your death - constitutes failure of "multiple non-trivial coverages" (which, incidentally, is untrue - that policy is referring to multiple SOURCES covering the topic, not necessarily the topic being covered for multiple reasons). Xoloz was citing Crispus Attucks as an example of someone who is clearly notable, yet is known only for his death. <i>Of course</i> Attucks should be kept; the absurdity of deleting his article was his point exactly. Regardless of the merits of this article, Rossami's theory does not seem to be correct. Your attack was both unprovoked and misguided and I think an apology would be in order... -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 23:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think his point is that his lasting fame came from his death, as did Pata's. I still do not understand why a notable death does not notable make?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wouldn't call this 'lasting' fame, but temporary fame fueled by a media story. One would think that to qualify, out of the 6.3 billion people on this Earth, that one would have to do or be someone notable to get an encyclopedia article. Simply a combination of a non-star collegiate player and an unfortunate event does not make 'lasting' fame. Ok, maybe this vote will lose right now, because people are 'appealing to emotion' instead of logic. But as we see from the other, outdated stories, after a while, what is so notable about being a backup quarterback on a team that didn't win? Or someone made 13 tackles in 43 starts, not even one tackle a game? On a team that didn't win. It's not notable. The only thing notable is how young people over-value things they see on TV and undervalue things read in books.131.96.70.164 00:55, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
