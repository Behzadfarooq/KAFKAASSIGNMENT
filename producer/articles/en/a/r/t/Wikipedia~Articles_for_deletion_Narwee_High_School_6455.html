<li><b>Keep</b> Just because the school is closed does not mean it is insignificant. Even if a politician did <b>not</b> attend that school, keeping an article on it (and expanding it) would be a valuable tool to historians who do not live in the immediate area of the school and do not have access to town records. Is that not one of the purposes of Wikipedia? To provide information that might otherwise be hard to access? Being a former public school, it is certainly significant enough to include in the ranks of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirenexx_d9a9.html" title="User:Firenexx">firenexx</a> 15:14, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the information about a closed school remains germane. Should we delete the article on Hurricane Katrina? It's over! <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 15:37, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. As far as I am concerned, the point of concern here is that the school is non-notable, not that it has closed. The fact that it has closed merely guarrantees that it will not become more notable in the future. The comparison to Elvis is absurd- Elvis is gone, but he became notable before he went. This school did not. Im not terribly familiar with <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, but it seems to me that it considers high schools to be relevant, and I dont consider the dead/alive aspect to be of particular relevance. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> <sub><sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELanoitarus_979b.html" title="User talk:Lanoitarus">(talk)</a></sup></sub> <b>.:.</b> 19:13, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
