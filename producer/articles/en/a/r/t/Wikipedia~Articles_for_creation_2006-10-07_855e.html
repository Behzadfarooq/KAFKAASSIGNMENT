<p>KC Tools International:</p>
<p>AIR REGULATORS: Clean, dry and lubricated air at the correct pressure is the most important requirement for perfect operation of air tools. KC Tools range of air tools are designed to operate at 90 P.S.I. unless otherwise specificed.</p>
<p>MOISTURE SEPARATORS: On installations where the pipping system does not provide clean, dry air the use of filters at hose connections points is recommended.</p>
<p>STRAINERS/FILTERS: Many tools arte provided with air strainers or filters. To eliminate air restriction these strainers must be kept clean and free of obstructions. Strainers or filters should be used at each hose outlet.</p>
<p>LUBRICATION: Many pneumatic tools, due to weight and space limitations do not contain built-in lubricators. Air line lubricators are recommended with all air tools.</p>
<p>MOISTURE ELIMINATION: The amount of moisture carried by compressed air varies with the temperature. As the temperature drops after compression, water is precipitated. To eliminate as much water as possible, compressors should be equiped with intercoolers, aftercoolers and full size receivers. These should be kept drained and in good working condition.</p>
<p>COMPRESSOR AIR INTAKE: Locate the air intake to obtain the coolest, driest and cleanest air possible. Intakes should be of ample size and as direct as possible. Avoid dusty or wet locations.</p>
<p>PIPING SYSTEM: Air mains and lines should be large enough to avoid excessive pressure loss under heavy working conditions. Pipe lines should be provided with drains for trapping water before it reaches the hose outlet. The ‘pitch’ of the mains line should be in the direction of the air flow so that gravity and air flow will carry the water to traps located at regular intervals. Provision for quick and positive inspection of operation for leakage should be made when traps are installed. Taps in the drains are usually provided for draining and inspection of water collected. To prevent moisture from reaching the tools, down pipes or hose connections should never be taken directly from the bottom of air pipes or mains. Connections should be made at the top of the a main line. Valves and hose connections should be large enough to pass the maximum amount of air required by the tool or tools on the line.</p>

<p>When the Congregation of Christian Brothers first landed in The United States, they taught at a school known as, All Saints Grammar School in 1906, in Harlem, New York. After the first graduating class in 1909, The Christian Brothers went on to open up a High school where the children could continue their learning experience. This school was named All Hallows High School (which means All Saints in Greek). It was originally opened up on the opposite of present day Rice High School, in Harlem New York. Now the school is on the location of 164th St and Walton AVE. in the Bronx, a few blocks away from Yankee stadium. It was moved in 1930. The school has many traditions which take place, and many activities as well as sports and clubs. One of All Hallows' most notable aspect is the fact that it has been named Top 50 Catholic High Schools in America by Middlestates.</p>

<p>Polymers</p>
<p>Polymer is a term used to describe molecules consisting of structural units and a large number of repeating units connected by covalent chemical bonds. The term is derived from the Greek words: polys meaning many, and meros meaning parts . The key feature that distinguishes polymers from other molecules is the repetition of many identical, similar, or complementary molecular subunits in these chains. These subunits, the monomers, are small molecules of low to moderate molecular weight, and are linked to each other during a chemical reaction called polymerisation.</p>
<p>Polymers are dived into four sections: Thermosets Thermoplastics Elastomers Coordiantion polymers</p>
<p>Polymers are often named in terms of the monomer from which they are made. The attractive forces between polymer chains play a large part in determining a polymer's properties. Polymers can be seen as tangled spaghetti chains, pulling any one of the spaggheti strand out is a lot harder the more tangled the chains are.</p>
<p>Thermosets</p>
<p>Thermosets are polymer materials that cure, through the addition of energy, to a stronger form. The energy may be in the form of heat through a chemical reaction or irradiation. Thermoset materials are usually liquid, powder and designed to be moulded into their final form. The curing process transforms the thermoset into a plastic or rubber by cross-linking. Energy is added to cause the molucar chains to link into a rigid 3d structure. A Thermoset material cannot be melted or remodeled after its cured. Thermoset materials are usually stronger than thermoplastic materials and are also better suited to high tempreture. You cannot recycle thermosets like thermoplastics.</p>
<p>Thermoplastics</p>
<p>A thermoplastic is a material that is plastic or deformable, melts to a liquid when heated and freezes to a brittle, glassy state when cooled sufficiently. Most thermoplastics are high molecular weight polymers whose chains associate through weak forces. Thermoplastics are elastic and flexible.Thermoplastics can go through melting/freezing cycles repeatedly and the fact that they can be reshaped upon reheating gives them their name.</p>
<p>Elastomers</p>
<p>The term elastomer is often used as the term rubber. Elastomer comes from two terms: Elastic (describing the ability of a material to return to its originol shape and a chunk is removed) and mer. ( Taken from polymer). Each link of the chain is usually made from carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and silicon. To make the chain ‘Mers’ and linked together. Elastomers primary use is for seals and modleded flexible parts. Elastomers are usually thermosets but also may be thermoplastics. The molucar structure of an elastomer can be described as a spagheti and meatball design, the meatballs signifying cross-links.</p>
<p>Coordination polymers</p>
<p>Coordination polymer is the term given in inorganic chemistry to a metal coordination compound. One of the first coordination compounds ever studied systematically, Prussian Blue, is a coordination polymer based on Fe-CN-Fe links.</p>
<p>Polymerization</p>
<p>Polymerization is a process of reacting monomer molecules together in a chemical reaction to form three-dimensional networks or polymer chains . There are many forms of polymerization and different systems exist to categorize them. Polymerization dates back to the beginning of DNA based life. The first polymers of the 19th century were actually formed my changing natural polymers.</p>
<p>Polyethylene Polyethene is a thermoplastic heavily used in consumer products. Its nanes originates from the monomer ethane, which created the polymer. Polyethylene is created through polymerization of ethene. Polyethylene is classified into several different categories based mostly on its density. Polyethylene was first created German chemist Hans von Pechmann, who prepared it by accident in 1898 while heating diazomethane. Polystyrene</p>
<p>Polystyrene is a polymer made from the monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is manufactured from petroleum. At room temperature, polystyrene is normally a solid thermoplastic, but can be melted at higher temperature for molding or extrusion, then resolidified. Polystyrene was accidentally discovered in 1839 by Eduard Simon.</p>
<p>Polyester Polyester is a category of polymers, or, more specifically condensation polymers. Usually, polyester refers to cloth woven from polyester fiber. Polyester clothing is generally considered to have a less natural feeling to it compared to natural fibers. Polyester fibers are often spun together with fibers of cotton, producing a cloth with some of the better properties of each. polyester generally refers to the large family of plastics. Polyester is combustible but due to its thermoplastic nature.</p>
<p>Polycarbonate Polycarbonates are a particular group of thermoplastics. They Are easily modedled and formed as these plastics are wildly used in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Electroactive polymers</p>
<p>Electroactive polymers are polymers whose shape is modified when a voltage is applied to them. Thye can be used as sensors. These are often called artificial muscels because they are used in the field of robots.</p>
<p>Biopolymers Biopolymers are a special class of polymers found only in living organisms. Starch, proteins and peptides, DNA, and RNA are all examples of biopolymers. A major difference can be found between biopolymers and polymers in their structure. They are both made of repetive units called monomers. By Arnob Basit</p>

<p>Rhyndaston Tunnel is 955m long on the main rail line from Hobart to Launceston/Burnie. The tunnel is on a slope of 1 in 40 and rises in the direction of Launceston. The tunnel was built in 1873-1876 and enlarged in 1964-1965. Despite this, current diesel locomotives in operation on often stall metres from the uphill end due to oxygen deprivation (See Rathole Tunnel in Wikipedia).</p>
<p>The Australian Federal government in conjunction with the Tasmanian government have allocated money to the maintenance of the main rail line and may investigate widening the tunnel further or finding an alternative uphill route.</p>
<p>Pacific National, the freight company utilising the rail line have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the State Government to invest in new locomotives. These may not have the same difficulties as the current ones in travelling uphill through the tunnel.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-07_855e.html" title="Edit section: Actor/Director   Rory Riedel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Actor/Director Rory Riedel</span></h2>
<p>Rory Riedel was born on July 29th, 1977 in the Canadian city of Winnipeg. At the age of 14, he started producing, directing, and taking lead roles in his own independent films, under the company name Frazar Movie Productions. Films were made with little budgets and no name actors, but popularity grew for the films, with their unique screenplays and the one of a kind film making. Films at this level were just simply not seen before. In 1998, Rory married the love of his life for 3 years, Christina Leigh. Still shining off the success of his hit independent film of the previous year, Mark of the Beast, Rory decided to focus his attention on his new wife and take some time off from producing and starring in films.</p>
<p>In 2001, Rory and his wife Christina, had their first child. Tyler Terrance Fredrick Riedel was born on November 10, 2001. His son later appears in an upcoming film titled '157 Red Oak Drive' and 2005's 'Attack on America'.</p>
<p>In 2002, Frazar Movie Productions finally gets online and launches their new website. Frazar Online expanded their audience from the "local" scene into the world. Requests for old and new Frazar films were being purchased on DVD for the first time ever, directly from Frazar Online.</p>
<p>In 2003, came the addition 'Frazar Internet Tv show with Rory Riedel' which gave fans an up close and personal look at Rory and his 'world'. The consisted of cast interviews, music acts, ad libbed cameras on the street etc. The show was a huge success and brought alot of traffic to the site thus starting a brand new fan base for Rory and his independent film company. In May, Rory's personal life fell apart however with the break-up from his wife of 5 years, Christina. A show aired in June of that year on the internet show, which was dedicated to his wife. This episode got Rory alot of support from fans, which he later stated helped him significantly through this rough time.</p>
<p>In 2004, Rory was approached to host a talk radio program via CRN networks from Burbank California. Unfortunately, talks ended only 2 weeks later, and no deal was met. With the success of 'Attack on America' in 2005, and his first ever animated film 'Alien Fury', released late 2006, and being cast to star in his first ever adult comedy entitled 'Rory McSexy', letting personal problems affect his work just wasn't the case. Mr. Riedel has not slowed down and doesn't intend to. "My films and my fans have only grown since my first in 1991, and one day I will be on the big screen" Rory was quoted as saying. Rory still currently resides in his hometown of Winnipeg Canada, with 50% custody of his son, Tyler Riedel.</p>

<p>Bokomolech is a band from Athens, Greece. The members met sometime in 1991 in the National Technical University of Athens. They started making an impression on indie audiences in 1993, after having played at the Indie Free Festival. Their name comes from a Ukrainian physician, Alexander Alexandrovic Bogomoletz, who came up with a drug of the same name some time in the 1950's, supposedly postponing the ageing of cells in the human body. Their debut LP " Xero " (1995 - Lazy Dog Records, which an important indie label from Salonica)was described by some critics as the best Greek Rock Record (with english lyrics) ever. They later signed with Hitch-Hyke and released the E.P. " Insect(songs) ". Steve Albini was impressed by their music and invited them to Chicago to work on a record together at his own well-known studios "Electrical Audio". The product of this collaboration was a double L.P., "Jet Lag". Steve and Shellac fitted an extra day in their European tour that autumn, so that they could play in Athens with Bokomolech. Their next release was another E.P., entitled "Slowburner", which was produced by one of the best musicians/producers in Greece, Coti.K. " Exit: Trance " is their last L.P. to date and was recorded in the summer of 2003, once again with Steve Albini, but this time in Iain Burgess' Black Box Studio in rural France. The album was very well received (as always). It was their first L.P. that got properly distributed abroad:Exit: Trance is out in Portugal and Germany.</p>

<p>OHA Hockey Club takes it's name from Old Hobartians Association - derived from the Hobart High School Which was in Letitia St. (later Hobart Matric &amp; later still a funeral home).</p>
<p>OHA Hockey started in 1936 for Men and 1929 for Women.</p>
<p>6 Australian Hockey Representatives have also played for OHA.</p>
<p>Partially as a result of this history, OHA is a highly successful club both on and off the field.</p>
<p>OHA is the largest hockey club in Tasmania with 28 senior and junior teams.</p>
<p>Off the field, OHA is known for its club spirit, mateship and loyalty. Our club has a strong volunteer committee, which controls the administration and management of club issues and finances. Our junior development program is acknowledged as one of the leading within the state.</p>

<p>Patrick Seeger is an experimental musician from Olympia, WA</p>
<p>He has released an album as Myotis Lucifugus on his Caesarian Stitches label. He also appears as Myotis Lucifugus on the infamous Q-107 Mix Tape, with four songs set to the early poetry of W.B. Yeats.</p>
<p>Mr. Seeger has recorded a series of improvisational masterpieces in collaboration with Brandon Johnson. The rhythm section of Seeger (drums) and Johnson (bass) developed a distinctive approach to composition in the time which they performed together (2002-2006). In all of their recordings, the duo disassembles traditional song structures. Seeger and Johnson appeared in a series of stunning performances at Le Voyeur in Olympia from 2002-2004, often collaborating with Andrew Heinz, Ryan Spengler and Annie Gilbert.</p>
<p>Patrick Seeger also started the band Shibboleth with the guitarist Joe Linsalata. Shibboleth is a Metal band that was primarily influenced by the film "The River's Edge", starring Crispin Glover. Seeger and Linsalata have released one album as Shibboleth on Caesarian Stitches, with Brandon Johnson on bass. This has been the most popular project that Patrick has contributed to.</p>
<p>Patrick Seeger is NOT related to Pete Seeger.</p>

<p>The Eurologos Group is a leader among translation and multilingual editing multinationals. It has offices on four continents and produces linguistic services (translations/adaptations, website localization, interpretation, layouts, and Web publishing) where the languages are spoken. Its motto is "relocalizing language production", since all production can be delocalized except regarding languages. That is why Eurologos never ceases to open new offices in the world's most important centers, where the languages are spoken&#160;! Each of our Eurologos offices bases its services on three main principles: Producing and/or checking the languages where they are spoken (linguistic quality can only be ensured by having a structure of truly multinational offices); Basing this production on terminotics (terminological precision - that is to say the base of linguistic quality - is not possible without numerous glossaries of industry "technolects" stored in translation memories at each office); Guaranteeing the control over revisions and translations right up to the stages of printing and multimedia publishing (the participation of graphic designers saves time and money&#160;: the possibility of complete services and integration of multilingual services in their printing and Web supports).Total Quality Management of the Group's offices is based on respect for a 400-page Eurologos Procedures Manual.</p>

<p><i>This article primarily concerns the biography of predoninantly well-known writer and student activist in the Maritimes, Canada who has written published articles for the Brunswickan.</i></p>
<p><b>Basil Khan</b> (born Basil Junaid Khan, pronounced "Bāassil Junayd Khân") was born on May 26, 1984, and is currently the the 2006/07 VP public affairs representative for the Muslim Student Association at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, NB.</p>
<p>Born to first generation Pakistani parents, his father, a graduate from NED, Karachi, originally migrated to the U.S. only to complete a Masters in Civil Engineering from IIT. He was later impressed by the somewhat stable and highly educated society, but shifted to Toronto, Ontario to avoid a military draft to the Viet Nam war. His mother completed an Arts and Education degree from Lahore, Pakistan. The two currently reside in Alberta. His family is a member of ISNA and have attended conferences in Chicago and Toronto. His mother is a member of Women’s division of the Muslim Association of Calgary, and Basil Khan himself has volunteered for MAC. The Khan family has travelled in various parts of the word, including Dubai, Thailand, Saudi Arabi, Turkey, New York, Florida, and California.</p>
<p>Basil was born and raised in Sarnia, Ontario (15 minutes from the U.S. border) in Saint John’s hospital. Surrounded by a predominantly non-Muslim Caucasian society of 75,000, he attended the local high school and a weekly Islamic school along with 200 other first-generation Muslim families who previously founded the mosque.</p>
<p>Basil's family origins range from Mogul ancestors to Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, with traces leading back to Persia, Turkey, and Afghanistan. The majority of his family relatives currently reside in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He is the youngest of three. His oldest sister is a medical doctor in Syracuse, NY, and is married to an oncologist, who is a graduate from Aga Khan Medical College. The younger sister obtained an honours in education from York University, Toronto and is married to a lawyer, a graduate from the University of Bridgeport School of Law. Both currently reside in the U.S.</p>
<p>At 17, Basil’s father found a job in the oil-rich province of Alberta in Calgary, where he completed high school. In 2003, Mr. Khan was accepted into the engineering program at the University of New Brunswick, but in 2006 changed into the BBA program. He is still currently an active Muslim-Canadian, with connections in Toronto, New York, Florida, and Ohio. In an interview with the International Student Newsletter on campus he stated "My goal is to bridge the gap between the Muslim World and the non-Muslim world, as there is much tension, especially after September the eleventh. I believe both these societies have much to learn from each other, for the better." He emphasezes his role as a citizen, and that he basically wants to “help people.”</p>

<p>The Virtual Machine Shop is an online training assistant providing machine tool instruction for the student, hobbyist, and professional machinist. It is supported by donation, advertisement, and volunteers from academia and industry.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>The Virtual Machine Shop (VMS) has its roots in a grant from the United States Department of Labor in 2001. The two year grant was awarded to a consortium of colleges and universities and to Gateway Cities Partnership, an economic development agency in southeast Los Angeles, California. The consortium of Colleges and Universities were:</p>
<p>California State University, Long Beach</p>
<p>Cerritos College</p>
<p>Compton College</p>
<p>Long Beach City College</p>
<p>Rio Hondo College</p>
<p>University of Southern California</p>
<p>Over a two year period instructors and industry professionals developed videos and animations of machine tool processes and placed them on the web as the VMS. At the conclusion of the grant the VMS was no longer supported by consortium members and in 2004 Ronald Smith, Department Chair of the Machine Tool Technology Department at Cerritos College, collected the various assets and re-published them on the web.</p>

<p><b>TYPE OF INSTRUCTION</b></p>
<p>The Virtual Machine Shop is not a curriculum and it does not have a course outline. Instead it provides a vast collection of reference data supported by videos, animations, and images that provide overviews of machine tool processes.</p>
<p><br />
<b>NEED</b></p>
<p>The need for an online Virtual Machine Shop stems from the rapid closure of manual arts programs in high schools and colleges in the United States and the virtual disappearance of traditional apprenticeship programs in industry.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-07_855e.html" title="Edit section: minor misdemeanor crimes could be aggravated felonies for foreign citizens">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">minor misdemeanor crimes could be aggravated felonies for foreign citizens</span></h2>
<p>Under IIRIRA minor misdemeanor offenses could have drastic immigrations consequences to a lawful permanent resident. See INA § 101(a)(43)(A). The Board of Immigration Appeals (hereinafter “BIA” or “Board”) agrees that misdemeanor convictions fall within the definition of aggravated felony as set forth in Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Int. Dec. 3411 (BIA 1999) (endorced by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (hereinafter “Fifth Circuit”) in Zavala-sustaita, 214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir. 2000)). However, the issue presented in Rodriguez-Rodriguez, was whether a felony offense under Texas state law met the definition of § 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, and not whether a misdemeanor conviction can be an aggravated felony. The Board also relies on the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165 (5th Cir. 2002) as support for the proposition that misdemeanor offenses are always encompassed by the aggravated felony definition under § 101(a)(43). In Urias-Escobar, the Fifth Circuit held that a misdemeanor assault conviction for which the alien had been sentenced to one year constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of § 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, which defines an aggravated felony as a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. However, Urias-Escobar should not be determinative in issue presented here, because the aggravated felony definition in § 101(a)(43)(A) makes no reference to any specific sentence length, or to any federal provision of law.</p>
<p>In Matter of Crammond, the Board, sitting en banc, in an 11-9 decision, addressed the exact issue presented, and determinated the matter in alien’s favor. However, Crammond was subsequently vacated on jurisdictional grounds after the Board learned that the alien had departed the U.S.. Matter of Crammond, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 9 (BIA), vacated, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 179 (BIA 2001).</p>
<p>Subsequently to the former Attorney General John Ashcroft’s reorganization and downsizing of the Board, which left only conservative members seated on the Board (see, Courts Criticize Judges’ Handling of Asylum Cases: Pattern of BIAS Alleged, by Adam Liptak, The New York Times, December 16, 2005. See also, Article from Immigration Bulletin, October 1, 2004), a three-member penal decided Matter of Small, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 448 (BIA 2002), in which the Board reconsidered its position in Crammond. There, the Board held that a misdemeanor conviction was an aggravated felony within the meaning of § 101(a)(43)(A). Such desperate measures not only violate equal protection of the law, it smacks discrimination based on alienage. In effect, the same offense which might be a misdemeanor for U.S. citizens is classified an aggravated felony for foreign citizens, a crime that is not even a felony. Moreover, the traditional rule of lenity should be applied to reach the conclusion that misdemeanor offenses are not to be included within the aggravated felony definition in that section. See e.g., INS v. Errico, 385 U.S. 214 , 225 (1966) (indicating that doubts as to the correct construction of a statute affording relief from deportation should be resolved in the immigrant’s favor “because deportation is a drastic measure and at times equivalent of banishment or exile”) (quotation marks omitted); INS v. St. Cry, 533 U.S. at 320 (same). Further, the due process clause of the constitution requires that statutes defining criminal offenses set forth prohibited conduct with sufficient specificity so as to provide fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that there conduct is included within the definition of an offense, and that they are subject to penalty for violation. The finding of the Executive Office of Immigration Review (“EOIR”) that alien’s misdemeanor convictions are to be included violates due process, because lawful permanent residents are not given fair notice that in pleading guilty to a misdemeanor offense, they are subject to removal from the U.S. as aggravated felons, barred from discretionary relief from removal, and permanently barred from ever returning to the U.S.</p>

<p><b>Story Synopsis:</b></p>
<p>In the year 1999, the Earth is invaded by a gigantic colony-spaceship. The ship belongs to the Idelians, who have been wandering through space for over ten thousand years. Now, with their vessel almost out of energy. Their final hope is to settle in our solar system. During the invasion of earth, the Idelians come across some similarities between their culture and the artifacts of earth's long lost past, in the form of the Easter Island Moai statues. The Earth Defense Forces initiate a repulsion effort against the Idelians` sudden invasion in the Alps, but cannot stand against the enemy's powered amour, and technological superiority.</p>
<p>However, among the Defense Forces is a single unit that proves a match [for the invaders], though their battles are harsh. The team, under the command of Colonel Yôichi Takashiro, is a special unit comprised of three men and three robots, the VV-54, VH-64, And VT-61, and centered on its human members: Makoto Mugen, Pierre Bonaparte and Louie Oberon. These three men board and do battle in their variable mecha: a jeep, tank, and helicopter, respectively, conceived for all-terrain combat. the unit is based out of a mobile flying aircraft carrier that provided the unit with a base of operations in their defense of earth.</p>
<p>The show was originally aired in Japan, and subsequently released with English, Spanish, Japanese, and Arabic soundtracks.</p>

<p>Matthew Vermillion was born in 1980 in Athens, Texas to a mother and father whose names are unknown. Matthew endured a fanciful childhood where he played with calculators and lawn equipment. Upon graduating high school in Athens, Matthew chose to seek out a higher education at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana in the fall of 1998. While there, he successfully pledged and was initiated into the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity where he donned their regalia and downed numerous amounts of The Beast and partook in wheelchair excursions down "The Hill." Vermillion graduated from Louisiana Tech with an accounting degree and headed off to Shreveport, Louisiana where he would being work with the illustrious accounting firm KPMG as he pursued his CPA certificate. When first moved to the SBC, Matthew resided at Turtle Creek where he and his cohorts, Ian MacIntire, Angus MacIntire and Paul Wilhelm kept the bartenders in Shreveport alive and on their toes every weeknight. Known for popping his collar and his brand-name polo shirts, Matthew has broken hearts all over Shreveport. His all-time favorite hang-outs are Kon-Tiki, Flananagan's, Sharpie's and Legends. After the break-up of the Turtle Creek Mafia, Matthew began to reside with Todd Lawson Meier, a fellow ATO brother and close confidant. Matthew achieved his lifetime goal in September 2006 when he passed the CPA exam. This up-and-coming Shreveport socialite can be found at his favorite hang-outs on the weekends when he's not cracking the numbers for KPMG.</p>

<p><b>Death To The Brutes</b> is the title of a historical <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> poster that was originally printed in France in August of 1943. The poster was signed "International Revolutionary Syndicalist Federation (F.I.S.R.)". 150 copies of the poster were produced.</p>
<p>The text of the poster illustrates well the militant pro-worker, cosmopolitan, anti-militarist and anti-government sentiments common to the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalist.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalist">Anarcho-syndicalist</a> movement.</p>
<p>Original copies of the poster are held by the C.I.R.A. Library, Centre Internationale de Recherches sur l'Anarchisme, avenue de Beaumont 24, CH-1012 Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Proletarians!</p>
<p>From East to West, from South to North, throughout the world, for three years, to a greater or lesser extent, you have been paying the price of the battle unleashed by your masters. Thousands of proletarians of all countries are dying, while men of finance, politics and war, brutes that they are, congratulate each other, giving speeches, sharing out the benefits, and dividing the wealth and privileges among them selves.</p>
<p>Remember, you veterans of the "war to end all wars," when you came home in 1918, still blood-stained from that infamous butchery which left ten million dead, twenty million injured, ten million permanently disabled, three million missing and millions of widows and orphans--then you said, and promised, NEVER AGAIN! Now, again, the military beasts have got their hands on you. All over the world, men are no longer men, they are serial numbers.</p>
<p>How long will this last? Until the proletarians of the whole world understand that they have only one enemy: their bosses. Until the proletarians of the whole world fraternize, unite and finally charge forward, armed with bayonets still wet with their brothers' blood, to stab in the ass all the governing and war- mongering charlatans.</p>
<p>Proletarians: In 1919 and in 1936 you shouted, "Death to The Brutes!" Now, in 1943, don't shout, ACT. Death to ALL of them, whether they wear the swastika, the red star, the Order of the Garter, the Lorraine Cross or the francisque.</p>
<p>LONG LIVE LIBERTY!</p>
<p>LONG LIVE PEACE!</p>
<p>LONG LIVE THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION!</p>
<p><br /></p>
