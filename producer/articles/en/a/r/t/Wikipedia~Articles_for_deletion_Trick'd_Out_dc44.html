<ul>
<li>Okay, I overlooked that. I can provide reasons why the film is notable, however, and I'll add them to the article once I've finished outlining them here. The first one that comes to mind is that the project is made completely by a group of non-professional teenagers aiming to produce a professional-level film. This is not "normal" either for independent films or Hollywood films. Second, the film is being shot entirely with entry-level consumer DV cameras, in order to demonstrate the potential of the format for films. While more common in independent filmmaking than in Hollywood, this practice is still notable due to considerable prejudice against using the DV format. Third, the film is being shot for sale with an extremely low to non-existant budget--also not a common practice in independent films, and certainly highly unusal in film as a whole. I could continue the list, but I hope this will be sufficient to establish the uniqueness of the project. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like it's all about the technology. But you're not making any technology breakthroughs yourself, you're just using off-the-shelf equipment. How notable can it be that someone unable to raise enough money for normal equipment would try to use cheap equipment? I don't see how a low budget makes a film <b>project</b> notable prior to release. The fact that <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easy_Rider_4451.html" title="Easy Rider">Easy Rider</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blair_Witch_Project_a6fd.html" title="The Blair Witch Project">The Blair Witch Project</a> was made on the cheap is notable only because those movies were big commercial box-office successes. I'm baffled by your "objective of proving that this eqipment [sic] can provide a quality film." If a 16mm blowup like <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaving_Las_Vegas_59a0.html" title="Leaving Las Vegas">Leaving Las Vegas</a> can be a commercial success, I don't think there's much left to prove. All you need is a really good cinematographer. And really good lab work. But the big challenge is to get commercial-quality <i>entertainment</i> out of your "purely amatuer [sic] actors." Enjoy your premiere and the local press coverage I'm sure you'll get... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a><a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:38, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apologies for the spelling errors, I will go fix them. Your criticism of the film "project" due it using off-the-shelf equipment and low-budget is uninformed at best. That is the entire point of the technical side of the production: that professional-quality films can be made with consumer equipment. You've missed the entire point. The "breakthrough" is that there is no breakthrough with the equipment. The low budget does not make the film notable; rather, the low budget coupled with the high standard for quality and the objective of a commercial release makes the film notable. Additionally, comparing 16mm to DV demonstrates a fundamental ignorance about film in general and the merits of the various formats in particular. While not as desirable as 32mm, 16mm is generally accepted as a quality film format, unlike consumer DV. To say that a terrible film can be shot on 16mm and still be a success proves nothing, as we all know that terrible films are produced on 32mm by Hollywood and still have great popularity at the box office for unknown reasons. Your argument about only needing a really good cinematographer (I assume you mean director of photography) is also invalid--if DV is truly a useless format, cinematography will not save the film.<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a></li>

<li>I've seen hundreds of student film projects with no budgets that set out to prove the abilities of entry-level consumer cameras. I can't see how that makes this project unique. Also, about <a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Episode III</a>: this page is allowed to exist because it has already got significant press attention and it's part of a very famous film series. 131.211.210.12 07:44, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC) (Actually <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">User:MacGyverMagic</a> while not logged in, I already voted above).
<ul>
<li>True enough, but how many of those student films were made for sale? Regarding Episode 3, an unreleased film is an unreleased film--I agree that Episode 3 is special, but so is Trick'd Out. The popularity is nowhere near the same, of course, but just because it can't compete with one of the most anticipated films of the year doesn't make the project unimportant or non-notable. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a></li>

<li>Alright, I can have a laugh at myself, 32mm indeed, you'll have to excuse me, I was a bit tired at the time. That aside, all you experienced Wikipedians seem to have forgotten the rule about being polite and not calling people sock puppets unless you can prove it. Vanity is not valid, self-promotion is not valid (how on earth can it be self-promotion when there's no link to any associated website?), crystal ball is not valid (see above), non-notable is not valid (also see above), and sock puppetry is an unfounded and unproved insult. And 32mm was a result of exhaustion, not of an ignorance of film. Cinematographer is an extremely broad term. According to Wikipedia itself it means "A cinematographer (from 'cinema photographer') is one photographing with a motion picture camera. The title is generally equivalent to director of photography (DP or DoP), used to designate a chief over the camera and lighting crews working on a film, responsible for achieving artistic and techical decisions related to the image." That, however, is not the only possible usage, as the term can mean anyone who operates a film camera. And obviously just having a good cameraman--or even a good DP--won't cut it if the format is useless, as I said above. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutcastJiob_0154.html" title="User:OutcastJiob">OutcastJiob</a>
