<li>Seriously, if you'd ask any student from any one of those schools I cited if their school was more "notable" than Cardinal Newman... 99 times out of 100 I'm sure you'd get a "no" answer. In the grand scheme of things none of these schools are exceptionally "notable".

<li>So why are you opposing the deletion?

<li>Mostly because all of these schools form a sort of "pod" and this pod <b>is notable</b>. If one of the articles is to exist they all should exist.

<li>My argument is for <b>completeness</b>.

<li>Wikipedia is not a collection of miscellaneous information. Again I ask, why is this school notable? Why is this "pod" notable? Why is there not an article on the "pod" instead of on the schools in the "pod"?

<li>Hyerbole is a figure of speech. Begging the question is a logical fallacy.

<li>I love when others argue and rely upon fallacies while being fully aware of such a reliance.

In terms of student population <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_Newman_High_School_c0d1.html" title="Cardinal Newman High School">Cardinal Newman High School</a> is likely in the top 5 for all of northern California from Santa Rosa north (and surely in the top 10). <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 11:29, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is Cardinal Newman High School notable? The bulk of the population of Northern California live on a street in Northern California, therefore (by your argument) ought there to be articles on every street in Northern California? If the pod is notable create an article for that. What is under discussion here is whether this article should be deleted. The reason cited to support deletion is that this school is not notable. What do you have to say to that? Mere membership of a supposedly notable group of schools does not make <b>this</b> school notable.

<dd>I do read the whole thread when an AfD comes my way, I've been here long enough to know that. I looked over the article and the statements that it made, and I do believe it should be kept (FYI, I do place my opinion for "Delete," on a few schools, check out the DRV on Arborview High School), it does make some claims of notability. Schools are put under a strange scope, and really that is the fact that it can make some sort of claim of being different from similar schools. About the WP:MUSIC comment, this AfD<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/SerialPod" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/SerialPod" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> stood up because of that argument. The situation involving schools is getting really ugly, but I admit there is a slight lecinancy in favor of schools, but this article does present certain information that makes in stand out from the rest of it's own class. That is really how people should judge the scope of notability, how does this subject make itself different from other similiar subjects? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 11:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
