<li><b>Keep</b>. Abigail's Ghost is actually fairly popular in the underground progressive music scene in Louisiana and has somewhat of a cult following locally. I've actually used this as a source for an article I've written for a local music magazine. I don't think this is a vanity article in any way. It is no more a vanity article than any write up on Radiohead or Coldplay. -Carmine Tripp <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sillyfeetmcgee (<a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESillyfeetmcgee_4e88.html" title="User talk:Sillyfeetmcgee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sillyfeetmcgee_7504.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sillyfeetmcgee">contribs</a>).</small> THIS COMMENT WAS INCORRECTLY ENTERED (removing previous votes) -<a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcbarr_c295.html" title="User:Jcbarr">Jcbarr</a> 04:42, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.Incorrectly entered or not, Carmine (Sillyfeetmcgee) has a point. Besides being leaders of the Louisiana art rock scene, acquiring corporate sponsorships after only a few months of forming and getting extensive media coverage, the lineup of Abigail's Ghost includes world's fastest drummer record holder Seth "Bad Boy" Davis on which numerous articles have been published. This band is beyond well on its way to expanding its region of influence. Sometimes I wish you guys would stop being so meticulously bureacratic long enough to see that others actually find merit in these entries.-<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingleton41_9db0.html" title="User:Singleton41">singleton41</a> 01:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you would visit the site you would see photos from various live gigs and studio sessions. I've personally seen them perform and have written an article regarding the band in a local music related publication. They do perform live and do have recorded material. If you would like I can send it to you. EDIT: I also noticed that you changed your original vote as if you had been somewhat shamed and insulted for making incorrect assumptions and are simply getting back at the writer of the article as a personal vendetta.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've seen this band (Abigail's Ghost) and all its members interviewed on the 8 o'clock news for HTV of Folse Productions, inc. a couple of times and seen them in concert as well. Although it's not exactly my style of music, they are a well known act in this part of the country.-yacovhirsch 09:48, 23 February 2006</li>

After the first deletion notice i read the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> thing to see what was wrong and Abigail's Ghost does in fact meet the criteria of "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop)". So i added that information to the entry but i think i forgot to put that i had edited it so...just letting you all know i had fixed it. -jtheriot@berk 11:54, 23 February 2006</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the fact that you want to delete this just proves how ignorant you are about the drumming world. Fellow world record holder Tim Waterson also has a Wikipedia article.

<li>There was no accusation -- there was a statement of logic. "If" Singleton's comment of "I can't edit articles because people are proposing *my* articles for deletion" was accurate, then that implies Singleton is the same person as the creator of these articles, thus a sockpuppet ID.

<li>There's also a chance that there may have been a hint of sarcasm in his reply. Whether or not he's a sockpuppet or not, he did make somewhat of a point. Just do some research of your own and you'll find that deletion of this article is totally unnecessary. I'm making it a point to add more information about underground or obscure artists on Wikipedia and I think that deleting articles on a whim without taking into consideration the valuable knowledge that can be gained (regardless of whether or not the article is properly formatted or cited) is at complete odds with the principles of Wikipedia. Sillyfeetmcgee 16:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seth Davis is a W O R L D R E C O R D H O L D E R. How much more notable does he have to be? He and Kenneth are both part of the same NOTABLE band that gets NOTABLE media reviews for catering to a NOTABLE genre and culture.-<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingleton41_9db0.html" title="User:Singleton41">singleton41</a> 12:02, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Envy &amp; jealously are for those that have low self-esteem and hold resentment at seeing the success of others. If any individual has taken the time to listen to Abigail's ghost, LIVE or RECORDED (I’ve heard both), then he or she realizes that to create this passionate, progressive, &amp; subtly ambiguous music, takes a high level of brilliance &amp; patience. Their knowledge of musical arts can hardly be summed up in one short paragraph let alone through Wikipedia. Research them, take the time to get to know the band and their music and I am sure that you will realize that your unsanctioned attack on their article will be lifted.-<a href="../../../m/r/n/User%7EMRNA_2f34.html" title="User:MRNA">mRNA</a> 22:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC) John Joseph</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Quality of the music is not an issue. Abigail's Ghost hasn't even recorded a full length studio album. And the label they are recording on was started by people associated with the band. The group hasn't accomplished anything notable <b>yet</b>, so they are not notable now.

<li>'<i>Question</i>. Why are you so dumb? The "full length studio album" you spoke of has been recorded. It's called Selling Insincerity. I'd send it to you if you weren't such a tool. As for the label being started by people associated with the band, are you aware of how many great musicians/songwriters have started their own label AND released their own music on it successfully? Frank Zappa-Zappa, DiscReet, Barking Pumpkin Steve Vai-Favored Nations Berry Gordy-Motown. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that your arguments are vanity arguments because you are so presumtuous in thinking you know everything.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is just with respect to <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Davis_fff8.html" title="Seth Davis">Seth Davis</a>.

The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_9c82.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a> lists the world's fastest drummer (single strokes) as Johnny Rabb <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, who's listed as 7th on World's Fastest Drummer's Battle of the hands <a href="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/battleofthehands.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/battleofthehands.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In reference to Flonkus. Of course the quality of their music is an issue! The basis of your argument is based upon not only Seth's but the whole band's notability. [<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/notability" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/notability" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. The exceptional quality of their music, whether it be the style of music you enjoy to listen to or not, embraces notoriety.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: In reference to Samir_grover. Samir_grover you are definitely correct. You know very little about drumming and even less about research. Firstly, if you were to look a little deeper in the the worlds fastest drummer web site you would have noticed two names that you had made reference to, right next to Seth Davis'. [<a href="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/wfdchampions.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremesportdrumming.com/wfdchampions.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. That’s right! Right there in front of your face. Mike "Da Man" Mangini, &amp; Johnny "3 Bomb" Rabb. Not to mention other famous drummers such as Art "The God Father" Verdi, &amp; Tim "Silver Feet" Waterson. Secondly, take a good look at your Guinness book of world records page. [<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=54634" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]. If you were to read the headline carefully you would understand that an individual has to challenge Guinness for a record to be recorded.[<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faqs/FAQ_Answer.asp?ID=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faqs/FAQ_Answer.asp?ID=18" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]. They do not just show up at any given event to record records. Finally, I am extremely tired of doing your research so here is your last site. Why don't you prove that he isnt notable.

<li>mRNA, You've missed the argument. Notability is established if the person has won or placed in a major music competition. As a corollary, a Guinness record for fastest drummer is notable per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The question is whether "World's Fastest Drummer" is a major music competition. If it is, great, Seth Davis should be included. If not, then no, he should not. By saying that <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Mangini_26f8.html" title="Mike Mangini">Mike Mangini</a> had a wikipedia article for "World's Fastest Drummer", I was establishing WFD's notability (i.e. supporting you), despite the absence of a wikipedia article. -- Samir ∙ <sup>T</sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samir_grover_e7b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samir grover">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> 06:34, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
