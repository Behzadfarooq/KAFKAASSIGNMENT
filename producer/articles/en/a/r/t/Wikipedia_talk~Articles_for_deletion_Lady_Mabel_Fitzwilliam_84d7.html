<p>To the admin closing this AfD, please note a number of editors who have&#160;!voted on this&#160;!vote have been involved in vote canvassing and now what another administrator has called “lock step” voting. Over the past months a number of editors have been accused of&#160;!voting on the basis of what “they like” rather than using the rationale of wiki policies.

<p>All of the above can by generally stated as voting within the anti <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_republican.html" title="Irish republican">Irish republican</a> and pro <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist.html" title="Unionist">unionist</a>/ <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchist.html" title="Monarchist">monarchist</a>.</p>
<p>It started with Astrotrain nominating a number of Volunteers from the Provisional Irish Republican Army and canvassing during those&#160;!votes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Lauder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906495" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Lauder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906495" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906674" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vintagekits&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906674" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tyrenius&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906838" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tyrenius&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106906838" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Couter-revolutionary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907038" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Couter-revolutionary&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907038" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Major_Bonkers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907475" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Major_Bonkers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907475" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Argyriou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907634" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Argyriou&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106907634" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Derry_Boi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106910216" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Derry_Boi&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106910216" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Canvassing for AfD&#160;!votes for Raymond Gilmour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine_Mac_Giolla_Bhrighde&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103229168" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine_Mac_Giolla_Bhrighde&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103229168" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Since then there has been what I consider a systematic abuse of the AfD system with a number of a same editors arriving at an AfD on a subject which they either like or dislike and voting to delete or keep on POV rather then wiki policy. The first AfD that occur was –</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_McDade_8813.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James McDade">James McDade AfD</a> Nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>. Result – ‘’’Keep’’’ 13 votes to Keep and 1 to Delete – that vote by as <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> – therefore 100% of the delete&#160;!votes from “the group”.</p>
<p>Then [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" rel="nofollow">Montgomery</a>] – this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. However <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> ended the AfD because of a source that stated that Montgomery was involved in a murder.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Antoine_MacGiolla_Bhrighde_2d9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde">Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 7 votes and Delete 7 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 71% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McGartland_98f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McGartland">Martin McGartland AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 10 votes and Delete 1 votes – that of Astrotrains</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diarmuid_O%27Neill_6646.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diarmuid O'Neill">Diarmuid O’Neill AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>No consensus</b>, This is where the real vote staking operation started and canvassing came into effect. Keep 20 votes and Delete 10 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept. Note the first eight&#160;!votes were to Keep and that is when the canvassing started and since then there has been almost total lock step.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then we had a AfD of a biography relating to a member of the “British nobility”. This was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot" class="extiw" title="wikipediawikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot">Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 9 votes – 3 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 75% of the votes to keep from “the group” in an article that was deleted</p>
<p>Again back to an Irish republican and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McCaughey_7c96.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McCaughey">Martin_McCaughey AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 16 votes and Delete 12 votes – 7 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 58% of the votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Similar behaviour and calls for deletion in an number of AfD’s of members of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_East_Tyrone_Brigade_1031.html" title="Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade">Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade</a> such as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tony_Gormley_6141.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tony Gormley">Tony Gormley AfD</a> – bios of each of those that were merged not deleted can be seen on the of the bottom of the page that they were merged to.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/%C3%93glaigh_na_h%C3%89ireann_%28CIRA_splinter_group%29" class="extiw" title="wikipediawikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Óglaigh_na_hÉireann_(CIRA_splinter_group)">Óglaigh na hÉireann (CIRA splinter group) AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> received no delete votes and result was <i>speedy keep'</i>.</p>
<p>There are on going AfD’s which the same pattern at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Federal_Commonwealth_Society_0cff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Federal Commonwealth Society">Federal_Commonwealth_Society|</a> (here is where admin <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">MrDarcy</a> highlights this potential stalk voting), <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lady_Mabel_Fitzwilliam_008a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lady Mabel Fitzwilliam">Lady_Mabel_Fitzwilliam</a> and now <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sir_Keith_Arbuthnot%2C_8th_Baronet_6b5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sir Keith Arbuthnot, 8th Baronet">here</a>.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 01:25, 9 March 2007 (UTC</p>

<dd>How is the fact that Astrotrain voted on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_McGartland_fb79.html" title="Martin McGartland">Martin McGartland</a> relevant? It clearly scuppers VK's allegations. It is perfectly true that sometimes I look at the contributons of other editors - as I note do others. So what? And Robert Murray Arbuthnot is an American lawyer not British nobility. - <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a> 10:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reason that I&#160;!vote for deletion on certain IRA members' biographies is because they are generally minor figures (like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tony_Gormley_6141.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tony Gormley">Tony Gormley</a>) and appallingly partisan (see: <a href="../../../d/i/a/Talk%7EDiarmuid_O%27Neill_b820.html" title="Talk:Diarmuid O'Neill">Talk:Diarmuid O'Neill</a>). There's no need to ascribe membership of a block to me - the low quality of the IRA memorial articles speaks for itself and is reason enough to get rid of them.--<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> 13:27, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
