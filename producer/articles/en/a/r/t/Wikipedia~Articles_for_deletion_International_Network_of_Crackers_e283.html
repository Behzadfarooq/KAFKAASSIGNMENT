<li><b>Delete</b> there are sources, but they're all from a site called defacto2, which doesn't appear to be a reliable source by our standards (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 13:29, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the sources are actual text files and interviews from the group... if that isn't reliable, then I honestly don't know what would be. Defacto2 is a pretty large and decently known site about the warez scene as well... <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EState_of_Love_and_Trust_5b5c.html" title="User:State of Love and Trust">ZoeF</a> 00:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> outlines what reliable sources typically tend to be. If we were doing an article about some arbitrary guy, would his website describing himself be a reliable source of information? Wouldn't he be able to say anything he wanted about himself without regard to whether or not its true? Thats why we need reliable secondary sources, such as something like a computer magazine article or Eweek.com or something like that. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 02:32, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Things written by and about oneself or one's group are never truly reliable sources. Even if one tries to write completely neutrally, bias always arises because they're too close to the subject. I could spend the next few seconds writing a text file that says I'm 9 feet tall, come from Mars, have titanium buttcheeks, and have telekinetic control over pasta, but that wouldn't make it true and likely wouldn't convince many others, either. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b> INC was the first major cracking network, as the name implies, for the IBM PC.

Furthermore, it later led to the formation of the now notorious <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirates_With_Attitude_202e.html" title="Pirates With Attitude">Pirates With Attitude</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obviously, as per my essays on the subject, I don't get involved in Wikipedia issues on the actual Wikipedia much, but I started getting contacted by a number of people about this particular debate, and wished to make a clear and concise statement. I run textfiles.com. I spend a large amount of my waking hours downloading, acquiring, and sorting through primary sources related to bulletin board systems, warez groups, online culture in general and a wide range of related subjects. I hand-scan printouts, transfer original floppy disks from dusty boxes, and travel to interview people who were involved in the various aspects of online life that I have on my site. I am in communication with other archivists doing similar work, or at least also collecting primary sources and information, and verifying, and doing all the proper background work one does when one collects history. Defacto2 is one of many groups doing this. We (defacto, myself, archive.org, Temple of the Screaming Electron (TOTSE) and many others) consider this information important, relevant, and we work to make it accurate and represent "what really happened". This is not the first time Mr. Lenahan has decided to put his mark on deleting aspects of this culture in the name of relevancy, and his statements in the past bear out a lack of perspective on the whole matter of inclusionism vs. deletionism. Focus on improvement, not destruction. I'm sorry to hear about your cat but there are better avenues to vent your sadness. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscott_f61d.html" title="User:Jscott">Jscott</a> 04:43, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> are you kidding? INC was the largest English PC Games Cracking Group I have ever seen (and I have seen quite a few during the last 15 years). At some point 1991/1992 did they absolutely dominate the PC Warez scene and ALL major english game titles were released by INC first, crushing all competition. Okay, there might have been 1-2 slip-throughs, but that makes it statistically still ALL. This would be like deleting the Brockhaus article if you would compare encyclopedias with PC warez groups. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 07:31, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> please this group was very notable and should be documented here <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 01:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Jason Scott's comments. For a collective of pirates that operated solely in the underground in the 1980's and early 1990's I'd say their existence is AMAZINGLY well documented. The efforts of online archivers of bbs culture (underground or public) should be greeted with appreciation, not disdain.--<a href="../../../s/o/d/User%7ESodium_N4_c8b8.html" title="User:Sodium N4">Sodium N4</a> 06:20, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
