<p>Please see the debate on <a href="../../../o/d/y/Talk%7EOdyssey_ef5e.html" title="Talk:Odyssey">Talk:Odyssey</a> about whether or not this book meets notability requirements. I am nominating it for that reason. Also, note that Anthony Snodgrass, a well respected arechologist and Homeric historian refered to this book as an example of lackluster scholarship and his thesis as 'infinitely less serious' than most things out there, which scholars don't even think is worth the time to refute. <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FCAJ%2FCAJ12_02%2FS0959774302000094a.pdf&amp;code=115655f96556f0c0ef0a6e06d5ccf9fa" class="external text" title="http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FCAJ%2FCAJ12_02%2FS0959774302000094a.pdf&amp;code=115655f96556f0c0ef0a6e06d5ccf9fa" rel="nofollow">text here</a>.

<ul>
<li>Strongly <b>oppose</b> deletion. Wikipedia has articles about lots of books, only some of which are scholarly. You might as well delete the article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a>, about which the same statements, attributed to Snodgrass above, could be made. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 18:57, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I weakly <b>oppose</b> deletion. It not the greatest book by any stretch, but it appears to be significant enough - a couple hundred copies listed in <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldCat_6cab.html" title="WorldCat">WorldCat</a>, some citations of the title by other authors, not self published, published in a couple languages and countries, etc. That said, there are plenty of other, better books that deserve to have the same amount of time spent on them. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECbustapeck_21d2.html" title="User:Cbustapeck">cbustapeck</a> 20:19, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> as the book seems to be the exponent of an interesting albeit very minority view. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 20:28 <a href="../../../8/_/o/8_October_8433.html" title="8 October">8 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (GMT).</li>
<li>I <b>oppose</b> deletion of <i>any</i> article on a book that presents a well-rounded Wikipedia article, simply because it is not considered up to academic standards. Andrew Salby's reference to <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is apropos. With this setting a precedent, many references might be suppressed to books whose conclusions are not liked. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 20:32, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The criterion that seems to me to apply: is anyone likely to want to refer to such a page?

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the article needs work, in that it ought to be very clear to one who reads it just how outside the pale of respectable academic theorizing about this subject this particular theory is. Still, one might say the same about the theories in the books of Eric Von Daniken, Immanuel Velikovsky, and lots of other notable authors. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 21:19, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I checked through the few undred Google hits and could not find a single reliable source for an article. Amazon sales rank is over the million mark, there is no evidence of the significance of this book and there is no obvious secondary source for the article itself - I am unable to verify the neutrality of this article from independent secondary sources of any evident authority. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 22:23, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then please ask for verifiable sources to be provided <b>before</b> you vote delete. Just because you cn't find them, doesn't mean they don't exist.

<li><b>Keep</b>--as I say <a href="../../../w/h/e/Talk%7EWhere_Troy_Once_Stood_be2a.html#Pseudoscience" title="Talk:Where Troy Once Stood">elsewhere</a>, WP has a fairly low threshold for notability, and the fact that this book commands high prices on the used book market (see <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&amp;y=13&amp;tn=where+troy+once+stood&amp;x=59" class="external text" title="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&amp;y=13&amp;tn=where+troy+once+stood&amp;x=59" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for instance) indicates that people are interested in it. As mentioned above by Christofurio, the article must indicate just how far out of the mainstream Wilkens' theories are. As an additional comment, the article <a href="../../../i/m/a/Iman_Wilkens_657d.html" title="Iman Wilkens">Iman Wilkens</a> contains almost no information that's not in <a href="../../../w/h/e/Where_Troy_Once_Stood_91c7.html" title="Where Troy Once Stood">Where Troy Once Stood</a>, and if there's an article to delete here, it might be <a href="../../../i/m/a/Iman_Wilkens_657d.html" title="Iman Wilkens">Iman Wilkens</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 22:41, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per JzG. Interesting is not a synonym for encyclopedic. A non-stub article on a non-notable work of tinfoil hat pseudhistory/pseudoarchaeology is undue weight if criticisms are not included, and if nobody bothered to criticise the book that tells its own story. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 13:56, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If there is no criticism, that implies the non-notability of the book. The inability to write <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> articles in the absence of multiple independent reports is why <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is a core requirement. One could argue that a stub article would be NPOV (in making no claims beyond the trivial ones of the book's existence, authorship, &amp;c), but Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of bibliographical cruft, so that wouldn't be an improvement. For books to have articles they have to be notable ... but we've been here already. There's no way an article on this book can meet the core requirements, whatever a proposed guideline like <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> might say. Notability isn't determined by ISBNs, or being included in a few libraries, but by being written about. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>CaveatLector's initial post refers to an article by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Snodgrass_c315.html" title="Anthony Snodgrass">Anthony Snodgrass</a> that includes criticism of Wilkens. To be honest, one of the reasons why I'd like to keep this article is because every few months new editors come on to articles like <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy.html" title="Troy">Troy</a> or <i><a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i> trying to add in Wilkens' theories. If we have this article to point to, and it contains Snodgrass' criticism, it's much easier to say that WP already contains sufficient material on Wilkens. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting to see the redlink there. Actually, Snodgrass helps to make Wilkens notable, simply by speaking against the Cailleux-Wilkens theory. So who's going to write the article on Snodgrass?

<li>Strongly <b>oppose</b> deletion. At one point or another in history Schliemann and even Homer himself would have been "deleted". Snodgrass too... political correctness knows no bounds... I expect Prof. Snodgrass himself would be horrified by the idea of censoring Wilkens: not of criticizing him, certainly, or of dismissing his ideas -- but the notion of <u>removing</u> the ideas of Wilkens or any other non-conformist, "nut" or otherwise, so that they might not even be read, if only to be dismissed, runs against the grain of the Western free-thinking tradition of which both Homer and now Snodgrass himself are parts. I've just read Wilkens' book, myself: greatly entertained, if not convinced -- it has motivated me to re-read Snodgrass.

<dd>This is slightly alarmist.

<dd>No, not alarmist at all. Feel free to doubt if you insist, <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">Akhilleus</a>, but if you and others wade in and censor views here with which you don't personally agree, Wikipedia will turn into just another "political correctness" vehicle, manipulated news of the type we see too often nowadays in Big Media, and in the history textbooks in Japan. So I believe we should let Wilkens have his say, even if some of us don't agree with him. --<a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKessler_5a20.html" title="User:Kessler">Kessler</a> 23:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The book is junk, yes, but I think it's notable junk. One, arguably not so reliable source, <a href="http://www.nycwritersgroup.com/v2/blog/archives/2006/01/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nycwritersgroup.com/v2/blog/archives/2006/01/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> mentions it as a highly sought after book. There's a review apparently here <a href="http://www.epigraphy.org/All_Abstracts.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epigraphy.org/All_Abstracts.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Anyways, I distinctly remember that theory being mentioned at the time the book was published. Some respected people have taken the time to explain how unreasonnable the theory is<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pENNH446VGgC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;vq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22&amp;dq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;sig=ywcHRYEGwgpEmrGPQudPa8vZefo" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=pENNH446VGgC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;vq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22&amp;dq=%22where+troy+once+stood%22+&amp;hl=fr&amp;sig=ywcHRYEGwgpEmrGPQudPa8vZefo" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>

Still it has some sort of cult following and this is exactly what the article should discuss. That being said, it probably falls somewhat short of <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> but not dramatically so either.<a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

In order to be notable a book really needs to generate interest outside of its own field - yet this book generates only about 600 google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22+-site:wikipedia.org+-site:answers.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> very few citation from Google scholar <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, is in only about 300 libraries out of 10,000+ in woldcat <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22907688&amp;referer=brief_results" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22907688&amp;referer=brief_results" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. We should be arguing about the books <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> rather than the correctness or otherwise of it claims. It generates <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2005-08,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2005-08,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22Where+Troy+Once+Stood%22" rel="nofollow">718 Google hits</a> and all editions rank about 1,000,000 in sales on Amazon (the first edition is of course much lower than the new one).

<li>Good point. Just about notable, I think, though the article wants improvement. WTOS is certainly the handiest current reference on the theory concerned, which has been running for more than a century. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 08:51, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There appears to be a great deal of meatpuppetry going on here. Check the talk pages of the "oppose" voters: many have a comment in their talk page telling them to vote here, and if you check the talk page of the person who made the comment, in some cases they <i>also</i> have a comment on their talk page of the same sort. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 00:11, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Of course, if you look at <a href="../../../o/d/y/Talk%7EOdyssey_ef5e.html#Geography_in_the_Odyssey" title="Talk:Odyssey">Talk:Odyssey#Geography in the Odyssey</a>, you'll also see that many of the editors commenting here have recently discussed whether Wilkens' book is a reliable source, so it's pretty natural for them to be interested in this AfD. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not a meatpuppet, I'm a person (I think). I am not in favour of Wilkens' theory, not by several light years, but I believe Wikipedia readers need references on such material. I advised one other user to vote because I know of his interest in the subject. I don't suppose he even knows what a meatpuppet is. Since he asked me how voting was done, I told him, and said he could recommend others to vote so long as he didn't push them one way. (See my posting on his user page <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntiphus_8ca6.html#See_Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FWhere_Troy_Once_Stood" title="User talk:Antiphus">here</a>.)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out to Antiphus that I have not made a REQUEST for deletion, I have merely listed this page in AfD because the book's notability seemed questionable.

<dd>The quotes from your talk page are relevant because they show how this book is treated. You have listed the article in AfD without having read the book! <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiphus_dd1f.html" title="User:Antiphus">Antiphus</a> 19:37, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is debatable. It depends on whether the vote should be made up of AfD regulars, people who have the article on their watchlist, people who are interested in the subject (some WikiProjects are organised enough that they have pages acting as group watchlists so they can contribute to deletion discussions for pages edited by their WikiProject), people who are expert in the subject (probably need someone to ask them to contribute), random passers-by, other random groups of people rounded up and herded over here to vote. I think if you know of someone you know would want to contribute to the debate, then telling them about it is OK. Of course, it would help the closing admin if everyone voting admitted their interest, and revealed how they found out about the debate, but that is never going to happen, is it? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Storkk. I'm certainly not one of those, thank goodness, and don't ever want to be one. Personally, I doubt if any of the others who have voted on this page could be described as such. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 15:16, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It would have been rude, I think, to have this AfD and not let him know about it. Similarly, this AfD follows upon a discussion at <a href="../../../o/d/y/Talk%7EOdyssey_ef5e.html" title="Talk:Odyssey">Talk:Odyssey</a> about whether Wilkens is a reliable source, which many of the commenters here participated in; obviously, people who participated in that discussion have an interest in this one. CaveatLector referred to this discussion in the initial post of the AfD, so it's not as if any of this is a secret. Furthermore, CaveatLector, Andrew Dalby, and myself are members of the <a href="../../../c/g/r/WP%7ECGR_c1b8.html" title="WP:CGR">WikiProject Classical Greece and Rome</a>, so this discussion is of obvious interest to us. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:25, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Heh.&#160;:-) If we are being all nice and open, I am a genuine passer-by, popping in to AfD to see what things are like at the moment. I prefer to see articles cleaned-up and improved, rather than deleted, and if an article seems OK and doesn't immediately set warning bells ringing, I'm happy to see it stay. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:36, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> How about a "Disputed" template, for this case? That doesn't require deletion or correction, as I understand it, but simply notes disagreement on article substance and directs readers to the article's Talk page for discussion &amp; debate. Seems to me that might be the healthiest solution, here: using Wilkens' far-out ideas perhaps to shore up but at least to question received opinion -- nothing worse than the latter unquestioned. The "Disputed" label, at the top, might attract attention but at least would alert the truly innocent. --<a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKessler_5a20.html" title="User:Kessler">Kessler</a> 00:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The full "Disputed" template label reads: "The factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed. / Please see the relevant discussion on the talk page." -- sounds fair to me, for this instance -- helps engender reasonable discussion &amp; debate, good things. --<a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKessler_5a20.html" title="User:Kessler">Kessler</a> 00:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Personally, I check out Afds every once in awhile for fun, because there's often an interesting dispute like this one to be found, and I end up reading articles (and learning about non-mainstream theories) I might never otherwise have encountered. I have told one other member about this one -- not because I knew how he would vote, but frankly because I was curious about his reaction. He's had none (in fact, I've subsequently discovered he's been inactive for two months). I've also mentioned this article and the Afd on my blog, cfaille.blog-city.com, but doubt that will stir much reaction. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 15:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
