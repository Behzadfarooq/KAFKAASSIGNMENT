<li>Keep, I was the one who added the page, not Mathew Valente himself, I added the 'vanity' in there and I recently removed it. However, Mathew Valente has made meaningful contributions to Final Fantasy remakes and is very well known within the Nobuo Uematsu's fan community for his contributions in the form of Soundfonts and other music to help others. This should be enough to keep (please remove my previous vote declaration because this one explains a bit more of my reasoning). Furthermore, his work on the Chrono Trigger ressurection project should be enough. - User: 66.93.247.62</li>

Also, whats the harm in leaving it here? - AaAA <b>(Likely sock puppet - second posting - after one other VfD)</b></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm quite sure he's a very nice guy, but being a nice guy or gal doesn't get you inclusion in an encyclopedia. Or everyone would be listing their mums. Don't take it as any kind of punishment, it's simply not a valid function of Wikipedia to make note of everyone who rocks or is otherwise nice. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 02:33, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Discussion follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have other game musicians listed, why is there any exception here? - User: 66.93.247.62</li>
<li>I personally removed the vanity references, and I don't agree that Mathew Valente is "nonnotable" especially to the thousands who were recently brought aware of his work through Chrono Trigger: Resurrection, which was linked from Slashdot and Game Review pages for people to freely download his remakes. To the Fans of any Squaresoft game this person is genuinely worth keeping. - User: 66.93.247.62</li>
<li>You need to keep Tssf in here, he is a great person and deserves this right. He has done alot for the music community midi-wise and should take this honor. -kokiri_boy</li>
<li>Why delete him? He's a great guy who's really talented. Besides that, you list other game music musicians, why not him? It doesn't make sense to me... Keep him in. - walnut100</li>
<li>Keep tssf in here. He is a great musician, and a nice guy. And like others have said, you list other game music musicians, so why delete him and not the others?</li>
<li>Dont delete him!!! He rocks!!! - Nebetsu: The Slayer Of Weasels</li>
<li>Dont Delete TSSF he's a nice guy and his music rocks too!! - Easy D</li>
<li>Keep him, what's the harm of not doing so? He's done tons of work for many forums, people, etc... He's arranged tons of Zelda remakes and custom songs for me personally (for my fangames and custom games). Mathew has done great things for many communities and the least that you can do is let him keep his account. - Scrappersa

<li>How many potential "Sock Puppets" never post to Wiki at all until they see something that interests them 66.93.247.62 22:01, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>People use it as reference and find that there is no need to post anything, but as soon as soon as they try to defend something they believe in, you call them "sock puppets". I personally don't care if you guys delete this or not, as far as I'm concerned it's all about who's notable or who's not. I believe I've done enough for both the fan-gaming, and the game music scenes that it's not like I don't deserve a notable listing here. A lot of you call it vanity, but most of you don't even realize that I did not post this of myself. Someone else did. So if you're going to accuse me of self-promotion, then fine. Delete the damn thing. A lot of you don't know the whole story so you vote vanity, I bet it makes you feel powerful. I don't care anymore. -Mathew Valente 69.193.14.149 22:12, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Think of Wikipedia as a community. Some people live here (citizens). We edit, we collaborate, we register our identity, we join the community. Some people don't live here, but are still a part of the community, in some lesser sense (visitors) - they read some articles, and they might edit anonymously. I don't know any community that allows visitors to have voting rights. If these sock puppets wish to be full members of the community, they need to register their identities and participate *before* voting, not so that they can have voting rights, but because they care about the community and not about any one specific article. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 22:38, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't get it. We KNOW which of these supposed edits are by sock puppets, and we KNOW that they don't get counted. There's no point in your continuing this nonsense, as only the votes of editors with a significant amount of contribution to the Wikipedia database will be considered. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 23:27, Aug 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I vote for "tssf" to stay. It's totally true,not spam.</p>
<p>My vote for him is to stay. He has given many valuable contributions to the community that many of you simply might not understand. Hes activly involved with the community and an honor to have. Requesting he be removed is like requesting Miss Spears be removed from publicity. Don't let said talent go unrecognized, embrace it&#160;: ) - PKGINGO</p>

<li>I second that! In fact, I was looking for a sock in my dryer just this morning, one which I was sure I'd put in, but alas, 'twas gone. That incident in turn made me think of this gentle discussion with its various and sundry versions of talking hosiery. Then, it really hit me: We may have finally discovered where all those lost socks really go! Ren and Stimpy, eat your hearts out. By the way, I found my sock. It was in the washer. It did not abandon me to become yet another sockpuppet. Since I feel bad for punishing the sock needlessly, I must vote delete. Since I have, in fact, voted once or twice on this page, I felt it was proper to allow my sock to type this particular vote. Trouble is, all I got was <i>dD&amp;YR)TJsfig87348hnkaau&amp;^$#*</i>. It is, after all, merely a sock. - Lucky 6.9 00:43, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The name "Nebetsu: The Slayer Of Weasels" deserves points for originality. I may have to steal that one! - Lucky 6.9 00:47, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment comment: I ran "dD&amp;YR)TJsfig87348hnkaau&amp;^$#*" through Rot-13 and it came back "B-Movie Bandit." Thought you should know. - Lucky 6.9 00:50, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
