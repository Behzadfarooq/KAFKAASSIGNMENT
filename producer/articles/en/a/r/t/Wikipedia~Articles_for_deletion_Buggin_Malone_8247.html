<li><b>Comment</b>, my vote hinges on the whether the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_Music_Awards_5236.html" title="Native American Music Awards">NAMMY</a> is considered a "major music award." Right now I'm leaning towards delete; the notability of an awards' recipients does not necessarily make it a "major" award.

It wasn't necessary, all humans have the ability to be offensive from time to time! As for me, if it was the brevity of my comment, which was intended as well meaning, that started this I will apologise for my own actions. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 08:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No comment on the article, but as always, if Phaedriel (or anyone else in good standing) wants an article userified in order to work on it after it's been deleted, with the goal of getting it to a place where it would stand scrutiny, I and many other editors would be happy to undelete and userify it on request. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
