<ul>
<li>Also 3350 hits for "scientific attitude" in book titles on amazon.

<li>Wikipedia is a work in progress. When you see an article like this, the correct procedure is to <i>expand</i> it. If you delete all pages that aren't perfect yet, the wiki doesn't get a chance to do its job. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 10:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Begging pardon, but as someone who's actually studying philosophy of science academically right now, the term "scientific attitude" is so vague as to be hopeless. Much better minds than we have tried to define what makes up science, and there is no agreement yet on even whether it <i>is</i> an attitude (as opposed to a societal value system, logical system, or something else), let alone what such an "attitude" might be. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 15:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would explain why there are so many opinions about the subject (as per google, amazon, pubmed above) . Quite worthy of an NPOV article explaining the different views!&#160;:-) Thank you for pointing out that this is a notable subject in the philosophy of science. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 19:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I'm saying the opposite if you'd listen. I'm technically pointing out that the title itself (and hence, the subject) is <i>question-begging</i> as far as academia is concerned. There is so little consensus out there that there isn't even agreement on what is being discussed, let alone the details of it. Every philosopher of science has their own take on how science is done and why, and has their own set of things that they focus on. While concepts like <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_theory.html" title="Value theory">Value theory</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationality.html" title="Rationality">Rationality</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm_shift.html" title="Paradigm shift">Paradigm shift</a> have gotten a lot of attention, there are few treatments on "scientific attitude" out there. In my own search of the literature I get 26 hits, of which (judging by the titles and abstracts) all but one merely use the term without elaboration. (I'm not sure what a search of a <i>biomedical</i> journal repository such as PubMed is meant to demonstrate about a socio-psycho-philosophical concept.) Most of them use the term in mutually-incompatible senses. Undoubtably something could be written, but this is an areas of inquiry that has yet to stabilise in the real world and I do doubt that we humble Wikipedia editors could document something that the real world hasn't even begun to settle on without resorting to original research. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Philosphers of science can debate forever, in the mean time, there's science to be done on the ground. People are showing *some* attitude or other. Are you sure there's no material on that topic? Google and amazon (and <b>even</b> a <i>biomedical</i> search) show hits.</dd>
<dd>I just did searches in some locations I use regularly. Each gave quite a number of hits. I think scientific attitude has probably been discussed to death for centuries. I'd be quite surprised if there was no literature on the subject. Once again, if people are discussing the topic, and the subject is unstable, you can report which main ideas have formed over time.</dd>
<dd>You yourself state that there is material on the subject, but that people are still all confused. Then that's what we report. And mutually incompatible senses you say? That's where NPOV can really shine!&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>I'm with you until you say "you yourself...". Yes, there may be material. I doubt it, and for the reasons I state. People are free to go do that research and create a new article at this title. Where you lose me and my patience is when you attribute words to me I haven't written. I have specifically said that, to my knowledge, there is <i>not</i> literature on the subject. What I <i>have</i> said is that there is literature about something that <i>some people</i> could label "scientific attitude" if they were to engage in original research, but that such a term is not in currency that I am aware of. I said that there is debate about <i>science</i> in general and what it means to do it, so much so that there is no agreement (not "disagreement") on the terms used. Simply put, to my knowledge what constitutes the "scientific attitude" is not under debate because the debaters on the topic of <i>science</i> are busy with other things and haven't begun considering the colloquial term in any academic way. Again, I may be wrong, but using a mistake about what I'm actually saying (or at least trying to say) in your persuasion is not going to convince me of that. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 01:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough on misunderstanding, my apologies. But if what you say is true, how does one account for so many hits, sometimes for the literal phrase? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 20:21, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are two ways to account for it: (1) the term has a lot of common currency but isn't treated on as a topic of discussion (i.e., it's just a common term and not a solidified concept), or (2) that I'm wrong, and there is treatment of the topic in a focused way with common premises. I believe (1) is the case, but I recognise that the reality may be between the two. (That being wrong isn't a fatally-bad thing is one of the joys of consensus decisions.) — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 21:35, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
