<p>Patrique is an American author, socialite, pop singer and fashion designer. His projects have been mostly independent, but he has received a high degree of attention for his personal life and at times comedic actions.</p>
<p>Patrique first came in to the public eye in late 2005/early 2006 as a socialite when his antics with British socialite Shane Tyas became a fixture in internet gossip blogs. On December 23, 2005 Girlstalkinsmack.com reported that Patrique and Tyas would be starring in a Fox spinoff of the E! program "The Simple Life" starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Then, on January 21, 2006 FadedYouth reported that Patrique would be suing Shane Tyas for $3 million. Patrique reportedly filed the lawsuit with Paris Hilton, and gossip blogger Perez Hilton. In late 2006 Patrique made a petition against myspace model Tila Tequila complaining about the fact that she lists herself as an unsigned artist even though she is signed to A&amp;M records. Shortly after the petition was released A Hot Mess Gossip Blog, citing a blind item, claimed that Patrique actually started the petition because he was angry at Tila for stealing his rumored boyfriend, actor Jared Leto. The rumor quickly spread through the internet.</p>
<p>In 2006, Patrique released his first book "Beverly Hills 60643" with print on demand company Lulu. The book chronicled the lives of four teenagers in the wealthy Chicago community of Beverly. The book recieved a fair amount of public attention, the book has yet to recieve any commercial success, lurking at the bottom of the Lulu.com sales chart.</p>
<p>Also in 2006 Patrique released his own clothing line called "Strength: By Patrique" the line featured highly priced clothes for all ages.</p>
<p>Patrique is in the process of recording an album, which will be a mixture of Pop and R&amp;B. On August 31, 2006 Patrique's song "It's All About Me" was leaked to the internet, the self affirming song is about Patrique and his material possesions. The song has been criticized for being self centered. Some claim that the songs instrumentals are similiar to a Britney Spears song "Oops I Did It Again." The songs lyrics are also nearly identical to a song of the same name from a Disney channel show "The Proud Family." Many claimed that the song in the voice could not be Patrique since it sounded like an African American singing the song, and compared Patrique to Milli Vanilli. Patrique denied the claims insisting that he did sing on the track and the producers had just used "cool effects" to make his voice "sound different."</p>

<p>Atp2102 05:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)In the contemporary United States, nursing homes and retirement homes are seen as the norm to care for the elderly population. In antiquity, gerokmeion or old people’s homes were very rare. In the Greco-Roman tradition, the care of the old was provided by the family. Children were expected to care for their parents and this was the primary if not only means of care for the elderly in the Greco-Roman era. Care for the elderly was a private not public concern. Slaves in their old age might find support from their masters. With the rise of Christianity, there began to be more organized care for the elderly. Alms-giving became an accepted practice and was used to assist the sick, which included the elderly who were many times the worst off out of the indigent. Saint Basil an important leader in the Early Christian Church, also played an important role in the care of the poor/elderly. In the 4th century, he saw the creation of the “city of charity” outside of Caesarea. It was known as Basiliad. Grouped around the church, were hospitals, hospices, and schools where the poverty-stricken, sick, and desperate could obtain care. Saint Basil was active in his “city of charity.” He was known for his willingness to embrace those that were suffering, even those with leprosy. Furthermore, he poor register, brought up for the first time in 5th century Gaul, was a list made by local churches and monasteries of those in most dire need. Some of the impoverished, sick, and elderly that were on the list were given food and were housed and cared for by the local monastery or church. Tertullian mentions a Christian fund for the domestici sense. Yet the term gerokmeion first appears in legal writing in the 6th century. Furthermore, Jewish communities provided specialized charitable organizations for the care of the old also. These consecrated houses’ are mentioned in Germany in the eleventh century.</p>

<p>"Teeming and Lading" refers to a specific kind of cash fraud. When monies are received from returned invoices, an employee may divert the monies into a personal bank account rather than their employer's account. To hide the missing cash, the next time money is received from the customer whose money has been diverted, the new receipt is matched to the old invoice, for which the money is still outstanding.</p>

<p>The American Society of Pharmacy Law (ASPL) is an organization of pharmacist-attorneys, pharmacists, attorneys, and students in schools of pharmacy or law who are interested in the law as it applies to pharmacy. The mission of the Society is to "educate the pharmacist-attorneys, pharmacists, attorneys and other interested parties on legal issues that affect pharmacy."</p>
<p>Founded in 1974 by Joseph L. Fink III, a pharmacist-lawyer on the faculty of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, ASPL maintains a website containing information and useful web links for members and anyone who is interested in the law as it applies to the profession of pharmacy. In addition, this web site would help those interested in searching for pharmacist-attorneys, an attorney with a particular interest in pharmacy law in a specific state or an expert witnesses on topics related to pharmacy. The Society confers a number of national awards in the field and sponsors or cosponsors two national conferences each year on topics related to pharmacy law and ethics.</p>

<p>Infinity boasts a game engine featuring Level of Detail (LOD) progression of procedurally generated environments. What this means is that the entire environment, be it space, atmosphere, underwater, ground based or interior are generated procedurally (vs. random) via user generated variables, thus presenting a unique global map/environment so to speak at any one instant. In this way the game is able to mimick real life situations, such as when borders of countries and stars may change from a single event.</p>
<p>The game engine is significant because most games use devices such as loading screens to load game data for various levels. These loading screens interrupt gameplay and can be distracting and annoying to players. The goal of game programmers (especially for MMORPGs) is to provide seamless gameplay, which so far has remained elusive due to technical restrictions. Infinity claims to provide a seamless experience, but as a result has high system requirements.</p>

<p>The great thing about sci-fi related space environments are the ships, vehicles and environments. In space, one can liken it to the great vistas of the wild west or coldness of the arctic tundra or even the vast richness of the Galapagos islands.</p>
<p>In space, one can find a similar abstraction in the form of gaseous nebulae, whole new planets and planetoids. or derelict objects of space age technology</p>

<p>When producing concept art and designs for any genre be it a upcoming movie or the latest art nouveau game, coherency of concept art becomes critical. However, when one is required to portray the richness that is akin to millennia of space colonization of mankind, then perhaps it is a bit wider to throw open the gauntlet to the public.</p>
<p>The Infinity project is thus unique in that there is active public participation and cooperation with a core group of designers and artists in the joint production of vehicles, artifacts, massive space ships and stations to populate the Infinite universe.</p>
<p>A quality, coherency and aesthetic rating is thus given to each submission and once quality control for each concept is passed, and subsequently modelled and textured successfully these designs from concept to final model are included within the Infinity framework for all to enjoy</p>

Update: Currently version 2.0 of the Combat Prototype has been announced and is expected to be release imminently. Major developments, including a lot more ships, gameplay refinement and the ability to mine resources will be the featured in TCP 2.0. Check the official forums for more info.</p>
<p>Update: Version 2.1 is now available for download ( <a href="http://fl-tw.com/Infinity/infinity_combat_proto.php" class="external free" title="http://fl-tw.com/Infinity/infinity_combat_proto.php" rel="nofollow">http://fl-tw.com/Infinity/infinity_combat_proto.php</a> )</p>
<p>The combat prototype is a multiplayer server intended for the testing of bugs, game physics, balancing, and the combat system. It is currently available and is linked at the bottom of this page. Patches are released regularly, most of which fix bugs, but a recent one has added content. The combat prototype has been tested by many eager players, and as the fan database grows, so does the prototype.</p>
<p>The goal of the prototype is to destroy the enemy battleship. When one first logs on, they are in spectator mode. By pressing the space bar the player is then randomly assigned a team (red or blue) until the end of the match. They may then choose a space ship to fly into battle. Among the 8 choices of ships available are the Varden, which is a 3-winged fighter class, the Makon, which is a light frigate class, and the Carrier, which is very large, but costs many points to play as. A player starts with 250 points, and gains more by defeating enemies. The bigger ships are more expensive than the smaller ships; the Varden is 100 points while the carrier is 10,000.</p>
<a name="Tactics" id="Tactics"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Tactics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics</span></h3>
<p>There are numerous of tactical "stuns" and tricks you can learn to become a better pilot, This list explains the most regular ones:</p>
<a name="Orbiting" id="Orbiting"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Orbiting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Orbiting</span></h4>
<p>This technique uses the thrusters and the speed of a fighterclass. You simply approach your target with full speed and when close enough aim at the middle of the target and hold down either up or down thrusters to start spinning around your target, thus "Orbiting" it. The technique is mainly used against the carrier and the battle ship to bring them down with out getting shot by its cannons.</p>
<a name="Mining" id="Mining"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Mining">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mining</span></h4>
<p>Capital ships are better at this, because of their more powerful weaponry. If plagued by small fighters, you can head over to the nearest asteroid and begin shooting at it. After a while it will explode, often destroying nearby fighters while barely scratching the capital ship's shields, which proceed to quickly regenerate. The larger the asteroid, the more powerful the explosion, but it will take much longer.</p>
<a name="Camping" id="Camping"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Camping">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camping</span></h4>
<p>This involves flying into the Hangar bay of an enemy Battleship and firing upon it from the inside. This is a very risky manoeuvre and is difficult to accomplish, but can usually pay off dividends. The advantages are that once inside, you are out of range of the Carriers' and Battleship's big guns and so are fairly free to fire upon the Battleship without fear of destruction. The disadvantages are that you must first get past the big guns to get into the Hangar Bay, that an enemy fighter may spawn inside the Hangar Bay while you are there or may follow you back inside, and that only small ships are capable of accomplishing this as the Hangar Bay entrance is too small to allow a Makon or larger vessel inside.</p>
<a name="Carrier_Charging" id="Carrier_Charging"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Carrier Charging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Carrier Charging</span></h4>
<p>Carrier charging first requires that a player earn enough points (10,000) to purchase a carrier. Then, the player simply flies the carrier straight at the enemy battleship. This tactic usually severely damages the enemy battleship, due to the heavy armor, strong weapons, and lack of recharge time the carrier possesses. A good defense against carrier charges is to work up a large amount of speed and ram the carrier, as this will send it spinning off course, and its great inertia makes it very difficult to manoeuvre the carrier back into the necessary position.</p>
<a name="Ship_Classes" id="Ship_Classes"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Ship Classes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ship Classes</span></h3>

<p>In Infinity, there will be many classes of ships. The following is a list that includes just some of them.</p>
<a name="Interceptor" id="Interceptor"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Interceptor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interceptor</span></h4>
<p>Interceptors are light and fast. They are incapable of FTL travel, and thus must dock with a capital ship for long-range transportation. Because of this, pilots will be at an advantage by working for the owner of a battleship. Normally, this would be done by defending the larger ships from bombers because they are well-suited for the job due to their speed. When used in defense, interceptors are not prone to enemy flak coming from the enemy battleship. This makes an interceptor's job relatively safe. They can be up to 25 meters long.</p>
<a name="Fighter" id="Fighter"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Fighter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fighter</span></h4>
<p>Fighters are bulkier than interceptors, and have better defenses. However, they are slightly slower and are less maneuverable. They are capable of FTL travel, but because of their small size and lack of self-sufficiency, this gives fighter pilots only a small amount more freedom than an interceptor pilot. Thus, fighter pilots gain an advantage working for a capital ship. They are well-suited to hunting down and destroying interceptors and bombers. The role of a fighter is riskier than an interceptor, though, because they are often midfield in the battle, which exposes them to enemy flak. They can be up to 25 meters long.</p>
<a name="Bomber" id="Bomber"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Bomber">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bomber</span></h4>
<p>Bombers are heavy and carry explosive weapons. These weapons are especially effective against capital ships, which tends to lead to them attacking the enemy battleships directly. Like fighters, bombers can travel faster than light, but again, lack self sufficiency. In battle, bombers have the most dangerous role because of their proximity to the enemy capital ships and constant interactions with interceptors. Bombers can be up to 25 meters long.</p>
<a name="Corvette" id="Corvette"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Corvette">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Corvette</span></h4>
<p>Corvettes are larger than the previously mentioned ships, and are the smallest ship capable of wielding weapons that move independently of the ship. Because of their size they still move fast and handle well, but not nearly as well as an interceptor. These ships can be outfitted with explosives, flak, and forward-facing guns. Corvettes, and all ships larger, are capable of FTL travel. They are 25 to 50 meters long.</p>
<a name="Battleship" id="Battleship"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Battleship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battleship</span></h4>
<p>Battleships are huge, slow ships covered with weaponry. They carry subhunter-class ships into battle. The destruction of a battleship often marks the end of a battle because they are so important. Battleships can have up to 40 turrets which can be used for flak and heavy turrets. They are 1250-2500 meters long.</p>
<a name="Haulers" id="Haulers"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Haulers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Haulers</span></h4>
<p>Haulers are the workhorse of the Infinity universe. These ship range in size from small to massive, and are used for transporting, or hauling cargo, from raw resources to completed ships from one place to another.</p>
<a name="Carriers" id="Carriers"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Carriers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Carriers</span></h4>
<p>Tactical weapons not meant for use in close quarters combat, carriers are capital ships designed to deliver smaller craft like fighters and bombers into battle. Commonly large, yet often poorly armed in comparison with like-sized combat ships, the best place for a carrier is far behind the front lines, where it can function as a support ship for the larger capital ships.</p>
<a name="Dreadnaughts" id="Dreadnaughts"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-19_fd2e.html" title="Edit section: Dreadnaughts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dreadnaughts</span></h4>
<p>Dreadnaughts are designed for use as powerful weapons, both physically an psychologically. Many times larger than battleships, dreadnaughts deliver massive firepower on the battlefield, as well as intimidation intended to greatly demoralize the enemy, encouraging them to either route, or surrender.</p>

<p>Dave Golden is a musician and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Fellowship" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Fellowship" rel="nofollow">Fulbright Scholar</a>, originally from New York, who currently resides in New Orleans and tours internationally. His career has spanned from jazz to classical to folk, bluegrass and country.</p>
<p>Golden's career begin in 1997 while playing in a New York City-based jazz sextet with Charlie Looker and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bernstein_%28pop-punk_musician%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bernstein_%28pop-punk_musician%29" rel="nofollow">Max Bernstein</a>. They gained recognition from Downbeat Magazine and were launched on a European tour, at the behest of the organizers of the Montreux Jazz Festival, where they played five performances. The group mixed Golden and Looker's avant garde compositions alongside standards and lesser-known elements of the jazz canon.</p>
<p>Golden left the music world in 1997 and worked a job at a Finnish paper mill before returning to the US. He earned a degree from Williams College and while there he joined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_ski_patrol" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_ski_patrol" rel="nofollow">National Ski Patrol</a> and started a jazz trio with Taiwanese pop star, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Hom_Wang" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Hom_Wang" rel="nofollow">Lee Hom Wang</a>, who was also studying there at the time. In 2001, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship.</p>
<p>Golden resurfaced on the music scene in 2004, with the award-winning film score for Sometimes the Neighbor and shortly after was on the summer festival circuit playing a repertoire of more folk and blues-inspired pieces. In 2004 and 2005, the Future of Music Coalition awarded him with back-to-back Fellowships and a review from Entertainment Today put him on the map again where he was quickly spotted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Johnston" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Johnston" rel="nofollow">Bob Johnston</a>. Johnston, having just left a decades-long tenure at Columbia Records, lauded Golden as a songwriter in a class with his former colleagues, Dylan, Cash and Cohen, and invited him to record for his new label, JAM.</p>
<p>Golden's career got another boost after Nuvo Newsweekly chose his improvisational encore performance as the highlight of the 2004 Midwest Music Summit. His collaborators at that performance, Chicago's Shelley Miller and New York's Jeremiah Birnbaum, toured with him on and off in 2005 alongside Chicago's Kara Kulpa and Samantha Twigg Johnson. The group called themselves Mercy Driver. Although Mercy Driver only lasted for less than a year, Golden continued to tour through 2005 with individual members of Mercy Driver, while taking breaks to record his debut album in New Orleans.</p>
<p>What was to be his debut album as a singer-songwriter, Wake To These Satellites, was never released. A studio error brought the backups to New Orleans in late August 2005 and the album was lost during the floods that followed Katrina. In its place, the dark folk album How To Breathe, was self-released in early 2006 and propelled a more modest tour, but one that saw Golden as a headliner at that summer's Cutting Edge (New Orleans) and Dewey Beach (Delaware) Americana Festivals.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2006, Golden ended his 2-year tour and returned to the studio. Throughout the end of 2006, Golden has turned up with several different bands supporting him, playing under false names such as Greyeye and The Diesel Blues.</p>

<p>74.38.246.208 16:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Take the concept of manifold from Technology. Manifold IS an existent operational SYSTEM that gives quantum gravitational OPERATIONAL *togetherness. Human Hand with five fingers + the Nerve impulses going to the brain is a biologic manifold going through space time and complexity region of existence. No five fingers with appositional thumb no human like dexterity no origin of the human brain! I have talked with many people who have assured me that this IS a true description that makes them see the Darwinian Evolution going through Cosmic Reality without faith being involved!</p>

<p>Emma McCune was born in India in 1964 to ex-colonial parents who could not adjust to life in England after their return from India. Eventually her parents divorced and her father committed suicide.</p>
<p>As a young aspiring English aid worker, McCune went to war-torn Sudan in 1987 at age 23 to teach for the British organisation Volunter Services Overseas, after reluctantly returning to England in 1988 McCune once again retunred to Sudan in 1989 to work for the UNICEF-funded Canadian organisation Street Kids International. Street Kids International founded/ re-opened more than 100 village schools in the country's south. "In my heart, I'm Sudanese," Scroggins quotes her as saying. McCune spent much of the late 1980s in the south in the midst of war and famine.</p>
<p>McCune met and married one of two leading southern guerrilla commanders <a href="../../../r/i/e/Riek_Machar_43dd.html" title="Riek Machar">Riek Machar</a>, McCune became a high-profile khawagiyya (foreigner). Their attraction was, apparently, instant; the liaison cost her her job with Street Kids International. After they married, she lived with him behind the battlelines of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century. In 1993 had just retreated to Nairobi to have her first child when she died, at 29, in a car crash.</p>
<p>Emma told a television correspondent, “Sudan has magic that takes hold of you for better or worse” [p. 42]</p>

<p>The Red Masque, founded in 2001, is an original, avant rock band from Philadelphia. Primarily influenced by such progressive rock and psychedelic bands as King Crimson, Magma, Van Der Graaf Generator and Art Bears, one of the group's first concerts was at the Prelude to the North East Art Rock Festival (NEARFest) in 2001 where they performed with the likes of Land of Chocolate and Wine of Nails). The Red Masque have also performed at the 2005 Rogue Independent Music Festival in Atlanta, GA; the 2001 World Con Science Fiction Convention [Philadelphia], the New Jersey proghouse series, Orion Studios in Baltimore; the Philadelphia Landing Pad Space Rock Festival; and The Gate to Moonbase Alpha concert series at the Rotunda in Philadelphia; as well as organized and performed in the 2002 and 2003 Philadelphia Underground Music and Culture Festival. The Red Masque has also opened up for musicians such as Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears), The Muffins, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Skeletonbreath, and Present. In 2006, special guests Dave Kerman (of 5UUs, Present, Thinking Plague) and Paul Sears (of The Muffins and Thee Maximalists) performed with the band on stage as part of the New Jersey Proghouse series.</p>
<p>The Red Masque have released to date one EP ("Death of the Red Masque" in 2001), and two albums ("Victoria and the Haruspex" in 2002 and "Feathers for Flesh" in 2004). "Feathers for Flesh" was released through the Big Balloon Music label out of Washington state and was reviewed in such publications as Wire Magazine (issue no. 248), Harmonie Magazine (issue No. 52), Progresiste Magazine (issue No. 39), iO Pages (Issue No. 55), Colussus Magazine (issue No. 26), Tarkus Magazine (issue No. 30), Progression Magazine (issue No. 47), Expose Magazine (issue No. 31), and various online newsletters, blogs, and review sites. Interviews in various progressive music media also followed, including Progression Magazine (issue No. 49) and Expose Magazine (in their online "Extra!" edition).</p>
<p>The band is currently working on a third album, "Fossil Eyes", which is due to be released in 2007 with an independent avant garde label (though the label's identity is as yet unannounced by the band). A preview of the song "Carbon 14" off this new album were played at the 2006 NEARFest to garner publicity.</p>
<p>Current band lineup includes band founders Brandon Ross (bass, keys) and Lynnette Shelley (vocals, percussion), and Brian "Vonorn" Van Korn (drums, keys, theremin, assorted other instruments, and producer of "Feathers for Flesh" and "Fossil Eyes"), Andrew Kowal (guitars, mandolin and violin). Former members include Kevin Kelly (drums), Steven Blumberg (guitars), Nathan-Andrew Dewin (keys, electric concert harp, percussion), and Kiarash Emami (guitars, mandolin).</p>

<p>Born and brought up in Mumbai's Pali Hill, Captain Vinod Nair shocked everyone when he decided to join the Indian Army. After getting through in his very first attempt, he was commissioned into the 19th Battalion of the Punjab regiment.</p>
<p>He served in a variety of places including 3 years in the indo - pak border area of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. After a colorful tenure, he left the army with honors in 1995.</p>
<p>Since then, he's made quite a name for himself. He is today associated with some of the biggest names in the western and global corporate world. He's also well known for his philanthropic work of supporting the 'House of Charity'a home for mentally challenged children.</p>
<p>He was always a brilliant speaker but his first big break came with his patented subject called Attitudinal Intelligence (<a href="http://www.kimmaya.com/ai.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kimmaya.com/ai.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kimmaya.com/ai.htm</a>) where he advised people to sart thinking intelligently.</p>
<p>However, he entered the world stage when he launched Kimmaya, a way of life and thinking in 2006. Kimmaya made a big spalsh and catapulted hin into the league of the world's most wanted consultants.</p>
<p>Not too much is known about his private life except that he lives in Mumbai's Pali Hill and is in a long term relationship with Bollywood actress Tulip Joshi (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Joshi" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Joshi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Joshi</a>)</p>
<p>The two of them do make occassional appearances at social functions and are quite adored by the media for their polished yet down to earth mannerisms and behavior.</p>
<p>A word of advise: keep an eye on this man, he's a rising star.</p>
