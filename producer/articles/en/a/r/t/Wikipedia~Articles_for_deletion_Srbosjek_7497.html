<dd><b>Comment</b>That picture on the holocaust memorial museum is sourced from Yugoslavia, one of the combantants with the state of Croatia of that time which brings into question it's reliability. Is there any mention of it from the official Jasenovac camp museum - I had a look @ the website<a href="http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/index_en.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jusp-jasenovac.hr/index_en.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> &amp; couldn't find any mention of the Srbosjek. It would be strange if the museum, the alleged site where the weapon was used had no mention of it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 12:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Information about this knife could come only from Yugoslavia. Please don’t forget that Croatia was integral part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later after the World War Two Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was never in war with Yugoslavia since later didn’t existed during occupation by Axis powers. Do we have to presume that the Jasenovac camp museum is only museum in the world that has reliable information about what happened in this concentration camp during World War Two? During war between ex Yugoslav states, Croatia went trough revival of Ustashi ideology which in many ways affected the comprehension of history of NDH and its crimes. I don’t believe that any museum in Croatia could be objective about Jasenovac and its significance. What I don’t understand is why facts presented on United States Holocaust Memorial Museum official website aren’t good enough to be used on Wikipedia. Do we have to presume that this museum couldn’t preserve objectivity or even that is spread false information about Holocaust. Is their criteria lower then the criteria of Wikipedia? I don’t think so. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarko_M_7cf8.html" title="User:Marko M">Marko M</a> 18:37, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The issue isn't whether United States Holocaust Memorial Museum official website is good enough - they would have accepted the information from the communist Yugoslav state in good faith. It's whether the original "Yugoslav" source is untainted.</dd>
<dd>Croatia was in conflict with Yugoslavia 3 times:
<ul>
<li>the first Yugoslavia was littered with ethnic conflict between the Croats &amp; the Yugoslav security structures dominated by Serbs, prompting protests about the Croats plight @ the League of Nations by intellectuals like Albert Eienstein. This continued until the formation of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banovina_of_Croatia_1e8e.html" title="Banovina of Croatia">Banovina of Croatia</a>;</li>
<li>In WW2, the NDH security structures fought the remnants of the Yugoslav military (Serb <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chetnik.html" title="Chetnik">Chetniks</a>) as well as the communist dominated Partisans - the Partisans went on to form the second Yugoslavia. It was in their interest to portray their military &amp; idealogical enemies in the worst possible light, with the aim of increasing the size war reparations, but also to legitimize the Communist governments' role in saving the peoples of Yugoslavia from the horrors of nationalism. So various myths were invented, such as <a href="http://wap.macedonia.org/myth/eyes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wap.macedonia.org/myth/eyes.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Hence the need for a multitude of reliable sources;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Your choice of words shows your (1) reliance on propaganda and (2) lack of knowledge on the issue. (1) Referring to your reliance on propaganda, the fact that you called the Serbs 'Chetniks' yet failed to refer to the Croat forces as Nazis (which is precisely what they were, do not even attempt to argue against this) is strong proof of your desire to portray the Serbs in a negative light, while leaving out a very negative fact about the Croat forces of the time. Also, using famous people to support your argument shows weakness, and once again, the usage of a propaganda tool. Also, referring to the horrors of 'NAZISM' as the horrors of 'nationalism' is a big no-no. The military of Yugoslavia was trying to save its people from Nazism (torture/death-no this is not propaganda, it is a fact), not nationalism. (2) Secondly, the fact that when referring to the Yugoslav military, you mention the Cetniks as being the dominant part of it, and then say 'as well as the... Partisans', shows your lack of knowledge. My friend, the Cetniks formed the ROYAL Yugoslav army, while the Partisans the Communist Yugoslav army. They were never part of a single 'Yugoslav military' as you have phrased it (and hated each other, as I'm sure you must be aware of). If you were aware of this significant fact, you have proven your lack of attention to detail and the importance of phrasing oneself correctly. Therefore, please cease to include such irrelevant arguments, which make you look bad due to your use of propaganda (wording) and your disregard for detail/correct information. This long reply was necessary, to set you straight, as you could better contribute to Wikipedia, and to let others know where certain faults in your reasoning might lie.

<li>Who said anything about Chetniks being a negative connotation?;</li>
<li>Dominant portion of the military of the first <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> became Chetnik formations after the country's dissolution - this is what the units called themselves <a href="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/chetniks/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/chetniks/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The denotion "Serb" was to distinguish it from the multinational Partisans;</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/d/h/NDH_e0d1.html" title="NDH">NDH</a> security structures included the fascist Ustasha militia, whilst the majority were the non-political Home Gaurd that was the successor to the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Croatian_Home_Guard_9360.html" title="Imperial Croatian Home Guard">Imperial Croatian Home Guard</a>. Hence one cannot use sweeping generalisations to describe a mixed forces;</li>
<li>NDH security structures fought against both Chetniks &amp; Partisans, hence, they fought against two Yugoslavias, the forces of the then defunct 1st Yugoslavia, and forces that envisaged a second communist Yugoslavia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 09:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not propaganda; fact, precipated by the murder of Croat intellectual Milan Sufflay - refer <a href="http://www.hr/darko/etf/nyt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hr/darko/etf/nyt.html" rel="nofollow">New York Times article about the death of Šufflay</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.hr/darko/etf/einste.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hr/darko/etf/einste.html" rel="nofollow">Einstein/Mann appeal</a>. It's relevance was to provide evidence of conflict b/w Croats &amp; Yugoslav forces which in turn goes to the point of reliability of "Yugoslav" (a.k.a Serb) sources. Quoting a "famous person" as you put it, means that the source can be found more easily;</li>
<li>The Communist leadership was concerned about nationalism - you may want to read some of the marxist literature. The federal nature of second Yugoslavia was to reassure the smaller communities that the Greater Serbia hegemony of the first Yugoslavia would not be repeated, as well as a first step of overcoming <i>the nationalist opiate that had hindered the workers struggle for freedom</i>.

<dd>The term "Srbosjek" is also good known in the croatian realm, although no one really know what it is, but the word itself is know good enough, so I suppose neither the serbs know what this word _exactly_ describes, and if the knife on this picture _is_ really it, and if the knife was used _under this name_ in the concentraation camps, as the article suggests, i.e if the contents this article should be kept under this name. As of now, despite the many "Keeps", the connection between the actual article title, the existing word "Srbosjek" and its content (especially the pictures), has not been verified to put it into a internationally accessible encyclopedia as a verified fact when no one can verify it. -- <a href="../../../r/h/u/User%7ERhun_3352.html" title="User:Rhun">Rhun</a> 15:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Knowing history of USA I could claim with certainty that thousands of people were killed with Bowie knife. Of course, I need reliable source to verify this claim despite the fact that it’s historically correct. Problem with administration on most Wikipedias including this one is that administrators just won’t go further to resolve problem like this. True administrator would already be contacting United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. and starting enquiry about origins of photograph representing Srbosjek. What ever the outcome of this enquiry would be, it would surly benefit Wikipedia by confirming the content of this article or by denying it. The later outcome could lead to correction of information on the official site of US Holocaust Memorial Museum which would raise the reputation of Wikipedia. But who am I to teach you how to do your job. I’ll wait and see the outcome of this vote and do what ever I can to find sources that would satisfy your criteria. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarko_M_7cf8.html" title="User:Marko M">Marko M</a> 18:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

is almost impossible to verify. To be analogous to the article, the claim would have to say that thousands of people were killed in one small location in the US?

<dd>You are voting for "keep" and at the same time acknowledging the lack of sources?? How does that work? Its not that the "Serbs" are a not reliable source, its the fact that we as of now dont have any third party aknowledging the authenticity of this word "Srbosjek" like we have for the genocide in Jasenovac. The Serbs and Croatians were engaged in a war and decades of mutual nationalistic hatred, and there was a _LOT_ of propaganda going on between them, so without third party review of the information (like for example, the books you cited) you just cant take it as a "proven fact" for an international encyclopedia. So how can you vote to "Keep" an article called "Srbosjek" when neither of your two pages mentioned above actually mentiones the word at all? I think its pretty clear what was happening at Jasenovac, and who was <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petar_Brzica_4a44.html" title="Petar Brzica">Petar Brzica</a>, but evidence is also needed for the word and article title itself. When the references only mention that the Jasenovac-knife was named "graviso", why should the article stay as "Srbosjek"? Thats the missing part. Linking more and more sites dealing with the atrocitiese at Jasenovac is useless, when they dont identify the knife as "Srbosjek".

<dd>I didn't say sources don't exist. I said there is a 'lack' of sources, also known as an 'insufficient' amount, aka: NOT ENOUGH, not 'not any at all'. And to add to that, most people believe there is a lack of sources because the sources are 'Yugoslavian' or 'Serbian' and therefore, considered unreliable (you yourself are an example of this, as you claim that two sources -serbian and croat- are unreliable and not sufficient, when we all know if the American gov't issued a statement, it would be accepted as truth almost immediately). The word need not be mentioned, when the picture, which is clearly identified by two entire peoples as the 'srbosjek' is included in the source. In addition, I have come across the term (along with a photo reference) in books, which I unfortunately do not have in my possession any longer so I cannot provide their names or find the page numbers to provide an exact reference, therefore, the references DO exist out there, there is no doubt about it. This is why I vote for <b>keep</b>.

<dd>It is common practice with two war parties accusing each other of wartime atrocities to exaggregate the opponent's crimes and to hush up the own ones. The US itself does this all the time (genie weapons of mass destruction, kuwait babies torn from their incubators, concentration camps in kosovo, and so on), so I would take any of the news issued from the white house regarding someone theyre preparing a war on with a grain of salt. The same way I wouldnt trust any serbian or croatian accusing the opponent of some atrocity without _anybody_ neutral to this conflict verifying this. Example Jasenovac: the estimations on the number of victims go from 50.000 (croatian number) up to 600.000 (serbian number). Its fairly likely that the truth lies there in between, and that both sides try to fake the numbers in their "favor" still today and therefore are not to be trusted. So I acknowledge third party (like the USHMM) pictures of the knife, and a description of its usage as reliable, but wouldnt take the serbian-only sources as facts, when in this 60 years since the WW2 _NOBODY_ not even the jewish holocaust organisations cared to verify those sources. Thankfully, as you see, we have now gathered almost complete information about the knife, its usage, Brzica, but still lack _verification_ of the name. Its not enough having _one_ war party accusing the other side of war crimes, and writing books about it, you also need a third, neutral and unbiased party verifying those. Its a basic scientific principle. Hypothesis leading to third party verification. So it would be nice having someone verify that this glove knife was actually called srbosjek there in Jasenovac, and that it isnt a common croat or serb word made up earlier or later and used for any type of knife, so having "entire two people" claiming they reckognize it from somwhere, but not being able to back it up, is, like you said, not enough.

<dd>Perfect, I am glad all this information has been found, thank you for all of your help. Now the article can be saved. There is no basis for a deletion of an entire article due to a dispute over its name. Many articles have their names disputed, but it would be absurd to delete them entirely for that reason. Therefore, the article can only result in <b>keep</b>. So, it appears there is a dispute regarding the name of the knife, but not its usage. Its usage was clear: to cut Serbs. Therefore, if 'Srbosjek' is a disputed term, perhaps some names for the article might be 'Ustasa Knife', 'WWII Ustasa Knife', 'Knife-formerly-known-as-srbosjek", OR we can simply call it 'The WWII Knife used to Cut Serbs' (referring to its use), in which case, we might as well call it 'Serb-cutter', or better yet, stick with the original, 'Srbosjek'.

<dd>Given the gulf b/w what the sources say &amp; what was written, then deletion of the article seems warranted. Also scrutiny of any purported sources is required since the srbosjek has the hall marks of propaganda, and given the sources to date come from a opposing side in a war. I can't help but notice that most comments on here claim the Srbosjek as a reality by virtue of anecdotal or faith factors, but very few reliable sources have been provided. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 09:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"hall marks of propaganda"??? The only way you can claim that the srbosjek has ONE "hallmark" of propaganda is in its name. Which may or may not be true. We were not there when the Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies were killed at Jasenovac with the tool, so we cannot say if the term was coined AT THE TIME it was used, or later. Other than that, you have no argument.

<dd>You mean Serbs, Jews, Gypsies &amp; <i>Croats</i> who were killed at Jasenovac. There is no evidence of a specific knife designed for killing concentration camp inmates. It's on the propaganda radar b/c it is as ridiculous as if someone was to claim that Srebrenica's Muslim victims were killed by a specially designed gun called something obscure. And you would not doubt be going, but it's a gun. Likewise with this alleged knife - some victims were killed by a bullet, others by a knife, other yet again by a mallet, then others were worked to death or were allowed to starved and others hanged. Incidently, questioning the notion of the Srbosjek doesn't diminish the suffereing or existence the victims in those camps. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 14:38, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: User:Marinko (also known as 'iruka') I will do my best to refrain from answering your replies, consider this a reply to everything you have just said and will in the future. You almost blamed me for trolling, yet it is you who is trolling. You blamed me for ignoring your arguments in my replies, which I didn't, when it is you who ignores my arguments in your replies (again and again), and goes off on a tangent to argue something very irrelevant to this talk page. And it seems one of your MAIN arguments is that MYTHS WERE CREATED, THEREFORE THIS MUST BE A MYTH AS WELL... Great argument, my friend! Wait no.. not really, you're sounding a lot like Descartes (when he determined the only truth is he thinks therefore he exists). Also, something so simple, where you mentioned that during WWII Yugoslavia fought Croatia, I agreed with you 100%, but since I mentioned that Croatia was at the time a Nazi puppet state, this was obviously not to your liking, so you decided to add that Yugoslavia fought against Croatia at other times, when Croatia was not a Nazi state (which is arguable), when you had ALREADY MADE THAT CLAIM, and I did not argue it there! This shows a personal bias, and that your arguments should be read very cautiously by other users. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStop_The_Lies_e29a.html" title="User:Stop The Lies">Stop The Lies</a> 21:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)Stop_The_Lies</dd>
