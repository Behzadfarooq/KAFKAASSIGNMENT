<p>I have tried using Prod, but it was deleted. My contention is that this particular calendar is just one man's opinion and is not notable. The idea that there are faults with the Hebrew calendar is certainly notable, and is or should be discussed in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_calendar.html" title="Hebrew calendar">Hebrew calendar</a>. The <i>different</i> proposal to improve the calendar, made decades ago by Dr. Feldman, may be notable, but that has no bearing on whether this proposal is notable.--<a href="../../../r/6/1/User%7ER613vlu_fd45.html" title="User:R613vlu">R613vlu</a> 12:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Sorry about deleting Prod, the mistake of an inexperienced Wikipedia editor. If Feldman's proposal "may be notable" (keeping in mind that he published it on a single page out of 239 in 1931 with hardly any arithmetic to back up his proposal), then why wouldn't a demonstrably superior reform that is comprehensively documented not be at least as "notable"? The Wikipedia Hebrew calendar entry is long enough, and most people who go there would not be interested in any reform proposal, nevertheless links from there to reform proposals would be appropriate. Kalendis 00:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: non-<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 14:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: On non-verifiable: A calendar reform surely should be regard as in a special category with regard to verifiability, as it is essentially a calculation algorithm for determining the labelling of chronological dates. The arithmetic of the Rectified Hebrew calendar is fully documented in the public domain, so anybody can use the published formulae to verify its performance against their preferred trusted source of astronomical moments. -- Kalendis 00:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is the second&#160;!vote by Kalendis --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: On non-notable: the traditional Hebrew calendar does have its problems and this reform proposal is probably the best I've seen. On non-verifiable or original research: the article has references to a detailed website with further references. The proposal has been discussed repeatedly in a specialized forum. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 20:30, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Verifiability: which <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> has this information been published in? --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As many others I consider the interpretation of the Wikipolicy that only printed matter can be reliable, ludicrous in the Internet age. And in this case, mathematics and algorithms are ALWAYS verifiable and don't need a prophet to proclaim their veracity. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 13:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, this is a discussion, <b>not</b> a vote.
<dl>
<dd>Interesting. Why then does everybody in this and other deletion sections say "keep" or "delete"? (yes I now the end result is not just a tally of the "keeps" or "deletes"). And if this is a discussion then why is my expressed opinion irrelevant? - TP
<dl>
<dd>Keep or delete (or merge or whatever) is a recommendation for what should happen to the article, not a vote. Please read <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>; Your personal opinion on whether a proposal is any good or not is irrelevant because Wikipedia is based on verifiability, not editor's personal opinions. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Secondly, please re-read the non-negotiable policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>: it doesn't matter if something is true. If it isn't verified, it has no place on Wikipedia.
<dl>
<dd>So even a mathematical derivation is considered "not verified"? What weird universe does this come from??? - TP
<dl>
<dd>The Wikipedia universe. A question for you: is Andrew Wiles's proof of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_f4b0.html" title="Fermat's Last Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> is correct or not? Your argument would appear to be saying "it's a mathematical derivation, therefore it's automatically verified". I also ask you to consider <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/d/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems.html" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorems">Gödel's incompleteness theorems</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> guideline, while not a policy, is still something which has broad consensus amongst Wikipedia editors; it is possible that the closing administrator will discount any arguments which ignore it without good reason. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 13:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Apparently original research, no reliable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> So in summary, the only evidence that Kalendis can bring is a personal web site created by Dr. Irv Bromberg (named as the originator in earler versions of the article), who by coincidence also uses the name Kalendis,<a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/kalendis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/kalendis.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and Remy Landau's courteous reply to a message from Irv Bromberg to view his site. When I said that Dr. Feldman's proposal may be notable, I meant that I don't know whether it is or not. As it is in a published and well-regarded book, I think it is, but that has no bearing on the notability of this different proposal.--<a href="../../../r/6/1/User%7ER613vlu_fd45.html" title="User:R613vlu">R613vlu</a> 23:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia only publishes articles on topics that are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. Articles have to be notable because Wikipedia is an encyclopedia whose job is to summarize ideas that have already been published and accepted elsewhere, not to publish new ideas that have never been publicly tested. Notability means, at a minimum, that they have been published in multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> subject to peer review, so a Wikipedia editor doesn't have to personally vouch for a statement or the credentials of a person endorsing it. This simply hasn't been done here. It doesn't matter whether proponents can convince me (or anyone else here) that the proposal has mathematical or religious merit. What has to happen is it has to be shown that these ideas have already been disseminated elsewhere and received substantial outside comment. Without this, an article on the subject doesn't belong here. Best, --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 05:49, 18 February 2007 (UTC) <b>Comment</b> It's worth noting that the Hebrew calendar has religious as well as mathematical implications. The claim that such a proposal can be considered solely as a piece of mathematics strikes me as evidence of a lack of familiarity with the subject-matter's context. This tends to give me additional doubt that it actually ever has received serious external consideration or comment. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 06:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe that I could come up with a simpler proposal that is at least as accurate given the uncertainty in predicting the length of the day.
