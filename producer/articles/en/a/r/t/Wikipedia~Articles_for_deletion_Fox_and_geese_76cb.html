<p>Article about a non-notable variant of Solitaire (the non-american usage of the term). Appears to be part of the Zillions of Games advertising spam. The creator claims not to be Karl Scherer, though the editing style is similar for this, and other, article(s).</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a Solitaire variant, the game is played since at least middle ages, see here for more info <a href="http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Tafl.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Tafl.htm" rel="nofollow">The Online Guide to Traditional Games</a>. It was not me who initially created this article, however I significantly expanded it. I added a link to <a href="../../../z/i/l/Zillions_of_Games_5a41.html" title="Zillions of Games">Zillions of Games</a> and made a screenshot from Zillions.

<p>It uses a half-empty solitaire board with pegs, thus a solitaire variant. The creator of the page added minimal content, and appears to be from an IP that looks like one of the open proxys that Wikipedia had some trouble with a while ago, so you are effectively the creator, even if you are not the editor from the IPs. <b>You</b> yourself claim <i>This article was written by me [i.e. Andreas Kaufmann], not Karl Scherer</i> in the article's edit history. Karl Scherer's trademark editing style is to create an article on a puzzle, or "type of puzzle" (as per-Karl-Scherer), and add "links to zillions of games". This is remarkably similar to your edits here. Your edits elsewhere also bear a similarity. While you may be innocent of sockpuppetry, you may also not be - a developer <i>should</i> be able to check it out to confirm either way, but they don't seem to keen on doing this lately. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 22:21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you are right the game uses the same board and the same pieces as Solitaire. Still the play is quite different, so that I wouldn't call the game a "Solitaire" variant. Yes, 90% of article is written by me, so I could call myself the author of it. Certainly, it is impossible for me to prove that me is me (I am using my real name here in Wikipedia) and that I am not a Karl Scherer. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas_Kaufmann_2b14.html" title="User:Andreas Kaufmann">Andreas Kaufmann</a> 3 July 2005 22:32 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>You are again reminded not to make personal attacks</b></i>.

<li>Question is, are the rules, playing pieces or the board most significant?
