<p>So, you're saying I mayn't? This is the exact text I would put there:</p>
<p>* [[Image:divinities.jpg|thumb|right|Front Cover Illustration]] [[Image:divinitiesback.jpg|thumb|right|Back Cover Illustration]]</p>
<p>Luke Sawczak's only achievement so far is his book '''''Divinities''''', a semi-fantasy novel written at the age of 15. He describes it as falling into the "historical fiction, philosophy, and fantasy" categories.</p>
<p>It was published on http://www.lulu.com on November 18th, 2006. Its two editions were published simultaneously. Its content was rated "Everyone" by the author using Lulu.com's standards and the description he gave for it is as follows:</p>
<p>"A plague primarily affecting women has cut down the population. Being that there are less than one hundred in the ravaged, plebeian, Latin country called Aedificia, they are worshipped as gods. Euchris Harandr, a confused, cold and insightful man, is led through his life by various underground people working to balance the genders, and he battles his own conscience and upbringing to try and discover what is right, as well as his religious struggle; concluding with the obliteration of Aedificia and the the starting anew of civilization, perhaps to failure, perhaps to a new life."</p>
<p>As of [[November 20]], [[2006]], the http://www.lulu.com/content/526783 Hardcover Edition] costs $25.14 USD and the [http://www.lulu.com/content/527578 Paperback Edition] costs $15.66 USD, though both editions can be downloaded for $8.00 USD each (as a [[PDF]] document).</p>
<p>I'll take your next answer as the final one on whether or not I may use any aspect, shape or form of Wikipedia to redirect my customers and give them the information about my book. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lsawczak (<a href="../../../l/s/a/User_talk%7ELsawczak_a9d1.html" title="User talk:Lsawczak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lsawczak_7803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lsawczak">contribs</a>).</small></p>

You're answering evasively, but I'll comply. One last clarification is that I did not intend the page to persuade anyone to buy the book, but rather that the only people to see the page would be people that already knew about the book from me in person and were looking for a method of buying it. Thanks for your focussed attention. I'll withdraw now. Delete the article as soon as you like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lsawczak (<a href="../../../l/s/a/User_talk%7ELsawczak_a9d1.html" title="User talk:Lsawczak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lsawczak_7803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lsawczak">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm being far from evasive. I don't think I can be any clearer. Wikipedia is not a place for you to advertise yourself and/or your products. It isn't for your personal commercial use.

<p>"I'm being far from evasive. I don't think I can be any clearer." - Well, you could have directly answered my directly-asked question* instead of restating your previous generalization...</p>

<p>Do you see what I mean?... you didn't link your answer with my question. Tis like someone saying, "Is President A going to remain in office?" and getting the reply, "I heard that President B has some policies on cats." If there was a connection, "The thing which people hate most about President A is his policies on cats," then the other person's reply would have been an answer to the first person's question... ...but no matter.</p>

<li><b>Delete,</b> because it is not sufficiently notable and really for no other reason. Self-publishing is irrelevant--who cares who published it if it's notable enough.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>, userfy to transwiki individual idioms on request. This essentially boils down to a quorum over whether "Not a dictionary" is applicable to this list, with a strong majority in favor of removing it from Wikipedia, either to delete or to transwiki (supposedly most of the content is already there, which I didn't check). There is also a preponderance by "keep" commenters to opine based on the usefulness, which is not a strong argument as the information will still be available. We don't have a monopoly on free content. Lastly, there is also the simple problem of sourcing, which has in all the debate not been addressed. There is of course no prejudice against creating articles for individual idioms, as long as they contain encyclopedic content. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sigh. This page (and the other 25) were created to split up an article which had become over-long, using the same technique as in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases">List of Latin phrases</a>. The original article was created as part of a popular and well-contributed to effort to document the differences between different varieties of English, and is of great use for those people trying to understand cross-cultural issues, as well as trying to understand unfamilar idioms. It is part of a group of articles, including <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_American_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_Kingdom_9354.html" title="List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom">List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_e65a.html" title="List of words having different meanings in British and American English">List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States_481c.html" title="List of British words not widely used in the United States">List of British words not widely used in the United States</a>, which as a whole have survived numerous AfDs. There is a move to relocate the content to Wiktionary, but the proposers of such a move have not demonstrated the practicality of this, especially as cross-Wiki authentication is still not implemented, and lack of IDs on Wiktionary would tend to put off contributors, as at least one has explicitly stated. Pending agreement on the mechanism for migration to Wiktionary, consensus could then probably be built for such a move. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 10:31, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh and by the way, it would have been better to put the AfD nomination on the main <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_idioms_in_the_English_language_ef3b.html" title="List of idioms in the English language">List of idioms in the English language</a> and List of idioms in the English language (full), rather than one of the transcluded sub-pages, where it is far less prominent.

<li>Putting it on the 'front page' would have been more visible, in my opinion.

<li>That editors are unwilling to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_one%27s_finger_out" class="extiw" title="wikt:pull_one's_finger_out">pull their fingers out</a> and edit Wiktionary, which is as easily editable as Wikipedia is, is not a reason for overriding our <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy. As for "pending agreement on the mechanism for migration": We've had a transwikification process for several years, now. I suggest learning about it. It's also unnecessary in this case, as Wiktionary already has categories and appendices that are <i>better</i> than this misplaced dictionary of idioms in the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe it is a case of simply 'trying harder'. For better or worse, Wikipedia is far better known than Wiktionary, and contributors are apparently more motivated to contribute to the former rather than the latter. I have learned about transwikification, and I have 'tried harder', and have an account on Wiktionary. Do not presume my knowledge. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">User:Rossami</a> is even proposing it for some other articles, but has yet to demonstrate it. Just because <b>you</b> think something is easy or obvious does not make it so for others. It might also have been better to propose a Copy to Wiktionary rather than outright deletion - note that Wiktionary does not give country/region of usage for the idioms that it records - which is actually useful information, and of cource citations need to be improved from the current non-existent state of most, if not all entries. All in all, I think the Deletion process is an overly blunt weapon for improving this article. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 14:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>This stuff is already at Wiktionary, hence {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopy_to_Wiktionary_891b.html" title="Template:Copy to Wiktionary">Copy to Wiktionary</a>}} is unrequired. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 04:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Really? Have you checked every entry? And what about the 'where used' information, which, as far as I can see, is not in Wiktionary? Deleting information contibuted in good faith by many people will tend to put people off from contributing, which is not what I thought Wikipedia was about. My personal view is that information like this probably does belong in Wiktionary, but I have not voted Delete, or even Transwiki on the basis that I an not convinced that the current state of Wiktionary is fit for purpose. Uncle G would no doubt disagree, but I am sure that there is room in a debate for different opinions. Simply pointing people at individual Wiktionary entries, or a category does <b>not</b> provide a proper replacement for the function this article (and others like it) provide. To use the deletionist/inclusionist tags, I would probably be of an inclusionist bent, and I see little if any harm that this article is doing - especially as Wikipedia is not paper, and it could well do positive good. If the article is less comprehensive than Wiktionary, I can see good grounds for adding an introductory paragraph that points out that it is not comprehensive and that more comprehensive and/or accurate information can be found at Wiktionary - thereby encouraging people to look at and use Wiktionary. Simply deleting the article removes that signpost, will demotivate good faith contributors, and removes what would be a useful link between the -ipedia and the -tionary. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:49, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"<i>It might also have been better to propose a Copy to Wiktionary rather than outright deletion</i>" — No. I repeat: It is unnecessary in this case, as Wiktionary already has categories and appendices that are <i>better</i> than this misplaced dictionary of idioms in the encyclopaedia. Notice the fact, demonstrated below, that Wikipedia has got several entries <i>wrong</i>, for example. Wikipedia is simply <i>bad</i> at being a dictionary. There are many examples of mis-placed mini-dictionaries that Wikipedia has grown here and there, that Wiktionary has done far better at, often from a standing start. This mis-placed dictionary of idioms is one. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:53, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We obviously differ in our opinions of the relative merits of the Wikipedia articles and Wiktionary. I do not believe that Wiktionary presents information collected together in Wikipedia articles like this one in anywhere near as good/useful/accessible format - so <i>in my opinion</i>, until Wiktionary improves to equal or excel the Wikipedia articles, I will not support a 'Delete' or 'Transwiki'. As it happens, I agree with the underlying tenet - that such information <i>should</i> be in Wiktionary, but I do not think the Wiktionary presentation style is ready for it yet. In addition, I do not believe that Wiktionary and Wikipedia are sufficiently integrated for editors as yet. Automatic cross-Wiki logins should at least be implemented. Where that particular project has got to, I don't know. In your opinion, I'm probably blinded by the merits of Wikipedia; and in my opinion, I think you are blinded by the merits of Wiktionary. While neither of us is likely to convince the other of the correctness of our views, there is probably a reasonable middle way. I think that middle way would not include a summary 'Delete' of this article, but is more likely to be a 'Transwiki' <b>pending</b> improvement of Wiktionary's presentation style for such information - so it is not a vote for a Transwiki now. I really don't think it is <i>essential</i> to delete this article now. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 22:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there is a great deal of debate on a related policy item about the inclusion of Glossaries in Wikipedia - see here: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_79ff.html#Glossaries" title="Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Glossaries</a>. Rather than rehash that debate here, it is probably worth reading the quite voluminous debate there as well, as I think the arguments apply here. As I understand it (and I am open to being corrected here), no consensus was reached as to their inclusion or exclusion, so a glossary's inclusion needs to be argued according to its individual merits. A 'List of idioms' seems pretty close in structure to being a glossary, so I would conclude that it is <b>not</b> a matter of policy that they be excluded. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 00:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So are the yellow pages. That doesn't make it Wikipedia material. This could easily be put in Wikitionary so we could stay an encyclopedia and not a dictionary.

<li>Wiktionary is already right there, and already <i>more</i> useful, since it has all of this and <i>far more</i>. If non-native speakers of English want a dictionary of idioms, they should <i>use the dictionary that is right there</i>. Wiktionary, after all, aims to document all idioms <i>from</i> all languages <i>in</i> all languages.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> While I like this concept, it has several problems. 1) It is better suited for a dictionary, and Wiktionary's coverage is already more complete. 2) There is no real standard for the information at this point in time. The areas in which these are used are pretty questionable as far as accuracy, and I think a lot of them are just editors making judgment calls. This alone isn't a reason for deletion, but combined with the dictionary thing, I feel it's better to improve the already more complete location of this information at Wiktionary and let this one go. DISCLOSURE: I got an unbiased notification of this AfD on my talk page. GassyGuy 19:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b>. This list is useful as an encyclopedic article due to the depth with which it covers many of the particular idioms. I might choose to weaken my 'keep' proposal by advocating that the list be shortened to a select, group of idioms per letter about which multitudes can be written and they can be explained in great detail. E.g., "at sixes and sevens" is a very old idiom about which the history and cultural influence and relevance can be given, as well as information about its use in print. In contrast, supposed idioms like "at one's beck and call" are barely more than unique diction, not deserving of the title, 'idiom'. <a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIlluminatiscott_e45c.html" title="User:Illuminatiscott">Illuminatiscott</a> 22:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My intention was to politely request recent editors of the article to take a look at this debate, which had (in my opinion) been initiated but putting the AfD notice in a less-than-prominent position, given the article's structure. The messages were placed by hand (no bot) on people's talk pages in as neutral a manner as I could, choosing all the recent editors in the last two pages of history that did not edit via anonymous IP IDs. If this was wrong, I apologise. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 19:37, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is generally frowned upon and seldom results in any advantage for the person doing so. However, it is not as bad as votestacking and since you are being open about it your apology should be sufficient. The AfD will still be settled based on arguments by experienced non-anon editors and not votes. Often what you see is a whole stack of votes going in one direction and with very little text to explain why they voted that way. That is votestacking and will almost certainly result in the closing admin disregarding the votestacking sides arguments. In other words, it isn't worth the effort. Because the system is open to abuse it is something we are very aware of and sometimes that results in well-meaning people getting frowned upon. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 20:57, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: The following idioms (14 out of 35) are not currently present on wiktionary, thus a transwiki process should be preferred to mere deletion.

<li>Albatross around one's neck (but Wiktionary does cover albatross as burden, and I'm sceptical about the definition given here.)</li>

<li>Asleep at the wheel.</li>
<li>A stitch in time saves nine</li>

<li>Wiktionary has had <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/all_over_the_place" class="extiw" title="wikt:all_over_the_place">all over the place</a> since 2005. "A stitch in time saves nine" isn't an idiom. It's a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proverb.html" title="Proverb">proverb</a>. You can find a whole list of such proverbs in Wikiquote at <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/English_proverbs" class="extiw" title="q:English_proverbs">q:English proverbs</a>. You'll find "All roads lead to rome." which is also a proverb and not an idiom, there, too. This is yet more proof, as if any were needed after years of cumulative evidence, that Wiktionary and Wikiquote are better at being dictionaries of idioms and collections of quotations than Wikipedia is.

<dd>My experience of Wiktionary's handling of glossaries leads me to the opposite opinion to Uncle G - that is to say, I currently believe that Wiktionary is simply <i>bad</i> at handling glossaries. I am hopeful it may improve, however. Categorising wiktionary entries as idioms, then relying on the category for the presentation of the list of idioms simply doesn't work, prividing a list with no context to the entries. Individual articles give no indication of where particular idioms are used. Wiktionary is not yet ready to take over the functions of this and related articles. When it is, I would support a transwiki. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, it isn't even the same argument. That cautions against arguing in favor of (for example) a page about a band because you particularly like that band. People are not arguing to keep this page of idioms because they especially like particular idioms, but because the page itself is inherently informative and useful in a way it might not be elsewhere.

The Google News hits are mostly press releases, santa will be there, stores are opening, shoppers ignore construction, drop off food while at the mall, Lone Star steakhouse for the urban cowboy in you, etc, etc. Basically fluff from tiny local papers that get served up by an online service for a few bucks apiece.

<li><b>Keep</b> 1. Dubbo Presbyterian Church is not dufunct. In this case the "spilt" referes to dividing for the purposes of growth: "The church has split again, for the purpose of planting other congregations, rather than growing one large church." 2. While not mentioned in the article, Dubbo Presbyterian Church may have a claim of notability. It has been the source of an amount of contemporary worship music, not as well known as <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsong.html" title="Hillsong">Hillsong</a>, but still well known in <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_Christianity_4c13.html" title="Evangelical Christianity">Evangelical Christianity</a>, particularly in the Presbyterian Church and among <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Anglicans_dad0.html" title="Sydney Anglicans">Sydney Anglicans</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> <small><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlarneytherinosaur_0246.html" title="User talk:Blarneytherinosaur">talk</a></small> 09:42, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/suggestion</b> Given new evidence, I continue to remain convinced on the delete here-(source 2 and 3 only drop the church's name, source 4 doesn't mention it at all). However, perhaps a better idea would be to look into an article on the music organization (if it's received a bit more coverage, it could well pass <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>), and merge this one there? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 11:00, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply to comment/suggestion</b>. People would be more likely to recognise "Plainsong Music" or "Emu Music" than "Dubbo Presbyterian Church". I assume the fact that it all started with the Dubbo PC would be noted in the proposed article, so I would still like to be able to link here, but I'll leave that up to the community to decide. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlarneytherinosaur_d96a.html" title="User:Blarneytherinosaur">Blarneytherinosaur</a> <small><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlarneytherinosaur_0246.html" title="User talk:Blarneytherinosaur">talk</a></small> 11:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Churches are not the new schools - as dodgy as <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> might be, churches have no established criteria for deletion or keeping, and so AfDs on churches tend to be arbitrary and inhabited by those who believe no churches are notable. The problem with churches is that they tend not to attract mainstream media attention unless they do something very controversial - so a large church that attracts many people, unless it's a megachurch (and some of them haven't even survived) tends not to be established as notable, but should be, given the large amount of people that they attract - think about it, if other groups of people drew crowds of thousands every week (I'm not saying this church does, but hear me out), they would be notable in many cases - but not churches. Some of Sydney's biggest churches have been deleted, as well as Melbourne's second largest church - if they can't stay, what can? Please enlighten us - I would welcome your input. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 12:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"so AfDs on churches tend to be arbitrary and inhabited by those who believe no churches are notable" And your evidence for that slur is? There are hundreds of thousands of churches in the world. At least. So a church has a hard job proving notability, just as a website with many visitors would not automatically be considered notable. If you want a set of notability guidelines for churches, why not create a notability guidelines page? <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 12:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think if you look through the AfD debates on churches in the last six months you'll find that I'm right - I think people who don't attend them don't understand that the church is more important than just its building, and for the reasons above it's often hard to get independent sources in a way that a lot of other organisations don't. The debates are by their own nature arbitrary, since there are no guidelines. To answer your request, I am going to create a notability guidelines page because this has got out of hand - it's about time there were some criteria established, instead of "no churches are notable" which seems to be the norm. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 21:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Bryson Smith and the church are very well known in Sydney Christian circles, especially for Plainsong and Emu having started there and the church's involvement in its establishment. If the consensus is not to keep (which appears to be the fait d'accompli nowadays), I would beg that a merge as per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> be done; it's definitely something worth including in the local area article. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 12:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I will reserve judgement pending evidence of notability beyond the website mentioning the music. Have there ever been two or more independent newspaper articles about the church which discuss it in more than a passing way (like announcements of service times, or of wedding ceremonies there? That could sway my vote in favor of keeping. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:25, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if the CD is notable (and I'm not convinced that it is), it still doesn't necessarily transfer that notability to the Church. If more valid sources about the CD emerge, it could mean that the CD should get its own article in which the Dubbo Church's article's info can be merged to. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 21:34, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and merge into Calvary Church (Naperville, Illinois). This is not a non-descript church.

<li>Is there some policy which stipulates that 'mega churches' are <i>de facto</i> notable? If not, then the above is not an argument. If so, that is <i>also</i> problematic, because a round-tower church in Suffolk with a congregation of 10 (or none!) is surely more notable because of its architectural and historical uniqueness than a modern 'mega church' of which there are thousands. Moreover, the 'mega church' argument entrenches bias towards evangelical/pentecostals, as opposed to more traditional denominations which do not use 'mega churches' (like the CofE with its little, quaint, historical round-tower churches). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 16:43, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia has yet to decide for itself what even definitively constitutes a "megachurch", so no, there's no valid reason for anyone to automatically vote keep just because something calls itself one. Just because they have a huge building is meaningless: huge shopping malls get deleted as non-notable every week here. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:52, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see I need to clarify a bit. I haven't heard the "mega-church" argument before, so I don't know what you are referring to. Why shouldn't one of the largest churches in one of the largest cities in Illinois be notable?A church with ~5000 members<a href="http://www.communitychristian.org/dailyed/news_articles/dailyedNewsMegaChurch.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.communitychristian.org/dailyed/news_articles/dailyedNewsMegaChurch.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> dwarfs most schools which are considered notable almost by default. (Ironically, it appears the church runs a school, so it possible that Wikipedia would keep an article on the school, but not the church? Just a curious thought.) Also, I don't find the argument about bias towards evangelical/pentecostal all that relevant. If one denomination has churches that are on average larger than those of another denomonation, those individual churches are going to be inherently more influential and notable. Wikipedia is simply more likely to take note of something that is "bigger" no matter what the context. Can anyone point me to discussion of this "mega-church argument that's popping up everywhere"? I'm curious about what others may have said. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeli_nk_ed07.html" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> 20:17, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you look at AfDs for churches (there are a few ongoing) the argument that thousands of attendees=notable pops up all the time. A high school with ~5000 members would be notable, a church is not as there are a lot of churches that size. Size does not equal influence, indeed a suburban megachurch may have a lot less influence on its community than say a traditional parish church, as the megachurch could largely cater to those who attend. Ted Haggard's church, being politically influential, would be a notable megachurch, a similarly sized-church may not be. And where does this idea that schools are considered notable by default come from? Schools are nominated for deletion as often as churches. <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 15:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i>claims</i> to have 6000 members. Big difference. (My family church still "claims" me as a member even though I literally have not attended since I was eight or nine.

<dd>There are also churches, however, which go the other way around, with many attendees not being members.

<dd>Additionally, the source that Patstuart cites simply proves that the church exists.

<dd>The new source isn't much better than the one about the American South.

<p>Non-notable mall. I don't think there's criteria for a mall being notable, but nothing I can think of applying makes me think this article should stay here. I asked for an assertion of notability (in response to a plea to not delete the article, in fact) on the talk page, but nothing happened. I don't think the building is architecturally special, a trend-setter in any way, or anyhting else that makes is stick out among the zillions of other shopping centers in the US. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 05:01, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> (Disclosure: I live about six-eight miles from this mall, but I never go to it, because I'm not made of money. My keep&#160;!vote is based on personal knowledge, even though I don't actually like the mall in question.) Short Hills Mall is, as I see it, highly notable as far as malls go. It's a mall for (generally) rich people in one of the richest towns in the country. The square footage of the mall is <i>gigantic</i>, as is the sheer number of stores. I know people who have gone out of their way on trips to NYC so they could stop at the Short Hills Mall. This isn't the most convincing (or rational) argument ever, but that's where I stand. I did a tiny bit of poking around, and "The Mall at Short Hills" gets 14 Google News hits (most, such as <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=51022" class="external text" title="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=51022" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, on an experimental members' lounge American Express has just installed in the mall) and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Mall+At+Short+Hills%22&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Hi3&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=720&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Mall+At+Short+Hills%22&amp;num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Hi3&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=720&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">25,000</a> Google hits, including 658 uniques out of the first 1,000. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 06:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per verified claim of notability. P.S. we need a standard for which malls are notable. Clearly the neighborhood strip mall isn't. Clearly some malls are. I wish we could just cite a bright-line standard. Someone please delete the store list. I expect to see a "You are here" arrow.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't necessarily agree with deleting the store list (or, at least, not the entire list) for this nor any other mall. I think a store list helps to identify a mall; after all, a mall is just a bunch of stores. Perhaps narrowing down the list to only the most notable stores, or only stores with WP articles, would be a better idea. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It's actually not "clear" to me that some malls are notable. I'm not sure how a particular JC Pennys store is any more or less notable than any of hundreds of other JC Pennnys. The building itself? Maybe for its architecture or history. Otherwise, certainly not notable. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 22:55, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak keep and clean up</b> per Opabinia regalis. The claims to notability seem borderline but plausible. The references are good, albeit limited. I thought about trying to apply <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (which it would probably fail), but the article is really about the mall, not the company that owns the mall. I suspect that malls, in general, should probably be considered a form of landmark (landmarks are often privately owned), and while we don't have any specific guidelines for notability of landmarks that I've seen, I think the general notability guidelines about independent non-trivial <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> coverage may be sufficient, and by that measure, this may just barely squeeze by. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 02:55, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Stong Keep</b>. I thought the point of Wikipedia was to democratize the whole encyclopedia experience so articles exactly like one on (what very possibly may be a bland) New Jersey mall are available. The arguments for "delete" seem to reek of condescension, and this is the very reason why "everyday" people avoid encyclopedias....because they are not relevant to their everyday lives. Removing articles simply because SOME people deem their subjects "non-noteworthy" means fewer people will use, contribute and care about Wikipedia and also creates a slippery slope where noteworthiness is subject to the judgement of a select few. What's notable to some may not be notable to others. whoasuckaa 11:54, 24 November 2006 (EST)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are 32 malls in New Jersey with wikipedia pages. Why not delete all of them? We don't delete them because this is supposed to be an encyclopia of as much information as possible. The Mall at Short Hills attracts over a million shoppers year-round, so I am positive that people have gone on Wikipedia and looked up this mall to find out more about it. It truly does not make any sense to delete this article, other than one person's opinion that it is not note-worthy. prepper2 2:57, 25 November 2006 (EST)</li>

<p>As per the other game show nominations: A list of game show episodes isn't needed. Look at the detail of each episode: it just describes what the models wear, guest stars (which is only once in a while), and what the contestant won. Purely fancruft. If we had an article for each season of a long running game show such as Price is Right, Wikipedia would be flooded with useless information such as Bob Barker wore a brown suit and so on. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 05:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> — I have one of two suggestions here. Either:
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and edit it down to the basic information (e.g., who won what and a brief summation of the game). Agree that there is no need to write down such minute details as what the models wore (unless it particularly stands out); the summaries themselves are too long. In the season 1 guide, I had edited down the summaries because of this very problem, which is one of (I'm sure) several reasons why this article was afd.</li>
<li><b>Move</b> content (or rewrite it) to [<a href="http://tviv.org/" class="external text" title="http://tviv.org/" rel="nofollow">TVIV wiki</a>]. Again, the same standard would apply.</li>

<dd>I totally agree, Cipher. It's not as trivial as "what colour shirt" they're wearing. This show has a cult following and this information is drawn on and mentioned throughout the show's run. Things like "what box number contains which value" and "since when the 1p has been won" are subjects that have consistantly been brought up during the show. The fact that so many people have contributed to this article is surely evidence of how useful this page is. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Wikipedia IS a TV guide - witness all the pages for stuff like Doctor Who and Star Trek. Deal or No Deal is NOT your average "game-show", and that more than anything else seems the hub of this question - does it deserve the same respect as other TV shows on wikipedia? A small but vocal group of people seem to think it doesn't. Fans of the series are already storing this information to host it elsewhere on dedicated DonD sites. It looks like the fans have lost, but as far as I'm concerned it is wikipedia who are the losers as this IS important information for many, even just casual viewers and not hardcore fans. These are (were) the best presented stats and episode guides on the internet. I'm quite disappointed in this decision. 88.104.207.7 17:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was previously submitted for proposed deletion due to possible hoax content, but the proposed deletion was challenged and the most implausible material was removed. Nevertheless, even if everything in this article is true, it has insufficient <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> as the only source listed is the subject's journal, without even any indication that it has been published. Furthermore, the subject's only claim to notability is as a soldier killed in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a memorial</a> and there were hundreds of thousands of soldiers who died in the Civil War. I am also nominating Gabriel Abreu which has not gone through proposed deletion but has similar problems with sources and notability. I recommend that both be <b>deleted</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While the subject is a relatively obscure analysis of epistolary collaborations in history, the article itself has been referenced in several subsequent articles and was a covered topic at a recent Literary Arts Symposium.

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it troublesome that multiple users are expressing frustration about Elonka's nomination, insisting on the notability of the mall, and have yet to add any assertion of notability to the article. Rebecca, in particular, would do well to actually spend time <i>working on the article</i> and cease making <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">bad faith assumptions</a> and calling for sanctions against Elonka. As of this post, there aren't even any sourceless notability assertions, much less one with a reference attached to it. Thus, the article still should be speedy deleted per CSD A7. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 17:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not reverting all of Elonka's tags.

I also stand by calling for sanctions - I'm fed up with having to spend so much time defending articles like this from guerrilla deletion tactics (speedy, then prod, then AfD), when if anything, all they need is a bit of cleanup and expansion. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>It being Westfield's largest is not inherently notable. The strip mall down the street is the largest owned by its owner, and it is really small. It is up to the creaters of an article and those who wish to keep it to make a claim of notability and to support it with verifiable and reliable sources, not to all other editors. The article had one from the Economist which was a directory type paragraph listing which said it was there and had a lot of stores, as do many other shopping centers. The other citation told of digging a big hole in the ground, as is customary when building something. The newest cite says the owner has made a hunk of money. Still not that superlative or notable. Please do not threaten editors with sanctions if they nominate articles which could benefit from re-writing or added citations. We really need a guideline to separate the notable from the non-notable shopping mall. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I just ask, what sort of information would change your mind here? I mean, what (verifiable) sentence in the intro would make you think "yes, this mall/centre <i>is</i> notable"? I realise it is up to creators and keepers to verify and assert notability, but it's not easy when such attempts or references are dismissed out of hand (the references, by the way, were for the figures, not to back up superlative claims). I definitely agree we need a guideline on this. However, Westfield of course is not just "the guy down the road", you are surely aware of how many centres they own, so I think this is a fallacious dismissal of a sound claim to notability. This is like saying, "this is Australia's largest shopping centre, but Papua New Guinea's largest shopping centre is tiny, so Australia's largest is therefore not notable".--<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 23:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Well, if the mall is distinguished from all other malls in the country by its size, architecture, splendor of its stores, or unique features, that would probably do it for me. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> comes to mind:"the largest shopping mall in total area in the United States when it opened in 1992."See also<a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_Tower_Place_a24f.html" title="Water Tower Place">Water Tower Place</a> which is notable as a skyscraper mall which has had a profound influence for 30 years. The largest malls in the largest cities of a country might be notable. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_Mall_a9f6.html" title="Meridian Mall">Meridian Mall</a> in a suburb of Lansing Michigan, the state capital, stayed. Lansing Mall, the second largets, got deleted. I might have kept it. I would not have kept the 3rd, 4th, 5th etc in the Lansing area. Also the ritziest malls in the largest cities. Do people all over the country talk about visiting the mall if they are ever in the town? Do people take bus trips for a long distance just to visit the mall? Or is it just the place you go to buy a shirt at J.C Penney's? Saying it is "Westfield's largest mall" is like saying it is "Joe Doe's largest mall" because it assumes we think Westfield is inherently important. Identifying it as "the largest mall in Xville" begs the question of the significance of Xville, for people in other continents. Bondi may be notable, but the article read very similarly to innumerable writeups of utterly unmemorable malls. The intro still just says it is Westfield's largest, not the world's largest or the country's largest. Maybe it could be revised to highlight the notability of Bondi. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The discussion here seems to raise the inadequacy of what we all mean by notable. Different people think some things are notable (or not) and others think the reverse. For example I find High Schools and large Shopping Centres to be notable, while I think most railway stations and roads are completely unnotable, yet there there appears to be little objection to keeping these. I also find villages to be notable even though they are often smaller than Schools and Shopping Centres. Perhaps for now we should move to be more inclusionist in all these areas, so I favour <b>keep</b> here. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - it is the responsiblity of the editor to show verifiablilty, notability, etc. Tagging it for improvement and then waiting a reasonable time would be polite though.

<li><b>Delete</b>. First of all, this is not an article, it's just a statement that something <i>may</i> happen, and we have no idea what impact it will have. Secondly, if this were a real article, we'd run into notability; there's plenty of independent short animations featuring SMB. Just look at Newgrounds.com Mario parodies category to scratch the surface. In its current form, this article doesn't point to any kinds of <i>guarantees</i> on how phenomenally successful it will be. Sure, everyone loves a good SMB film; the question is, how is this thing different from others and why is it actually worth discussing <i>now</i>? This is like the game mods that we've had to delete because they hadn't been even released yet. If a major studio says they're going to make a film, that's notable because there's 99% chance it will be finished and the Consumers will take a note once it's out; this, however, has problems. Independent fanworks <i>need</i>, however, to demonstrate how much they rule, for example in form of press buzz. A studio which nets me whole 17 Google hits falls in the latter category in my opinion. In closing, by all means, we'd bid them welcome back once the film is out and they can somehow demonstrate the thing has become really really famous. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:08, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi. I will be changing the article so don't worry. And about fanmovie stuff? Well, the thingy is, that my "short" film is actually not a flash movie, rather a scratch built video editor edited film. Also note my 'intended' run time of longer than 45 minutes. But please, do not worry. I understand your reasons, which is why I'm changing the article by putting in development pictures and posters. I have the trailer written, I even have the blimmin' film written. I do understand that Wikipedia is not a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">journal</a>. But please, rest assured. I know you're very concerned about whether this is true or not. But you have the director/producer's word.

<li><b>Neutral</b> several comments here - most, if not all of the google links are to software directories. Most popular open source projects usually feature mailing list or forum chatter on the first few Google results pages. While not a valid test per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, a lack of these sort of results usually indicates a non-notable open source project. Secondly, as per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, inclusion in the distributions mentioned does not immediately infer notablity. In particular, Debian Unstable, Fedora Extras and BSD Ports are additional sets of packages that are distributed seperately from their respective core distributions. Most code that successfully compiles and is properly licensed passes the inclusion test for these extra distributions. I also dispute the un-sourced claim that the software is as popular as Celestia. Regardless, I remain neutral as <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> is not policy, and any notability inferred by the inclusion of the package in the distributions is subject to interpetation. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 05:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>And most Google links for Windows probably point to unreliable Microsoft press releases, spammy web stores, and random blog posts where people discuss in excruciating detail how much Windows sucks. =) Secondly, Debian Unstable is <i>not</i> an "additional" repository of packages; it's simply the work-in-progress version of the next stable release of the operating system. Debian does <i>not</i> categorise software apart of saying this particular piece of software is "optional" (i.e., "this piece of software is not critical to the operation of your system, and, unless you want to look at stars and stuff, you may remove this thing safely"); "optional" label goes to a <i>huge</i> bunch of software. In the current <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" class="external text" title="http://popcon.debian.org/by_inst" rel="nofollow">Debian Popularity Contest (ranked by installs)</a>, which is specifically listed on <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> as one way of gauging the popularity of open-source software, Stellarium is ranked #4522 out of 61036 packages, which is a <i>very</i> respectable rating. (Hint: mediawiki1.7 is currently ranked #7720, and surprise surprise, is "optional" as well...) I also wager that the "extras" packages in other Linux/BSD distributions cover a whole lot of stuff that <i>is</i> nevertheless very widely-used; Linux distributions are package-based and people tend to just install applications they <i>need,</i> even if it means admitting "oh poop, I need to point my installer to this extra package repository too, just to get the one I need". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I spent some time trying to discern consensus on this one. Because of the number of keep comments that came from potentially single-purpose accounts with a vested interest in the project, the number of keep comments is not a good indication by itself. Next I looked at the notability requirements specified in <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. The only claim being made for notability here is inclusion in the <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debian.html" title="Debian">Debian</a> software distribution, but even there, the claim was weakened by the apparently poor adoption. There are also the issues that this is a port of the <a href="../../../d/c/%2B/DC%2B%2B_e7f6.html" title="DC++">DC++</a> software and that there is no current release. When taken as a whole, the arguments in favor of keep don't meet the requirements of notability. The other option was to <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../d/c/%2B/DC%2B%2B_e7f6.html" title="DC++">DC++</a>, but per the sparse nature of the article and the lack of a release version, there isn't much to add that isn't already mentioned in the DC++ article. If more needs to be said, please expand the discussion of this version in the DC++ article. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 08:11, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Which is why <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (or at least that section of it) is not a viable measure of notability. You can't say <i>"It's notable if it's in Debian (but not if it's in Debian)"</i> and expect people to use that as a suitable guideline. Also, in case anyone hasn't looked at it, WP:SOFTWARE is currently marked as a "draft" so I don't think using it as a basis for deletion is sound yet. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheParanoidOne_a135.html" title="User:TheParanoidOne">TheParanoidOne</a> 06:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Most criticisms of WP:SOFTWARE that I've seen involve it being too inclusive (especially the free-software clause). Yet you seem to be using its still-tentative status as a justification for being even <i>more</i> inclusive. In the absence of more specific guidelines, the general guideline that prevails in AfDs is non-trivial coverage by multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. If you're going to ignore <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (which, while somewhat controversial in parts, is usually well-received in AfD discussions), you should be providing more standard evidence of notability, not just saying, effectively, "keep 'cause I think it should be kept".</li>

Also, the porting article say "The term is not usually applied to the process of adapting software [...] [rewritten] to a different language (i.e., language conversion or translation)". LinuxDC++'s GUI is written with Gtk+, which is C, while the DC++ code (that LinuxDC++ uses) is C++. <a href="../../../u/l/l/User%7EUllner_506e.html" title="User:Ullner">Ullner</a> 12:24, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think merging is not a very good idea because LinuxDC++ has a separate user base, very different code and most importantly different developers, releases and aims (it's not an exact replicate of the Windows version, and never will be).

<p>I believe that this cool-sounding breed of dog is in fact an elaborate, well-orchestrated <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">hoax</a>. It is not recognised by any kennel club, and there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for the claims made in the article. The language in which 'Tamaskan' is supposed to mean 'mighty wolf' is unknown; it is not <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish_language.html" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a>. The 'Tamaskan Dog Register' and the 'Tamaskan Dog Society of Great Britain', from which much of the content is lifted, are slapdash websites which could have been made by anyone. The creator and principal contributor to this article, Blufawn, is apparently the breeder of these dogs, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Blufawn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Blufawn" rel="nofollow">their contributions</a> consist of this article, links to this article and pictures of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_deerhound.html" title="Scottish deerhound">Scottish deerhounds</a>.

<li>First let me say that this breed of dog is not a hoax by any means. Sure it is not recognised by any Kennel Club at the moment but then neither are other breeds such as the Utonagan and Northern Inuit, Labradoogles etc but this does not mean that they are not a breed in themselves. The name was taken from the North American Indian language meaning mighty wolf and no it is not a Finnish word but then neither is the word Utonagan English but taken from a North American Indian saying, yet they are classing themselves as a British breed! Considering the comments about the Tamaskan Dog Register's website being 'slapdash'. I would like to point out here that they are indeed receiving emails almost on a daily basis congratulating them on their professional looking website and beautiful dogs and interest is pouring in from all corners of the globe hence they have this year alone sent Tamaskan out to USA, Holland, Great Britain, Sweden and of course Finland. There have been 3 litters of Tamaskan born this year in Great Britain alone along with others elsewhere. Just because these breeders dont have websites dosnt mean that they dont exist. There are breeders in USA that also dont have websites. You will find that the vast majority of good breeders do not have websites, not everyone even owns a computer! I suggest that people who are not involved with the Tamaskan breed let them carry on with the good work that they are doing and do not make comments about other breeds of which they obviously have no knowledge. I would like to point out here to all the Utonagan people who seem hell bent for some reason or other on trying to interfere with the Tamaskan that the name Utonagan was bought in as a means from escaping the name Northern Inuit!!! so who are they to judge!!! I also have it on good authority that they are using other breeds to widen their gene pool so just what is their problem, talk about the pot calling the kettle black!!! As I see it and probably I speak for many others who read these notes that these people are obviously so jealous of others and have nothing better to do with their time than critise and malign anything that is not to their liking and before anyone else jumps to any conclusions I am not from the Tamaskan Register but visiting from UK in order to see these dogs for myself first hand and from what I see I am definately going to book one of these lovely puppies. I have also seen all the awful comments made by the Northern Inuit and Utonagan people in GB on their forums and to be frank I dont now believe a word of them it all shouts very much JEALOUSY. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.223.126.199 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.223.126.199_6f66.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.223.126.199">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - if you're not from the Tamaskan register, how can you know they get emails on a daily basis? And which Native American language is Tamaskan from?

<li><b>Comment</b> The description of Tamaskan in the article: <i>The Tamaskan is a mix of different types of Arctic breeds, including Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky, but it also contains a very small amount of German Shepherd</i>. In other words, <b>it's a <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed-breed_dog.html" title="Mixed-breed dog">mutt</a></b>, right? Isn't this basically just a naming contrivance used to give some mutts a high-falutin' "purebred" sounding moniker so they can be sold for higher prices? <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 12:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Seriously though, all three domain names referenced in the article (tamaskan-dog.com, tamaskan-dog.co.uk, blustag-arcticbreeds.com) are registered to either "Lynn Sharkey" or "Jenny Sharkey", so these sites all seem to be run by the same individual or family.

<li><b>Delete</b> - if the previous unsigned comment is accurate, then this would seem to be a very new and certainly, according to everyone else, unrecognized breed, whose only proponents seem to possibly be the breeders themselves. While I do not believe that the article would necessarily qualify as Spam on that basis, I do think that, as of yet, the breed is not yet noted enough to qualify as notable according to wikipedia guidelines. Once a kennel club or other outside organization recognizes them, or they even have an article about them in <i>Dog Fancy</i> or some similar magazine that they can point to, that would change, but, as of yet, there really isn't what I consider compelling evidence available to me to convince me that this breed is both verifiable and notable <i>yet</i>. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:37, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I am a graduate student with access to a tremendous number of online databases. I just performed a quick search on the word 'Tamaskan' in the likes of Academic Search Premier, BooksinPrint.com Professional, Dissertations and theses (Proquest), Electronic Collections Online, Encyclopedia Britannica, etc. and did not get a single hit. Of course, there's always the possibility I am doing something wrong. If the folks who would like to retain this article would contact me and inform me of how to find credible, published scholarly writings referencing the Tamaskan Dog, I'll gladly look again. Please be kind; I'm trying to help and seek compromise with quality. Another idea I've had is to include mention of the Tamaskan Dog as a feature in the mixed breed article. Perhaps that has already been discussed, and if so, please accept my apologies as I get up to speed on all things Wiki ... <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 16:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I said that I was here from UK to visit one of the breeders of these dogs and to see them for myself. I thought that it would be obvious to anyone that the breeder would be showing me lots of photographs and filling me in with all the details especially as I am well aware of all the bitching going on from the Northern Inuit and Utonagan people in UK which do nothing more than to show them up for the type of people that they are and I for one would never have bought a puppy from that kind of person. Also I have seen the many testimonials from people perfectly satisfied with their Tamaskan and copies of some of the nice emails that the Tamaskan Register have received from people enquiring about the breed. It was only when I was shown the article on this wikipedia site that we saw the comments above and I felt that I must write something in defense of this lovely breed of dog. I stick by my comments that only people with an axe to grind and suffering from pure jealosy would be bothered to find fault and ask for this article to be deleted. Deleted or not the Tamaskan is here to stay and will only increase in numbers as time goes by. What is it you are all frightend of? Is it the fact that they look more wolflike in appearance than the NI and Utonagan. Judging by the mails I have been shown and the comments I have heard myself they certainly look a whole lot better than either of the aforementioned breeds. Or is it because someone else is doing a good job of promoting their breed and getting on with their life. I have had a lovely stay here and am looking forward to receiving my puppy who will living a great life alongside my Dogue de Bordeaux who incidently started out life as a crossbreed of Bulldog and Bull Mastiff!! as didnt most breeds of today. Start out as a cross between something or other. Angela Broadbent UK.</li>

<li>Angela, I completely understand and would undoubtedly join your love of this breed if I had one of my own. We're writing an encyclopedia entry here, though, and need to have scholarly resources to back up our words. Personal experience is great, but it just doesn't cut it in academic writing unless you are a known authority with published works of your own. I don't think anyone is afraid of anything other than the claim that Wikipedia is not a good source of information, i.e. not a real encycopedia, unless we cite references for our information. Please help me find authoritative documentation on this breed, or please be patient until such documentation comes forth. Please also seriously consider opening an account on Wikipedia and signing your posts with that.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> - According to wikipedia the definition of a hoax is 'A hoax is an attempt to trick an audience into believing that something false is real.' Tamaskans are obviously real, there is more than one picture of a Tamaskan dog on the websites, there is more than one breeder and more than one litter advertised from more than one kennel and in more than one country. They have a dog showing club in judgedogs.com with more than one Tamaskan entered owned by morehttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Tamaskan_Dog&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1 than one person. They also have more than one website and more than one breeders website, yes both of which have the same webmaster, but does that mean that the breed does not exist??? Therefore if this breed is a hoax it's an extremely elaborate one to try and trick wikipedia readers into believing there is a breed of dog which does not exist.Blufawn</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Hoax may have been a bad choice of words on someone's part. I do not feel the breed is a hoax and I do not feel that these dogs do not exist. Obviously, they do. As a potential contributing writer, however, I feel we need credible, scholarly resources if the article is going to remain a part of the Wiki encyclopedia. We're looking for something more than a website by a breed fancier, photos from proud Tamaskan companions, and descriptions of personal experience. If we cannot find the credible material now, then when it does become available in the future, even if the current article is deleted, the breed will then be granted the space, with citations, that it deserves. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 17:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The price figures I've seen bandied about are $1300 - $1500 each, which sounds a bit steep to me for a dog of such uncertain provenance. I think it's about time to put this puppy to sleep (some might prefer a demise similar to <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowball_%28The_Simpsons%29_b59f.html" title="Snowball (The Simpsons)">Snowball II</a>), and while we're at it, euthanize the rest of his <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppy</a> litter, too.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thank you Keesiewonder for explaining to me why this article should be put forward for deleting, I understand your point of view although I don't agree with it. But at least you explained it nicely unlike some who I don't think grasp the idea still. The deletion of this article is not to do with what language Tamaskan is in, or if you disagree with cross breeds or designer dogs or if you wish to argue which breeds were used in the making of this new breed. Or even if you like the website or think its unproffessional. Nor is this article spam&#160;: - An article considered advertisement to include those that are solicitations for a business, product or service. May I point out the Tamaskan Dog Register is not a business and they do not sell the puppies and The Tamaskan Dog Society of Great Britain do not give a product or service...yes I agree breeders do make a profit and you may wish to think about deleting the breeders advertisements on all dog breed pages.</li>
</ul>

<dd>We do actually have an article coming out in the next few months in a high profile dog magazine and so I agree you may delete the article if you so wish and I may replace it once the magazine has been published. Blufawn
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that's basically how Wikipedia works: If you can't really demonstrate this thing is really all that notable <i>now,</i> you won't get an article; However, once the thing <i>does</i> get really notable, no one has a problem with having the article around. Basically, that's all the deletion is about. The nominator also raises the point that there's <i>possibility</i> of this article is part of an elaborate scheme to <i>make</i> the subject more notable (in other words, covert marketing); Wikipedia is not the place to promote an idea, a product, or an animal breed for that matter. While I agree it's not <i>outright</i> spam, having an article about an animal breed that's only mentioned in a few places <i>does</i> raise slight concerns about the reason why the article is here.<br />
If you allow me to do some funny analogies: This is kind of like an unreleased <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Mod (computer gaming)">game mod</a>. A "fan work" that's, while condoned, is not officially recognised by the company that makes the game. Fan-made works are generally on shaky ground in Wikipedia; one must prove they're really famous. Many articles about unreleased game mods have been deleted because they're about an unreleased mod with little press mentions or anything like. But once they get a magazine's attention, that's all nice and keepable. However, in case of dog breeds, you probably need more than just a single magazine article to sway the opinion. And all I'm saying is, simply, that patience is a virtue. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks wwwwolf. I understand that Tamaskan need more media attention but I did originally feel as if I was subjected to personal attacks rather than just people telling me about the wikipedia rules which I had to look up for myself. They say we need official reports, letters, eyewitness accounts, autobiographies or statistics compiled by authoritative agencies.. very soon we are likely to have nearly all of these we do now have two official letter and statistics compiled by the BVA. It also says companies and organizations <b>may</b> be used as sources and I think The Tamaskan Dog Register counts as an organization as does The Tamaskan Society of Great Britain. I just didn't like being attacked personally by other Wikipedia members suggesting I had created the article purely for my own profit as a breeder of these dogs, when at the time I wrote the article in Febuary I only owned one male and was not a breeder, and even though now I own a female I am not planning a litter until 2008 as my female is too young so this article is certaintly not spam helping me 'make money off breeding mutts under a high-falutin name.' and I beleive that sort of insultive critisism does not belong on a talk page about reliable sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with User:Blufawn that some people might have been a bit quick to accusation here, me among them. If I was, I apologize. Having said that, I think that one thing that might reduce the possibility of further such attacks in the future is if you create a userpage for yourself. Most users do that fairly quickly after signing up, and it is a major cause of suspicion when editors see that the link in the signature is red. Most such contributors are newcomers and/or single purpose accounts, that purpose generally being a not particular highly valued one (spam, advertising, attacks, and other things outside of wikipedia guidelines). Also, if the article is deleted, as it might be, I hope you realize that that deletion does not necessarily mean that the article cannot be recreated. I am aware of similar pages for reality show contestants that were created before the show was made, deleted, and then recreated later after the show aired, so it has been done before. You might also want to get in contact with either <a href="../../../d/o/g/WP%7EDOGS_420a.html" title="WP:DOGS">WikiProject Dogs</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Dog_breeds_df79.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Dog breeds">Wikipedia:WikiProject Dog breeds</a>, as they would be the two groups most likely to be able to help you improve the quality of the article when we have what wikipedia considers sufficient evidence of notability as per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">the existing notability guidelines</a> for dogs. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, Blufawn, I have to agree with Badbilltucker and emphasize that a user page of your own plus collaboration with the Wiki Projects mentioned will help tremendously.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Okay then, that information needs to be sourced and added to the article. This will strengthen a case for keeping. However, forthcoming releases and tours, unless they're officially confirmed and verifiable by a press release or similar, can't really be counted towards notability (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> - editors should write about things that are notable already, not things that <i>might</i> be notable next year). You say they haven't even sent demos out to the record labels yet - how can they be sure they will get signed and this album and tour will go ahead? As I say, their notability is open to debate, which is why I took this to AfD instead of an outright <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">CSD-A7</a> deletion, and if some other claims to notability besides those already written about are unearthed as a result, so much the better. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 17:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After all this time, there is apparently still confusion over the relationship between Christopher Michael Langan and the Mega Society. Langan is an early member of the Mega Society but he no longer participates. A few years ago he quarreled with other members of Mega and tried to take the society's name and the name of its journal and operate his own version of the society; he was eventually stopped by a court order and an adverse ICANN ruling on Mega Society domain names.

<li><b>Keep</b> Here are some reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. The deletion decision was procedurally flawed. As a result the reviewing admin encouraged a rewrite of the article. See Talk:Mega Society.</dd>
<dd>2. The argument for deletion mentions Langan but not <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_vos_Savant_bc35.html" title="Marilyn vos Savant">Marilyn vos Savant</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_W._Golomb_5101.html" title="Solomon W. Golomb">Solomon W. Golomb</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Sununu_1e6d.html" title="John H. Sununu">John H. Sununu</a>. The implication is that the society supports Langan, whereas the fact is that the society sued Langan. See <a href="http://www.megasociety.org/judgment.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.megasociety.org/judgment.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.</dd>
<dd>3. The society has been listed in the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_9c82.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a> as the most elite ultra high IQ society. This alone makes it notable.</dd>
<dd>4. If the nature of a society limits its size, then size alone is not a criterion for deletion. See <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a> with 26 members.</dd>
<dd>5. Obviously this society rubs some people the wrong way, which is affecting their judgement. For example, the statement that "most of the article is about the reliability of IQ tests" is patently false. The statement that "super-geniuses" should be able to "think of a better name" is pejorative. That a subject is offensive is not a good criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 14:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not The Guiness Book of World Records. What sets this record apart from the others given the limited media attention given to this group?</dd>
<dd>The comparison with Order of the Garter is flawed. That group is included because it's age makes it a notable group. The Mega Society does not fulfill that criterion.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, not good enough. Do you intend to make the original article available for review so we can judge ourselves rather than rely on other people's memory of what they read months ago? No matter what the closing admin noted reposting after an unsuccesful attempt at rescuing it at deletion review requires a substantial if not complete rewrite.

<dd>Some specific answers:
<dl>
<dd>1. As an example of why the Guinness listing is significant, it was <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_vos_Savant_bc35.html" title="Marilyn vos Savant">Marilyn vos Savant</a>'s association with the society that resulted in her being listed in Guinness, which in turn led to her column in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parade_%28magazine%29.html" title="Parade (magazine)">Parade (magazine)</a>, which is the most widely read magazine in the United States.</dd>
<dd>2. The society has been cited in many mainstream books and other publications, not just Guinness, as referenced in the article.</dd>
<dd>3. There are many societies that are old. The Order of the Garter is included because it's members are selected by the Queen of England. By the way, one of the arguments given above is that the the society is "largely self-selected." This is both false and pejorative.</dd>
<dd>4. I'm not assuming bad faith. I'm giving evidence of bias. Those are not the same thing.</dd>
<dd>5. The article differs from the deleted one in that it is an extensive rewrite.</dd>
<dd>6. The original deletion was procedurally flawed, and revealed a Catch-22 in Wikipedia policy. The original deletion admin admitted that he merely counted up the votes, which is contrary to policy, but the reviewing admin followed policy when he counted up the votes on the review. In other words, if there are a large number of people who want an article deleted for whatever reason, and if the deletion admin doesn't follow policy and merely counts up votes, then there is no real recourse. This may be why the reviewing admin encouraged a rewrite and resubmit. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 15:56, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Canon was a major contributor to the article prior to deletion. I have resotred the history (deletion was end of July) so people can judge the extent to which this is a repost. I don't think it's a G4, I <i>do</i> think it's perilously close to an A7 and I definitely think the sources are inadequate, in that they are evidence only of existence (and we already know it exists, we just don't know <a href="../../../w/s/i/WP%7EWSIC_1496.html" title="WP:WSIC">why we are supposed to care</a>). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>2. The "why we should care" article mainly discusses the need for verifiable citations in mainstream publications. That has been done in the article. However, the underlying theme is that the idea of a small group of people who score highly on an IQ test is not notable. Here is why it is: Either intelligence is something real or it is not. For the purposes of Wikipedia we can assume it is real since there is no consensus that it is not. If it is real, it can be measured. It is difficult to measure anything that is rare, and efforts to do so are interesting. The Mega Society does not exist in a vacuum; it is the last in a series of societies that have been assembled over the years. As such it represents the limits of the art and science of intelligence testing as it currently exists. That makes it notable. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 16:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Namely that the selective nature of the club limits it's size as stated by Canon. The "issue" of the club being "largely self-selected" is ridiculous, "self-selection" means selection by oneself of oneself, I don't see how it applies here, even if it did I don't see what preclusion would be involved.<a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETstrobaugh_0402.html" title="User:Tstrobaugh">Tstrobaugh</a> 19:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Guinness articles are about the Society and it looks like they stretch from 1983 to 1990, not 1986. The Omni articles are written by Scot Morris, not Ronald Hoeflin, so this needs to be fixed in the references. Since Hoeflin founded the Society he will be mentioned in any reference to it, but for example the Simonton and Jacobs books both only mention the Society and Hoeflin. All of the references discuss the Society and some of them are only about the Society. By the way, while checking this I found some other books on Google Books that discuss the Society. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 00:01, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The mentions in Guinness are not really in articles, but as part of directory listings, so they are not considered sources for purposes of notability. Most of the books on Google books use the term "mega-society" in a different way that does not refer to this organization. Of those that mention the organization, that's all they do--mention it. In order for the notability criteria to be satisfied, the Society (not Hoeflin) would have to be the <i>subject</i>, implying some extended discussion. Only the Simonton book even bothers to reference "Mega Society" in its index and that is only one page. The articles in Omni seem better, but looking closely, according to the Village Voice article, the 1985 article was a reproduction of the Hoeflin's test, not an article about the society. The 1990 article, both from the title and how it's used in the WP article also seems to be a reproduction of the test for Omni's readers, not a source that we can use to write an article about the Society. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:55, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, if one were to sit down which these references and compose an article about the Society, one would end up with an article very similar to the current article. That is the purpose of giving references, to verify the information in the article. As has already been stated by others, this article is well-sourced by Wikipedia's (or I dare say any encyclopedia's) standards. The statement that a listing in Guinness is not evidence of notability seems contrary to reason. I fear that the discussion is veering in the direction of trying to define "notability" which is well-trodden (some might think over-trodden) ground. At the risk of redundancy, the society is notable because Hoeflin and others use it as a testbed for high range testing, and the members are statistically unusual. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 01:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Recreation of spam, we should speedy delete and warn those trying to Wikilaywer themselves into Wikipedia. Won't work no matter what. Also, how is a society of 26 out of a potential target group of thousands of people on earth notable? It is still only 1 in a million people... that amounts to thousands of people worldwide. What makes a group of 26 people notable in that context? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 07:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

Wikipedia is a tertiary source, that reports as much as possible on research published in peer-reviewed academic secondary sources (journals, conferences, news sources, etc).

<li>Yes, that will work fine, but only copy and paste to that subpage (or another subpage of whatever name you prefer), don't delete the original article under discussion. I'd suggest doing that now in case the article vote ends up for deletion, so that you can retrieve useful work as needed. By the way (since I'm guessing you are relatively new to wikipedia, apologies if that's incorrect), deletion isn't yet certain as Article for Deletion discussions are kept going for at least a week before any final decision is made. This deletion process can seem a bit harsh, but it's not arbitrary or immediate. The idea behind it is to seek consensus from a variety of editors before anything drastic is done. As you are obviously interested in well-researched topics and you express yourself well, please don't let this discussion (or the final decision, regardless of what it is) discourage you from continuing to help enhance Wikipedia -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:35, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm an inclusionist. Maybe the article needs more work, but the nomination largely referred to the subject - Liberty Post. It IS the leading Libertarian / Conservative political forum, and also known as an important Conservative voice critical of the policies and recent direction of Free Republic.

<p>Non-notable song from soundtrack of a film that doesn't have an article, either. Lacking notability manifests itself in the fact that there is nothing much to say about the song, and most of the article is about the film and another song that samples it. And that it's sampled in "<a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_%28Gnarls_Barkley_song%29_7d19.html" title="Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)">Crazy</a>" does not really make it notable in my opinion, either.

<p>The entry is all about his games with next to nothing about him. The only piece about him is about his participating in flamewars and a link to provide evidence for this sparked a 13month+ editwar.</p>
<p>Neither Derek Smart's game development history nor Derek Smart himself seem to be noteworthy(or even talked about in the entry). The article has a massive edit/revert war history that still continues and this has turned the article into an uncyclopedia style parody of referencing.</p>
<p>Lastly, it doesnt talk about his role in development, it talks about the development and the games themself, how the games were critically received and how often they changed publisher. In fact, it reads more like a page on 3000AD(the company) than it does Derek Smart the person. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastion_9fea.html" title="User:Bastion">Bastion</a> 12:50, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>keep</b> Sure the page has problems, it is likely to cause revert wars and it contains a lot of off topic material. But I don't see how that can be a reason to delete an entire article. The piece contains information on a notable guy, let's keep it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESander123_7c7c.html" title="User:Sander123">Sander123</a> 13:09, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - not appropriate for AfD in my opinion, geez, does anyone use cleanup tags any more or are articles being AfD'ed for having too many references now? What sort of personal detail do you want? Height and weight? The guy is an <i>independent</i> games developer... this means he mostly writes the games himself (despite the grandiose CEO titles), so development history of those games is perfectly relevent to the article. Smart has been mentioned in games magazines for years, undoubtably notable, albeit controversial (but once again, that's not a reason to delete). --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 15:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's like saying a politicians entry should have a year by year analysis of what happened in their government, regardless of if it had anything to do with the person specifically.</dd>
<dd>Again, my problem is for a bio entry it has absolutely nothing on the PERSON ITS ABOUT. If he's so notable, why does the wikipedia page on him have pretty much nothing about him? It reads like a thinly veiled critique on the games he developed and his companies relationship with developers. It doesnt even mention his age or where he lives, nevermind marriage/family - Just "In the year XXXX Battlecruiser had this happen to it" over and over and over. --89.100.1.161 15:36, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I have not yet given an opinion on the content of this article but I can't resist this opportunity. Smart is infamous in the gaming industry for his bad behavior, e.g., allegedly beating up a coke machine, suing publishers, wild unfulfilled promises, and insulting customers. Writing about this goes against <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> or at least is difficult to negotiate. That coupled with sockpuppetry and pushing personal agendas, it is an edit war without end. WP has some most excellent articles on very controversal subjects that I was just admiring, e.g., Charles Darwin, Intellignet Design. This article is no where near that calibre. I'm convinced that the WP process can work but really is an article really worth the effort when it's on a game developer of mediocre games, at best, i.e., marginal that it meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? I say that this is both an interesting solution to the edit war and a good idea. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Huffman_955a.html" title="User:Bill Huffman">Bill Huffman</a> 16:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>; consider a move. I don't see a very strong case for Mr. Smart meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and unlike Addhoc I think the article in it's current form is utter junk in respect to what a biographical article should be, but it is rather exhaustively sourced (moreso than many articles here). Still based on the current version of the article it almost belongs at a Battlecruiser Game Series article with a redirect from <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a> because while it is a rather good article about the game series, it isn't a very good article about <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Smart_5ab0.html" title="Derek Smart">Derek Smart</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously his games are notable enough to keep, (with multiple magazine articles and reviews about them) and given his personal involvement and association with them, I'd say that he himself should get an article. He's done several interviews, and I recall more than one magazine article that talked about him more than his games. That was several years ago though. Any concerns about vandalism and such, while valid, are not grounds for deletion, though they may support other action. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There is no doubt that Derek Smart is notable, the man is infamous for designing one of the most hyped games which bombed on release and is also notorius for engaging in the longest running flame war of the USENET, a google groups search on "Derek Smart" <a href="http://groups.google.lk/groups?lnk=hpsg&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22derek+smart%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.lk/groups?lnk=hpsg&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22derek+smart%22" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> yields a astonishing 53,100 results which alone is probably enough reason to say the man is noteworthy/notorious to be included in a wiki biography. Another reason would be that user Supreme_Cmdr has been alleged to be Derek Smart himself, now how many wiki biographies can claim to have regular editing by their own subject!<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> 08:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - This is another example of what is wrong with Wiki. Someone who has no knowledge of the person, nor the article (no contrib whatsoever) can roll out of bed and decide that it should be deleted. Not to mention the ludicrous reasons stated. For good, better or worse, Derek Smart is one of the most written about game developers of our time and is one of the most prominent indie devs left in an industry that has given way to the fast buck. As a game developer myself, IMO, the article is perfectly valid and the edit wars were perpetrated by Kerr and his friends who have tried (and FAILED repeatedly) incessantly to taint the article with unfounded nonsense. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarHawkSP_5e39.html" title="User:WarHawkSP">WarHawkSP</a> 13:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: no&#160;!vote yet, but I can at least that these programs are quite widely used: I know of different fitness centra in Belgium where the "teachers" (how do you call these) have followed courses in BdyJam and so on in the Netherlands to be able (and certified) to give classes in Bodyjam and so on. So it exists, is used (internationally), ... but is it verifiable?

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the one that put the pages up less than 24 hours ago, and I'm just coming back to add further content, including pictures further information. There is some information about the Les Mills programs at <a href="http://www.lesmills.com" class="external free" title="http://www.lesmills.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lesmills.com</a>, and forums such as <a href="http://www.lesmillstalk.com" class="external free" title="http://www.lesmillstalk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lesmillstalk.com</a> and <a href="http://www.groupfitness.org" class="external free" title="http://www.groupfitness.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.groupfitness.org</a> all of which are grassroots communities of people that do a series of fitness class and like to talk about them. That they are created a fitness program that comes out of New Zealand and which are done in 55 countries by 4 million participants doesn't make the "Body" series of fitness programs notable? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardoc_9640.html" title="User:Beardoc">Beardoc</a> 03:17, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe you, but to keep this article according to the Wikipedia policies, we need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources which are reliable, peer-reviewed and independent. Info by the company doesn't count (not independent), info by forums and so on doesn't count either (not reliable, because not peer-reviewed). What we need is articles published in independent magazines (so no advertorials or magazines owned by Les Mills or small magazines by fitness centra that have a Les Mills program), something like "Fitness International" or "Sport and Fitness" something similar (no idea if it exists, just trying to give an impression). If such general magazines on a sport / lifestyle spend (lare) articles on Les Mills and on the different programs, then they are worth keeping. If no one can give us such sources (preferably but not necessarily online), then we have to delete it. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:07, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for your input Fram - however, I don't see that this particular series of entries is should have the official guidelines apply to it, when with things like <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkin_Green_Frog_0e58.html" title="Hopkin Green Frog">Hopkin Green Frog</a> or I am not Canadian can exist in Wikipedia with only links to various websites and blogs (which <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says is not acceptable. Other entries seem to be allowed to continue, but get tagged with the "needs citations" tag. Why shouldn't these entries be allowed that as well, rather than getting deleted? Also, if I can find research that is relevant, then it can stay, right? if that's the case, then <a href="../../../b/o/d/BodyPump_0fd2.html" title="BodyPump">BodyPump</a> cites research - why can it not stay? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardoc_9640.html" title="User:Beardoc">Beardoc</a> 12:05, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This sport is even known here in Lebanon. I found the listing of the songs in each version very useful. Anybody practicing this fitness program would appreciate such information.

<li><b>Keep</b> This information is useful for people doing research for fitness programs. Agree however that more research needs to be added so that this does not become Advertisement or Spam. This is similar to other Wiki entries such as Taebo, etc and is unique enough to warrant an entry. Citing reviews based on differences and similarities in different locations might also prove useful. --User:Juce 12:12, 29 November 2006 (EST) <small>— Juce (<a href="../../../j/u/c/User_talk%7EJuce_2de8.html" title="User talk:Juce">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Juce_615a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Juce">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<p>Although this was kept during a previous flawed AfD, there's <i>still</i> no sources here for the article's tenuous claims of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> because as a <i>professional</i> electronic sports team, they are, in fact, notable.

<dd>As noted in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ninjas_in_Pyjamas_3eba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ninjas in Pyjamas">prior AfD</a>, the notability is that they actually earn enough money playing silly games (prizes, appearance fees, endorsements and sponsorships) that they don't need "real jobs". There are only a few teams like this in the world and that makes them notable. Gaming clans in general are non-notable because they are fleeting collection of "internet friends" that are no more notable than someone's Tuesday bowling league.

<p>First, this article tries to catalog what things are <i>not</i> included in a given standard, and has no hope of ever not violating Wikipedia's prohibition against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Second, even if you <i>could</i> somehow write this article without, y'know, just making things up, I question whether it has any encyclopedic value at all. Lastly, the fact that the talk page is one long war between an expert and those conducting the original research, and that the quality of the writing in the article is hopelessly poor is just the icing on the cake. We should put this article out of our misery. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 15:43, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The summation above is somewhat inaccurate. There is absolutely NO 'original research' involved in listing scripts which do not have a specific code in the ISO 15924 standard. You can point to the standard... see that there is no code there... and perfectly verify the accuracy of the list. This page exists because there is currently a problem with articles on 'writing systems' in Wikipedia. Specifically, it has been claimed that Wikipedia is in '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AInfobox_WS&amp;diff=86926839&amp;oldid=86925331" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3AInfobox_WS&amp;diff=86926839&amp;oldid=86925331" rel="nofollow">error</a>' to refer to various sets of characters as 'scripts' or 'daughters' of other scripts... because the ISO 15924 standard would not define them that way.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is, again, untrue. ISO 15924 does not define scripts. It assigns codes to the names of scripts. I have explained this before. I asked you to read the standard, which is online. The list contained articles about some <i>alphabets</i> like <a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwi_script.html" title="Arwi script">Arwi script</a>, claimiing that they were not in ISO 15924. But Arwi uses the Arabic script. So it <i>is</i> in ISO 15924. Bah. I've explained this before, too. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 17:52, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Likewise, when the words "character sets" are used to describe groups of symbols used in writing the angry retort is 'that is not how ISO 15924 defines the words "character set"'... which, while all true, is irrelevant. This is not the ISO 15924 website. This is Wikipedia. An encyclopedia written for ordinary web surfers. If you ask a regular person whether <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon_language.html#Writing_systems" title="Klingon language">Klingon script</a> is the same thing as <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_script.html" title="Latin script">Latin script</a> they <b>are</b> going to tell you NO... regardless of what <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">User:Evertype</a>, no matter how expert on writing systems he may be, has to say on the matter. And it is those ordinary people who define what Wikipedia includes and how it is presented. This page attempts to clarify the difference between 'scripts' as defined by the ISO 15924 standard and things which are <i>called</i> scripts by ordinary people. It has not proceeded very far or had much cleanup because people have been attempting to get agreement and understanding on this difference before proceeding. Essentially this comes down to a question of whether Wikipedia is written to comply with the expectations of billions of ordinary people or to follow a recently developed and little known international standard. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:12, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I must disagree with your conclusion's about Original Research in this article. That is meant to apply to different things than this situation. Theories is the primary concern, and research data, not logical deductions such as this. However, I would say from this <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/unsupported.html" class="external text" title="http://www.unicode.org/standard/unsupported.html" rel="nofollow">Unicode.org</a> page that it is at least possible for there to be some sources.

<dd><i>(edit conflict)</i> You suggest that unless someone else has already published a list in a reliable third-party source it is original research to compile one here. I disagree.

This isn't 'original research' because no 'research' is involved... only compilation of verifiable third-party source material which already exists. It is possible to cite reliable sources for various things which are called scripts... this is readily apparent from the fact that Wikipedia has referenced articles on dozens of them. Compiling those into a list is NOT original research. 'Original compilation', yes... original research, no.

I attempted to explain this, then stated getting called liar by Mr Conradi and told that I was engaging in original research by CBD. This is not interesting. I tried to explain things on the Talk page, but that didn't go anywhere either, not for want of trying on my part. Dispute Resolution? I'm not sure what you think the dispute is.

Thus you should consider the advice DR offers you. If you are tired of this problem, then you may wish to consider leaving it for a while, though given your stated membership with the Unicode foundation, you may find that you can't just leave forever. Still, it might help to take a break. I understand that you don't want false information going around, but in this case, I doubt anybody will come to any lasting harm if you let it stand for a while.

Can you quote from ISO 15924 or ISO/IEC 10646 or a published text on the subject or a peer reviewed journal or... <i>anything</i> to back that up? If not, then yes... it IS original research. If there is no source that 'Joe Wikipedian' can go to and see, 'Yup this reliable third party source says that Arwi script is an orthography of Arabic' then that isn't 'verifiable' information by Wikipedia standards. That doesn't mean it isn't 'True' or 'logical' or whatever. Treating the thirteen Arwi characters which do not appear in Arabic as 'orthographic marks which do not indicate a different script' might well be the best way to view it. It might be the accepted "common sense" amongst experts in the field. But if it isn't written down <i>anywhere</i> then it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. We don't define things.

<dd>By all the gods featherless and feathered, will you <i>please</i> <b>listen</b> to what I am saying? The Arwi alphabet is not a script. The English alphabet is not a script. If you do not understand the difference between an alphabet and a script you have no business editing articles about writing systems. The English alphabet is an orthography of the Latin script. The Arwi alphabet is an orthography of the Arabic script. It is a mistake to call the Arwi alphabet a script. It would be a mistake to call the English alphabet a script. An alphabet is made of a set of letters which belong to a script. If I say that the letter <b>B</b> is used in the English alphabet, and that the letter <b>B</b> belongs to the Latin script, I am not engaging in original research. If I say that the letter <b>ب</b> is used in the Arwi alphabet, and that the letter <b>ب</b> belongs to the Arabic script, I am not engaging in original research. I do not have to "back up" a claim that <b>B</b> belongs to the Latin script, nor a claim that <b>ب</b> belongs to the Arabic script. It is simply a fact. These are coded characters. If you have some software, you can select a coded character an find out its Unicode name and hexadecimal code. You will find out that their names are LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B and ARABIC LETTER BEH respectively. The one is not Latin and the other Arabic because the standard says so. The standard says so because the one <i><b>is</b></i> Latin and the other Arabic.

<dd>I have listened. I understand. I am not so "obtuse" as to be unable to understand the "Sesame Street" logic that "ABCDEF" are part of the Latin script as you have implied. What <i>you</i> need to understand is that I do understand what you are saying, but I do not <b>agree</b>. You say above, "It would be a mistake to call the English alphabet a script." I disagree. I am convinced you are wrong about that. The reason I am so convinced is that I can open up my OED and see that it defines 'script' as an 'alphabet'... I can do a Google search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=English+script&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=English+script&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">English script</a> and find thousands of examples of people doing this thing which you say is a mistake. So... no, it is not a mistake. It is reality. That is the way actual human beings use the word 'script'. You don't believe that this is a proper / logical usage of the term and you may well have many excellent reasons for that... but it does not matter because that IS the way the term is used. As to, "I do not have to 'back up' a claim that <b>B</b> belongs to the Latin script"... again, no one has asked you to. Rather to 'back up a claim that <b>β</b> belongs to the Latin script'... or that IPA belongs to the Latin script despite using the character 'β', which does not. If you have a reliable third party source for either of those things then please quote them. If not... then clearly that is NOT verifiable. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:29, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User:CBD, I have to ask have you got third party sources that, for example that Arwi is a script? Surely it is your responsibility to to find sources that show it is a script before putting it in a list of scripts, not User:Evertypes responsibility to find sources to disprove that fact.

Wikipedia should not have an article about the "Albanian script" where the alphabet is really what is being discussed, and because ABCDE do not belong to the "Albanian script" but to the Latin. The arbiter of what the scripts <b>are</b> must be the UCS. When you type A, you are typing LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A as defined in the UCS (ISO/IEC 10646). If, therefore ا ب ج are found to be in an alphabet (as they are in Arwi) then, because all of those are Arabic letters, we know we cannot have an article called "Arwi script".

<dd>Now you're just being disingenuous. You are well aware that while (as you say) ا ب ج are Arwi characters classified as 'Arabic' by UCS, چ ڊ ڍ are Arwi characters classified as NOT Arabic by UCS... and there are four characters in the Arwi alphabet which aren't coded by UCS at all. The fact is that ~30% of the characters in the Arwi alphabet are <b>not Arabic</b>... as defined by the UCS which YOU say should be the standard we follow. If the UCS classifies a significant portion of Arwi characters as being <b>not</b> Arabic (as it does) how can you cite it as an authority that Arwi IS Arabic?
<dl>
<dd>No, no, no, no, no, no, and no. Will you PLEASE listen for once? <i><b>There is a difference between a script and an alphabet.</b></i> چ is ARABIC LETTER TCHEH. ڊ is ARABIC LETTER DAL WITH DOT BELOW. ڍ is ARABIC LETTER DDAHAL. These are Arabic characters. They belong to the Arabic script. They are not, it is true, used in the alphabet used for the Arabic language. They belong to the Arwi alphabet. TCHEH also belongs to the Persian and Urdu alphabets. DAL WITH DOT BELOW also belongs to the Sindhi alphabet, as does DDAHAL. All of them belong to the Arabic script. It was therefore incorrect for someone to make an article called "Arwi script", because there is no Arwi script. There is an Arabic script, which includes a great many characters. No single language uses all of them. The Arabic script is a superset including the Arabic alphabet, the Arwi alphabet, the Sindhi alphabet, and dozens more. This is unambiguous. It is precise. It is the accepted nomenclature in the International Standards Organization and in the Unicode Consortium. Articles about ISO 15924 or aboiut چ <i>are</i> about UCS charcters.

If it were to exist, then we would need to have articles about the English script, the German script, the French script, the Polish script, and the Swahili script. But there are no such things.

<dd>Above you present the argument that UCS classifying some characters of an alphabet as belonging to a particular script means the entire alphabet belongs to that script (Arwi to Arabic in your example)... but by that reasoning the 'International Phonetic Alphabet' could be classified as the 'Greek script' (rather than Latin as you argue) since it contains Greek characters. There is no 'clear cut' standard here.

<dd>There is if one knows what one is talking about. It appears to me that you do not. I said, and I say, that the International Phonetic Alphabet is a Latin alphabet.

A Caucasian script, named Albanian, which is a different Albania entirely from the other one on the Adriatic, and which does not use Latin letters ç and ë, as the national language of Albania does. So you're telling us what? That you don't know how to use Google properly?

<dd>We aren't going to get anywhere, then. Your first link is unimpressive, and simply shows imprecision on the part of the vendor. The second is to a PowerPoint essay and is hardly authoritative. The third contains the word <i>script</i> in its correct sense (the Turkish shift from Arabic script to Latin script [NOT to "Turkish script"]) and doesn't even contain the words "Albanian script". So much for your Google prowess. In the real world, the word "script" is <i>not</i> "generally used" as a synonym for "alphabet". I work with people from India who sometimes use the world "alphabet" where we would use the word "letter" ("In Hindi we have 35 alphabets"). This error is common enough, but it doesn't mean that the word "letter" is "generally used" for the word "alphabet". We have three words: letter, alphabet, and script. There are good, simple definitions of these which allow us to describe the world's writing systems unambiguously on the Wikipedia. In particular, in the context of ISO 15924 it is pernicious and misleading for you to insist that your "script = alphabet" view should be the one used in the context of articles on writing systems. And the definition you have taken from the OED you have misunderstood, because the <i>script</i> is the <i>system</i> not the individual <i>alphabet</i>. So the OED definition can be seen to be more congruent with the definition of this word in ISO and Unicode contexts, which <i>are</i> what we are using in the WS project. If you can't live with this, please find something else to edit than articles on writing systems, because you will get reverted. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 10:20, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Setting aside your typically condescending tone... you apparently missed the part where the third link states, "I also find it significant that Armenian was placed closest to the new <b>Albanian script</b> in the table." As to your casual dismissal of the other two as 'imprecise'... that's the problem. The real world IS imprecise. People use the terms this way. That it is 'imprecise' does not change the <i>proven fact</i> that they <b>DO</b>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

Or the word "Armenian" either. What is it you are trying to achieve? Insisting on imprecise terminology because it pleases you... in what way does this assist users of the Wikipedia to be able to distinguish between an alphabet and a script? They are distinguishable. The Arabic script contains the Urdu alphabet, the Persian alphabet, the Arwi alphabet, and indeed the Arabic alphabet. Each alphabet contains letters. There is a hierarchy here. A taxonomy which we need to use on the Wikipedia because it makes sense, and it helps users of the encyclopaedia. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 14:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Question: 'Who commonly considers them scripts?' - Answer... humans. Just like everything else on Wikipedia. We name our articles based on what people commonly call them... not the precise technical name considered most appropriate by specialists. That is and has always been the case. If thousands of people around the world call something 'Albanian script' or 'Klingon script' or 'Latin script' (meaning only the common characters found in our <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_script.html" title="Latin script">Latin script</a> article rather than the full range so defined by UCS) then that is how we name and structure the articles. Should <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_script.html" title="Latin script">Latin script</a> be re-written to state what we have in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicode_Latin_88af.html" title="Unicode Latin">Unicode Latin</a> or should it continue to cover how the term is <b>commonly</b> used? Should <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat.html" title="Bat">Bat</a> be retitled to 'Chiroptera' because that is the name used by specialists or should we continue to give precedence to the name the majority of people actually use? How is it 'original research' to use common names and definitions rather than specialized and in some cases undocumented ones? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As it stands, it isn't stating an alternative common name, it is expressing an opinion which needs supporting with references. I wouldn't suggest renaming <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat.html" title="Bat">Bat</a>, as I can provide many reliable sources to back up the use of that name for the genera, and reliable sources are all that is required here (as everywhere where a statement is the subject of controversy); this isn't covered by its absence from the cited document. If thousands of people use it, it should be easy to find sources, otherwise it is just your opinion. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:02, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But... it <b>IS</b> easy to find sources. As has been demonstrated when Evertype said above that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=English+script&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=English+script&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">English script</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Albanian+script%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Albanian+script%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">Albanian script</a> were 'incorrect usage'... it was child's play to find the linked examples of such usage, and those were cases where he chose the item in question. How about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Aramaic+script%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Aramaic+script%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">Aramaic script</a>? Not exactly difficult to find references. Edit warring with Evertype to maintain them in the article would not be worthwhile until this issue is settled, but it is obvious that references exist. If they didn't the pre-existing Wikipedia articles on these things wouldn't be here either. Some of the more obscure ones might be difficult to find English language sources for, but it is also readily apparent that the word 'script' is used to describe any and all forms of written communication (as per my citation of the OED). --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:01, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your link to "English script" leads to a "cursive handwriting" example of "script" which is <i>not</i> what we were disputing about. What we were disputing about is whether "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" can be termed "the English script". It cannot, which is why the Arabic letters making up the Arwi alphabet do not lead to a meaningful entity called "the Arwi script". Your citation of "the Albanian script" ONCE AGAIN leads to a true script found in the Caucasus which is unrelated to the Latin-script Albanian alphabet used in the country on the Adriatic. Your citation of the OED, as I have mentioned above, is being completely misinterpreted by you: <b>And the definition you have taken from the OED you have misunderstood, because the <i>script</i> is the <i>system</i> not the <i>individual alphabet</i>.</b> It is ridiculous that you suggest that we do not distinguish between <b>script</b> and <b>alphabet</b> on the Wikipedia. I don't think you're an expert in this area. What is it that you are trying to achieve? To defeat me in argument? I am trying to achieve a usage on the Wikipedia which assists people in knowing what the difference between a <b>script</b> and an <b>alphabet</b> is. You are not <i>ever</i> going to convince me that the terms are synonymous, or that there is such a thing as the "Arwi script". -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 14:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You already acknowledged above that there were various entries in the 'Albanian script' list DO refer to the modern 'Albanian alphabet'... after I provided direct links proving that. Thus, repeating the false claim that they all refer to the older 'Caucasian Albanian script' seems less than helpful. Likewise, while it is certainly possible to find results in almost ANY Google search that refer to other things it is obviously false that all of the Google hits on 'English script' refer to things other than the alphabet used to write the English language. Could we please argue the actual merits rather than such obfuscations? You say it is ridiculous to suggest that 'script' and 'alphabet' be used interchangeably on Wikipedia. I say that it is proven reality that they ARE used interchangeably throughout the world... and therefor believe that Wikipedia should follow suit. What 'I am trying to achieve' should be obvious... 'a usage which is consistent with the way people actually use the terms'... in conformity with <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:03, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're not "catching me out" on anything, CBD. I am quite tired of arguing with you. Wikipedia naming conventions do NOT oblige us to use imprecise terminiology or taxonomy where precise terminology exist. You have not established with any of your efforts that "Arwi script" would be appropriate to describe the "Arwi alphabet"; you have not addressed my specific description of the relations between "Arabic script" and the many alphabets which use it. You have taken pains to show that "script" may be polyvalent, but that does not mean that you are right and that your notions of article titling should prevail. I have taken this up on the Writing Systems WikiProject pages.

Dear User Samsara,</p>
<p>This is user Spoon2319 creator of the Dean Cameron Reynolds page. I am in fact Dean Cameron Reynolds as well. I politely request that you reconsider the nimination of deletion of the mentioned page as the reasons you cite for deletion are not entirely accurate. With only a little research it is easy to see that the work has been published, if you google the name Dean Cameron Reynolds you will see that published work appears on the Mosaic Literary E-Zine, as well as the fact that I have been involved in production work at the Barley Films animation company. And if further proof is needed I will happily send you copies of the Watermarks Literary Journal in which his writing AND artwork have been published as well as an article and photograph of myself in the Irish Times. The Watermarks Literary Journal is the printed companion of the Moloch Literary E-Zine which you are welcome to investigate. And finally, under the Wikipedia article guidelines themselves, I will quote:</p>
<p>Self-promotion. You are free to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in. However, do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other, including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view, which is difficult when writing about yourself. Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography, Wikipedia:Notability and Wikipedia:Conflict of interest.</p>
<p>which is found in:</p>

<p>I am an full time animation Lecturer in Palmerston North, and due to the nature of the networked animation community it is important to have information of this nature accessible to those who you do business with in other parts of the world. I politely request that you reconsider your stance, and perhaps remove the nomination for deletion. I feel that the guidelines of wikipedia are clear, and that with proper research it will be easy to see that the article has relevance.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dean Cameron Reynolds</p>

I've been reluctant to expand on the brief article by the original posters.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. When the debate is primarily ten people, each accusing everyone of bad faith except themselves, it's hard to pick out cogent points. The consensus is a little weak, but does favour delete (particularly as there is some very fishy (sockpuppetty) 'keep' votes). And, as the discussion has become less about the merits (or lack) of this article than into an incoherent shouting match, the main reason for my going with deletion is the fact that the article is a collection of external links, thus failing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, anyway. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 15:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Renaming the article has nothing to do with the AfD, and in fact, might actually have <i>helped</i> the keep side in the debate, as its new title more properly reflects <i>what the article is</i>, and therefore less a reason to delete it as POV.

<dd>Exactly. You completely bypassed the AFD, which is a key concept of Wikipedia, and decided to rename it yourself without taking into account the views of other editors.

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> I wanted to mention this is littered with allegations that are misrepresented as facts. Many of the incidents show no proof LTTE had any part in it, but its completely misrepresented in the article. In addition many incidents rely on a Sri Lankan government letter sent to the UN citing incidents. Its hardly a credible source of information and could just be propaganda material. Title is hardly NPOV. There is hardly verifiable evidence to indicate and prove its "Terrorist attacks carried by the LTTE". <a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElalan_06ee.html" title="User:Elalan">Elalan</a> 23:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The current title "Terrorist Attacks carried out by the LTTE" is certainly POV. LTTE has not accepted responsibility for all of these attacks. Most of the accusations have been made by the Sri Lankan Government, and it is very likely that their version is full of exaggerations. Merging the article content under the title "Attacks <i>attributed</i> to the LTTE" is a better solution. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:25, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since most of these terrorist attacks were carried out in mercenary type or in suicide mission, unless dead people come from their graves,one must say we never know the absolute truth of this.But what we know is, LTTE have every reason to terrorise sinhalese and even muslim people.They want sinhalese/muslims out of their mythical homeland by any means..<b>And even this,article actually do not carry every single terrorist act of them.The list is,sadly huge!!</b>.And none of the attacks were exaggerations by GOSL,and i would really appreciate if you can come up with any. finally i would like to state, that this article has not violated any of the wiki policies.And arguments against are "amazingly weak",and simply can be put into various "logical fallacies". --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 14:01, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

And speaking of civility, its amazing that those comments comes from someone"who deleted his own talk page just to cover himself up".someone who uses words such as "goons", "stupid" ,"kid" ,"immature" to describe fellow wikipedians and yet hasn't done a single apology at all!!</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sri Lankan govt letter to the UN is not a WP:RS. That is the biggest problem with this article. Where is there reliable. neutral, authoritative source to indicate this is a "terrorist attack." Hence 115 events have to removed to start with In this it claims "LTTE" did it. It has no substantiation to make this claim. A Sri Lankan govt. letter to UN is hardly of any substance and doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. Are we starting to publish everyone's letters on wikipedia&#160;? The way it is worded, there is apparently proof the LTTE did, but this is complete misrepresentation coming from clearly a propaganda letter. The article is the boldest example of WP:POV, it relies on what is a propaganda source to advertise that these events were true. Where it relies on other sources of evidence, its got show that its "a terrorist attack".

<li><b>comment</b> LTTE did carry out every single attack stated in the article and a lot more not in this article.And these are acts of terrorism.And even in the wikipedia they have an separate template titled infobox terrorist attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_terrorist_attack" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_terrorist_attack" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.Which is work of an administrator named Tariqabjotu.So the word "terrorist attacks" is not POV at all according to wikipedia.You may have a case against calling them terrorist,but not against the use of "terrorist attacks"..And if you have any questions regarding cited incidents, i would like to take every single incident and discuss with you.And,finally, i would like to tell you that the ,LTTE have not categorically denied most of the massacres stated in this article. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 19:15, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Reply to <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">User:Utcursch</a>, Terrorist attacks attributed versus Notable attack as a tile. If the former, then each and every attack has to fit the definition of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> page, attacks aginst military instalations cannot be included. If the title is latter then the attacks have to be notable ingoring the troubles associated with terrorist attack definition, hence my preferance to <b>Notable attacks by the LTTE</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason they're unreliable is that for a great many of them, their source is solely the Government of Sri Lanka. The GoSL has certainly been known for lying about these incidents (indeed, it has even been accused--in some cases likely justifiably--of blaming its own soldiers' crazed attacks on the LTTE). Therefore, reports of LTTE attacks whose only source is the GoSL are <i>inherently unreliable.</i> Third party reports from reliable neutral parties is an <i>absolute must</i> for such an article. This cannot be remedied with this silly "some of the incidents were contained in a letter authored by a Sri Lankan government official, [so] it's contents may or may not be neutral" note. <b>If they're not known to be reliable, they <i>cannot</i> be included</b>. To work the way that is being suggested with such a note is like writing an article of fiction and having it pass muster because you note at the top "this article may be lies". Sorry, but we <i>obviously</i> cannot work that way. In addition, the entire article is POV. The reason we have <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a> is twofold. First, is so that only attacks that are notable enough for an encyclopedia are included. Are these attacks notable? If they are, they can go into that article. If not, then they don't belong in an encyclopedia. Secondly, it is properly named. Simply "attacks" and "attributed".

<li>Iwazaki, whether the claims in the letter are correct or not, the source of the letter is biased. I will <i>not</i> provided evidence for what cases are not true. That's not the point at all. If the source is unreliable (and it is, since it is clearly biased to the pro-GoSL point of view), it cannot be used. If what's contained in the letter is correct, you should have <i>no trouble</i> finding it printed in an <i>independent reliable source</i>. The sooner you understand that this is how we write an encyclopedia, the sooner we'll be able to get on with actually writing it. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 19:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

As i said before, your argument is totally based on the fact that "since GOSL said so this cant be right",which is a <b>logical fallacy</b>,and totally <b>irrelevant</b> .Since we have given evidence, why dont you give evidence against it&#160;??

<li><b>Comment</b>. Okay, this is the last time I'm going to bother responding to you, since you seem to be intentionally ignoring my actual point. There is no "evidence" that <i>this time</i> the GoSL is lying. However, it has to be accepted that the GoSL is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> on the LTTE because it is <i>so involved</i> in the conflict with that group. That's the whole definition of <i>reliable source</i> - a source that is neutral to the issue. It is <i>not</i> "our" turn to find reliable sources to question the validity of the GoSL letter. It is <i>your</i> responsibility to show what is an <i>inherently unreliable source</i> (a source so close to one side in an <i>incredibly heated</i> conflict) is actually the truth. Basically, both the LTTE and the GoSL have to be excluded from your fact-finding mission (except where they are reporting on their own actions, and even then they have to be examined carefully). Both sources are <i>obviously</i> suspect to a great degree, to the point where we cannot accept them. If what GoSL is claiming in the letter is truthful, then there will be <i>no problem</i> finding reports from neutral parties on the same incidents. So go searching for the obvious truth. This is an encyclopedia--don't expect your articles to be handed to you fully-formed by Sri Lankan officials. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

You have failed to point out a single attack,which couldn't be pointed out to the LTTE. And surprisingly you still question the validity of the article&#160;!!! When its people are dying from the acts of terrorism,and there are over 200 such acts carried out during 1980-2000,GOSL had every right to made complains to the relevant international bodies.Every incident stated in the article is carried out by LTTE for obvious reasons,ethnic cleansing..And for my knowledge they have even not denied most of them&#160;!!</dd>

<p>if you are claiming GOSL sources are biased, you should prove it..And provide counter arguments for it..Just because GOSL is engaged in a war against LTTE, we cant dismiss every single claim made by the GOSL.We should take, every case carefully and analyse it thoroughly before making any conclusions.And in this case,you havent done any of it.Also the article has given non government sources too,but you still want to delete it,and merge into a different article,which says nothing about terrorist attacks&#160;!! so i have the feeling that this isnt about evidences after all. Finally, except for giving classical examples of logical fallacies,such as Appeal to Ignorance,you have done absolutely nothing to justify your position here. --<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 21:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>strong keep</b>. As a fellow editor had already stated,this is one of the best referenced article in wikipedia.

<dd>This article has a wealth of information that is not contained anywhere else in Wikipedia. As pointed out, what is wrong with using statistics of a national government about dead citizens?

<dd>The word "terrorist attacks" is not POV and is widely used in Wikipedia.

<dd>Also, a look at the articles that link to the terrorist attack template shows how many notable attacks have been labled as terrorist attacks. For example, the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_bombing_680f.html" title="Oklahoma City bombing">Oklahoma City bombing</a> article starts off</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oklahoma City bombing was a terrorist attack on April 19, 1995, in which the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, a U.S. government office complex in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was destroyed, killing 168 people.</p>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>And the article <b>should not be merged</b> with the notable attacks article as that primarily focuses upon the military attacks by the LTTE and the terrorist attacks article focuses on the Terrorist, ie attacks against civilians.

As for POV not being a reason for deletion, if the article cannot be anything <i>other</i> than POV, that is, if the entire issue is POV from the start, (the way this article is named is undoubtedly POV that cannot be allowed to stay), then, yes, POV <i>is</i> a reason for deletion. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 17:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The other articles prove that there is a wide consensus within the Wikipedia community that the word "terrorist" is acceptable. Just because you don't like it that does not mean that it shouldn't be used. Again, if you dispute that, you do not have to go through the articles, simply nominate them for deletion as they contain the word terrorist in the title. Your need to delete this article <b>ONLY</b> and your unwillingness to take engage in any other article with the title terrorism or the "terrorist Attack" template clearly displays your bias and duplicity in this matter. And we aren't talking about 1 or 2 murders here. If we listed all the murders carried out by the LTTE we'll get a really, really long list. Only the <b>notable</b> incidents where at least about 4 or 5 people were killed are listed. Comparably, there is an article subsection list of serial killers in the US <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_serial_killers_by_country.html#USA" title="List of serial killers by country">List_of_serial_killers_by_country#USA</a>. -<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolfd4_dd28.html" title="User:Snowolfd4"><font color="#9696A0" face="Tahoma"><b>snowolf</b></font><font color="#0A0096" face="tahoma"><b>D4</b></font></a><sup>( <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolfd4_35b8.html" title="User talk:Snowolfd4"><font color="#339966" face="Constantia"><b>talk</b></font></a> / <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Snowolfd4_5371.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Snowolfd4"><font color="#CC0099" face="Constantia"><b>@</b></font></a> )</sup> 19:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh, goodness gracious. First off, those articles don't prove anything--you'd have to also know how many articles that <i>could</i> use the word "terrorist" but don't in order to get any idea whatsoever of how widespread and accepted its use is (plus, Wikipedia isn't a democracy, it's an encyclopedia out to publish facts in a neutral way, and if something's wrong with 95% support, <i>it's still wrong</i>). Secondly, I explained quite well on your talk page why I am currently dealing with this article. And I did not say I would never go deal with the other articles, which, BTW, might not require deletion--if they're only POV in their naming, then they just need renaming. This article, however, is POV in its entirety, using GoSL propaganda as its main source, which is clearly against <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. As for your argument that this article only includes <i>notable</i> incidents, do you mean it only includes incidents that the people maintaining <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a> don't think are notable? There's already an article on <i>notable</i> incidents, so why you'd be arguing that this article is about notable incidents, I do not know. Clearly, it's a POV fork from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_65d5.html" title="Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE">Notable attacks attributed to the LTTE</a>, an attempt to include as many "incidents" as possible, including all sorts of incidents that are reported by the GoSL and the GoSL alone, because those level-headed individuals maintaining the other article didn't want it turned into the huge POV mess this one is. This article certainly doesn't make any mention of notability, and, in fact, someone from this AfD has been adding it to article "See also" lists as <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_the_LTTE_7d95.html" title="Terrorist attacks attributed to the LTTE"><i>Comprehensive</i> list of terrorist attacks carried out by LTTE</a>. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:01, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>attacks on civilians can obviously be called "terrorist attacks".

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Iwazaki, you can't vote a million times, vote once and respond to other statements as comments. This is truly uncivil to drag in the names of Wiki editors in every comment you make like the one above the previous fake vote of yours. I am not looking at deleting a template as you have mentioned above, but it is more likely that you are getting very frustrated and losing temper because the pages you cried out against including the State terrorism template are all being confirmed to be perfectly <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">WP:5P</a> So respond to points in a fair and civil way than just cry out and hit out at everybody against you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspite of repeated requests and warnings you still haven't changed, not just with me, but with anyone who has a stance against that of yours. Instead of trying to understand that they are talking about a context, you think they are out to get you and prove you wrong. I am posting this very specifically because you have been too much for quite some time, meddling with my talk page, posting uncivil comments and the list is endless and all the warnings and messages in your talk page testify it.</p>
<p>I'm specifically making this point here because you have dragged in my name for no reason here as italicized: <i>And its good to know, like Sudharsansn ,you also want to delete a certain template</i> and this is totally uncivil. This kind of a hitting out behaviour is definitely uncalled for and it definitely violates Civility norms.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: The LTTE is recognised as one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the world, classified as a terrorist organisation by 29 countries including the US, and the LTTE has has been responsible for the most heinious and brutal murders of women and children in Sri Lanka. The relevant article has extensively referenced sources for every quote. There is a group of people with vested interest like the LTTE sympathisers who want to expunge this information in order to whitewash the LTTE hence their objection to this article in the wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government of Sri Lanka is a reliable source <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, for the main reason that <b>as a government the statements that it(Goverment of sri lanka) makes carry a inherent sense of responsibility</b>. A goverment's comminiques are carefully considered statements which are reliable sources which do not contravene any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidlines.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the main people unhappy with sourcing from the Government of Sri Lanka are LTTE sympathisers or antigovernment forces who are quite happy to use pro eelam websites such as tamilcanadian.com, tamilnation.org, Tamiltigers.net as sources for there potentially libelous orchestrated attack on the Sri lankan goverment via the wikipedia artcle <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Terrorism_in_Sri_Lanka_8f88.html" title="State Terrorism in Sri Lanka">State Terrorism in Sri Lanka</a> yet cry foul when a Goverment source is used to substantiate a LTTE attack.</p>
<p>I wish to make a strong point, if the government of sri lanka cannot be used as a reliable source, then coversely none of the pro eelam sites or LTTE sympathisers and LTTE fronts like tamilnation.org can be used either, and thus would justify a swift call for a strong deletion of articles like <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Terrorism_in_Sri_Lanka_8f88.html" title="State Terrorism in Sri Lanka">State Terrorism in Sri Lanka</a>, which use multiple pro eelam sites (ex&#160;: "Sri Lankan State terrorism by Tamiltigers.net") to substantiate their allegations.</p>
<p>This article uses multiple cited reliable sources like the goverment of sri lankas official communiques, amnesty international's reports. US state department's reports etc to highlight the ghastly murders including the killing of Buddhist monks done by one of the most murderous and ruthless terrorist groups to appear on the face of this earth which pioneered the concept of suicide bombing. It is NPOV and should be allowed to stay as a article in accordance with the wikipedia policies. There should be no whitewashing allowed for a classified terrorist group like the LTTE.</p>
<p>I also urge the people who question the statements made in this article to <b>highlight the relevant sections that in there opinion are disputed</b> so we can discuss and find other sources to substantiate the claims if needed.</p>
<p>I urge the ruling admin to strongly consider the importance of this article, and the neutrality and the mutiple reliable source used to substantiate the claims and continue to let this article exist.</p>
<p>It would be interesting that a similar debate regarding the infinitely more libelous and defamatory template against the Sri Lankan government called Template:State terrorism in Sri Lanka ended up in a "no consensus" ruling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_15" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_15" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>.<a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerr_avon_f75a.html" title="User:Kerr avon">Kerr avon</a> 09:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, Kerr avon, those articles/templates should also be deleted as being based on unreliable sources. This AfD is going to end up as no consensus as well, since the majority of the votes, on both sides, are based on emotion and not appeal to Wikipedia policy, and there are sockpuppets (both confirmed and not) on both sides.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, as for your statement that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says that since it is from government it is reliable, that is a misrepresentation. It says that "Government publications are often reliable, but governments vary widely in their level of reliability, and often have their own interests which will explicitly allow for withholding of information, or even outright deception of the public." This is clearly a case where the government is far too involved as a partisan in the conflict to be considered reliable. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 14:24, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> No ref to such a show on google. Show not in WF's imdb entry, not in any of his obits. Show not in IMDB. His 'co-star' is not in IMDB. I recall no such show - very improbable that there was such. How to fake entry: copy half a dozen lines about some obscure 70s sitcom from somewhere else, change title, create article, change actors, and a few details, add to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I find your logic hard to believe - how would anything ever be added if it has to be in Wiki or IMDB first! I added this article BECAUSE there was no existing entry for it. Mary Clark is my aunt and playing Joan Spent was the only significant role she ever had. The article is based on her personal account and the titles were obtained from her scripts. She herself said how cringe-worthy it was, but great fun to make.</li>

<p>The term "movie filler" is not commonly used in that sense. As one can see through the discussion on the talk page, the article was written by the owner of the moviefiller website. I do believe that he acted in good faith but it is simply misleading to tell Wikipedia readers that this is a standard use. (Extra note: I believe that this is not quite speediable.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's a list of freeway exits. It isn't a guide to heart surgery or an accounting of historical events that could be disputed. Most likely it <i>was</i> created by a guy looking at a map or taken from a website where the list was made from same. You aren't going to find books on this subject.

<li>Highway exit lists are valid content <i>on a highway's article</i>, but they are <i>never</i> encyclopedic enough in their own right to merit splitting out from the main article. And I'm simply <i>not</i> convinced that something that doesn't deserve its own separate article in the first place should be granted its own separate article <i>just</i> because a consensus existed to ignore the fact that the topic doesn't actually deserve its own separate article. For one thing, 32K is a <i>guideline</i>, not an inviolable rule which automatically mandates splitting out subtopics <i>regardless</i> of whether they merit separate articles in their own right or not. Splitting is not an "anything goes" proposition — there are things that are sufficiently encyclopedic topics in their own right to warrant splitting from the main article and things that aren't; a highway's exit list is the latter. But at the same time, Wikinews was a bad suggestion; an exit list isn't news. <b>Merge</b> back into <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_401_%28Ontario%29_4303.html" title="Highway 401 (Ontario)">Highway 401 (Ontario)</a> and consider alternate ways to reorganize the article if the size is still viewed as an issue. Oh, and by the way, that's exactly the result that was obtained the <i>last</i> time this was split out — see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Interchanges_on_Ontario_provincial_highway_401_c278.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Interchanges on Ontario provincial highway 401">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Interchanges on Ontario provincial highway 401</a>, which <i>actually</i> makes this an instant <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:18, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Earth to Consumed Crustacean. Hello, Consumed Crustacean. Are you recieving? The fact that Neo's trying to get the entry deleted based specifically on the latest draft of a yet-to-be-adopted-and-may-never-be guideline that's currently under debate for being too vague and restrictive should make his reasons clear enough. His argument isn't standing on solid ground. It's standing on pudding during an earthquake. Why oh why would he try to get the Skulltag article pulled when his reasoning is so totally halfcocked? And why would he single out Skulltag when thousands of other software entries likewise "violate" the proposed guideline? Boy, what a mystery.4.246.219.169 07:51, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>You do realize that the Skulltag entry isn't violating any policy, right? It's only "violating" a proposal for a new policy that might or might not be adopted sometime in the future(and chances are high for "not"). Which makes NeoChaosX's argument for deleting <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skulltag.html" title="Skulltag">Skulltag</a> a total fallacy. 4.246.217.13 07:07, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wikipedia isn't a bureaucracy and notability isn't clear cut. There are no set notability <b>policies</b> on things like this, they're just <i>guidelines</i>. They are suggestions. Any reasonable cause for deletion can be given, as NeoChaosX has done. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">talk</a>)</small> 06:40, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe NeoChaosX gave a reasonable cause in some magical alternate reality, but here in this universe, his cause for deletion revolves around the entry "violating" a proposal for a suggestion that hasn't even been adopted yet and may never be. Even then, major sourceports of Doom are notable for a variety of reasons anyway, Skulltag being no exception. 4.246.217.13 07:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You haven't even proved that it's a "major" or notable port. You haven't given any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> third party sources to back it up.

<p>Article was speedied once as nn-bio but recreated a short time after the deletion. I'm bringing it here to settle this through AfD rather than a consistant delete and recreate cycle. Artist appears to be non-notable. No outside sources given. While she has been dead for 6 years now and Google might not be the greatest judge for this, her name only gets 11 hits, 10 of which are a really odd mirror of the Wikipedia deletion log for this article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 19:48, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> article does not assert notability beyond a generic "she is notable" without any specifics. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 20:02, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Notability is a subjective term. The precepts of wikipedia do not denote it a a requirement though it the most often used reason by the administrators as a reason for content deletion. I thus posse that wikipedia is subject to the whims of its editors thus presents a narrow view of humanity. Societies derive notability not individuals especially not those individuals who would be influenced or work in unison to ensure a centric or singular perspective. History has notable figures who cannot be found in the records of Google, but are none the less relevant. If wikipedia is simply a reflection of Google or any other such tool, is it trully notable? If not then please proceed deleting this article.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Birktek, Google is simply a tool used to locate sources to verify the assertions made within the article. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is an official policy, and there is nothing in the article that can be referenced (online or offline) to confirm that the subject is encyclopedic. The reason that notability (specifically the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines) is used, is that an encyclopedia without notability requirements quickly becomes a phone book. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 21:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No assertion of notability, fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> wasn't in bad faith. I just went through the user's other contributions to make sure there wasn't any other issues of possible vanity going on such as adding what is presumed to be someone close to the user to the UMW article.

If you look at Nationsims games based on a forum, you will also notice that Qpawn is one of the most successfull and largest. The fact is that there is a lack of information on nationsims, and searching it, the only information leads to a Eikedpia article on nationsims. Qpawns importrance is mentioned here. It was not written by a Qpawn member. The fact is when you search the web that nothing is written on nationsims shows that the area is still in development. Or there is simply bot enough to write a book on the subject. Lets face it, a book on nationsims will be boring. Because the games are forum based, little evidence is there to create a history of nationsims. Qpawn startet in 1998,ask anyone in the nationsim world, most consider it the first.

<li><b>Keep</b> While it has been said before, I'll repeat it: It has important historical value in nationsim history.

<li><b>Keep</b> QPawn is certainly significant enough, as it is a nation sim which has continued to exist for quite some time. A lot of nation sims have died, including some mentioned on the page about nation sims, but Qpawn has managed to continue its existence in some form or another. Rabble Rouser 15:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Qpawn is a large game, made by the original creator of the Qpawn dynasty. There are now more nationsims on the net than many other types of games. These add variety and this page should be kept because this genre of game is one in its own and deserves its own page. If this page is deleted, Wikipedia has squashed the game as not notworthy enough (being the first and official QPawn) to be noted. All of you who do not feel that this page is notworthy should try it sometime. --Euphoria X 18:18, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Qpawn in by far the best nationsim on the web. The majority of other nationsims have either been inspired from Qpawn or have borrowed many of its fundamental gameplay attributes. It is also worth noting that Qpawn has an unbelievably high activity rating which is not common among nationsims. The reason for this is largely because people find out about Qpawn through wikipedia, which keeps new players coming. Deleting this article would adversely affect the game and unless that is the goal of deleting it there seems to be no reason for doing so.

<li>If you want other sources, fine, but I feel fairly strongly that <b>you</b> need to make a distinction between notability in a community and notability worldwide. I edited a page last night on some cooking website I'd never heard of and didn't see any multitudes of sources for, but the site's been around a long time and it wasn't a vanity article, so I saw no reason to send it to the deletion crew (whether it be speedy, ProD, or AfD), and I've been pretty quick on that particular trigger lately. This is all to say that notability <i>must</i> be relative in the cases of certain genres of websites, music, and so on, or there won't be any mention of any of them on Wikipedia whatsoever. I realize this isn't the place for that discussion, but is that really what you want? At the very least, it should be a <b>Redirect</b> to an article about nation sims, as per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the policy you yourself keep citing as a reason to delete. --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 21:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are wrong. There is no reason to make any such distinction between community fame and wordwide fame, because <b><a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_fame_nor_importance" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">notability is not fame nor importance</a></b>, as you erroneously think it to be. The PNC in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not make any such distinction, and rightly so because it is addressing notability, not fame. The PNC requires multiple non-trivial published works from sources independent of the web site (and its creators/publishers). I've asked for such sources <i>five</i> times, now. If the web site whose article you edited is not the subject of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources, then it too does not warrant an article on Wikipedia.
<p>For this web site, a redirect is only appropriate if, per <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirect_36c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirect">Wikipedia:Redirect</a>, the subject would warrant discussion as a sub-topic within an article with broader scope. But since the only source that has been cited contains 1 sentence's worth of information, if that, there's not even enough source material for a sub-topic. As stated right at the start, for this subject to warrant mention <i>even in an article on nationsims</i>, it has to be shown that it has actually been recorded as a "part of nationsim history" (as claimed). Despite repeated encouragement, neither you nor anyone else has cited a single source to demonstrate that it is, in fact, a part of nationsim history, and that it warrants any mention <i>anywhere</i> in Wikipedia.</p>

<li>Let me start off by saying that you have a <i>very interesting</i> definition of the word notable. Notability is neither fame nor importance? Then what, precisely, <i>is</i> it? <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=notable&amp;i=2&amp;h=000#c" class="external text" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;s=notable&amp;i=2&amp;h=000#c" rel="nofollow">Princeton University</a> seems to disagree with you, by the way. If this is deleted because fame is not notability, maybe I should go AfD <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> or something. After all, what's she done to achieve notability aside from being famous for fame's sake? You basically say on your user page that notability has nothing to do with anything aside from having sources to cite, but then you go on, on that same user page, to list all sorts of things that notability is not, including verifiability, which at first glance seems to fly in the face of notability being nothing more than multitudinous sources.
<p>At the end of the day, Uncle G, three-quarters of the articles on Wikipedia would be gone by a strict reading of your "rules" for notability. While I understand what you have goals and you are trying to make a point, that doesn't necessarily make you right for it.</p>
<p>Lastly, you are flat-out incorrect about what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#_note-1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states.

<dd>I have never really understood the logic of the alum argument. Either schools are notable, sui generis, or they are not, in which case the accidental production of a few notable folks is not germane. Personally, I think schools are not notable, (hence <b>Delete</b>) but we've had these arguments before ad inf. and in the end everyone has agreed to disagree. But the question surely should redound to whether schools, in and of themselves, merit encyclopedic treatment. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 00:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, but I don't see why 'notability can be assumed'. A google search comes up with plenty of trivial mentions of the organisation (in lists of attendees at conferences, directories of charitable organisations, etc.), but no non-trivial, independent sources about it that I can find. The article is pretty clearly an incompletely-wikied dump of some promotional material produced by the organisation itself. What independent, reliable sources are there for wikifying this article? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 22:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is not Original research in any way. Maybe Original documentation, but that doesn't violate any policy! Fine! Do you you want! It's obvious that all of you are stuffy headed, puffed up and arogant. You must have nothing better to do than try and run people off! So here, have your brain stimulating web pages of unimportant babel. You can be sure that before I come back to Wikipedia again I'll make sure I'm a genius like all of you so I can fit in. Because you obviously think that you are SO much smarter than everyone. By all means be as "uncivil" as you like you wont hurt my feelings any!

<dd>Yes, well, fair enough, but there's <i>something</i> written there; and while on first reading I agree with you there's not a great deal of article content, I'd rather have someone who knows a little more than I do about the subject-matter make the call on whether there's anything at all worth integrating before any redirect is implemented and the content is gone. It looks to me like the worthwhile content could be summarized in a sentence or two at most; but a sentence or two isn't quite nothing.... Not a big deal either way. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:52, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's just that this article <i>reeks</i> of vanity. And wouldn't one type in "PC Gamer" before typing "PC Gamer Forum" in the search box? One can't just assume there's an article written on the forum, can they? Anything's possible, but I feel it's unlikely, so a redirect may not be appropriate (it might not hurt, either). <font color="green">—</font><b><a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl"><font color="DarkGray">Ed</font><font color="DarkKhaki">Gl</font></a></b> 02:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
