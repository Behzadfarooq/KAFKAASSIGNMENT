<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was Keep, no consensus to delete. The voting is roughly tied between keep/delete. Throwing out votes simply because of an inclusionist campaign is out of the question. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 07:14, Mar 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. First, that's an argument for consolidation of more Pokemoncruft. Second, I daresay more people have heard of and been affected by Pokemon than Canyon Crest Academy. Their reported pupil:teacher ratio of 34 doesn't suggest a particularly impressive institution, either. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 19:30, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Pupil to teacher ratios are not a valid reason for deletion as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. And it has also been established that you need not have "heard of" something in order for it to be encyclopedic. GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 21:20, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I saw someone driving 85 mph on Route 128 the other day. Is that an argument that Route 128 should have its speed limit raised to 85 mph? Wikipedia is intrinsically inconsistent. The existence of Pokemon articles that should not be in Wikipedia is not an argument for inclusion of other articles that should not be in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:22, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Concur with Dpbsmith. Actually the entire 'Pokemon test' is an argument out of spite, and thus invalid. It actually seems to mean 'there are certain articles on a well-known subject that I find totally ridiculous, i.e. pokemon, and therefore a certain other article should be kept since I don't find it totally ridiculous'. Whether you like Pokemon or not (and frankly, I hate it), it is very very famous and very influential. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:10, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)
