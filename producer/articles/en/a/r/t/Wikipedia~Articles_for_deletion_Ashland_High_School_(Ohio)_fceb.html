<li>Nope, they don't spring up overnight. And they don't spring up overmonth or even overyear. I challenge you to go look at school articles over a year old, and see for yourself how few get much past the stage they originally appeared at. It is clear to me that inclusionists for the most part do not wish to concern themselves with the long-term viability of an article, and instead support the thesis that more is always better. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 02:48, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So what is your point? That the project should shutdown? Every article not completed should get cut? No stubs allowed? Are you advocating a blanket purge of every article that <i>you</i> don't consider viable? For my part, I'm willing to allow editors the requisite time to build these school articles- ten or twenty years if need be. I assume the schools and wikipedia will still be here during that timeframe. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 07:35, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>My, you're good at setting up straw men. But I will take one of your wheat guys and say yes to no stubs for non-notable schools. West Armpit High School will be a one-sentence stub for as many decades as you care to wait, because quite frankly, Jjay, no one gives a beaver's backside about this school except a few of its former students, who probably aren't even aware of Wikipedia's existence, or if they are, couldn't be bothered to improve the article. I am willing to accept school articles which present well as articles, but I have no patience for articles which are half-baked placeholders for maybe maybe something happening down the road. Maybe. This kind of article just makes us look incompetent. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 00:48, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I respect where you stand. In fact, I would agree with you, except that there are no non-notable schools, that is nonsensical nonsense designed to fool the uninitiated. They are all notable, even PS Armpit 157. They are worth many beavers, front and back, cooked and baked. And that even extends to Canadian schools, where beaver, I've heard, may be easier to come by. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:06, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use.
