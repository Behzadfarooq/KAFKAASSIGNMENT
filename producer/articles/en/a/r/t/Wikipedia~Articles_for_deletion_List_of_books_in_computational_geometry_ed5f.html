<li><b>Neutral</b> I'm not a big fan of lists but comprehensive texts on computational geometry are not that abundant so it shouldn't be a problem to have a decent unbiased list.

<li><b>speedy keep</b> We have such lists in every subject This one is a little different, for most of the others have been renamed List of important books, or List of important publications, and objective criteria are given for the listings.

<li><b>Delete</b> This list and all others like it should be included as bibliographies at the end of specific articles. Having a set of articles on various subjects and a separate set of book lists doesn't strike me as being particularly useful for a user of Wikipedia. If I want to know the basics of computational geometry then I'll read the article on it and if I decide to study it further I'll scroll down to the bibliography. Most users would think this way, but would NOT think to go searching Wikipedia for some separate list. As far as "bloating" the articles, I would rather bloat the bottom of some articles than create a bloated and less useful Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalist_6829.html" title="User:Capitalist">capitalist</a> 03:06, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry. Bad idea. "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_geometry.html" title="Computational geometry">Computational geometry</a>" is now in a pitiful, sketchy state. It may be expanded at least 4-5 times. List of books is a separate, detachable topic. What purpose is to bloat an article with it? It is just one click away and its separation does not break the logic of the article in any way. I also intend to expand the list with brief annotations. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 22:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my opinion that "one click" is more of a problem than the "bloat" added to the article (in small print you can list over 30 books on a single screen). Why break with the convention of listing literature relevant to a subject in the article itself? —<i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._Koot_c978.html" title="User:R.

If that list has too many books--that is, if some of them aren't important enough that they should be included in the article to prevent it becoming too large--then the solution is simply not to include every book, but rather only those books which will be particularly useful.

<li>In this particular case all books are quite different in subject coverage. Therefore, like I said, I am going to provide brief annotations for these books. This will considerably bloat the main article. I'd rather suggest this page is <b>already merged</b> articles about <b>separate</b> books. Rephrasing, all these books are <i>notable</i> each in its own aspect, but this domain of knownledge is quite narrow, and it makes sense to see side-by-side comparison of these books, rather than to have them in separate articles, prone for aggression from those who think that only pokemon, porn stars and sexual slang are notable topics. Unfortunately experts in computational geometry do not rush into wikipedia, rather in opposite direction (I did notice several familiar names, who quickly became disinterested in wikipediting) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 20:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From a brief reading of the list and the topics suggested by their titles, it seems to me that several of these books would be appropriate on more specific articles--in particular, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combinatorial_geometry.html" title="Combinatorial geometry">Combinatorial geometry</a> has a separate page, as does <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery_theorems.html" title="Art gallery theorems">Art gallery theorems</a>. The fact that the books differ in coverage then seems (to me) to be because some of them are about different topics which we also have articles for. If that's the case, then those books should be listed on the appropriate articles. It's true that an annotated list of books on a topic is useful, but there's no reason you can't annotate a further reading list. Also, if the books truly are all important (i.e. introduced major theorems or ideas) then they may merit a mention in the main article (in a history section, perhaps) for that reason. At any rate, wikipedia is not paper and there is no reason we can't include all relevant (and verifiable) information, as long as we are careful about the presentation. I just feel that it's more useful to present it on the article rather than in a separate list. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 22:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Providing 'brief annotations' for the books is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Original Research</a>, instead you need to provide 3rd party references stating that these books are the best in their respective fields.

I agree with you, but if I decide to write a detailed report about some book, I will write a separate page about it (and some smartass will probably come and say "WTF, prove that this book is better than the rest or write about all other books, otherwise I delete it because you are POV-pushing"). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 19:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'm advocating merging this into the main article on computational geometry--I don't want any information to be lost, I just think it's better presented along with the subject of the books, where people will see it more readily. Regarding deleting an article about a book: if someone did that, though, they'd probably be wrong. If you wanted to write an article about a book that was actually notable, according to our own guidelines, then the existence of articles on other books has no bearing on this. Their claim may mean we'd have to go through an AfD for the book, but in the end things should work themselves out. I don't think that keeping this article just as a prophylactic measure against future problems is a good idea, though. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 21:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into computational geometry per Ruud's excellent suggestion. With all due appreciation for the valuable expansion of the original skimpy list, article bloat is not an impending problem. After merging we'll have an estimated length of 15K. By the time the article becomes unwieldy because of the envisaged expansions, it is more likely that the remedy is found in spinning off specialized subtopics than in having this list as a separate article (and see also Soporific's suggestion above). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lambiam_2f72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lambiam">contribs</a>).</small></li>
