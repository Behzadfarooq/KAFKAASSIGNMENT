<li><b>Keep</b>: the notability of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Abendroth_5509.html" title="Wolfgang Abendroth">Wolfgang Abendroth</a> is actually pretty obvious judging from his article on the German Wikipedia and the hits I get for his name in an online library catalogue (held professorial chairs at several German universities, finally at Marburg; there are at least two festschrifts dedicated to him, one of them proceedings from a symposium in his name). Opitz (and especially his two-volume work <i>Faschismus und Neofaschismus</i> from 1988) seems to be somewhat important in left-wing German historiography. Regardless of the quality of the current articles, I can't see how these would be less valuable as subjects of articles than the thousands of insignificant baseball and cricket players we have. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 07:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The header struggles from non-native idiom, but the body is fairly useless as a recreation of the lead page/review of a book. The author deserves discussion, but the article is wretched.

<li><b>Keep and Rewrite</b>. It is written in a decent amount on the German wikipedia, so we can definitely expand on the article in the English wikipedia. A total rewrite is needed for the article, and whoever's doing the rewrite should at least know a bit of German, as it seems like 90% of the 200,000+ Google hits on Reinhard Opitz that one could use for research are written in German or in other foreign languages. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 18:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The German article on Abendroth looks fine, and could be the basis for a total rewrite. No fishing of Marxist scholar red herrings over there, thankfully. The one on Opitz is not that great, and does not establish his academic notability that well, though he seems to have a cult. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeibniz_106a.html" title="User:Leibniz">Leibniz</a> 20:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Abendroth was also respected by political opponents. His personal integrety is e. g. documented by beeing a member of the constitutional courts of the German states of Bremen (1949) and Hesse (1959-1963). It seems there is a rough consence on the notability of Abendroth and that the article should be improved on the basis of the German article.

The organization gets meetings with all of the top congressional offices see here <a href="http://bproject.wordpress.com/" class="external free" title="http://bproject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bproject.wordpress.com/</a>. They're also aligned with the United Nations Volunteer Program <a href="http://onlinevolunteering.org/groups/group_home.php?source=self&amp;gp_id=7593" class="external free" title="http://onlinevolunteering.org/groups/group_home.php?source=self&amp;gp_id=7593" rel="nofollow">http://onlinevolunteering.org/groups/group_home.php?source=self&amp;gp_id=7593</a>.</li>

<li>To address the concern of theProject, quite a bit has changed with the Borgen Project since last year. They've launched a massive public awareness campaign by distributing their PSA across the nation (currently 25 whole states). As the previous user noted, they also got meetings with over 40 key congressional offices in July of 2006. Again, it's not a think tank but a player in the process of increasing political attention on international poverty. Please also notice that Clint Borgen (President) is mentioned on the United Nations page and the Borgen Project is cited on the Millennium Goals page. Wikiusa 19:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

We've provided numerous red links that invite folks to add items like 17823 Bartels; perhaps our deletion shold should include discussion with members the community that created <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a>.

<li><b>Speedy delete as G1</b> even if we don't settle the issue of the lists: The "article" is a sentence fragment. One of the reasons that people will delete lists is that they indiscriminately promise article space to thousands of items that might be so unknown by the general world as to be impossible to write about. The secondary issue here is that the List of asteroids article links every single rock.

<p>This is an article which has been around for a while, without ever being fixed up. The term was coined by one man, and the sources which refer to it all appear to mention it as being his term. Of the 100-odd unique Googles, Wikipedia is the leading resource on this subject. This has all the appearances of a one-man neologism, and in the time since I originally tagged it for cleanup it seems to have become less prevalent not more. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 21:35, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article is, as its first paragraph states, about "a theory that music and language have a common ancestor". The article had several references discussing and analysing the co-evolution of music and language from sources <i>other</i> than Steven Brown, including a detailed discussion in <i>a second book by a different author</i>, until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Musilanguage&amp;diff=69276487&amp;oldid=69254684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Musilanguage&amp;diff=69276487&amp;oldid=69254684" rel="nofollow">JzG removed them immediately before nominating the article for deletion</a>. The problem with the article is that it only currently includes material from the first source, not that the theory that it discusses is original research. Deletion is not the way to fix that, nor is removing from the article the sources that can be used to improve it. The objection to this article appears to be based solely upon its use of Steven Brown's word for the theory as its title, rather than upon reading the sources to see whether the co-evolution of language and music has been discussed by people other than Brown. <i>That's a simple matter of article naming conventions.</i> The way to fix the article is to round it out with the discussions from the <i>other</i> sources on the relationship between music and language, including the <i>New Scientist</i> article, not to delete it. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

There are works by Bickerton, Cross, Dissanayake, Falk, Fernald, Geissmann, Hauser &amp; McDermott, Huron, Miller, and Todd that all appear to have relevance to the subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, you didn't. <i>You removed two articles from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>, some university degree course material, an article by <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Fink_3972.html" title="Bob Fink">Bob Fink</a>, and a book.</i>
<p>It may or may not be the most common name for an article about a theory of the co-evolution of music and language, <i>but that is a simple matter of naming conventions, not deletion</i>. To warrant deletion, it would have to be established either that this article is unverifiable or that such a theory has not progressed beyond its creators. The many works on this subject from several authors, both in the article and in the references section that I point to earlier, belie both of those. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I certainly don't want to pick a fight with you here. I am happy to concede that the <i>concept</i> may be significant, but the <i>title</i> gives undue weight to one man's name for it. What should it be called, and how widely is the theory accepted among subject experts? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't think that you were trying to pick a fight. ☺ We're having a perfectly fine discussion about the provenances and depths of sources — the proper study of encyclopaedists. I've actually been thinking along the same lines as you appear to be. This article is clearly too narrowly focussed, including material from only one source. (One of my motivations for adding the other sources to the article in the first place was the hope that an editor would expand its scope.) But we don't need to delete it to fix that. A merger, along with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Origins_of_Music_e50b.html" title="The Origins of Music">The Origins of Music</a></i> (another article that really is too narrow in scope to stand alone) into <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_musicology.html" title="Evolutionary musicology">evolutionary musicology</a> seems to be the best course of action. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:10, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I agree that libraries are very important, and if this is the only library that serves that city, then I agree it should be included. However, if it is one branch of all the city's libraries, I do not think that if a library is just one branch out of several in a city that every branch should be included (see <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio_Public_Library_6596.html" title="San Antonio Public Library">San Antonio Public Library</a>). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 21:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Commment</b> That's a good point that you make. A post office is also very important to a community, and yet, not every one has an article. It seems to me as though its a bit of hypocrisy within the wikipedia community in that schools merely need to be verified as existing in order to get an article, while everything else has to be verified <b>and</b> notable. I do not think that being verifiable also confers notability, which is apparently what many people believe. I have a big problem with the inclusion of every school just as long as you can verify that it exists. I believe that schools should only be included if they are notable for some reason. See <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. But concensus among wikipedians and apparent precedent states that all schools are notable. While I strongly disagree with that, I alone cannot change wikipedian policy or guidelines. If all schools deserve an article, then at least the main library serving a city is important enough to deserve an article. And maybe even the post office serving the community... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill381796_4c9a.html" title="User:Will381796">will381796</a> 22:32, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You asked what on this list could not be represented by a category, "sequels and related works", and "name variations" are exactly the kind of thing lists do well and categories do badly. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now, I remember where I've seen your name... You're the editor who de-prods everything. Lists do them just as badly. There was a redlink on the Anime list for Cyber City Oedo. The article was named <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber_City_Oedo_808_9ca4.html" title="Cyber City Oedo 808">Cyber City Oedo 808</a>. Most name variations are not important--they'll come up in a search as name variations are supposed to be linked and require redirects to be made. Entries are often made to these lists with no research or searching of the wiki for prior articles what-so-ever. If there is something particularly in need of a variation, the redirect can be categorized. Anime is an extraordinarily well covered topic on Wikipedia--converting these vanilla lists in to categories is no detriment to the wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 19:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Surely making them less vanilla then would be far better than simply deleting them?

<li><b>Comment</b>: This category would have never been populated without a list like this (that's exactly what happened by the way). <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord CyberSkull</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 23:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>So the list served its purpose and now must move on to a higher existence. Wikipedia is constantly changing, and articles that were useful once are superceded by other articles, categories, and so on. This isn't the first article to have this happen, and it likely won't be the last. As for whether or not a Tokyopop category could have been populated without this list, that's just absurd. Plenty of categories haave been populated without a list existing beforehand. Certainly, the list made it easier to populate the category, but that doesn't mean it would have been impossible to do so without the list. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 23:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There's a claim of 23 novellas at <a href="http://www.allsf.net/Autrauteurs/G/Gotschalk.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allsf.net/Autrauteurs/G/Gotschalk.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> - a small number of these seem verifiable via Google. If he were actually the author of a book, and many short stories as well, then that would seem enough to keep him - verifiability is an issue though. But I don't see his single book as intrinsically notable enough to keep it. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Not sure about this one but the arguments given here are way too weak to convince me. 99 unique Ghits strikes me as not so bad for an author who wrote in the 1970s. Similarly, the Amazon rank is of course extremely low since it relates to current sales (which are naturally horribly low for a 30 year old sci-fi book). The fact that the author's short stories are indeed part of anthologies sounds to me like an indication of (arguably limited) notoriety. 82.231.209.148 18:10, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable author. Only claim to notability is the book (apparently based on a blog) "Four and Twenty Blackbirds," which has an amazon.com SalesRank of 292,540.

The author has two more books in the series forthcoming from Tor as well as inclusion in anthologies and forthcoming work from publishers such as Subterranean Press. FOUR AND TWENTY BLACKBIRDS was not "based on" a blog; rather, the author used a blog as a working tool in its composition. The author is a known and up-and-coming presence in the speculative fiction field. elizabethgenco 06:41, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> From what Alistair explained to me, <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lulu.com.html" title="Lulu.com">Lulu.com</a> is <i>capbale</i> of being used as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a> but (being expensive for bulk orders) they coudln't possibly be making the majority of their profits in that manner. They should therefore be considered a self-publisher. (a1Octopus - sorry didn't realise I wasn't logged in).

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm also editing the Caffeine article, and am a big fan of the stuff. But personally I don't think an article about a <i>book</i> about caffeine is any more a POV fork than an article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_bc7c.html" title="The Last Temptation of Christ">The Last Temptation of Christ</a> is a POV fork to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bible_5d21.html" title="The Bible">The Bible</a>. Not to put too fine a point on it.&#160;:-) It's not a matter of whether or not people <i>believe</i> caffeine is harmful; if we delete the article because we disagree with the POV of the book we are deleting it for the wrong reasons. The issue is whether it can be proven to be notable. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 07:31, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, that is true, article about non notable murder victim. So it should be deleted. Crime itself might be notable. So new article need to be written. If this article is about crime - then title is wrong and completely misleading.

<dd>Survivor has 16 contestants a season; Jeopardy! has over 400. Minor contestants on Jeopardy! do not get thrust into the public limelight; minor contestants on Survivor are.

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Most contestants on traditional game shows like Jeopardy receive a lot less public attention than most contestants on reality shows like Survivor; there are a few exceptions but Westphal does not appear to be one of them. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:45, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>That sounds like the very definition of systemic bias. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 18:10, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. Both Survivor and Jeopardy! are U.S. television shows and accessible to the same viewers. But the content of Survivor is much more focused on the personalities of the contestants relative to Jeopardy!, which focuses more on the answers/questions, which is why more Survivor contestants get asked to appear on other television shows or appear in movies than Jeopardy! contestants. If we had articles about contestants on Survivor but refused to include articles about contestants on Chinese reality shows of similar relative popularity, that would be <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:35, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps then, this has more to do with the difference beween notability and importance. Presumably the first contestant to get voted off the sunny island of [wherever] appears in one, maybe two, episodes, and doesn't win a penny, yet somehow he's more culturally significant than a 5-time Jeopardy champion? Maybe so, but it ain't right. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 00:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Technically, all <i>Survivor</i> contestants are supposed to get a consolation prize in increasing value from the time they were voted off (wish I could say the same for <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Got_Talent_89ff.html" title="America's Got Talent">America's Got Talent</a></i>), but, of course, that's beside the point. One reason I voted this article for deletion was because there seems to be no precedent for including articles about Jeopardy! non-tournament winners and minor record holders.

<p>Weird article about a young mexican engineer.

The references given in the article barely mention his name.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - I had stepped away from my computer for lunch only to see that during my brief break, the article had reached a no consensus for an AfD, and that it was being resubmitted for deletion, all within a span of 46 minutes. While I will do my best to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, it is very hard to accept that this is not just another attempt to undo an AfD that just failed. As with the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Schilling_5e6a.html" title="Sue Schilling">Sue Schilling</a> AfD, can I politely suggest that as a genuine show of good faith this AfD be withdrawn and that a period of time — say several weeks or a few months — be allowed after the rejected AfD to allow the article sufficient time to be improved to allow the article to better meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> concerns. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> No consensus was reached, and no effort has really been made to improve the article. The article as it is has been that way since March. That's plenty of time. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 20:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - In addition to addressing the other 4,500 articles on my watchlist, and dealing with this and other AfD's, I have not had the opportunity to improve these articles. I had hoped to do so after the AfD was complete, but I was not around in the 38 minute period (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">check article history</a>) before your new AfD was created. I had attempted to contact the author of the article by leaving a message on his talk page, which went unanswered, there was no email address available and the user's last edit was in March 2006. I will as respectfully as possible ask yet one more time for a simple demonstration of good faith by requesting that this AfD be withdrawn to allow sufficient time to address the concerns you have raised and bring it up to your standards. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, Indeed; if the original nomination of this article was bundled with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joe_Kelly_%28Freeholder%29_2dcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Atlantic_County_Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_5bca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>, it is more than likely that the outcome of the previous discussion for this article would have been "keep" instead of "no consensus". In any event, good editors who are part of a WikiProject intend to expand this article and deserve a reasonable period of time to do so.

<li><b>Comment</b> The 'keep' for Joe Kelly is based on the results of a google search, none of which was brought up in either the AfD or the article in question. I therefore have reason to doubt the verdict of the AfD as entirely valid. The other two were not ruled 'keep', so I take the 'no consensus' as no decision. The articles in question still do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The keep arguments are based on the rapid renomination, and not on the merits of the articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 16:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> Those who qualify as notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are "Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature". The subject is a county official, and as I understand it is not even remotely close to that and would appear not to satisfy the criterion above, notwithstanding articles covering those holding similar positions who have survived AfD. There appear to be few other critera for his inclusion as notable. What is more, it appears that the sbject was not elected but merely appointed to fill a vacancy. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The additions to the page are still local positions that do not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A <i>county</i> officeholder does not meet the standards for political office, and there has still not been any assertions of notability beyond the local offices or 'significant press coverage' that would rise to the standards set forth in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The keep arguments are for the timing of the renomination.

<li>Why would you delete this because "someone related to the subject" wrote this? This article is based on facts. The links where placed because one of the Wikipedia admins asked to reference the facts. I can take the links out again. This page is as important as for example Squidoo - which is in Wikipedia for a long time. I guess you are not related to the art world. ArtByUs.com is a key art auction site on the Internet.

<li>I was just reading through the rules. They say: "A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." With artiicles and reports on TV, newspapers, magazines and business journals, this should fit. By now, all the "vanity" is also deleted. --Ptogel 17:42, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

I tried to clean it up by taking out some of the more vanity-laden parts. (It was touching that the author included a letter to the founder of the company from George W. Bush for example). <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 17:45, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just so you know, I am the the #2 fastest 400-yard sprinter from the 1977 Grade Three class at Dibble Elementary School in Jackson, Michigan. That's notable? Looking at Alexa.com <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.artbyus.com/#top" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=3m&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=r&amp;url=http://www.artbyus.com/#top" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> it actually appears that Artbyus.com is the #1 art auction site now (maybe thanks to spam linking), but the site is averaging maybe 10-12 visitors PER MILLION.

<li>I didn't say I thought Norman Technologies should have been deleted, and I didn't say Artbyus in its original form was good. One mistake doesn't justify others to establish a pattern. The issues behind NT are what led me here to clean up this article. I'd say it's <b>hard</b> for people close to a subject to be able to write an NPOV article.

<p>This unsourced article was originally blanked with an edit summary indicating it was a hoax. I reverted that and the editor indicated to me that it really is a hoax but apparently does not know the workings of the deletion process. A problem here is that the article has been up for about nine months and a google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dinlas+aphrodite&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=dinlas+aphrodite&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> reveals many sites with the information. As far as I can tell all of those sites fork the information from this article or from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Greek_mythological_figures_6beb.html" title="List of Greek mythological figures">List of Greek mythological figures</a> where the name was added in by an ip whose only edit was that addition (see this diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Greek_mythological_figures&amp;diff=29244502&amp;oldid=29014559" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Greek_mythological_figures&amp;diff=29244502&amp;oldid=29014559" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>).</p>

<p>Of course it could be that this list of 7 published papers dating back 15 years found in seconds by a search on the keywords "Bayesian regret" (several authors explicitly having included that in their keywords lists), is not sufficient evidence that the term is widely used. Perhaps it is necessary to provide an explicit list of 100 papers for that purpose. Since your standards are so incredibly high.</p>
<p>The idea probably dates back to Bayes himself, though I have not checked. It is quite amazing to me how self-appointed experts at wikipedia simply proclaim, without ever checking or citing a damned thing and without ever giving any specific argument whatever, that terms are "widely used" or not, or that articles are "original research" or whatever.

This is homunq, the article author, again. It is true that the references Smith gives are based on the separate (but clearly related) use of the two terms. (Also, he has no reason to complain about not being contacted, as I contacted him.) But Uncle G's references, now mentioned in the article, use them together.</p>
<p>My own position is that the single original Smith article, while clearly biased in its presentation, is a solid advancement of the field, and notable in its own right. All the other references, put together, only at best use the two terms together in a way that is more-or-less clear from their meaning separately, as such the joint term would barely merit a definition, let alone an encyclopedia entry. Yet the term's use as a voting-system criterion which, unlike other criteria in use, occupies an important position in between objective mathematical criteria and ill-defined subjective ones, in my opinion deserves a short entry. Nobody is claiming the article isn't NPOV or that it lacks references.

<dd>I assume you are talking about the Smith pdf listed in the references. Since fwict it isn't even published yet, we can't even assess its impact via citation search. It is simply not our our job to assess the importance of a scientific contribution ourselves, that clearly falls under <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. It is our job to verify whether the contribution had an impact via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">outside sources</a>.

<dd>Miniclip.com hosts hundreds of games. While having a game on it isn't 'trivial' in the way that having a game on Newgrounds is, being on Miniclip clearly isn't intrinsically notable. We don't need articles on Ride the Rapids or Sudoku, to name a couple on their front page. On the other hand, some of their games may stand out, in the way that <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> obviously does, and the way to demonstrate that is by showing that Club Penguin has received external coverage to a similar degree. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 10:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A slew of Iranian footballers (or footballers who play in one Iranian team). Originally correctly marked as speedy A7 - the articles do not assert an notability beyond the fact that they play football - but both AfD and DRV in the past has had questions about whether playing for a national league team = notability or not.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. If they play at a national league level, they are notable. Iran's league is professional. Therefore, there is no reason to believe it is somehow substandard. In fact by saying so, it is an unfair judgement on the Iranian league. Don't just delete stuff because it is a one-line article.

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> The article itself needs to be taken out behind the woodshed and shot (No, inside humor is <i>not</i> appropriate on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is and shall always be on the outside looking in (sniff)), but there DOES appear to be a pretty active community on the site itself (there are literally hundreds of thousands of posts).

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree it needs to be edited but the site is one of the last active MR2 sites for info worldwide, and maybe the only active one left that is mainly centered about the MR2s in America.

<li><b>KEEP</b> The article isn't that great, yet, but the subject matter, <a href="http://SpyderChat.com" class="external text" title="http://SpyderChat.com" rel="nofollow">SpyderChat.com</a>, is very noteworthy, as mentioned above by Mwmorph. Of the MR2 sites that have high traffic that I have managed to find, SC is the most encompassing site. Others are centered around particular geographic regions, byt SpyderChat is global. They have members and very active posters there from across the USA, the UK, many European countries (Greece, Finland, Spain, and more) and Asian countries (Thailand, Japan, etc.) as well. I grant that the article needs a major overhaul. I will take on part of the mantle for that now that I am aware of the WikiNeed.

<li>Same could be said of almost any article. Why read about IBM here when you can go to IBM.com and see for yourself? And Spyderchat is not the only MR2 forum, just (possibly) the largest, longest-running and/or most encompassing. ALL of Wikipedia is available from other sources.

<li><b>comment</b> So why don't you each make an edit to the piece and put your efforts into that? Wiki needs content not deletions.

<dd><b>comment</b>Looks like all the censors are out en mass on this one. What's important to me is that factual and intersting information gets published regardless how bad it makes people look. An encyclopedia is worthless if it only publishes positive rose coloured information. The world is a ying/yang and the good and evils need to be equaly documented and recorded as factual information. All this POV pushing serves no good purpose.--Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">The Humble</span> Woo 02:47, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have an issue with government officials that you continue to try and contest in entries here. Your point of view is obvious. If you have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">PUBLISHED SOURCES</a> to put behind your claims, then dandy. If you do NOT have published sources, then you are pushing original research, and you are failing to follow <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>, and your articles, edits, etc. will continue to be adjusted by people who are adhering to policy. This definition of prequalification is very much a negative approach, and the title is poor; if you're going to do a serious article about this, it should be under 'prequalification,' it should have actual reliable sources linked into the article, it should be written in the [[WP:MOS|proper style[[ and should not be an immediately negative article.

<dd><b>comment</b> Thanks for the excelent advice and constructive input. But I thought Wiki was a collaborative project where everyone with information and ability to contribute would participate in writting up interesting articles to expand the knowledge of readers of the world. Judging from all the interest in this topic "Prequalification" It obviously merits a great article with plenty of details and cites and all. I started it off based on experience and knowledge. I added the expand tag to invite editors with interest in expanding knowledge to pitch in and edit it. Do you all expect me to rewrite Wiki all by myself? If there was any integrity in these peoples concern with the article one would expect efforts to reword, cite and expand...and not the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_6caf.html" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> looking to burn this witch at the stake for fear it might result in an informative article on an important subject of great pubic interest.--Wiki <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">The Humble</span> Woo 04:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

The subject is a major party candidate for the highest position in the State government of Nebraska. He has received considerable Nebraska news coverage, and is an active and visible candidate. The article on the <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska_gubernatorial_election%2C_2006.html" title="Nebraska gubernatorial election, 2006">Nebraska gubernatorial election, 2006</a> exists, and now the notable candidates deserve inclusion in Wikipedia. There exists enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on the candidate which will be proved if the article is allowed to exist for long enough for one to be written. The fact that another person has attempted to fill the hole seems evidence that there is enough interest for the article to exist. This is not an ad for the candidate. I have no affiliation with the candidate. I am simply interested in Nebraska politics and wish there were more information available on Wikipedia about the major players. I plan on flushing out the entries on both the major candidates in this race to help push them beyond stub status. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienmercy_7510.html" title="User:Alienmercy">Alienmercy</a> 01:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The first article's author was User:Hahnfornebraska, and the content was copied from the campaign website, so that hardly demonstrated any interest by anyone other than Mr. Hahn's campaign staff. Being a candidate does not, in itself, make someone notable; being elected does. Wikipedia is not a voters' guide. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 01:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand being a candidate for office does not necessarily make someone notable, but I truly believe this candidate is. Regardless of what happened before, I am an outside observer who can maintain neutrality. I realize that Wikipedia is not a voter guide, but there are many similar articles on governor, senate, and congressional candidates currently out there that I read out of interest. Most of the currently contested gubernatorial election have articles on the serious challengers. The other major contested statewide race in Nebraska this year is the senate election. The challenger, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Ricketts_5020.html" title="Pete Ricketts">Pete Ricketts</a>, has a stub which was considered for deletion and was kept. What is the difference between the two? Can any political challengers be considered notable? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienmercy_7510.html" title="User:Alienmercy">Alienmercy</a> 01:57, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Pete Ricketts' article was Proposed for Deletion, a process which anyone can contest and cancel. No one ever pursued a full deletion nomination like this one. No way to know what the result would have been. To answer your question, generally (in my opinion) only challengers who receive significant news coverage outside their state or district would be considered notable. I would also note that, despite being of opposite parties, both Ricketts and Hahn are considered almost guaranteed losers to popular incumbents. Would you still consider either one notable come November 8? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:10, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In fact, I do believe a loser can be notable. My own anecdotal interests are all I have, but I like to read about election history, and the losers contribute to that history. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to see any of those other articles delted, but why has this one been singled out for deletion where so many others in similar situations have not? It seems that there was outside opposition to the last deletion of the article, so I fail to see where the consensus for deletion is. If a significant portion of Wikipedia readers are interested in this article's continued existence, what is the problem? No one is forced to read this article, and I think a borderline case ought to be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienmercy_7510.html" title="User:Alienmercy">Alienmercy</a> 02:25, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This time of year, articles on candidates are coming through AFD all the time (a new one was nominated about ten minutes ago). I'm sure huge numbers get missed as well. This one was not targeted in particular, except insofar as I still had the title on my watch list from the last AFD. A loser <i>can be</i> notable, not necessarily <i>is</i> notable. Will this one be? He'll be a good sport, run a clean, sincere campaign, and concede graciously on election night. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:30, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

You are certainly aware of it as you were the first to cite him as an example in the discussion of the first deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A major party candidate for a governor's seat is notable. Not always; in a state almost completely ruled by a single party with a sacrificial lamb, any old person can get the party's nomination. However, in this case, the guy had other people challenging for the nomination, and looks like he's trying to mount a credible campaign (even if he isn't going to win due to demographics, he's making an earnest try for it, apparently). I would recommend fixing the problems with the article and not arguing that it needs to be deleted because an article was deleted before. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 10:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>: This is wrong as a matter of principle. Lists complement categories, and both should exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> - From Spencer in New York - Robert Pelton's work is extremely valuable to the world of journalism. Ideas and observations made outside of the corporate news entities are slowly becoming a thing of the past and less and less available to those of us that look to independent journalism to inform us on what is really happening in the world. The "non-sexy, in vogue" stories, issues, and places in need of our attention are what Mr. Pelton has made a career of focusing on and illuminating through his books, articles, and reports. Deleting his entry from Wikipedia, is fully contrary to what Wikipedia is about; a site based around the idea of community, the ideal of which as described by its founder as, "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing," - <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Spencerpost (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Spencerpost_5b36.html" title="Special:Contributions/Spencerpost">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP!!!</b> Y'all gotta be kiddin me, thats the best most clinical author's profile in 5 paragraphs I've ever read replete with links to the author's works with in-depth coverage. Where's the beef about self-seeking promotion? I sure aint seein any. Haint it Wikipedia SOP to include profiles of world famous, award winning authors complete with links that refer to their works? And if Wiki-wackos start editing and messing it up, dont worry because commonwealth opinion will prevail and clip whatever junk gets added on. Otherwise y'all are crazy to throw out the baby with the bathwater here, Robert Pelton is easily one of the most influential writers of our time...... says me, Yorickentucky</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The entry seems fine to me. A photograph would be good and the last paragraph needs re-arranging too. Young-Pelton is probably the most prominent and respected author in this field. Although it'd be fair to say that his Televised and journalistic pieces aren't to the same standard of the likes of the BBC's John Simpson, the books he has published are much more encyclopedic rather than subjective reportage... all of this is nicely captured in the entry, although - as i say - it's a bit messy at the moment.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have read several of Pelton's books and find them to be informative, entertaining, perceptive and humane. His web site "black flag cafe" has proven to be a very valuable source of information and contacts in re my travel to non-traditional destinations. The sincerety of RYP in providing relevant and valuable information and topical discussion is beyond question. He is a man who "walks the walk" and better yet encourages and motivates others to do the same. submitted by: Charlotte</li>

<p>While Jim Bob Duggar may be noteworthy having been a former legislator, his family is not. None of them have established any relevance of encyclopedic nature, and while such a large family is rare, it is not unique or unprecedented.

Being on several television programs could constitute the multiple external sources needed to be notable. if the Duggars are the feature of the programs. However, the article is filled with minutiae from their daily lives and does not answer the question "Why should I care about the subject?" If the only source is the television programs it is unlikely to be expanded/fixed unless a WP editor happens to catch a rerun of the program.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the list obviously has information that would not be convienent in a category.

<li><b>Comment</b>- If this is a "vanity article", so are some about men in mathematics, too. How abour R.M. Dudley, Mark Pinsky, Don Knuth -- all great mathematicians, and the articles deserve to be there. If this is a "vanity article", why not wipe out all articles about the men, too? And the few women, too? I wanted to add bios on other female (and male) mathematicians, but are they all "vanity" articles. I already voted "keep", so this is just a comment. I will quit Wikipedia forever and there will be no more bios on any mathematician, scientist, or statistician from me again...you are not well-informed about mathematics, science, and statistics, or else you are a bunch of bullies who want to control Wikipedia. So, I was planning to write a bio on Paul Halpern (physicist and author), James Pierce (bioinformaticist), Linda Zhao (statistician), and others, but you would call them "vanity articles". <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathStatWoman_4206.html" title="User:MathStatWoman">MathStatWoman</a> 18:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Please stay on topic</b>. Whether or not women are under-represented in math does not matter for our purposes. Just having a job (even if that job is "mathematician") is nowhere near enough to warrant an article. However, clearly some academics are of encyclopedic significance. I don't see enough here to decide either way, yet- the article needs serious improvement. I wish we'd given it time to improve without the pressure of Afd, but that ship has sailed. <s>My opinion is <b>keep</b> for now to give the article time to develop- if later we're still not satisfied of the verifiable significance of this person, we could delete it then. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:53, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</s> Upon further thought, we need demonstrable notability now in order to keep the article now.

Does anybody search for this person? Does anybody search Google for this person? Who would want to know what her dissertation is? Has she significantly contributed to the field?

<li>No offence, but this seems to be a combination of mis-reading and unsupported assertion. She is <i>not</i> currently in-charge of a notable organization.

This role is not defined; certainly "assistant to the Executive Director" would be notable (see my notes on the Talk page. There is no evidence that any of the "Awards" are particularly notable, or that any of her publications are "significant and well-known", etc., etc. Speaking as someone who hit the wall with college calculus, I applaud her as a successful mathematician, academic, and contributor to human knowledge, but that does not require an encyclopedic article. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:25, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I searched on ISI Web of Knowledge (author finder, RS Wenocur); this showed just 3 papers, only one of which was cited more than once - her paper in DISCRETE MATHEMATICS 33 (3): 313-318 1981 is given as having 45 citations which is a very strong showing for this field. However, I don't see a strong case for notability as a mathematician. No doubt she's a good mathematician, but I really think we have to be very parsimonious with biographies of living people. Yes there are relatively few female mathematicians, and in a few years there might be rather few male biologists; an article on gender and mathematics might be interesting, and maybe that's the way to address this as an issue <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGleng_c015.html" title="User:Gleng">Gleng</a> 14:42, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Correction</b> the above user has made a <b>factual error</b> because:<br />
<b>1).</b> User has wrongly used the incorrect and shortened name;<br />
<b>2).</b> has failed to combine the results from the different searches that need to be done - Name could be "Daniel Wagner Associates", "Daniel H. Wagner, Associates" with the comma, "Daniel H. Wagner Associates", without the comma, "Daniel H. Wagner Associates Inc." with the Inc or incorporated; etc, etc and also a close check on "Daniel Wagner" and "Daniel H. Wagner". I get over <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=%22Daniel+H.+Wagner+Associates%22&amp;btnG=Search|" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=%22Daniel+H.+Wagner+Associates%22&amp;btnG=Search|" rel="nofollow">700 hits</a> with just "Daniel H.

<li><b>Correction</b> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> has made a <b>factual error</b> because Google searches search on text only. Commas are ignored. Therefore searching for "Daniel H. Wagner, Associates" will return exactly the same results as searching for "Daniel H. Wagner Associates". Adding "Inc" onto the end will only bring up results that were already returned in the search for the shorter string.

A marge into something like <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fundamentalism.html" title="Islamic fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalism</a> might be a good idea, but there's plenty to be said about subject of young muslim men becoming radicalised and taking on an extreme worldview in which <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> simply means "unconditional war". <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddenface_dcff.html" title="User:Middenface">Middenface</a> 23:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not an adjective. It's a noun (per the article, at least). If it were an adjective it would be the wrong title for the article per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28adjectives%29_835b.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (adjectives)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (adjectives)</a>, by the way. And the best response to the claim that something is a dictionary definition is not "It's an adjective." but "This isn't a dictionary article about the word 'jihadi'. It's an encyclopaedia article about a type of person, and can be more than a perpetual stub encyclopaedia article.". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>

<p>I hope this is the right place to rebut this...</p>
<p>How is this not "verifiable"? Yes, you're right, e-feds are a dime a dozen, but not e-feds such as the PWA. It's massive, with a total roster of over 60 people, it's read by thousands of people a day. It's on the forums for the number one wrestling news site on the internet. This isn't some piddly little organization put on by a group of 13 year olds.</p>
<p>It's an entire community of people. If you don't believe me, read it for yourself. www.lopforums.com</p>
<p>I don't see what is so wrong about sharing all of this information with the general public.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is indeed the place for rebuttals. If you can include the sources required under the verifiability policy that I linked to above (and that is in the statement right below the edit box), as well as show us how the site fits under the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">Website guidelines</a>, then I'm sure other editors will give it thought. My view is that e-feds, like 99 percent of fan produced works, roleplay groups and similar fan-created products, are not encyclopedic, and that's why my vote above. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 18:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
