<p><b>Delete</b> This is a bunch of mostly-unrelated summaries of several different other articles, and seems to have no redeeming content of its own at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> What have you got against this article Mike? The international coverage the said films have received proves that they are notable and are a valid addition to Wikipedia.

<p>Originally I proposed this game for deletion due to no evidence of notability and since the website of the creators has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.bay12games.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.bay12games.com/" rel="nofollow">no Alexa rank</a>. The author of the article removed the tag. I must say in his favour that he did attempt to explain that: He argued that Alexa is not a fair measure and that I should have used Google or Yahoo instead, which I did: 783 total <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a>, of these 33 unique ones; <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" rel="nofollow">Yahoo</a> gave a total of over 1000 hits, but only 62 unique ones. (I also tried Altavista, with a <a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?q=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" class="external text" title="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?q=%22Liberal+Crime+Squad%22" rel="nofollow">similar result</a>.) He also said that it is listed in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_controversial_games.html" title="List of controversial games">List of controversial games</a> (where an unregistered User:67.190.124.84 added it); well, in order for a game to be controversial, it should have caused a controversy - am I wrong? You'll have to do much better to persuade me that the game is notable; until then, my vote remains <b>delete</b>. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 00:51, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This may not be a real production company, but it is a real thing. It is a name that we put our movies under. All the movies listed are real and have been made. Check it out and see at the Myspace address. They are pretty funny and entertaining. This should be kept because we are entering a movie into a local film festival.

<li><b>Question</b> sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, feel free to post on my talk page any answers. What is notable about a judge? Being English I have no idea what the difference is between a federal or state district judge, much less why either of them should be notable. I cant see any reason I would do a biography on anybody working at Harrogate Crown Court for example....

<dd><b>Reply</b> I don't think there is a set policy on judges. State judges can be notable and Federal judges can be obscure. But your state district court judge is going to be more likely to have your run-of-the-mill cases like car theft, assault and the occasional murder. Sometimes state judges like <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Ito_cf8e.html" title="Lance Ito">Lance Ito</a> become quite notable because of a notable trial, <a href="../../../o/j/_/OJ_Simpson_4efb.html" title="OJ Simpson">OJ Simpson</a> for instance. A Federal judge requires you to get a Presidential appointment, which can end up becoming political, and you also get a shot at constitutional issues. If someone could point out a case with major implications that Judge Rice presided over, that would change my opinion. So as in everything here at Wikipedia, it's very subjective, for me I like a rule of thumb. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 02:19, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even district court judges are notable within a state legal system. Plus, different states have different titles for "district": for example while at the federal level districts are the lowest tier and circuit courts are the appellate branch, in the state of florida circuit courts are the original jurisdiction courts and district courts are appelate branches. Anyway, it grants him notability. I do have to say however, all Federal Judges are notable as they receive their appointments from the president of the united states. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 06:42, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article that gives an overview about wrongful and disputed convictions in a particular state is valid.</p>
<p>One commentter says the article is "Pure soapbox, from the article title on down. Irredeemably POV." He is free to take issue with particular cases. Because of DNA evidence, the government admits to falsely convicting over 170 innocent people in recent years. Is it POV to accept the government's opinion? Only a small percentage of cases involve DNA evidence, so obviously a large number of other innocent people have presumably been convicted. That is reality, so accept it. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 03:47, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notwithstanding what I expect is agreement betwixt us apropos of conviction errors and the like, it should be noted that even a collection of altogether factual information can present POV problems, but that, even assuming arguendo that the pages you've created are written from an altogether neutral point-of-view, they still fail WP:NOT. Notably, your pages, inasmuch as they are simple aggregations of ostensible wrongful convictions/punishments (and concomitant weblinks), seem to be "repositor[ies] of links" and "indiscriminate collection[s] of information". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:52, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> The links on the pages can be removed. They are there for documentation purposes, but they are not needed for any questions about accuracy can be resolved with user web searches. The links are not there to advertise particular sites. Perhaps only a few general links should be listed at the end in an external links section. The supposedly "indiscriminate collection[s] of information" is highly organized by county and date. People are more interested in what happens in or near their home county than they are in highly discriminate intellectual distinctions. Of course there needs to be more state listings and perhaps other national listings as well. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 04:41, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Coughs</b>, c'mon Carlton. To clarify that. The goal of the project is for encyclopedic research. To include such an article is to verify the claims for research preferences.

With that said, i'm changing my vote to <b>weakly neutral</b>; on closer inspection, as you point out, it is NOT a list of three letter english words, but rather three letter combinations of letters that are theoretically possible to pronounce as a word, suffixes and prefixes from other languages like "psi", non-words such as <a href="../../../c/0/2/C02.html" title="C02">c02</a> (which is a redlink as C-zero-two rather than <a href="../../../c/o/2/CO2_05f3.html" title="CO2">CO2</a>) . . .

<li>Thanks for coming back to discuss this. I'm nominating the article <i>as it stands</i> and as I see it with little prospect of improvement into a useful encyclopedic article. Of course if it <i>were</i> to be massively cleaned up whilst the debate is in progress (and perhaps given a new name, as it wouldn't be just a context-free list) I may well reconsider. For now I have it firmly in the class "listcruft".

<p>Supposedly some really terrible game. There are no links to <i>professional</i> reviews. There was previously a link to a forum thread, which of course isn't exactly a reliable source in proving this game to be notorious for poor quality.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> this "innovation" sounds and looks identical to kaleidoscopic and prismatic multi-image filter systems - as have been in use and production for decades. It certainly is not called "montography".

Now, every flight mechanic around the world takes an ice cooler to work during summer.</dd>
<dd>With a little help of the Unitarian Universalist Church of America, I was instrumental in stopping the Soviet Union from initiating an ICBM attack on America during President Ronald Reagan's administration.</dd>
<dd>If you ask Louis Freeh, President Clinton's FBI Director, I was the first Astrologer to pinpoint the source of the 9/11/01 attack to an area east of Kabul (using Astro*Carto*Graphy).</dd>

<li>So, I was hallucinating when every flight mechanic and supply staff member, at Altus Air Force Base, came to by Budget Office to shake my hand to thank me? Sad you don't have anything meaningful in your life to recount. Other than hiding behind a keyboard, have any of you little boys made a serious effort to validate my claims? Have you checked the archives of the Unitarian Church? Have you called Louis Freeh? Have you read the article in The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists written by an American general and an American admiral stating that the closest America ever came to receiving a first-strike with nuclear weapons was during Ronald Reagan administration in the early 1980s?

<li>The ice thing did it for you? Just speaking personally, I was a little skeptical about whether Mr. Homer averted nuclear war with the USSR.

<li>What is truly amazing is that even while saving the world and making so many other contributions to humanity, Mr. Homer still manages to be the man to see if you want to buy real estate in the Albuquerque area.

<li>I can't tell whether you are saying it is or is not copyrighted.

<dd>Clarification - The name stems from a sensationalistic Scientific American article. The "law" itself is based on two data samples - what data density was many years ago and what it is now, and it doesn't fit any other range of data, particularly the last several years. The use of the name is very small, leading me to believe that Wikipedia is the primary source of the information for people using it. I could concievably publish a column in a respectable newspaper entitled "Bush's law," that the second president in a dynasty's administration always end horribly, based on George W Bush. But I would be ignoring John Quincy Adams, I would be coining a neologism, and so it would be wrong for Wikipedia to write an article about it, particularly one that mistakenly alleges that W is not the son of Barbara. Correcting that misrepresentation would not fix the article. Placing it under "American Political Dynasties" might. Likewise, renaming this to 'Hard drive areal density growth,' along with analysis, while too dry for a SciAm column, might fit an encyclopedia. Or filing it under a 'related phenomena' heading in the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_law.html" title="Moore's law">Moore's law</a> article could work. Or deleting it and writing those articles anew.Lesqual</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (Agreeing with Qleem.) While the law is wrong, it is mentioned <i>out there</i> (e.g. on the Internet). Therefore, people who never heard of it before, and are interested in it are likely to search for it. Wikipedia should offer the correct information to them. The article has been rewritten and is now a whole lot better: it states very clearly that the law is wrong and how the wrong statement originated.

"Kryder's Law" gets only 568 hits on Google, compared to over 2 million for "Moore's Law", which implies it is not a widely-used term. Moreover, most of the first page of those hits (apart from Wikipedia's article in second place) seems to consist of references to the SciAm article of that name, not to the "law" as such. So it is not at all clear that it belongs on Wikipedia. The fact that the article has been rewritten to acknowledge the mistake does not change this: if the information is incorrect, it should be removed, not kept with a disclaimer!<br />
The <i>verifiable</i> information in this article -- the concept of such a law applying to storage growth, and the figures showing how fast it's happening, and the implications for computing -- could usefully be merged into <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moore%27s_Law_4f26.html" title="Moore's Law">Moore's Law</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It's non-notable, for one thing. Only Wikipedia mirrors and direct references to the Scientific American article use it. Whether Scientific American coined the term is less important than whether other people now use it. And other people *don't* use it. I can't believe all these keep votes suggesting it should be kept because it's used on the Internet--it isn't used at all.<br />
And while it's true that the Scientific American article has as its title the phrase Kryder's Law, that doesn't mean the article is really trying to introduce something called Kryder's Law. It'd be like me publishing an article about an archeologist which compares him to Indiana Jones, then titling the article "'Indy' Smith".

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an important article as now written, since it provides good information about one of the three primary hardware enablers of computer technology, the other two being processors and networks. This has nothing to do with Moore's Law and I would not merge this with the Moore's Law article. Rather I would suggest changing the title to something like Disk Drive Areal Density Growth and removing all but one of the references to Kryder's Law, leaving only a link to the unfortunate SciAm article and the statement that no such "law" was ever proposed. <a href="http://www.storagemojo.com" class="external free" title="http://www.storagemojo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.storagemojo.com</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I keep hearing Moore's Law, Moore's Law yada yada. As the poster above says, this has nothing to do with Moore's Law. RTFA and you'll find that, according to the SciAm article's data, HD growth has been far slower than Moore' Law would predict. Moreover, Moore's Law has jack squat to do with HD growth. To quote from the page, "the complexity of an integrated circuit, with respect to minimum component cost, will double in about 18 months." Note, if you will, that that's <b>integrated circuit</b>, not magnetic storage capacity, nor magnetic storage cost, nor anything else to do with Kryder's law. Moreover, smerging would directly contradict the last section of the Moore's Law article: "Not all aspects of computing technology develop in capacities and speed according to Moore's Law. Random Access Memory (RAM) speeds and hard drive seek times improve at best a few percentages per year." To recap, the Law applies only to ICs and semiconductors. Smerging would be foolish at best, and destructive at worst. <a href="../../../q/l/e/User%7EQleem_995d.html" title="User:Qleem">Qleem</a> 03:59, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Proposal</b> I've gone through and reread all the criticism and keep arguments here and on the talk page, and the sciam article, and the article itself. It seems the major objections are: the name, and the perceived relationship to Moore's law. The major arguments to keep seem to be: It's written, it's out there, Wikipedia editors didn't coin the neologism, it's a distinct phenomenon from Moore's law, and it's an important idea that needs to stay on the wiki (feel free to add more objs or for below this if I left anything out). My proposal is two-fold. Firstly, the article could be rewritten to be very clear on just what it is this law refers to, namely <b>platter bit/sq inch density growth in hard drives</b>, not capacity, nor price/GB, nor anything else. Secondly, the article could be moved (and Kryder's law redirected to) Hard Disk Density Growth or similar. The link on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_disk.html" title="Hard disk">Hard disk</a> would need to point there too. This would put the article under a more "encyclopaedic" name, remove any ambiguity, promote a more thorough rewrite, and still maintain the content and the ability for people to search for Kryder's law. <a href="../../../q/l/e/User%7EQleem_995d.html" title="User:Qleem">Qleem</a> 20:12, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It *isn't* out there, except in that single article--Google shows little to no use--and it *is* a neologism. Just because the title of the Scientific American article is Kryder's Law doesn't mean it isn't a neologism; the Scientific American article is not really using it for a law any more than the hypothetical Bush's Law is a law or 'Indy' Smith is a nickname. Moreover, the supposed content isn't true. As even you admit, hard disks don't grow at the speed that Moore's Law predicts, which was the original contention.</dd>
<dd>It's true that you can write an article about disk drive space that doesn't use the original name and doesn't make the major claim of the original article, but there's only a semantic difference between "delete the article" and "rewrite the article into something that's completely unrelated to the original except that it has disk drive space in it". If you're going to do that, we're better off deleting the article, writing the disk drive space article separately, and not even pretending that the disk drive space article has anything to do with this one. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 13:47, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its use as a name for a law is a neologism coined by Wikipedia. The Scientific American article didn't seriously use it as a name for a law, despite containing the word "Law".</dd>
<dd>As for moving the article vs. creating a new one--you are already proposing creating a new article. You're just not calling it "creating a new article". It doesn't have the same name as the original article, nor does it state the same central point; I'd call that a new article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I will state, in defense of the article, that the measure of some does not always match the measure of others thus creating the dispute. The article was not created due to vanity, but due to notability throughout the independent professional wrestling circuit in the past seven years. If I can be cited for lack of notability, I could cite a thousand articles for my own measure of note and lack of knowledge. Then again, we come to Wikipedia to learn about things which we haven't the knowledge or we wish to learn. As a colleague of many wrestlers listed on this site, worker of many shows, and center of much controversy throughout my career, I e-mailed Wikipedia on this subject. Also, with neutrality shown in the article, there is no glorification nor burying of said subject. Not everything on this site is recognized by the world before placement or publication. As long as this site is broad in its vision, I have that right to create my own little footnote in history... or perhaps you could tell the thousands of people for which I performed that I never existed. -Ian Walsh Ethan_de_Sade@excite.com</li>

<p>User "Discopinster" is clearly not the sole objective force in deciding whether or not this venue is "notable." This venue has meant a great deal to very many people in michigan, and the subjective nature of a claim such as the one made should be reviewed. The entry "Haterhouse" has recently been edited, sources cross referenced and many internal links added (all of which obviously qualify to have their own wikipedia entries.) reconsider this, please.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_integer.html" title="Algebraic integer">algebraic integer</a>. As the article notes, the "radical integers" are a subring of the algebraic integers, and the algebraic integer article already mentions them in passing. Anyway, I'm not sure this is quite a neologism: for example, <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple_computer_algebra_system.html" title="Maple computer algebra system">Maple</a>'s help system defines a "radical number" as the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A radical number is defined as either a rational number or <i>i</i> , or a combination of roots of rational numbers specified in terms of radicals. A sum, product, or quotient of these is also a radical number.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>and I can find other mentions of "radical number" on the web. So a "radical integer" by the definition in this page is exactly what one would expect it to be, namely a radical number that's also an algebraic integer. But it doesn't seem to be used enough to merit its own article. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 17:38, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not all that persuaded that it's obvious a "radical integer" should be a "radical number" that's at the same time an algebraic integer, and anyway I don't recall hearing "radical number" before (may be internal terminology to Maple). Unless the term can be better attested, I don't think WP should claim that this is what "radical integer" means, even inside the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_integer.html" title="Algebraic integer">algebraic integer</a> article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:52, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After searching the web for a little while, it seems that this R Schroeppel character is a bona fide researcher in the area of theoretical cryptography. You can find lots of published papers by him on some fairly mathematical topics. But I found no reference for radical integers. It seems like a very noncontroversial definition, but I suppose we can't allow even noncontroversial definitions that are in violation of NOR, right? If this is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, merging is not appropriate, we have to delete.

<li>Verifiability doesn't mean we don't make distinctions among sources. We don't have to blindly accept everything that gets an ISBN. We don't really know what Schröppel said, and anyway he doesn't seem to be a number theorist either. For that matter even if he were a number theorist, his use of a term in one posting on a mailing list wouldn't constitute much evidence that it's an accepted term in the number theory community.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> wow, good catch, I hadn't noticed that at all. Maybe the article meant "quintic"? Anyway now I'm sort of curious; <i>is</i> the golden ratio a "radical integer"? You'd think this result (the general one, not just for the case of the golden ratio) might be the sort of thing RS might have gotten around to publishing if the proof had held up, which makes me wonder if he found a mistake later. This has gotten mildly more serious; the issue now is not just whether MathWorld is pushing a non-accepted terminology, but whether they've made an actual mathematical error here.

<li><b>Comment</b> Schroeppel claims to have proved it himself. He probably did, and it's a nice result that would be nice to have. Unfortunately it hasn't been published in a reliable source. (People, we <i>can't</i> rely on Weisstein!!! Talented as he obviously is, his quality control standards just aren't good enough in this sort of area.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree here with Trovatore. <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> does not say that we just include anything that we can verify, it's necessary that the sources be reliable also. Here we have an article whose contents are backed up by <i>one</i> source (it's unfortunate that Schroeppel's email, posting, etc., can't be used, but that's how it is); this one source is an encyclopedia, a source whose authority and reliability is supposed to rest on the sources it cites. In this case, it's clear that this source's standard are not as stringent as Wikipedia's. Not only that, but no, we don't just trust the author and publisher. In particularly contentious cases (as in this one), what is usually done is that we look into whether the author is reliable. This reminds me of the time Weisstein claimed (and still does) that geometers don't use 2-sphere to refer to a <a href="../../../2/-/s/2-sphere.html" title="2-sphere">2-sphere</a>. He apparently got this idea somehow (from looking at outdated books, I imagine) and then goes on a whole long spiel about how topologists and geometers differ on what to call the 2-sphere. In my experience also, his error ratio is quite high, and his goofs can be quite bad. What's funny is that he goofed on the entry under discussion, but I suppose that's not really going to change your mind as to reliability. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:48, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: It seems like something someone would have thought about before, and maybe there is another source out there. But this is just speculation. All we got so far is that Schroeppel made up this term "radical integer" in a discussion on a mailing list, with the help of others he proved some results in the list discussion, Weisstein mentions this in his encyclopedia. That's not enough. Now, I've often thought Wikipedia is too stringent at times, but what about in this case? I feel it's wise. I mean, who are we supposed to credit the theorem? Schroeppel says it wasn't just him. What about the proof of the stated result? Are we just supposed to state the result and then not say anything more? If Schroeppel put it up on his webpage, it would be different (for me and some others I'm sure), but he says he can't find the preprint! It seems that maybe he could find it, but he says that it assumes too much knowledge of the list discussion, so it's possible editors trying to use the preprint to create the article would have to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in a substantial way. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:36, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> so the relevance would be to the claimed result (namely that if a number expressible by radicals starting with rationals is an algebraic integer, then it can be expressed by radicals starting with ordinary integers). As I say, that's a nice result, but I don't think that from the sources we have, we have enough to claim in WP that it's true. If we could verify the result, then there might still be a question whether "radical integer" is genuinely accepted nomenclature for the concept. But if we <i>can't</i> verify the result, then as you say, keeping the term (even as a redirect, I think) would be kind of silly. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am not sure about that; Schroeppel clearly claims to have proved it, and if we source it to him, we are doing our job (and it's the sort of thing which <i>ought</i> to be true. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:14, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I doubt it's encyclopedic if stated as "Schroeppel claims to have proved...", which would clearly have to be in the <i>text</i> under these circumstances, rather than simply inferred by the reader by looking at the references, given that the proof hasn't had formal peer review. I might feel differently if we had the proof available to us to check; "legalistically" I suppose that's not supposed to make any difference, but I'd call this an instance of <a href="../../../s/e/n/WP%7ESENSE_4fdd.html" title="WP:SENSE">WP:SENSE</a>; if the result has a proof that we can follow, and we check that it's right, then it's verified. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 17:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Mark was one of the central figures of the radicalized anti-Vietnam War movement; to say he made no significant impact beyond his circle at Columbia is not much more accurate than describing Usama bin Laden as someone whose principal influence was on airline security. The online New York Times index shows over 300 articles relating to him, from 1967 through to this year. There should be zero question about the notability or encyclopedic nature of the subject, and the nominator should withdraw this remarkably inappropriate suggestion to avoid embarassing himself or herself further. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 02:18, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The article does not address what he contributed that makes him notable. There is not sign that this individual changed anything as a result of his actions. He created nor was involved in any lasting organization or institution nor were any created due to his actions. Further, simply being noted in a media outlet such as the New York Times does not establish his notability nor does a high google count. His personal impact on society would establish his notability. There seems to be no significant impact and his name is one which is certain to be forgotten outside the realm of an extremely small few. Hardly a subject for encyclopedias and history books. Also, I'll refer back to the fact that no one seems to wish to wikify or contribute to the article in any serious manner when there has been a tag on the article for nearly four months. This is enough to nominate the article for deletion and to follow through with the deletion. Monicasdude, you see adamant about keeping the article, perhaps you should put your actions where your mouth is and actually attempt editing the article rather than putting uncivil comments in the afd <i>discussion</i>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 13:23, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi HD. Yes, I <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChai_Walla_24f5.html" title="User:Chai Walla">Chai Walla</a>, once used the same laptop as <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBaba_Louis_3121.html" title="User:Baba Louis">Baba Louis</a> to edit an article while on the road. No we are not the same person. This has already been explained to you. I am no sockpuppet. You fought to keep this article a couple of weeks ago. Something has changed. If you want to enlist the support of people for your amazing "about face" on the fate of this subject, I would suggest that you pour out your reasoning on the discussion page as per WP policy. I have no clue where you are coming from and I suspect others are in the same boat or flotation device. You rarely explain yourself or your edits and this is in my opinion the main reason there are conflicts between the editors on this subject. You constantly scream "sockpuppet", but in reality many wonder if the shoe isn't on the other foot, so to speak.-<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChai_Walla_24f5.html" title="User:Chai Walla">Chai Walla</a> 07:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Documented facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Hampshire Declared its Independence on January 5th, 1776, six months before the Continental Congress issued its Declaration of Independence.</li>
<li>New Hampshire adopted its Constitution on January 5th 1776, long before the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781 and more than a decade before the US Constitution was ratified (by the independent Republic of New Hampshire, as the ninth ratifying state) on June 21, 1788.</li>
<li>New Hampshire functioned as an entirely independent country between January 5, 1776 and Jun 21, 1788, with a republican form of government, under the title and seal of "Rei-pub Neo Hantoni" and "Republica Neo Hantoniensis" (as of 1784, when the state Constitution was revised).</li>
<li>During its period of total independence, it issued passports, collected tariffs, raised armies and activated militias (which operated independently of the Continental Army), coined money, held elections, issued letters of marque, constructed naval vessels for combat, etc.</li>
<li>The period of the independence of New Hampshire was at least as long as those experienced by the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_b889.html" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Hawaii_406e.html" title="Republic of Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a>, and almost as long as the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Vermont_0894.html" title="Republic of Vermont">Republic of Vermont</a>.</li>
<li>It appears that The Commonwealth of Virginia and the Republic of South Carolina also declared their independence prior to the joint declaration of the Continental Congress.Citizenposse 20:27, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>there never was a so-called "Republic of New Hampshire" see <i>Revolutionary New Hampshire: An Account of the Social and Political Forces Underlying the Transition from Royal Province to American Commonwealth</i> Dartmouth College Publications. Hanover. 1936. Page 180 says: "On September 10, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read before the legislature, whereupon an act was passed by the provisions of which the province assumed the name of the "State of New Hampshire."</p>
<p>The notion of a so-called "Republic of NH" is therefore a fraud concocted by militia groups in the 21st century. --<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am currently researching further, however the original <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seal_of_New_Hampshire_78dc.html" title="Seal of New Hampshire">Seal of New Hampshire</a> held the title "Rei-pub Neo Hantoni", which is "Republic of New Hampshire". This version of the Seal remains in existence and is published by the state government on the cover of its official copies of the State Constitution. I can document this further if people are not in such a huff to jump the gun with their prejudices on this topic. Please do not be precipitous, allow a researcher to find further references. I can say that New Hampshire declared its own independence and named itself a Republic BEFORE the Continental Congress issued its own Declaration of Independence. When the US D of I was read before the New Hampshire Congress, it was accepted and the Congress voted for statehood. If you look at the dates here, you'll see I'm right: NH was an independent Republic before the US Declaration of Independence even existed.

<li>No, as I've told you before, the Republic is a different entity from the State. The State is an artificial corporate person which is governed by the legislators. The legislature brings the corporate State into being through its Acts, but it not itself the State, any more than the stockholders of Pepsico are the corporation.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems like original research. Most of the references given do not conclusively prove anything; they are used as part of the editor's own effort in trying to interpret New Hampshire's various seals. Other references only contain references to "Republic of New Hampshire" as a typo, rendering them completely irrelevant; this can possibly imply that the editor is grasping at straws. There is a single reference to "Republic of New Hampshire" in one document, but it seems to barely call for a merge to the main state history, as it still doesn't imply that the Republic was a recognized entity by historians, other nations, or other reliable sources. It was but a fleeting part of state history, which should be laid out like the rest of the histories of the other 13 colonies are, and per <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Ben</a>'s comment.

<dd>When a major government entity is created there always is a record, and a date when it happened. In this case there is no record, no date, no document, no citation in any history book. During the Revolution the Province of NH changed its name to the State of NH and never called itself the Republic of NH. All the history books agree on that. In recent years there is a militia group that is trying to set up a "republic of New Hampshire" -- try a google search. They talk about posse's a lot. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 19:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm convinced there is something to the notion that New Hampshire had a separate existance for a period between the start of the war of independence and the ratification of the constitution. The material in the article, and the material presented here, are convincing enough evidence of that, assuming they're backed up with cites (which ought to be easy). I would oppose outright deletion of this material. What I'm not clear on is why this needs to be a separate article rather than a section of the main <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> article. I'm also not clear on why Citizenposse needs to be so vehement, as his vehemence does his cause a disservice (sorry, but that's the way it is... if two exactly equal cases are presented, consensus here more often seems to go with the case that is presented more softly and reasonably ). I think <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> with a redirect left behind is the right course of action.

All of us who are editing/maintaining are still new to Wikipedia, this would be most of our first pages that we have ever touched, which also is another reason why there is not much on the page (due to us not fully knowing the coding style of Wikipedia, which does have a weird learning curve).
