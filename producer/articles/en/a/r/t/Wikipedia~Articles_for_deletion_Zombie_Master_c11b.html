<li><b>Delete the gamecruft!</b> A completely, utterly non-notable mod. "Zombie Master"+"Half-Life 2" gets less than 70 unique Google hits. The thing hasn't even been released yet- in fact, it's in alpha, which means it isn't even <i>close</i> to release!

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> since there's no notability asserted, besides the fact the mod hasn't even been released yet.

<li>Forum-ish names? Names like Aplomado you mean? This isn't the internet or anything where anonymity is allowed. Has less than 70 unique Google hits? I didn't know that was wiki's standard for deleting things now. If you actually looked at their page you would see they have done lots of work and I don't think they should be repayed by wiki deleting their article because someone didn't think the mod was popular enough. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by S1dra (<a href="../../../s/1/d/User_talk%7ES1dra_9800.html" title="User talk:S1dra">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_S1dra_8372.html" title="Special:Contributions/S1dra">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but whilst I'm on the side of deletion for this, what makes this any more or less notable than any other modification in the community, considering it has had magazine coverage, interviews and working demonstrations to the public? Mods like No More Room in Hell and Black Mesa Source are certainly no more notable than Zombie Master is. --86.128.14.79 12:54, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_%28game_mod%29_f303.html" title="Black Mesa (game mod)">Black Mesa: Source</a> was kept (even over my objections), due to it actually nearing finished state and it was also picking up mentions from (dead-tree) game press and commendations from Valve, IIRC, which, in my book, certainly makes it a bit more notable than a mod that describes itself as "alpha". And it <i>was</i> actually deleted before on exact same grounds that this mod is being considered for deletion for... Does Zombie Master get this sort of press yet? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:44, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, considering it has apparently made no or little progress since then, do you think that might be perhaps a lie on the behalf of those might want to keep it in Wikipedia? Secondly, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development_stage.html#Alpha" title="Development stage">Alpha</a> fits the bill very nicely for how BMS was presenting itself to you guys. In addition, whilst Zombie Master hasn't been mentioned by Valve, I don't really think that's overly relevant, since that seems to be semi-linked to the amount of screenshots of rendered models a team can produce. A German magazine has picked up on Zombie Master and wrote a little piece on it with an accompanying screenshot. So er, what's the difference between the two? --86.128.14.79 13:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think having media mentions etc. is a be-all, end-all reason to keep; a mod that's released and gets media mentions is much better than a mod that's not. Media mentions would be a "mitigating circumstance". =) BM:S's vote ended with No Consensus. If someone renominated that thing, say, 6 months after the previous AfD, and stressed hard enough that there's not been much progress, you'd probably soon see a smouldering crater where an article used to be. At best, it'd be a case for merge. WP can be lenient what comes to promises, but not exactly lenient what comes to late promises. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hm, so ultimately this comes down to the owner of the thing they want to promote wanting or not wanting their article enough to buy themselves some more time? Interesting, but I think this is a pretty good sign of how WP has some weird beauracracy issues. Anyway, delete this, buy colour me not too happy that other, similarly worthy modifications are allowed to stay based on very little else other than some rather biased words. --86.128.14.79 15:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
