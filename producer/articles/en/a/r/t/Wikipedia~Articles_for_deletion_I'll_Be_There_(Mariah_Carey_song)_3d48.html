<p>This is a cover of the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_5.html" title="Jackson 5">Jackson 5</a> song, which already has an article at "<a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Be_There_70fc.html" title="I'll Be There">I'll Be There</a>". Although it's not yet official <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Songs_9a56.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs">Wikipedia:WikiProject Songs</a> policy, songs that are recorded by more than one artist have one article which discusses all major versions of the song, and uses compound infoboxes (examples: "<a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Ga_Ga_295f.html" title="Radio Ga Ga">Radio Ga Ga</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/_/h/I_Heard_it_Through_the_Grapevine_c34b.html" title="I Heard it Through the Grapevine">I Heard it Through the Grapevine</a>"). I was going to go ahead and <b>merge</b> and <b>disambiguate</b> with no redirects, but I wanted to get a consensus first before I did so. <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 14:42, 27 May 2005 (UTC) <i>(<b>Note</b> I've written a merged article, which is up at I'll Be There/temp)</i> --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:12, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>...but since it's the same exact song as the Jackson 5 one, does it really need its own article? --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 15:09, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../i/27/l/I%27ll_Be_There_70fc.html" title="I'll Be There">I'll Be There</a>. I think the article is keepable, but since it's the exact same song, it'd probably be better all in one article. -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User_talk%7EIlGreven_076b.html" title="User talk:IlGreven">Talk</a> 15:22, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <b>I don't think a merge would be good for either article</b>. Both articles identify the song as the same one and there are mutual links. I don't want to see the Jackson 5 article swamped by the Mariah Carey statistics, which are in themselves encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:36, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> separate, especially since it's a #1 song, also seems to be part of a Mariah Carey wikiproject. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:39, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Please do not merge these two articles. As mentioned above, we are in the middle of a Mariah Carey wikiproject, and as Tony Sidaway mentioned, merging these two articles will not enhance either of them and will bring down the overall quality of the articles. <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 16:34, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with I'll Be There. Articles on songs should cover notable versions of the song. The Wikiproject can link to the article which should mention that Mariah Carey had a number one hit with it. We should have a consistent policy for songs and perhaps we should have a policy forum to decide one. We shouldn't have one rule for Mariah Carey cover versions and one for everybody else. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 18:01, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This was my main concern. This same issue could occur with a song such as "<a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Marmalade_0584.html" title="Lady Marmalade">Lady Marmalade</a>", which was a major #1 hit for two different acts. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:23, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, separate of the Jackson 5 entry. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 19:45, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>. Having an article on every song ever recorded by Mariah Carey is ludicrous. This is even more fanboyish than Everyking's Ashlee Simpson obsession. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:04, May 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, articles on hit singles are important. I'm not familiar with the Mariah Carey project; are they really writing articles for *every* Mariah song? --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 23:54, 27 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes unfortunately *every* song. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 02:49, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse Me, Rick and Megan, but I really don't think you should be talking when you don't know exactly what you're talking about. The project is not about *every* Mariah Carey song, it's about all her single releases. And Rick, It's a bit rude too to be insulting Everyking and his Ashlee Simpson articles too. And Freddy, I'll Be There is one of the bigger and more remembered hits of Mariah's career. I understand the points mentioned about songs usually being put together, but as mentioned above, it is a project that we have been working on for some while, and they help to maintain the flow the of the Mariah Carey single articles, and merging would really disrupt it. <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegaWikipedia_90c1.html" title="User:OmegaWikipedia">OmegaWikipedia</a> 06:34, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you aware that Everyking became so obsessive about the matter that it eventually went to the arbitratin committee, where he was forbidden from making any edits to Ashlee Simpson aticles? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 18:58, May 28, 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not sure if it being one of Mariah's "bigger and more remembered hits" is a valid reason to keep it seprate from the other article, which is the Jackson 5's biggest and most remembered hit (and the biggest pre-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> Motown hit ever).--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 02:31, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I have a suggestion of my own. Use headings for each significant version—here, the Jackson 5 original and Mariah Carey's. Then, change links in all other articles to point either to the Jackson 5 section, the Mariah Carey section, or the main article, depending on context. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDale_Arnett_0a47.html" title="User:Dale Arnett">Dale Arnett</a> 21:56, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, these are a fantastic set of articles and are well written, leave them alone and stop putting them on votes for deletion. A lot of hard work has been put into them, and this article should be left the way it is. Both this and the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_5.html" title="Jackson 5">Jackson 5</a> article have relevant information and merging them is too much. This article is also too well written and factual to be deleted. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimate_Star_Wars_Freak_7703.html" title="User:Ultimate Star Wars Freak">Ultimate Star Wars Freak</a> 13:48, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't want the article deleted; I suggested a merge (essentially a copy-paste job with the removal of redundant information). I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings or undermine anyone's work. The purpose of me putting this on VfD was to get a consensus instead of simply going ahead and merging the articles without a consensus. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 21:23, 28 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I understand your point of view, but if you read both articles you'll find they have little to do with each other due to their separate impact and the huge difference between both acts and also there is too much information for a merge to make sense. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimate_Star_Wars_Freak_7703.html" title="User:Ultimate Star Wars Freak">Ultimate Star Wars Freak</a> 19:47, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not exactly. Again, it's the <i>same. exact. song.</i> The only impact either really had is that they (both of them) were major #1 hit records. Should I jump the gun and merge it as an example? --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 23:28, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment. I've done a merge</b>, located at I'll Be There/temp. Maybe seeing the example will help the situation. I expanded the information on <i>both</i> records, including correcting some information from both articles that was incorrect. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 00:31, 30 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Some songs like <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragostea_Din_Tei_8874.html" title="Dragostea Din Tei">Dragostea Din Tei</a> work with one, others need two.
