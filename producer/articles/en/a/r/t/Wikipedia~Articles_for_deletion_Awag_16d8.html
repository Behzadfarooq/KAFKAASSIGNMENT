<li>I would argue that to several hundred people, if not thousands (let's include the lurkers), that the subject matter is important. That the signee has not heard of the subject should not be used as reason alone for deletion. I am sure if i searched through the wiki files I would find plenty of entries that I considered to be unimportant. As I stated last night when asking for the page to not be deleted, similar entries for other websites are included. As for having no notoriety, again that is a subjective viewpoint of the signee and surely cases should be reviewed on an objective not subjective issue. The entry will make more sense when it is completed, but I say again, to thousands of people the entry will be relevant. Sitheroo 10:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>keep</b>. I second Sith's emotion (except I have no interest whatsoever in anything to do with Savidan and the word "entry"). It is certainly more relevant than some esoteric mating ritual practised by a bunch of idiots in green jumpers with letters on them who attend some American establishment no doubt famous for its practise of unbridled Man-Love and named after a rather shabby British Dockyard. In short, keep it, or I'll ram you up your own fudge-tunnels. Bernoulli

<li>Keep: Some of the material that appears on awag may be contentious, but it is subvesive and invetive: it is this very FACTAMUNDO (overlooked by the main page author incidentally) that is the ESSENCE of AWAG: it forms a continuum of a deeply embedded strand of British SATIRE c/f 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Office.'

<li>Hello. I've cleared the unhelpful entries off. My intellect alone will be enough to convince you that Awag should be allowed to stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the Wikipedia community.

<li>Right, I'm back with a proper user name which will hopefully take the edge off the more anal contributor's attitudes. I have an encyclopaedic knowledge of many subjects I will be more than happy to contribute to one I discover the nature of the beast we're humping here. I reiterate that if "Dartmouth Pong" or some water park which caters to people who weigh as much as a small family car are regarded as suitable for inclusion then it would be scandalous not to extend the same courtesy to Awag.

<li><b>keep</b> A definition for nonsense as given on wikipedia. "Much madness is divinest sense to the discerning eye.

<li>Ah, perhaps you'd be kind enough to direct me to your notability-o-meter? Again, there are considerably more than a <i>few</i> football fans out there to whom "Awag" means something.

<li>You might want to try <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>. "Dartmouth College" (including the quotes, thus excluding many relevant results, considering it is universally known as simply "Dartmouth" by all Americans) has 11,400,000 results. awag football (excluding quotes, thus including many <i>ir</i>relevant results) has a whopping 567.

</ul>
<p>For a start, it's not soccer. Secondly, I believe that the point has been made above as to why the "awag" entry should be kept. Reasons have been given such as it's appearance in books, newspapers and national radio. However this appears to be a dictatorship, and we are not being listened too because "zunaid" has too much time on his/her hands. The reason so many "sock puppets" have come on here, as you seem so keen to keep pointing out, is because of the popularity of the entry of awag, and our utter disbelief that you cannot see it's value.

<p>What MHG said, again I am not a sockpuppet but another person who has taken the time and effort to create an account in order that this unbelievably inane discussion comes to an end.

<li>Starryeyes, I find it fascinating that somebody who regards British music as so important can be so ignorant of the culture from which it grew.

<p>FOOL. They both need inclusion. You are just sounding like a snob now. Oh, and by the way, this was un unsigned entry by a non-voting intruder blah blah blah.

<li>AWAG is not just a community, it's a way of life, a way of escaping boredom at work and at home with like minded people, It is also a perfect vehicle to co-ordinate social occasions across the country....sorry YOOKAY!, the football element contributes only a small percentage to that which is AWAG. Maybe you narrow minded fuckwits can't get your head around people who can actually manage their own lives and make their own decisions and generate their own community without having their heads up their own self important arses.

I'll bet good old English pounds to your vicously devalued American dollar that twenty years down the line (assuming the inevitableresource/race-wars haven't destroyed the internet/western society by then) that there will be more Awaggers than "Botcon" attendees, if only because a significant proportion of our lot have had sex with something other than our own hands and are likely to actually have some progeny. "Botcon" is a ridiculoous word, for fuck's sake - it sounds like a festival of anal adventure. AWAG is at least as "real" at least as "meaningful" and a milion times more significant than some bleach-faced Finnish Nazi sympathisers getting together with like-minded potential serial killers to spray their salty jizz over who has Galvatron in the most original original packaging.

<p>I was going to write a right good polemic on why this should stay on the webiste but having come in this morning and read the sanctimonious whiny shit above I've changed my mind. Good grief. Rightio That you self-important arbiters of what should be on this website appoint yourselves on time served on website rather than experience or qualifications shows what an arrogant up your own arse bunch of cunts you americans are. This is cultural imperialism of the highest order. Relevance? I could care less that a bunch of webtards who live in their mother's basements fantasizing about shooting their school friends with their dads AK47 collection do not find an ENGLISH website (a very popular one, 1000000 hits a month at the height of it's popularity) relevant. I assume, rightly I imagine, that you have all written off to the Encyclopedia Brittanica and asked for all the bits you don't care about to be removed? Here's the news: AWAG, to many many Britons is as relevant and important as things you care about but we have never heard of are to you. Boo hoo you haven't heard of it. It's a comedic website, it doesn't profess to be anything more and as such it deserves to be kept on this encyclopedia (from the greek meaning 'encyclo' - everything' and 'pedia - fiddler of small children' - and quite right too, that is pretty much what you all are). SO hey ho, you small band of keepers of the truth don't want us to play. Never mind. We'll have as much fun searching the site and finding non-relevant and non-important entries as we would having the pleasure of seeing this entry accepted into the fold.</p>
<p>America uber alles eh? God bless George Bush and his beacon of truth democracy and justice.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> As an American working in Europe I am frankly dismayed by the attitude of both sides to this discussion, sadly especially my compatriots. Having moved to Munich in 1997 to work for my existing company I have had to put up with anti-american attitudes in all walks of life. Living in Germany this has become particularily hard in the last few years following the intervention in the Middle East situation. In my capacity as a member of AWAG [<a href="http://www.awag.us/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.awag.us/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] I constantly strive to improve relationships with our European Counterparts. Living in Europe has taught me to welcome the diversity of nations, to compare a German to a Frenchman is like comparing an Alaskan with a Mexican Immigrant, one simply can't.</p>
<p>I have a duty to promote AWAG in Europe both through social convertion and the internet, and have come across the alternative British meaning of the acronym on many occasions. While often typically British in attitude, one cannot doubt the growth in use of both the term and the relevance in their part of the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I am saddened to see such dispute over this subject, Wikipedia is growing in reputation in all parts of Europe but particularily the United Kingdom I read, such actions sadly hinder this</p>

<ul>
<li>Fair enough. The nom. for deletion was based on non-notability (phrased as non-notoriety). Meatpuppet &amp; Sockpuppet votes will be discounted or disregarded, however it does seem to show that there is some minimal notability (notoriety?) on the subject. We have a fairly low threshold for notability (nearly every murderer or executed murder at least is considered notable enough, as are semi-deities in any number of sci-fi genres, and on and on). Years from now (encyclopedically speaking) these non-notables will not be remembered, but that doesn't preclude their appearance here. If we want to up the threshhold of notability (like we have done with music), I'd be all for it IFF we apply it consistently. In any event, at least I spurred some discussion. You'll note that generally my votes on AfD's are not anti-majoritarian although sometimes I state that I didn't necessarily agree with the rationale. If I end up as a minority of one, I think I can take it.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Better, but probably still not good enough for me to change my vote. There's no independent verification of the website's traffic claim, which seems to be the main claim to notability, and in one of the two newspaper references cited earlier, the main body of the reference is the sportswriter admitting that he's never heard the term and doesn't know what it means <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1671899,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1671899,00.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p><b>Comment on this delete discussion</b> I am still new to Wikipedia, however I have noticed a few things in this discussion and while looking around the place. Some of the administrators comments on this are rather poorly worded however there have been well voiced comments such as those of Colin Kimbell.</p>
<p>To be honest I get the feeling that most of the comments by the more experienced users are said without even reading the article, they call this jumping on the bandwaggon. There may be many reasons for this but I think that at least some of this is point chasing, from what I read some of the more childish users believe that the more edits one makes, the more important one is. They even have a list of <b>most edits</b> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]</p>
<p>As a new user it is not my place to say that this is stupid but I have to say it comes across this way.</p>

I must say that this episode has been an eye-opener for me.</p>
<p>I have, of course, heard of the concept of Wikipedia before, but this is the first time I have ever bothered to look in to it - that was as a result of being part of the Awag community.</p>
<p>My first thought about Wikipedia was that it was a foolish premise which was doomed to failure. Why would the entries in it be regarded as reliable, if they were penned by people with no authority, and freely open to vandalism by anyone (anonymously at that)?</p>
<p>The project does have virtues, of course, and the key one, apart from not having to pay people to insert and edit articles, would have to be inclusivity and scope. Here was the possibility to have an encyclopedia so comprehensive that no other could possibly compete. Even the most obscure facts could be embraced at no cost, apart from a few kilobytes of disk space.</p>
<p>However, this virtue seems to be being thrown away remarkably cheaply.</p>
<p>There are many valid reasons that could be put forward for removing Andy's Awag entry. It is not written in a journalistic style, and the origins and history of both the word and the community are not made clear enough. However, these things could be tidied up. It is true that to verify that Awag exists, and the facts about it are true is not easy, because of the sparsity of other web sites referencing Awag. In this case, we could have relied on the hundreds of other members of the Awag community to edit and correct the entry (apparently the whole idea of Wiki).</p>
<p>However, suggesting that entries should be excluded because they are "not famous enough" is not only an unwise criterion, it is also clearly being applied in an idiosyncratic and irrational way by an cliquey oligarchy of narcisstic bullies, seemingly drunk in their own solipsistic view of the World.</p>
<p>As an example, I noticed that a recently-deleted randomly-chosen article (which I have not had the opportunity to read) was called "Mesh computers". One reason put forward for the deletion was "I've lived in Britain for ten years now and never saw one single box manufactured by those people anywhere". I don't know what that signifies, but we have two in the family and at least two of my work colleagues also have one - so they do exist! Another comment: "links from the vanilla Google search are mostly just product reviews and thus do not indicate notability". There are, in fact, "about 64,000" matches for "Mesh Computers" in vanilla Google. How many do you need to be included?</p>
<p>The next deleted article after that was "Engineering Week - University of Alberta". Maybe not the most important subject in the World, it appears nevertheless to be earnestly and carefully written by someone who though it was worthy of inclusion, and there may be dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people who might have read it with interest. The author may have become a valuable contributor to Wikipedia, but I doubt he/she will ever bother with it again after the vitriolic and utterly inapproriate bile seen in the deletion page, e.g. "vanity", "Does anybody outside the Uni of Alberta give a shit", "boring", "dime-a-dozen University event", etc. These comments are spiteful, unnecessary and are simply a case of shooting onesself in the foot, by alienating people.</p>
<p>I note that one of the aims of Wikipedia,as stated by its founder, is to achieve the same quality as the Encyclopaedia Britannica, or better(!). Frankly, this aim is so laughable as to be embarrassing. Tragically, Wikipedia is also failing miserably to play to its strengths of immediacy and inclusivity.</p>
<p>Personally, I doubt I will be bothering to access Wikipedia again, either as a contibutor or as a reader. If I want reliability, I can use Britannica. Wikipedia doesn't offer anything of value to me. In fact, to be honest, Awag is more valuable.</p>

Ruth, please allow me to say that you are a shining beacon of sense in what other wise amounts to a dogshit-filled dark corner of a park of mental mayhem. I feel I should apologise for the US-phobic comments of some people here who appear to be doing their best to exhibit what they perceive to be the major drawbacks of the US i.e. a parochial, judgemental, cartoon picture of other lands. As I watch hour after our of news footage of people screaming "Allah Kebab Fallaffel!" and burning down the wrong embassies I feel it is my duty to extend an understanding hand of internationalist pragmatism to try to bring disparate, mutually suspicious groups of people together and elimante the suspicion and rancour over tiny issues which divides us. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to expelling a different, semi-liquid issue I have into an old sock, whilst concentrating on a digitised picture of (a pre-cancerous) Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>As for the self-righteous Wiki-Napoleons, to quote Mr Reggie Noble; fuck all y'all. I expect Ruth has decomposing lint jammed under her big toe with infinitely more clue of what this Wiki-business is all about than you tossers. Read, mark and learn John BCEE'äs entry with as much attention as you would pay a UNIX manual or a 24 hour Transformer marathon. ONly then can you save yourselves FROM yourselves.</p>

<li>Many of the people on here who consider a lack of notability as a valid reason for deletion do so because they feel that it is a logical extension of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>. Some others feel that it's not possible to document a truly obscure thing without violating <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>/<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, since the contributor wouldn't have heard about the obscure topic without direct personal involvement.

I was just making a point Colin - it seems the 'regular' users feel the people involved here are not real.</p>
