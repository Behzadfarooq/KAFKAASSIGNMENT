<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not going to weigh in on whether the article should be deleted or not. Perhaps it'd make more sense as part of the main "Rescue Rangers" article. However, I think it's definitely notable, just as much as other major furry works like Jack or DMFA which aren't under debate. It's really a fully-fledged fan-created graphic novel, and was created and released as such. It's an accomplishment which is fairly unique, as most other comics are episodic on-going affairs, often times lacking a single cohesive storyline. Considering OMaM's readership, if it were a regularly comic, instead of a completed work, this discussion probably wouldn't even be coming up. I was directed to this work by Mat Sherer of Badly Drawn Kitties fame, in an off-handed comment he made about a year ago in his blog. (Unfortunately, the Internet Archive is down at the moment, so I couldn't try and look for it. If corroboration is necessary, I'm sure he wouldn't mind speaking for himself. Heck, why not ask notables in community to weigh in?) Mat isn't even necessarily a part of the CDRR-specific fandom, but he seems well-connected to other notables in the community, and his comment mentioned the waves this comic was making. I think that speaks loudly enough about the level of impact it's had. --BeeBot 17:06, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Though this may be the only page I've contributed to, I hold no association with "Of Mice and Mayhem" or its author. I use wikipedia quite regularly. However, this is the first time I've come across a page that was nominated for deletion. Given the contents of the page and the subject it was referencing, I was compelled to open a wikipedia account and voice my opinion on the matter. I would also like to note that I have not participated in alerting anyone to this page's impending deletion. I am merely a voice among many who feels this subject is notable enough to warrant a reference on this site. And though I am aware this in not up for a vote, I'm hoping the administrators will at least take this under consideration and reconsider. –BabylonLegacy 12:04, 1 June 2006.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I saw this page ages ago, and considered deleting it. However, I put it off to go after even more useless webcomic crap that we had lying around and never came back to it. The guy seems to have some iota of talent, but the arguments above say it's notable to the Chip n Dale fandom? That really isn't enough, because I'd vote to delete an article on the Chip n Dale fandom any day. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 05:26, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: There must be dozens of pages about fandoms, series, webcomics and shows that aren't as noteable as "Of Mice And Mayhem". Yet they deserve a place to. Furthermore, most people got it wrong that it's important to Rescue Rangers fandom. It's considered an accomplishment in the whole furry and anthromorphic fandom. Most of these fans, when asked if they know this comic, are likely to give a positive answer. Even if some have never watched the series itself. And the comic's creator still recieves praise for his work. I find the claim that it has little noteability very dubious. ---CD--- 11:34 2 June 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.45.51.85 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.45.51.85_2b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.45.51.85">contribs</a>).</small>
