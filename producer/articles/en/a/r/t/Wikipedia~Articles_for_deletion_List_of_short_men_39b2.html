<p>The introduction says it all&#160;:</p>
<p><i>The <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_People_of_America_4583.html" title="Little People of America">Little People of America</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> indicate 148 cm or 4 ft 10 as the "cut-off", but as they concede people slightly taller than that may fit men up to and including 150 centimetres will be included.</i></p>
<p>The standard by which this list goes is US-centered. Furthermore, a man like <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Sarkozy_0554.html" title="Nicolas Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> is often derided in France because of his short stature and called "<i>le nabot</i>" (the midget) by his ennemies. Being 164 cm, he is excluded from the list, although in public perception, he is notable for being a tiny man (and married to a tall and broad-shouldered wife, which makes things worse&#160;!). So i think it is quite absurd to fix 150 cm as an upper limit. <a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCS_dae0.html" title="User:RCS">RCS</a> 16:53, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note to closing admin</b>: Please also consider the parallel discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_tall_women%2C_List_of_tall_men_f8bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of tall women, List of tall men">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of tall women, List of tall men</a>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem with the Sarkozy example is that there are many nations where 164 cm is not necessarily short. Granted I mentioned Pygmies as an exception as if we had to go "short" by their standard we'd have to drop some dwarfs as well. I could maybe add the Hmong as well as I seem to recall they have an unusually low average height. However if we include China, Japan, and most of East Asia as exceptions we're exempting about half the planet. Still if you want to divide by nation, and have anthropometric studies of nations, it might be reorganizable at a later date.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 07:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So discuss it with other editors on the talk page and come up with something else. Deleting it isn't a good solution. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:17, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This sounds a bit sour grapesy. The other one was an admin decision which is in review. It looks like it's, rather perplexingly, going to lose at review but that's neither here not there. This list should be judged on its own merits if possible.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the article's definition of "short" is arbitrary and inherently POV. Fixing the limit at 150 cm, while it may be taken from <i>Little People of America</i>, is still POV. Suggest another word should be used in place of "short". <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:48, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It's not arbitrary, I switched it to go by the standards of a recognized organization. That that organization is in the USA is not blameworthy in itself.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 18:47, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> If the limit I switched to is too short, this could've been discussed at talk. I don't think that's a valid reason for delete. I agree it's too US-centric at present, but I could not find a non-US site on anthropometrics. If you can find an international study on height variation I'd appreciate it. Lastly this is the third vote on this in two months.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 18:49, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I am having a hard time understanding why this list is necessary, given that there are plenty of categories in which these people can be included. I also fail to see how this isn't just trivia or something best left to the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_4fe1.html" title="Guinness Book">Guinness Book</a>. If this list is kept, it needs renaming for several reasons. First, I do not understand why this is limited to men. Second, "short" in the title implies people who are of below average hight and may have this as a well-known trait (i.e. <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>), but this is clearly a list of "little people" or people with some form of dwarfism. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:27, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So we should only have height lists for women? Is there some kind of logic to that I'm not seeing?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 03:37, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We shouldn't have height lists at all. If that AfD had not been pre-emptively closed for reasons I can't fathom, I would have voted delete on that too. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 03:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Alright then. Let's agree to disagree on that. How about the criteria for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> -- extremes of height <i>have</i> been the subject of multiple non-trivial reliable publications. I agree that the current articles need to be improved on--including renaming, discussing to build consensus, better sourcing, etc.--but there is no reason to delete them. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> - specifying hard-and-fast limits for any relational adjective (e.g., short, tall, large) leaves room for some criticism. Note that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tall_women.html" title="List of tall women">List of tall women</a> was kept. If we delete articles based on the fact that they contain "subjective" relational adjectives, then we will have to delete <i>every</i> article in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of__largest__articles_2ca5.html" title="List of &quot;largest&quot; articles">List of "largest" articles</a>.

<dd>The thing is I think the shortest men are largely not in that list and may not even have articles. I'm 3 ft 6, but I don't think I'm among history's shortest men.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, for reasons mentioned already and also that it should be easy to determine if a person should be on the list or not. Simply ask yourself, "has this been been refered to in the media as <i>short</i>?". If so get the source, and cite it. Easy as pie. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 11:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but then the people in the list should have passed their growth-spurt days and not still be growing..hehe..<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECometstyles_5139.html" title="User:Cometstyles"><font color="green"><b>Cometstyles</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7ECometstyles_42cd.html" title="User talk:Cometstyles"><b><font color="red">talk</font></b></a></sup></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is difficult to see why a workable list of "men notable for their shortness" can't be sustainable - perhaps a guideline max of e.g. 150 cm plus any others who are/have been notable for shortness (and, off on a tangent, difficult to see why same approach couldn't have worked on List of Tall Men also). <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeartofaDog_3faf.html" title="User:HeartofaDog">HeartofaDog</a> 12:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the overturn/relist arguments in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_30_68c1.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 30">List of tall men DRV</a>, which although endorsed, I find did not provide sufficient consideration for all of the concerns. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 18:07, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. Per my same reasoning on the AfD for the lists of tall men/women. Also a <b>comment</b> to some of the above commentors. The AfD we are discussing is NOT "List of men notable for their shortness", it is "List of short men". There's a big difference. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 21:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

There is no signle definition of 'short'. If it does have to stay, it should be renamed to List of shortest men. But given that we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_dwarfism.html" title="List of people with dwarfism">List of people with dwarfism</a> (which is what "list of shortest men" should redirect to, this list is pointless. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">â–º</span></a></small> 22:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
