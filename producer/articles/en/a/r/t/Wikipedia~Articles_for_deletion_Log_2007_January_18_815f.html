I really think the article needs to be deleted or completely brought down to a stub. I'm not contesting the existance of the term, it's all the original research I'm not liking, and original research is a reason to nominate an article for deletion as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">the deletion policy</a>. --<a href="../../../l/i/j/User%7ELijnema_e954.html" title="User:Lijnema">Lijnema</a> 10:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Commnent</b>: The referencing is far from being wiki featured article status. All there is, is "see also" section at the bottom. A quick glance at those "reference" appear to be extremely relevant and have most of the information from this article. The problem I believe that Lijnema brings, I believe is not that the Article should be delete because of Original Research because he hasn't take the time to verify the information. And who would... it's a mess non-properly referenced , as per <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> material. Hence I understand the nomination. I however, do not accept it, as I previously voted keep. That means I believe that with a little work, a party of interest to the article should add the references. I think AfD should have to categories of deletion. I don't think the article should be deleted but, if you follow WP:CITE, WP:OR, WP:V all these rules are interlinked and hence if one is violated they may all be violated.

<li><b>Keep</b> It may be neologism by hard and fast criteria, but the fact of the matter is that Wikipedia allows things to be documented more quickly than an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> This artice is very useful to me and I'm linking to it from my website for all the players of my game server to know what's against the rules. If you are going to merge it in the page with the list of slang, make sure that there is griefing and not only griefer. I still suggest to keep this page since it describe even better the actions that are considered griefing, for example in my game server we have this list: Leeching, Kill Stealing, Teamkilling, Stealing dropped items, Spawncamping, Suiciding. In short terms saying that griefing is forbidden is easy to make sure that you cover any lame action that a player could do. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.54.88.8_75a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.54.88.8">82.54.88.8</a> (talk) 21:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Please keep in mind while reading this that I can always be swayed in my opinions. This article does not site its sources (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). It reads close to the edge of an advert, and I suspect it may have been planted to support a company. From looking at the first couple pages of ghits, of which there are many, it looks like they aren't for this exact phrase, they're for some combination of "home and garden" and "real estate". I suspect that "Garden real estate" may be a non-notable neologism. <b>Delete</b>. If someone can make this into a real sourced article which makes sense, I'm always willing to rescind my nomination. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 00:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To be fair, many of the references do look legitimate, e.g., "All your 404 are belong to us" is certainly a reference to All your base, and many of the other quotes are obviously also references.

<li><b>Please no!</b> *gets on soapbox* You guys may say that it is obvious guesses, but I recognize ALOT of them, and have seen many too ON THE SITE. We could show you exactly where the references occur, if you want, but if other people who actually PLAY the game saw this they would tell you this page is hilarious. For instance, I remember the "there is no jelly, only zuul," one, that happened a little while ago. I'm sure if you all want it "validated" then you could, I'm sure someone is willing to. We'll get the Neopets Team people over here to check it out...it is so funny, you just don't really get the point because you guys have probably never actually played. <b>I have looked through the what-is-and-is-not-allowed list thing</b> and I don't see why you should delete it, because this stuff isn't speculation (well maybe a bit of it) and think about it, we all have biases, especially for a website that has toys sold to mcdonalds, (except that little kids wouldn't recognize a quote from most of this, so it's obviously adults and teenagers who would see this anyway) and you wouldn't appreciate it like users would (who are not little kids). The Neopets Team often says funny things, and it is very cool that somebody actually made a list of them all. *gets off soap box* ok, you may ignore my ranting and go on with your buisiness now. 0:27, 21 January 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: An article's problematic history or attractiveness to a now-banned editor are not good deletion rationales if the underlying content is sound or there is good material that can be added. (After all, we are dealing here with an abstract mathematical concept, not a living person biography.) It would be good to have input from the mathematics contributors as to whether this is a valid concept, appropriately described, and using reasonably common terminology. There are several links to this article from others which suggest that the answer might be yes, but I am not knowledgeable enough to say. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Of the resources, only one has an ISBN number, and it is not cited.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's not my field of mathematics, but the question is, is the term <b>Zariski surface</b> <i>really</i> used for this concept (by someone other than Dr. Blass and his students). If so, we should have some article here, even if it turns out only to be a stub because none of us know the appropriate references.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A search of MathSciNet found 26 papers or paper reviews containing the phrase "Zariski surface", with authors Masuyaki Hirokado, Joseph Blass, Piotr Blass, Jeff Lang, Tim Ford, Angie Grant, Toshiyuki Katsura, Torsten Ekedahl, Raymond Hoobler, Masayoshi Miyanishi, Peter Russell, James Deveney, John Mordesen, Marc Levine, Richard Randell, and William Lang. That many legit mathematical publications and that many different authors (despite many being related by coauthorship to Blass) seems well above threshhold for a mathematical WP article to me. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 02:21, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I looked through MathSciNet too, but I couldn't find any articles with the words "Zariski surface" in an article that wasn't written by Blass or one of his co-authors.

I am unqualified to evaluate the significance of mathematics-related articles and have no opinion on the outcome, yet a <i>discussion</i> of whether to delete this article is very apt. I was the administrator who performed the actual banning of Dr. Blass and his sockpuppets. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#009">Durova</span></font></a><sup><i><a href="../../../d/u/r/User_talk%7EDurova_6afa.html" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i></sup> 04:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's obvious that a decent number (&gt; 10) of the 26 papers mentioned by David Eppstein are in perfectly respectable journals, e.g. Duke, Compositio, Proc. AMS, etc. Thus the concept should be considered valid for Wikipedia purposes. The only issue here is on the title. But generally we don't delete valid content just because we <i>suspect</i> the title may not be appropriate. We try to find a better one and then move it to that. Unless evidence is shown that indicates that there is another more popular name for "Zariski surface", I see no reason why this concept should not only have an article but live at its current title. The reliable sources we have so far suggest that is the name. The fact that many of these authors are related to Blass somehow is not important (with only several actually being his students), as they are perfectly respectable researchers. I would expect this kind of thing to happen for a niche topic. Incidentally, Marat Gizatullin mentions in his review MR0546289, that "here we are using P. Blass's suggestion to call a surface $X$ a Zariski surface if $X$ is birationally equivalent to a hypersurface in $A^3$ defined by an irreducible equation of the form $z^p-f(x,y)=0$ [see Blass, "Zariski surfaces", Ph.D. Thesis, Univ. Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich., 1977]". This strongly suggests to me that there was no widely accepted name for this until Blass proposed "Zariski surface". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 04:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That is unfair. The problem here is that the major source for this is known to be a serial and prolific creator of vanity articles (not just on himself). He has inserted his name and links to his website into numerous other articles. Since the only source we had for the significance of this subject is one whose judgement on the significance of his own endeavours has proven to be exceptionally unreliable, it is valid to ask whether this is in fact a notable mathematical concept outside of its (very few) proponents. That question remains unanswered. How many secondary sources exist for this? Is it included in standard texts at undergraduate level? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 18:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:The journal sources show that "Zariski surface" as an actual topic in mathematical research. Whether it is included in an undergraduate text is irrelevant, as that is not how we judge whether a mathematics article should be deleted. I can understand the situation has been confused by Blass' actions, but really...the situation is simple enough, I wonder what the problem is. If this were any other mathematics article whose topic was the main subject of a dozen papers in well-respected mathematical journals, it would be an automatic keep by many non-mathematical editors. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:51, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you think this article is worth keeping because Blass (and coauthors) have published a few papers in reputable journals, did you also vote to keep the article on transreal numbers? I could see someone arguing either way. Anderson has had only one or two coauthors and has only published a handful of papers in journals. (He has self-published a lot more, but for the moment let's ignore that.) Blass, on the other hand, has had about 10 coauthors and has published a couple dozen articles in journals. Some of his coauthors have gone on to publish independently of Blass --- but still are, in a sense, his collaborators and aren't "independent". Where does one draw the line? <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunch_e74c.html" title="User:Lunch">Lunch</a> 19:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm <i>very</i> surprised that you would bring this up. You were one of the people that mentioned in the transreal AFD discussion that Anderson's publications on transreal numbers were not peer-reviewed. Anderson basically had a couple papers in some conference proceedings that were not reviewed. I based my "delete" on that. The <i>major</i> difference here is that Blass and the other authors have published in well-known peer-reviewed journals. Not to mention that they are actually <i>mathematical</i> journals versus whatever it was that Anderson published in. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 19:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yup, at the time I thought the proceedings where Anderson published were not reviewed. I was incorrect. The standards for that particular proceedings journal are different; his (few) articles were reviewed. The proceedings were also tangentially computer science related.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My understanding of the wiki process is that, if I invent (or research or discover) the magnificent Foo, I am essentially disqualified from writing the wikipedia article on Foo. The proper writers are other wikipedians, and the proper sources needs to be journals on Foo, newspaper articles on Foo, and government surveys sampling the economic impact of Foo on homeless beagles. The three sources on this page listed are by Zariski and Blass, and I'm guessing that Blass made significant contributions to the realm of knowledge -- which means neither of them are good sources, and neither of them need to be the wikipedian writing this article. Ideally, someone who understands such things should gather some information from reliable, secondary sources, and that person should write this article. (It won't be me; I didn't comprehend the first sentence.) Anyone want to correct my perception of how things should work?

<li><b>Comment</b>. Not exactly. If Blass and his students are the only ones using that <i>name</i> for the concept, the article shouldn't be here under that name, nor should there be a redirect at that name. I believe the concept to be notable, which Blass's papers in peer-reviewed journals give credence, but I'm not convinced that the name is actually used by wotking mathemeaticians other than Blass and his students.

<dd><b>WP:BIO comment</b> How so? I <b>strongly disagree</b>. First, it qualifies for the "<i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</i>" rule specified in WP:BIO -- Bill wrote many Ethernet device drivers directly from hardware datasheets, and these drivers are now part of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD etc. Second, the article passes the Verifiability test. Third, I was the original author of the article, and I've never met Bill Paul in person, nor have I ever communicated with him online -- so it passes the Biography test as well. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> 20:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whoever calculates the votes, please notice that most delete votes here are "me too" votes, and all people who voted to delete the article do not seem to have bothered to actually read it. Because if they did read it, they would have found that Bill wrote <i>major</i> component of the FreeBSD operating system -- namely around every other Ethernet device driver. I didn't specifically check, but I won't be surprised at all if <i>every</i> single device driver he wrote for FreeBSD was quickly ported to OpenBSD and NetBSD. I also added information about him having started the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Evil_f924.html" title="Project Evil">Project Evil</a> to this article. Moreover, I took some time to contact him personally, and he told me that originally he did want the article to be deleted due to the "infantile humor of certain members of the FreeBSD community", but he also told me that "at this point" he doesn't "really care one way or the other".

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Bill Paul is widely known within the BSD communities and somewhat so in the larger FOSS community, and his contributions are large within the field of BSD Ethernet drivers (as the man pages testify). However, I can find very little other published work, and even very little general content about him (interviews, reports/articles about his work). A borderline case. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicM_3e6b.html" title="User:NicM">NicM</a> 12:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Some people write code (Bill Paul), others give interviews (<a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_S._Raymond_ac9d.html" title="Eric S. Raymond">ESR</a>), some others try to do both. People take Bill's work for granted&#160;— in fact, I'd say he created this society of people that (rightly) assume that whatever Ethernet chip they have, there is a driver for it in *BSD, and no third-party patches are necessary to make it work. And the fact that we take it for granted now, doesn't diminish Bill's accomplishments, it only amplifies them. I still honestly fail to see how this could possibly be a borderline case as far as wikipedia rules or just common sense are concerned&#160;— count the number of FreeBSD, OpenBSD etc files that bear Bill's copyright, and remember that he only contributed to FreeBSD&#160;— i.e. files in OpenBSD etc could well qualify as "articles about his work" part of the rules. And to my understanding, Bill is (practically) the only FreeBSD person that is individually acknowledged and highly respected by NetBSD co-founder and OpenBSD founder and project-leader Theo de Raadt (see Theo's 2001 kerneltrap interview). <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> 16:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You can say that, but the lack of information doesn't improve his notability. He is a borderline case because: although he has contributed a lot to it, the community in which he is well-known is relatively small; he isn't a major figure outside that community; he isn't widely read or published or written about. Nobody is taking him for granted, I have a <i>lot</i> of respect for Bill Paul and his work and I think he is barely notable enough, but the fact is that IMO people who are solely *BSD developers have to have to be <i>really</i> significant—and not just within their community—to be notable enough. Can you really come up with enough relevent material to expand the article to the length of, eg, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_de_Raadt_f80a.html" title="Theo de Raadt">Theo de Raadt</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linus_Torvalds_1ecb.html" title="Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> (I couldn't)? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicM_3e6b.html" title="User:NicM">NicM</a> 07:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The purported <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Evil_f924.html" title="Project Evil">Project Evil</a> article implies that it is a version of the Linux ndiswrapper project, when it was an independent work that evolved orthogonally. I recall vague discussion that some Project Evil code made its way into one of the Linux projects, but I don't recall for sure. Bill is very, very widely respected. He has not, however, published a lot of work or written books, like other BSD hackers of similar background who have articles about them (<a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_McKusick_d7d2.html" title="Kirk McKusick">Kirk McKusick</a>, Sam Leffler, <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poul-Henning_Kamp_c94d.html" title="Poul-Henning Kamp">Poul-Henning Kamp</a>). I don't mean to be unfair, but it seems like one person has taken to adoring Bill and thinks there should be an article about him, and has created it with minimal content. There is, in fact, little non-<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> information to add beyond what is there. Bill is a private person and doesn't have a large public persona or even a publishing history from which to draw even a trivial biography. He also actively objects to this article existing, but that isn't really a good reason to delete it, in and of itself. --<b>juli.</b> <sup><a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlata_00d5.html" title="User talk:Flata">t</a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlata_90d6.html" title="User:Flata">?</a></sup> 22:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see your point. However, Bill is and was listed in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/FreeBSD_a3dc.html#Notable_developers" title="FreeBSD">‘Notable developers’ section of the FreeBSD article</a>, and there are also some references to his persona from some other articles on the networking theme&#160;— he completes the picture. Moreover, consider that most articles describing programmers on wikipedia are rather small, so deleting this article only because of its size doesn't sound right, specifically as it has some relevant description of the subject's contribution to *BSD, all taken from reliable sources. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> 00:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that to single out the Irish for deletion is prejudicial. There should be an overall soultution, but there should be referencing at all of the mobster pages. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As the nominator, I'm completely open to nominating all these pages. I singled out an example, knowing there was a larger problem here. All these lists are indiscriminate, unsourced and partial &gt; all of which are bad for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECornellrockey_19bb.html" title="User:Cornellrockey">Cornell Rockey</a> 05:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Personally, I feel the lists are helpful especially to those editors involved in organized crime related articles. There are both pros and cons to lists vs. categories and I believe a reader or editor should be allowed the right to an alternative. However, among the various organized crime related lists (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Italian-American_mobsters_011e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Italian-American mobsters">1</a>) and categories (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2005_December_30_fb27.html#Category:German-American_mobsters" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 December 30">1</a>/<a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_November_16_a93c.html#Category:German-American_mobsters" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 16">2</a>) proposed for deletion, this specific list has <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lists_of_Irish-Americans_f7bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lists of Irish-Americans">previously been nominated</a> and kept. If you feel the main issue is a lack of references, then a reference tag should be placed rather then then nominating it for deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 05:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is manifestly useful, it just needs somewhat better referencing. -<a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJHFTC_516e.html" title="User:JHFTC">Toptomcat</a> 13:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a list. Also, who decides how to use the pejorative term "mobster"? How could this article ever be anything more than <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>? Prejudicial and unreferenced, no matter how useful one may find it -- <b>usefulness doesn't warrant inclusion</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> references could easily be provided, there are books <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060590025&amp;id=uvDN9yBVBF8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=FeltPKK94i&amp;dq=Irish+American+mobsters&amp;sig=mdTbvdNx1_g4MRymKnOkInSz97A" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060590025&amp;id=uvDN9yBVBF8C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=FeltPKK94i&amp;dq=Irish+American+mobsters&amp;sig=mdTbvdNx1_g4MRymKnOkInSz97A" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think the list is hardly indiscriminate. Certainly prominant mobsters such as <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dion_O%27Banion_df4d.html" title="Dion O'Banion">Dion O'Banion</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Coll_c948.html" title="Vincent Coll">Vincent Coll</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Greene_a667.html" title="Danny Greene">Danny Greene</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitey_Bulger_9683.html" title="Whitey Bulger">Whitey Bulger</a>, etc. are clearly organized crime figures.

<li>The problem is, who gets defined as a mobster? More importantly, why does being Irish matter? Though probably not the author's intention, associating the two smacks of an ethnic attack. And there's no mention of Irish heritage in some of the articles listed, so why are they included? -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 20:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>If you'll notice the examples I provided, with exception to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Side_Gang_5aa0.html" title="North Side Gang">North Side Gang</a> which did include some Polish and German-Americans within its ranks, these mobsters headed or were members of criminal organizations which were predominanly made up of Irish-Americans such as the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westies.html" title="Westies">Westies</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egan%27s_Rats_ac1f.html" title="Egan's Rats">Egan's Rats</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Hill_Gang_93af.html" title="Winter Hill Gang">Winter Hill Gang</a> and others. Organized crime is generally grouped by ethicity no different from <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Italian</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish-American_organized_crime_ecf9.html" title="Jewish-American organized crime">Jewish-American organized crime</a>, each of which have their own lists, and this list includes members of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Mob_1957.html" title="Irish Mob">Irish-American organized crime</a> no different then any of the other lists.

<li>If their ethnicity is not described in the article, how do we know they're Irish? It's this level of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiability</a> that makes me vote to delete.

<li>The references I have provided, specifically T.J. English's <i>Paddy Whacked: The Untold Story of the Irish American Gangster</i> and Stephen Fox's <i>Blood and Power: Organized Crime in Twentieth-Century America</i>, clearly descibe all of these individuals involved in Irish-American organized crime.

<p>Article already speedly deleted as "a7 nonnotable hacker" and then recreated. Even in this version, in my opinion, the article still doesn't prove Doctor Pk's notability and the 50000 defacements that the article say made by his hacking crew (but if the deface, aren't they crackers? lol) and recorded on Zone-h.org, aren't listed there (or maybe I didn't find them, anything is possible). But since the decision seems to be controversial, I brought the discussion here. <i>by <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowolf_0f76.html" title="User:Snowolf">Snowolf</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnowolf_100d.html" title="User talk:Snowolf">(talk)</a> on</i> 02:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> I just get myself register to write this comment, LOvely Work, nice article, excellent note i have never seen article`s on pakistani hackers so open albet its need a little fixing which i can do but i will recommand admins to keep this page on wiki, the link are weak but can be fix and alldas.de is soon comming with their old database so i guess their should`nt be any problem. And Snowwolf do you really know the differnce in hacker and cracker&#160;?? if yes then WOW , if no then try this <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">Hacker</a> or <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is" class="external text" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is" rel="nofollow">Hack3r</a> and ohh sorry i forget yes u know the meaning of hacker thats why u wrote that short funny note and laugh! but now a days the ethical are history try to get the point . pointing out someone`s mistake is easy but make it correct is hard&#160;!! As far as article is concern all the club names i.e. FBH(fedral bureau of hacking) PHC(pakistan hackers club) Gforce flooders or TheBugz they dont need ne refernce or links, u can just type their name on google and u can get the result&#160;!! And if DOCTOR_PK is nonotable hacker then i`ll must say .. Duh .. REad some news&#160;:) ... Anyways My vote is to KEEP ON&#160;!(DOCTOR_PK can be reached thro IRC but ummm i dont know wht ircd&#160;:( SO guess lets wait )<br />
P.S: BTW .. the author didnt mention other pakis groups like cyberwarriors a-i-c(anti india crew) paklords etc may be because he`s updated and knows that these group are finished L33t Hack3x 18 jan 07 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> No keep points have asserted nobility and neither does the article.

There is absolutely NOTHING in the article that is has a source or is cited. The references section is a complete joke, having a minor mention on a semi-notable site does not make you noteable.

<li><b>quick comment to lee Vonce</b>: a conviction isn't nessisary for hacker notability, but it is a quick way to see if they've caught anyone's attention. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Draper_67d5.html" title="John Draper">Captain Crunch</a> was never convicted, but he invented Phreaking as we know it, for that matter the morris worm (widely regarded the first computer virus) lead only to probation and some community service. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 21:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The links are <i>not</i> satisfying, and that's the problem. If alldas.de is not available, we cannot verify the assertions of the article, and it should be deleted.

<dd>Minor characters do not usually need articles no matter how remarkable the work of fiction that they come from. WP:NOTE may supersede WP:FICT but only if the characters are actually notable. Zero sources can be found for these characters outside of in universe fiction. I would merge only as a last resort as these characters are already mentioned with sufficient detail on the main page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A LOT of people seem confused about this. V for Vendetta is not only, or even primarily, a movie; its primary claim to notability is as one of the best-known graphic novels of all time, having been written by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a>, arguably <i>the</i> most notable writer in that medium.

<dd>How about a little civility? I don't think hostility is warranted, this is supposed to be a discussion, the idea is to discuss policy as it applies to this article I am arguing my point of view not exactly trying to undermine anybody. Personally I don't see any evidence that these characters are notable outside of their own fiction. Notability is not subjective it requires sources which at this point are not available. You asked me to provide you with a reason for deletion, but I think it is pretty clear, the deletion policy on minor characters states that if they do not have some kind of notability in the real world than they should be merged. I think that the main V page has enough character detail, but I wouldn't be opposed to a minor characters page that way we could use the pictures which would be nice. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<li><b>comment</b>: If he's the son of a notable person, then he's notable simply on that basis. He's already mentioned in his father's article in fact. Not only that, if he's been mentioned by mainstream jazz commentators, as you so deftly showed, then that gives the lad some notability of his own. Wouldn't you agree? --Lee Vonce 21:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but being the offspring of someone famous does not warrant their own page. Neither does the other reasons you've mentioned.

<li>Notability may have some dim reflective properties, but is certainly not hereditary, as Ocatecir has noted. The children of a notable person may get a brief mention in their parent's article, but an article of their own requires them to be evaluated as individuals, on their own merits. The links I've noted above may <i>or may not</i> constitute independent non-trivial coverage - jazz is certainly not my field of expertise, and I defer to those who know more about the field. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 19:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> The kid is sure a whiz at self-promotion. Such schlocky fake posts of interest questions on jazz boards he posts. However, he does have two albums that appear to have at least sold a few. There are less notable people on Wikipedia. Still, that's no reason to include or exclude him. I can't figure anything out because of the overdose of self-promotion.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am an Orthodox Messianic Jew. True the article appears unsourced at this time, but it is a brand new article. I'd say give the author a chance to respond to sourcing the article. Messianic representation on Wiki is like very minimal (in fact I seem to be the only known regular at this point); and I myself am hardly on once a week. The guy who created the article probably isnt on for durations shorter than mine at the most. If people want sources, feel free to request them. Submitting a brand new article for VfD due to lack of sourcing is not the best way to go about it. It will only serve in having the article probably recreated by the original author who may have totally missed this VfD discussion. Shalom. If someone wants me to provide sources, post on my talk page and I'll make it a priority. If you want a website to an orthodox Messianic synagogue check out: <a href="http://www.rootsofthemessiah.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.rootsofthemessiah.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rootsofthemessiah.com/</a> for sources. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 03:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unless I'm misunderstanding your intent and that of the website you cited above, it appears blatantly obvious that these people make no claim to being "orthodox", and certainly not "Orthodox Jews". On <a href="http://www.rootsofthemessiah.com/faq.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rootsofthemessiah.com/faq.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, in fact, they clarify that they are not Jews according to rabbinical determinations, which indicates that whatever they are, they are absolutely <i>not</i> orthodox.

<dd>Apparently you are misunderstanding what is meant by the term "Orthodox Messianic Judaism" but you're not far from the definition. "Orthodox" isn't a term exclusively owned by rabbinic Orthodox Judaism, however in this case, a relation can be implied and should be. I disagree with your assement of the so-called contradictory "Pauline" version of the Shema. But this isn't the place to debate theology. An orthodox Messianic Jew is a Messianic Jew who has accepted as many practices of Orthodox Judaism that do not conflict with faith in Messiah Yeshua - now I know Orthodox Jews would say all of it contradicts it, but that's just not the opinion of Orthodox Messianic Jews who live it. Obviously this means OMJs reject the OJ view that God can not manifest himself in the physical. So then the definition becomes not one of an OJ becoming Messianic per se, but rather a Messianic becomming more like Orthodox Jews in lifestyle, tradition, and practice. Thus the most obvious difference between a Messianic Jew and an Orthodox Messianic Jew is that the Orthdox Messianic Jew has a religious and theological reason for wearing a kippa (usually the same reasoning Orthodox Jews do), they will wear a tallit katan, keep kosher (some even glatt); study Talmud as well as Torah; and lay tefillin - basically they observe the Torah commandments PLUS orthodox rabbinic traditions that do not conflict with faith in Messiah Yeshua - namely the theological view that nothing oral or traditional should EVER nullify the clear and expressed written of the Torah. The list goes on: they keep beards, grow out the sides of their hair, dont drive on Shabbat, and live a very strict lifestyle. However, they wont care to wash hands before eating for anything other than sanitary reasons, because Yeshua taught that belief that clean food eaten with unwashed hands was failing to distinguish between clean and unclean as the Torah is specifically clear that we should do, and here a handwashing tradition nullifies this commandment to distinguish between clean and unclean because by tradition one is led to think that clean food is not clean to eat if eaten with unwashed hands - but this is only a tradition and nullifies the written commandment to "distinguish" as the Torah distinguishes and not as tradition does. This is a group of Messianics that are a far cry different from Ham-eating Easter-keeping Jews for Jesus who find themselves inaccurately labeled as "Messianic Jews" by outsiders who don't know the difference. In short, an orthodox Messianic Jew is a Messianic Jew who in addition to observing written Torah, also engages in the traditions of rabbinic Judaism as found in the Talmud and elsewhere, where it doesn't conflict with expressed Torah commandments and the principles of Torah observance that Yeshua laid out. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 08:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, this isn't the place to debate theology, but it is appropriate to discuss proper naming of articles here. The statement "An orthodox Messianic Jew is a Messianic Jew who has accepted as many practices of Orthodox Judaism that do not conflict with faith in Messiah Yeshua..." quite clearly indicates that "orthodox" is not a part of the appellation (it also states quite unequivocally that these people are "<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaizers.html" title="Judaizers">Judaizing</a> Christians", or "born-again Christians with a few Jewish practices"). What's obviously being discussed is Messianic Jews, and the proper place to do so is in <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a>. Merge whatever material is relevant from this stub into that article, with proper sourcing, and under an appropriate section heading. It does not warrant an article of its own. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 20:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've reviewed these sources, and it's not clear they support the claims made. A critical reason is that "Messianic" has several distinct ordinary meanings when used to describe Orthodox Jews, which have nothing to do with Jesus. For example, the article that mentions "fanatical messianic Orthodox Jews" in Hebron refers to a group who are fervently awaiting the coming of the (first) Jewish messiah -- nothing to do with Jesus. Similarly, Messianic Lubavitchers refers to a group of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a> who believe that the Lubavitcher Rebbe, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson_07ba.html" title="Menachem Mendel Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a>, was the Jewish Messiah. (See <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechi.html" title="Yechi">Yechi</a> for more detail). Again, nothing to do with Jesus at all. There seems to be a basic misunderstanding about the use of "messiah" and "messianic" in Judaism, which has a very different meaning from its meaning in Christianity. Perhaps this whole article is the result of a misunderstanding.

<dd>Inigmatus? What are you doing? Does adding "Beit Tefilla, however could be classified as an Orthodox Messianic Jewish congregation according to this wiki article." seriously make sense to you? You invent your own personal definition of "orthodox Messianic Jew" and then say you've proved the legitimacy of your chosen definition by citing some website, which doesn't say anything about the <i>term</i> you've chosen nor the definition you've contrived, but then based upon your interpretations of their website contents, you say that according to the definition you've come up with they could be considered "orthodox Messianic". This is a rather difficult to follow, but it's clearly <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a>, and it definitely does nothing to strengthen your argument. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:06, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, you neglected to quote the far more relevant part of what they <i>do</i> say about your term, to wit:

<li><b>Comment</b> Looking at the list of editors supporting delete, you don't suppose this is another case of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwagoning.html" title="Bandwagoning">bandwagoning</a> based on the concept of sheer mainstream Jewish rejection of any concept of Orthodox Messianic Jews - of which I am one? I mean come on, I at least know who I am. The sources provided paint a picture of Orthodox Messianic Jews, and the references provided clearly use the term "Orthodox Messianic" to describe them. One would have to be blatantly biased against the existence of Orthodox Messianic Jews to reject their existence at this point. I hope the admin takes this truth into consideration. The article is noteworthy and increases the legitimate knowledge of the Wiki community about a group that gets the rap from both mainstream Jews and mainstream Christians, and if comments like "ridiculous" and "hoax" aren't enough to raise a red flag over the intentions of some of the obvious non Messianic Jewish editors here voting to delete yet another Messianic Judaism related article, then call me blind. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 22:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The hypothesis works both ways. Any attempt by Messianic Jews to assert the truth of who they are, what they are, and what they believe, is often met by the Jewish editing community on Wiki with accusations of POV pushing, notability, and wikilawyering. <a href="../../../a/a/g/WP%7EAAGF_5ca1.html" title="WP:AAGF">WP:AAGF</a> seems to be a foreign concept to some editors when it comes to Messianic contributions to Wikipedia. Maybe it should be taken as an honor that Messianic Judaism articles are now actively policed by the standard group of "delete" editors above; but to be honest, as I always keep saying in these VfDs that ultimately get concluded to 'keep' anyways in spite of the sheer number of delete votes, submitting an article for vfd is not the best way to go about improving wikipedia; but it sure is a good way to POV push and *gasp* dare I say: "censor" legitimate articles that enhance the knowledge of one exploring the subject. Imagine how much better the article could be if all the time spent in these VfD debates over Messianic articles was actually spent on IMPROVING the article rather than cackling to get them deleted because a bunch of people have a POV that no such belief is compatible with biblical Judaism. <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">inigmatus</a> 22:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Inigmatus, you cannot have it both ways. The above is a blatant expression of assumption of <i>no</i> good faith in the rest of the community. You have no idea what the rest of us believe about anything. Your protest about "wikilawyering" clearly indicates that you have no idea what the term means. Please stop trying to talk about the people who disagree with you here, and concentrate on the subject at hand, <i>i.e.</i>, the article. You have yet to demonstrate that there is any merit in keeping this article, and, in fact, your latest contributions here, and to the article as well, seem to underscore the correctness of all the "delete" votes. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Given that this proposed "Orthodox Messianic Judaism" is a fringe group of the already fringe Christian group that is MJ, it is not in the least unreasonable to nominate it for deletion under <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a>. If it is indeed notable, it should be fairly straightforward to show this - the fact that the article has previously cited sources that would condemn the movement as irrelevant in the strongest possible terms (i.e. Lubavitch Messianics) is ample evidence that even the authors and contributors can't find a way to prove notability and are grasping at any straw that's entitled "Messianic Judaism".

<li>Inigmatus, if you find someone cackling, I suggest a nice bowl of chicken soup. I understand, to an extent, the paranoia you are exhibiting here. However, I do not believe anyone is attempting to delete articles that belong, such as <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a> itself. The article we are currently discussing is a neologism at best, and a POV attempt to create a linkage with an accepted form of Judaism at worst. Either way, the topic of this article is not wiki-worthy as it currently stands. If the movement creates enough buzz and press coverage (by reliable and verifiable sources -- not self-aggrandizing websites and poli-zines) over the next few years, and justifies its existence as a legitimate accepted subgroup of Messianic Judaism -- in the eyes of more than its adherents and fringe elements<small>(not to mention the laundry list of self-contradictions and other problems raised above that make this look like it falls somewhere between <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a>, each of which are unacceptable)</small> -- then the article will survive.

<li><b>Delete</b> If we focus on the article's merits ojectively rather than placing it in the confines of a Mainstream Jewish-Messianic Jewish debate, I thinkthis article deserves to be deleted with some of the key pieces being moved into the Messianic Jews article or elsewhere. The subject of the article is too small to warrant its own entry and would be better served as part of the larger movement (I can think of a number of subsets with the various Reform/Conservative/Orthodox denominations that don't deserve their own pages either). Should the group grow in size and notability, a page can be re-created then. But my second reason is that it isn't really a very well-written article. It has a defensive tone that reads like a member of the group wrote it rather than an encyclopedic objective approach. The sources at the bottom are not integrated well and they serve more to simply acknowledge the group's existence than to further the article. If the page remains (which it isn't looking likely) then it needs some massive rewrites. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerseyRabbi_cf1b.html" title="User:JerseyRabbi">JerseyRabbi</a> 06:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This bothers me, QuagmireDog... secondary sources? The terms is boggling since in any research, you would rather have primary resources. So whatever you mean is unclear. I find much shorter, less interesting articles all over wiki, ever hit that random article button? and do not see these articles backed by "reliable sources". Many wiki articles beg for sources or do not cite any at all. So your argument makes little sense to me; "any relisting without secondary sources is speedied."? Is this a jargon that is spoken somewhere I am unfamiliar with? There is no product given away, it is played on the internet, much like Wiki is not given away, it is used and enjoyed by millions. Both SW and Wiki are free, therefore neither gives away a product, but offer a service. If it were selling a product, would this not be an advertisement and therefore misguided in advertising on Wiki? The article is, in part, simply the beginnings of an explanation for players to refer friends to and say, this is what I enjoy. There are many MMPORGs or whatever they are called scattered all over Wiki as well as just games in general. In fact, the game Half Life got on the front page roughly the same day this article appeared. As for comment above about SW designers making this article. Neither the article creator nor myself are designers, we are players. Wafulz faults the capitalization as if that is something to delete article for. Note in the next comment, the person cannot spell which (JzG). Do we condemn that person or fix it? Hardly a reason for deletion. I am afraid I see little in the Delete comments that really merits deleting an article that several people have already worked on and argued to keep. I will note one thing fyi, just so you understand my vehemence. I enjoy the game and in fact won the first age of the game under the name of Tobionitaru. Valthalas 21 January 2007</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is a tertiary source, taking information from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> secondary sources and some core details from the primary, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> is not usable. No secondary sources and no appropriate award is a failure of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which is why the article stands to be deleted and is the only reason needed for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speedy deletion means just that, deletion without a five-day AFD process, nuke on sight. Recreation of previously deleted material is eligible for speedy deletion. If players wish to refer their friends to the game then that is exactly what they should do, point them to the Shogun Wars website so they can create an account. Video games in general are not under the microscope here, there is no reason that VGs cannot be in WP which is why that hasn't been said - Half Life got on the front page because it is a featured article, IE is an article of the highest quality on WP. All featured articles are loaded with secondary sources, that's what WP is about. If yourself or any other contributor wishes to keep this article, Valthalas, then I'd suggest you try to find some secondary sources (if they exist), because it's the lack of them which is the problem here. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 12:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Some comments for Valthalas:
<ul>
<li>I pointed out capitalization as a note, in case the editor wanted to create a page sometime in the future- I never once suggested it as a reason for deletion. The article should actually just be at Shogun Wars since there is no article under that name.</li>
<li>Using the game , its players, and its website as the only sources actually violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a> and makes it impossible to create a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I suspect that more could be said about this topic. For example, our article on Espiritu Santo (island) which is part of Vanuatu states "Between May and August 1980 the island was the site of a rebellion during the transfer of power over the colonial New Hebrides from the British–French Condominium to independent Vanuatu. Jimmy Stevens' Nagriamel movement, in alliance with private French interests and backed by American libertarians hoping to establish a tax-free haven, declared the island of Espiritu Santo independent of the new government. British Royal Marines and a unit of the French Garde Mobile were deployed to the nation's capital island but did not invade Espiritu Santo as the soon-to-be government had hoped. The troops were recalled shortly before independence. Following independence Vanuatu, now governed by Father Walter Lini, requested assistance from Papua New Guinea, whose forces invaded and restored order on Espiritu Santo." <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> it does not exist yet. All we have is speculation and an announcement that something will/may happen.

Not saying that's the case here, just saying that waiting for more info before creating the article is prudent.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Statements made by corporate executives are inherently "speculative and forward-looking". If actual work begins on the film, there will be press-releases issued and information will be made available to entertainment industry press.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This is Pixar animation Studios. If there are pictures of it about and the CEO of its head company announces it, it is real. Pixar's animated films take 4+ years to make. I highly doubt they will get over 2 years into production on a film and then dump it. I have even heard word about 2 years ago that they were already making models of the characters. If they are that far, it costs a lot of money ot make those models. They are not going to waste money on a movie they are possibly not going to release. Even one of the animators at Pixar said on his blog that he is working on the film after Ratatouille, being Wall-E. This film WILL be released in 2008, no matter what you say and you are going to be proved wrong. And before any film goes ahead a film studio, the chief creative officer runs it by the CEO of the company. In which case John Lasseter from Pixar who is Chief Creative Officer at both studios would have reported it to the CEO of Disney, and he has had the greenlight to announce it.</dd>

<p>I prodded this article yesterday but there was an objection, so to open up the debate I thought I'd nominate. I couldn't find anything from searching the web that lived up to the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> "that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself" - all I found were term papers and wikipedia mirror sites. As there were 1600 hits for the name on google this has been disputed (as I obviously couldn't check every one). I still say delete - but open to suggestions <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmedea_0f30.html" title="User:Madmedea">Madmedea</a> 10:06, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. His name is actually <i>Arth<b>e</b>r Ferrill</i>. He has (as far as I can see) authored five books, three of which have been published by <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_%26_Hudson_d674.html" title="Thames &amp; Hudson">Thames &amp; Hudson</a>, and one of which has been published in at least a second edition. Finding multiple reviews of his books is an easy matter. I get 70 hits on JSTOR for "Arther Ferrill", another 35 for "A. Ferrill". This includes articles and reviews by him, articles where he is cited, and seven reviews of his books. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up◦land</a> 12:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. He is only notable for one thing, but I think that is enough that we should expand on this man who shaped the world, if only in a small way. The <a href="../../../m/d/5/MD5_7f13.html" title="MD5">MD5</a> collision that he and fellow academics <a href="../../../a/r/j/Arjen_Lenstra_e829.html" title="Arjen Lenstra">Arjen Lenstra</a> and <a href="../../../x/i/a/Xiaoyun_Wang_1062.html" title="Xiaoyun Wang">Xiaoyun Wang</a> proved is monumental to the world of cryptography (those https sessions with the bank that we trust) and computer science in general. To illustrate the impact of this, MD5 is still one of the most widely used <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hash.html" title="Hash">hash</a> algorithms, almost a year after this first minor challenge to its fidelity, because it survived so long that many thought it was impenetrable. I acknowledge that those who proved that <a href="../../../m/d/4/MD4_59b6.html" title="MD4">MD4</a> had faults do not have articles, but would like to point out that MD4 was never widely used, as MD5 came out less than a year after MD4, by the same creator (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Rivest_066d.html" title="Ron Rivest">Ron Rivest</a>), so naturally most standards and software quickly upgraded. In summary, academics who break notable cryptography algorithms inadvertently shape our society; software that used the old algorithms are suddenly forced to adopt the new ones in order to keep client confidence. Please note that <a href="../../../x/2E/5/X.509.html" title="X.509">X.509</a> is extremely notable ... it is the foundation of "<a href="../../../h/t/t/Https.html" title="Https">https</a>". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Personally I don't think they are legitimate topics. They are a list of the different type of bets that online bookmakers use: they are at best non-notable product description aren't they?

<li><b>Merge</b>. If they're legitimate, fine. But perhaps a number could be merged into a list of betting/gambling terms?

<p>Spam; written by site's webmaster (Daniel Maldonado as <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualchicano_19fc.html" title="User:Virtualchicano">User:Virtualchicano</a>) for self-promotion – note the use of "we".

<li><b>My Reply</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly object to the term "self-promotion". I did write the article myself because I worried that the nativists and white supremacists would write the article first and fill the article with half-truths and mis-information. I have seen cases in Wikipedia where articles were written by writers from VDare.com and I was simply trying to avoid an article being written about us by them.</p>
<p>I sent an email to a Wikipedian who writes for the "Chicano" category requesting assistance on writing a successful article but I've yet to receive a reply.</p>
<p>I was informed last night to change the "we" in the article and that is what I came in to do when I read my article was marked for deletion.</p>
<p>The changes have been made.</p>
<p>Please reconsider.</p>
<p>In addition, the link to our news website was removed.</p>
<p>If anything, I am guilty of being clumsy and new to Wikipedia. I certainly meant no disrespect and I appoligise for the badly phrased article.</p>
<p>But my concerns remain valid and I prefer to write the article myself than to read a misleading article written by nativist groups.</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely you will ever find "verifiable third party coverage" due to the fact that the word "Aztlan" sends people rushing to silence us. Aztlan is a word that people love to hate. Aztlan is never given a chance to be explained for what it really is, the homeland of the Mexica people. Aztlan is most often used along with the words "myth" and "racist" in a deliberate attempt to discredit anyone who believes the Mexica are entitled to a homeland.</p>

<li>Daniel, no one is trying to silence you. This AfD is based entirely on whether or not your article complies with applicable Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The policies an guidelines here are very clear in their requirement that there be some verifiable level of independent notability about a topic before an article has a place here. There is none that we can find. Additionally, when the subject of an article (or the owner of the subject of an article, or someone who has a strong tie to the subject of the article) writes the article, it raises issues of conflict of interest. That in and of itself is not sufficient to delete an article but that combines with no verifiable notable third party coverage is. Should your forum become notable in the future, defined as being the subject of multiple published independent third party sources, it will become a welcome addition to Wikipedia provided that someone without your level of investment writes it. As it stands, the article doesn't belong. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>What interest does anyone have in writing an objective article about us? Surely you can see the catch-22 involved. What about the link to Urban Dictionary, will that not suffice? It is unlikely anyone will ever write "verifiable coverage" because they believe it would be furthering or cause. That's like asking the growers to write about the farm workers.</p>

<p>Please do not imply that I am paranoid. Even if you were a qualified professional to make this statement you still do not know me.</p>
<p>I am not paranoid and no qualified professional has ever made that diagnosis about me. I deeply resent this suggestion. Thank you.</p>
<p>As I previously stated, I've seen at least one article written by a member of VDare.com. This is what prompted me to write the article myself.</p>
<p>The Chicano Movement was fine but our community is more about a modern resurgence with a focus on aiding migrant workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, our community served as the main "hub" during last years migrant right's marches. Activists from from dozens of groups were using our site to keep thousands of people informed on upcoming events, throughout the nation, and they still do. I often post the information myself as a courtesy to academics, professionals and Latino community leaders.</p>
<p>The suggestion statement that no one has written about our site because no one has heard of it is mistaken and false.</p>

<li>I searched VDare and couldn't find anything about your site and no articles came up on a google search.

<p>I did not say that VDare has written an article about us. I am saying that I was trying to avoid a occurance such as this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Mexican" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Mexican" rel="nofollow">Afro-Mexican</a> , please scroll down to "Admixture" and follow the link "1" in brackets. This link takes you to an article written by a writer for VDare. The problem is that there is no shred of physical or DNA proof that Emiliano Zapata was an Afro-Mexican. The writer makes a comment about his hair as proof. I have viewed the original image and his hair is straight. Also, some people claim that because his parents were from a town where there were Afro-Mexicans living that one can deduce that he was Afro-Mexican. That is also circumstantial, however, but the author leaves the reader believing Zapata was Afro-Mexican. He was not. My daughters were born in Los Angeles, CA where there is a large African American community, this does not make my daughters African American. Although there were and are Afro-Mexicans who deserve there rightfully earned place in Mexican history, Emiliano Zapata was an indigenous, Nahua speaking person.</p>
<p>I simply took the initiative to write the article myself before someone else came along to intentionally write an article that isn't accurate.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to add that we are separate from the above Chicano Nationalist article mentioned in that we do not espouse a "ethnocracy". We believe in a multi-cultural, democratic, center-left nation.</p>
<p>The article I wrote was still incomplete as I fully intended to address false notions of "reconquista" and so on.</p>

<li>You don't seem to get it. You can't just come up with whatever you want and write it on here (there are plenty of other sites that let you do that). Even if it's true, and I don't contend that anything written in the article isn't, it isn't verifiable by reliable sources. Since it is your site, it is natural to think that you would qualify as a reliable source for this information. But according to Wikipedia's policies, you don't. That you are afraid someone that someone will write an attack article about is none of our concern. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 21:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Although he does have a point that neither the <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emiliano_Zapata_0674.html" title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a> page or it's talk reference him as <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Mexican_bbf6.html" title="Afro-Mexican">Afro-Mexican</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatic_Universe_4c86.html" title="User:Static Universe">Static Universe</a> 22:14, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but it has nothing to do with whether this article should be kept or deleted: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, sure the article doesn't meet any of the policies; it doesn't even come close. But what you have to remember is that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_defense.html" title="Chewbacca defense">Emiliano Zapata was not Afro-Mexican</a>. He was an indigenous, Nahua speaker. So he's indigenous, not Afro-Mexican. Think about that. So, if Emiliano Zapata is not Afro-Mexican, you must keep.

<p>I am a bit cautious about nominating this list, because the author is one of our most prolific chess contributors who has made a number of very valuable and highly respectable contributions, yet I fear that the presence of this list is not justified. The list is of "ethnic" chess openings, in the context of the list it means chess openings named after a country or region. Typically <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">chess openings</a> are either descriptive (e.g. <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Knights_Game_8881.html" title="Four Knights Game">Four Knights Game</a>), named after places (e.g. <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna_Game_250e.html" title="Vienna Game">Vienna Game</a>) or players (<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alekhine%27s_Defense_570e.html" title="Alekhine's Defense">Alekhine's Defense</a>). From a chessical point of view, what an opening is named after has no bearing on the qualities of the opening. There is for instance no similarity between the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_Game_031c.html" title="Scotch Game">Scotch Game</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Opening_295c.html" title="English Opening">English Opening</a> even though they're on the same island (the openings differ already on move 1, one is a classical open game the other is more modern flank opening). Some etymological explanation behind each opening name is of course of historic interest, but such information is already covered in the various chess opening articles. In addition, the term "ethnic chess opening" appears to be a neologism, the hits at Google are either to Wikipedia or its mirrors. I'm afraid that this method of categorising the openings appears to run afoul of violating the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy since it "defines new terms". <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:24, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. How about creating a category of "chess openings named after a place" (somebody can probably phrase that better) and putting all the included articles (plus others if they are found) into that? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 12:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator's well-stated reasoning. Our current level of chess coverage is excessive anyway for a general-interest encyclopedia, and no other board game even has close to that level of "cruft". Any effort to put even a small dent in it is okay by me. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:56, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well in the defense of chess articles (I created a number of these myself), chess is perhaps the most studied of all board games as well and there are literally thousands of chess books on the market. It is only natural that it's this board game that winds up with the most coverage on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The individual articles can contain a wealth of information, but the list doesn't have any value. Surely a category would be better? --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 14:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The list contains the opening moves. A category can never list that information. Nor can a category detail the origin of the name, something I think should be expanded in the article and included with each (even if it seems obvious). And, insofar as the nominator's WP:NOR issue you will see that some have references (e.g., <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Defense_b061.html" title="Baltic Defense">Baltic Defense</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slav_Defense_a5be.html" title="Slav Defense">Slav Defense</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_Defense_1509.html" title="Hungarian Defense">Hungarian Defense</a>) so I don't see how they are original research. Heck, I think it'd be neat to include the setup after the opening is done. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 14:27, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh, I am not in any way arguing for deletion of the chess opening articles, or calling <i>those</i> original research in any way. (Heck, I created several of them so why would I want to delete them? And besides my <i>paper</i> encyclopedia even has a short entry on the Caro-Kann) The thing which concerned me was this list, and the way it sorts out the "ethnic" openings from "non-ethnic" openings, it is the term "Ethnic Chess Opening" which I deem as a neologism and which concerned me, terms like "Baltic Defense" or "Hungarian Defense" are most definitely not neologisms. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's OR by synthesis. From <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> "Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C. However, this would be an example of a new synthesis of published material serving to advance a position, and as such it would constitute original research.[2] "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument in relation to the topic of the article." Unless the sources identify openings by "ethnicity" then documenting that the members of the class exist does not mean that asserting that the class exists is not OR. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 16:27, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that somehow this list takes existing A, existing B and joins them, but I do not think it really comes to "advance position C".

<li><b>Delete</b> It's slightly trivial, because there's no actual significance to being a chess opening named for a region.

<li><b>Delete.</b> It simply escapes me why people think a list should be kept just because the items in the list are worthy. I have played chess for almost ten years, and I have spent literally thousands of hours reading about it. <i>There is no such concept in all of chess literature as an "ethnic" chess opening.</i> Take my word for it, or go read everything I've read. The term simply does not exist and never has existed. If you folks feel the information must be kept, rename the article to "List of Chess Openings named after a location." However, I'm happy to suffice with the information in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">Chess opening</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chess_openings.html" title="List of chess openings">List of chess openings</a>. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 17:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The claim to notability has still not been reliably verified. Repeating the point I made at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Talk%7ESouth_Jersey_Radio_Association_f3e7.html" title="Talk:South Jersey Radio Association">Talk:South Jersey Radio Association</a> regarding the Courier Post article: that article says "The South Jersey club ... <i>describes itself</i> as the oldest in continuous operation in America" (my emphasis).

<dd>See congressional record for 1917, the club is listed there in 1917 (ref in article now). Though not a direct reference of the date, the information there is one hell of a support to their claim of their age, also listed in the newspaper article, and also listed by the Milwaukee club's history. With the list of their own club records of presidents, If that ain't enough for you I don't know what to tell you.
<dl>
<dd>From (1917) Radio Communication: Hearings before the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries - House of Representatives - Sixty-Fourth Congress - Second Session on H.R. 19350 - A Bill to Regulate Radio Communication - Part 1 - January 11, 12, And 13, 1917 Page=221.</dd>
<dd>Speaking is Mr. Charles H. Stewart:</dd>
<dd>"...I am here representing the Wireless Association of Pennsylvania, and also by special request the radio associations of Germantown, the <i><b>South Jersey Radio Association</b></i>, of Collingwood, and the Atlantic City association..."</dd>

<dd>This is also a very historical piece in radio, part of this was discussing the turn over of radio regulatory authority to the commerce department and it also includes testimony from Armstrong regarding the regenerative receiver and patents and the effects of this legislation in the face of the first world war and the amateur radio operator.</dd>
<dd>I still say <b>Keep</b> I understand notability requirements are met, even if you refuse to believe they are the oldest club, the club is listed in the congressional record, it hosts a national contest, it is listed in a non ham publication, it is affiliated with the ARRL, it runs a communications repeater. Even if you put age aside it's still notable. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 21:58, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding your evidence for being the oldest continuously operating amateur radio club: this is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. The point is not whether I (or any Wikipedian) believe the claim.

<dl>
<dd>WP:N Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale 13 colonies award; inclusion in congressional record. WP:N was met. WP:N Inclusion in third party published materials. The club has been included in third party published materials. WP:N has been met. We don't even have to talk about their claim of age, WP:N was met. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 17:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mere inclusion in sources is not enough to show notability. The third-party sources have to be non-trivial, because there has to be enough third-party source material that we can use to write a Wikipedia article. According to your description of that section of the Congressional Record, the subject being discussed there was radio regulatory authority in general, not South Jersey Radio Association, which was only mentioned in passing. The VHF Colonial award has apparently been noted by zero external sources<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22vhf+colonial%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22vhf+colonial%22" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and thus information about it is neither noteworthy nor reliable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no sources providing notability, no real claim to notability. Re the question above, IMO the answer is no. The fact that the people you mention were in the group is pretty irrelevant, they did not form the group, the group did not split when they left.

<li>Is the award described in The Crimson impressive? Note that the award moved no journalist -- <i>including the author of that Crimson article</i> -- to write a profile of the Opportunes that we could use to write a Wikipedia article. I think we have to distinguish <i>claims</i> of notability (such as winning an award) from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">actual notability</a>, which is a totally <i>practical</i> requirement: the existence of enough sources to write a good Wikipedia article. Whenever possible clean up, don't delete, yes. But which of the Crimson articles you linked to could we use to rewrite this article? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I think the idea is that the award (Contemporary A Cappella Society of America's award for "Best Mixed Collegiate Song") <i>is</i> impressive — that's what moved them to write the article. The fact that no one wrote a comprehensive profile of the Opportunes (that is readily available via Google, at least) is in no way, and has never been, a criterion for <i>disproving</i> notability. I think that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is formulated precisely to identify "actual notability", which usually (although not always) maps quite similarly onto "claims of notability". I think that many of the Crimson articles provide plenty of information for an article; certainly not an exhaustive one, but at least enough for a stub. And who's to say that another article - like a profile - won't turn up in the (near) future? <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 02:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per national awards, tours, appearances at White House and on Today Show, and Harvard Crimson article.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I disagree; I believe that despite the best attempts, the writers are doubtlessly partial towards their own choral groups, sports teams, and organizations, and I am sure that some of these biases make it past the editorial board. However, this is beside the point. None of the <i>Crimson</i>'s articles really speak to any of this article's non-established claims (hence, claims in violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As Pan Dan said just above your comment, we need to source all the claims in this article, at a bare minimum... and I'm still not at all convinced that it covers a notable subject. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 02:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the paper at Harvard is "partial towards their own," surely the papers in Boston or London are partial toward their own as well, but that does not exclude them as sources to establish notability. A newsletter published by a choral society would not be independent, but the Harvard campus paper is as independent as a paper in a town toward things in the town. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The list does not establish a significant connection between the items such that it would be of interest to those outside a very small group (i.e. Patrickwolfcruft). Merging to the article is not a terrible solution. As Strangelv correctly points out, there is plenty of room. However, a simple list of songs (unlike albums) is pretty uninteresting information to have in any musician's article. As he releases more albums, the list of songs is going to look a lot like article filler.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 23:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure what is unclear about "fails <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>". Firstly, the article fails the criterion "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself." No such works are asserted. Of the references in the article, one is not English, one is a broken link, and the third does not reference this company by name. Similarly, the article fails the other two criteria; to my knowledge, it is not "listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications", nor is the "company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate stock market indices". — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb"><i>talk</i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 00:46, 6 January 2007</dd>

<dd>First, we're referring to a company that has a global userbase. Why should a non-English article be discounted? Secondly, how does this differ from the other aforementioned pages that have not been deleted. <a href="../../../f/w/d/FWD_c926.html" title="FWD">FWD</a>, for instance, references the FWD trademark application (which is hardly an article), the founder's Blog, and a decision that uses FWD as an example of one of many companies that offer the same sort of service (ours included). <a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxbone.html" title="Voxbone">Voxbone</a>'s page references no one. <a href="../../../g/i/z/Gizmo_Project_4803.html" title="Gizmo Project">Gizmo Project</a>'s page references a page of links to client names and someone's discussion on a blog on how cool it is to use Gizmo Project with Asterisk. You've marked the page for deletion. You've deleted links that were neither broken nor irrelevant to the article in question because one didn't work for you and one wasn't English. Your methodology in the face of the other pages and the global nature of information in general as well as that of the service seems... incongruous. I really don't understand what's so different about this page than the others. I'm not trying to be difficult. I just don't get it. Eneref 01:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)Eneref</dd>

<dd>I am sure there are pages on Wikipedia at least as worthy of deletion as this page. However, seeing as I obviously haven't read all of Wikipedia, I can only take each page I come across in turn and determine if it meets inclusion requirements. Arguing that a given page should stay because a similar page has not (yet) been deleted is completely falacious reasoning. As for the references, this is the English language wikipedia, and references in languages other than English are not exactly helpful, particularly in determining notability, where the editors determining the validity of a source cannot be expected to know a language other than English. As for the other reference I removed, the site in question loaded, with a message that that particular content was simply not there. I am fairly certain such a problem would not be limited to me or my browser. If this company has global notability as you claim, it should be very easy for you to find and add reliable, non-trivial, English-language sources to the article. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb"><i>talk</i></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 05:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I obviously cannot provide a link to someone's online broadcast, so I am not sure how you expect me to 'prove' that?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - The article doesn't have much of anything to it, but it definitely meets the notability standards, including independent articles from the top digital music blog on the Internet as well as the largest student-run newspaper in the United States.

<li><b>Question</b> which is the "top digital music blog on the Internet"? can you provide sources for that? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 09:56, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> Sure thing: 1) check Google search; it is quite literally the "top" digital music blog, and just a query for "digital music" puts them in the top result. 2) the Alexa rank for the site is quite high, and its Alexa details also reveal that the Digital Music Blog receives the highest portion out of every one of the blogs on Weblogsinc.com. I have no idea how it ranks in terms of its ratings among the related blogs (it would be hard to gauge anyway&#160;:-) ), but it definitely surpasses all the others in terms of traffic. 70.171.7.246 09:20, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The argument made by the advocate for deletion is on the discussion page to the article (it's not here, obviously)... quote by IP 220.255.26.145&#160;: I was searching for the wiki entry to 'incunabula' when I came across this puff piece. Wikipedia is not a tool for self-promotion. Clearly the inclusion of intimate personal details of what the author did in the 70s and 80s (traveling, sending articles to obscure journals) and a veritable CV can only be known by the author himself. Please delete.</p>

<p>I moved this nomination (from the article's talk page) in an attempt (not a very successful one, since DumbBOT still had to finish the job) to be helpful only. I believe that the article is notable. Some assistance was sought from its subject as has happened in some similar cases. As to obscure journals, unless Incunabula itself is the reference, that's the only reference I see offhand, and it has a respectable number of google hits. I say Keep. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchissel_09fc.html" title="User:Schissel">Schissel</a> | <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchissel_dfe5.html" title="User talk:Schissel">Sound the Note!</a> 19:18, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think we at WP are in some trouble if we rely solely on Google hits or GNews (what is this?) to determine notability. Anyone active before the advent of the internet will receive correspondingly small numbers of hits and Janet Balaskas did most of her pioneering work prior internet. Despite that, Google still seems to find her name 68,000 times! She does not run a maternity products store, but rather an organization that trains childbirth educators and midwives in active birth. Sure, her website does sell some products, but I don't think it can be called a maternity webstore. As for her few books, they are considered by the natural birth movement significant texts. Whilst, it is clear HarperCollins is trying to flog her books, read about what they say here: [<a href="http://www.harpercanada.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0007108176" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpercanada.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0007108176" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>] In all honesty, most authors simply have sites flogging their books - this does prove that someone things that their books are worth flogging. A search on Google Groups will show that she is mentioned many times in newsgroups dealing with natural birth. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 22:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Newsgroups are not reliable sources. At the time it was nominated, it was unreferenced and looked like spam, and the problem I'm alluding too is that
<ul>
<li>A) she appears to fail <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></li>
<li>B) Reliable sources are few and far between (For instance, I could find none).</li>

<dd><i>Comment</i> Newsgroups are not reliable sources but they do show that people who have nothing to do with flogging Balaskas' books talk about her and what she writes about. Surely this helps demonstrate notability? I'd humbly suggest that Balaskas is far more notable and influential than the vast number of popular bands and cartoon characters that seem to dominate WP these days! <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 21:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that's true. Newsgroups are a) ravaged by spam, and b) can be filled up with a lot of posts by very few posters. So many/all of the posts can easily be made by people hawking her books, or by a half dozen people who violently disagree with her. An infinite number of Usenet posts won't get you past <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. If Usenet posts are a measure of notability, then <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viagra.html" title="Viagra">Viagra</a> is more notable than <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antibiotics.html" title="Antibiotics">Antibiotics</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are quite right about them being riddled with spam. But if if we actually read some of the posts we discover that it is a variety of people in a variety of countries over a period of time debating her notion of active birth. So by looking at the content and not simply looking at the numbers a better assessment can be made. What does YMMV stand for? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 22:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It is possible thought that this is a more widely used term than I'm seeing in the context of the Indian business world. Regardless I figured I'd nominate it for AfD to get a community consensus since I'm not the most knowledgable person on this topic. --<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Disputed prod. Reason for prod was "notability lacking from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Created by member of family; a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>". See talk page for reason for removal of prod. Despite entry on talk page, the first two references are references to subject's own website, and I could not see anything of relevance in the 3rd, but I might have missed something.

<li><b>Do Not Delete.</b> I recommend solidarity with Billy Bill. As educated browsers of the electronic superhighway I too am unimaginably confused at the lack of acknowledgement and understanding of Paul Kelly’s achievements. Paul (or "Nigel" as he is known to his friends) is a terribly shy and reserved character despite his superhuman accomplishments and contributions to society. It is worthy to note, nay, essential to note that not all of Paul Kelly’s acclaim is captured in the above article. Case in point in the most poignant of examples being that I would not be here today if Paul Kelly had not somehow summoned the strength of 6 oxen to pull me out from under the ice that day...Rico Spandex 16:05, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think the argument here is that this is an arcane property, but that the definition is useful in creating interesting (i.e. hard-to-prove) number-theoretic problems. The way I read it this is simply a generalization of the twin, cousin, and sexy primes. So a twin-prime pair would be an Euler-1 prime pair, a cousin pair an Euler-2, etc. The unsolved problem in the second section is simply the Goldbach conjecture if p = q is allowed. It q &gt; p were required, it would be a stronger form of the Goldbach conjecture, although I have no idea if it's an interesting one. And from the way it looks it's original research, since no one can find evidence of ongoing usage of the term in this definition, so for now <b>Delete</b>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, no claim of notability, reads like a press release. No indication of verifiable independent coverage that isn't trivial. If there is reason (other than the company's own website and PR, and fan forums) to believe that the topic meets WP core policies, strongly enough to override the policy-based guidelines at WP:SOFTWARE, then you need to cite that reason. There are hundreds, or thousands, of computer game mods out there, and very few have been written about in featured magazine/newspaper articles or have had any big influence on their field. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't feel that these individual articles on cast members of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Class_c6f5.html" title="The Class">The Class</a></i> add anything significant to what is already in the main article.

<li>I don't see any "standards" there. I see guidelines and suggestions. However, the fact that he's listed in IMDB is good enough. IMDB is a credible source and his presence there is verifiable. Also, I don't see how wikipedia is better for removing entries on people of questionable notability. Why not err on the side of caution and include him? --Lee Vonce 16:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Guidelines <i>are</i> standards in Wikipedia. IMDB is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> since anyone can edit it. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 20:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure how you figure that "guidelines are standards" but you're incorrect about IMDB being an "anyone can edit it" source. Information has to be submitted for inclusion and verified by IMDB admins before it will be accepted. That makes it a more reliable source than wikipedia. I'd also point out that <i>many</i> other wikpedia articles cite IMDB as a source. So why can't this article do it? --Lee Vonce 14:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Somewhat weak keep</b> A lot of people <i>think</i> they're not notable enough. A lot of people have greater minds than anything written on fixed medium can possibly reflect. The facts that you can say and can source according to WP's policies don't really make him sound too impressive. I agree in that there's not really all that many facts that can be said about him, except for the fact that if you mention the name to any Ruby programmer, they've probably heard the name. I don't think he has been involved in <i>really damn important</i> breakthroughs, but we do have articles about people who have even less important stuff done. In conclusion, biography articles are boring. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Definite <b>keep</b>. Despite _why's modesty, he is quite notable in the Ruby programming community. His Poignant Guide is probably the most recommended beginner's guide to Ruby after the pickaxe book (Programming Ruby, by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt). And yes, he and his software are talked about in articles and books (including the pickaxe). --<a href="../../../o/i/n/User%7EOinkOink_a997.html" title="User:OinkOink">OinkOink</a> 16:29, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. W(p)GtR is an important ruby book. Furthermore his contributions to Ruby and programming in general are not done. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.49.164.17_f19b.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.49.164.17">202.49.164.17</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.49.164.17.html" title="User talk:202.49.164.17">talk</a>) 10:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I respect why's modesty, and humility, but his contributions to the Ruby community and the web software community in general are significant enough to merit an article here. It's not just the Poignant Guide, but also Markaby, Camping, Hpricot, and maybe sometime soon Sandbox that carve him a small page of record here. We might foster more goodwill with the subject of the article if we respect his modesty and remove the image, though I think it is not inappropriate on its own. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlondike_5814.html" title="User:Klondike">Klondike</a> 07:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Definitely keep.</b> The Poignant Guide is a work of art and a damn good book on programming. It may not have an ISBN number, but I suggest you read the book and then decide if the author isn't worth a Wikipedia page. Also, Why wrote Syck, a library that is included in the Ruby language.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I think it's borderline whether it should or shouldn't be here - but since _why doesn't want to have an article on him, I think that it's okay to delete it... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.208.7.240_57d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.208.7.240">128.208.7.240</a> (talk) 18:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Definitely keep.</b> Besides a great book on Ruby, he designed a tutorial that even other heavier name brands such as Python do not have. I've heard mainframes used to have a 'Learn' program that helped prod users along, and then would help them write new programs without ever knowing a thing about C. (Read: an interactive javascript ruby console that guides users through some parts of ruby... minus the mainframe and 90% of the web can use) <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhreaki_2ef3.html" title="User:Phreaki">User:phreaki</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> These articles haven't been nominated for notability. You can't cite an event at which a move was used as a source. The information has to be verifiable, how do you suggest an editor verifies that not only did the move happen, but also that the move is correctly named? They can't go back in time. The only way that could be verified if the event (and also names and descriptions of the moves used) was covered by a reliable source. If you're referring to citing TV shows, I consider that problematic. How do you suggest an editor is able to verify information from a TV show that has aired and isn't repeated? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 22:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Quite simply put, you're raising policy issues that don't exist, as well as a situation that is ludicrous. WWE <i>et al</i> has been releasing compilation tapes and DVDs of wrestling events for years, meaning that this information exists in tangible, primary source form. While it would be ideal for everything to be available freely on the internet, that isn't how the world works. Some things require you to actually get off your duff and go out to verify them. You should always, always use an internet-based source if you can, but when there aren't any internet sources you use the primary source, e.g. the event. (Or recording thereof) This is permissable under both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 23:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Does Reverse Shining Wizard appear in a dictionary? No. Is Reverse Shining Wizard used outside of wrestling fans? No. By definition it is a neologism.

<li><b>Comment</b> The techniques' respective names and the articles describing them are based on the association between a move observed during a professional wrestling event and the name given to it by the commentator. If the ringside announcer, whose job it is to describe to the fans what is happening with the correct jargon, expresses shock at the "octuple-bucky cokebottom buster" he just witnessed then that is what the maneuver is called. It could be said that all such terms are neologisms, but they do not have to pass <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> because they are being used within the context of a larger work of fiction (see <a href="../../../m/u/g/Muggle.html" title="Muggle">Muggle</a>). I really do think a good approach here would be to treat professional wrestling as one large work of fiction, as other editors have suggested, instead of some scholarly discipline. After all, the "tombstone piledriver" is rarely seen in real (meaning Greco-Roman) wrestling due to its unfortunate habit of paralysing its victims. By that logic, the entire series of professional wrestling spectacles becomes the only primary source. To track down the origin of each hold and throw to a specific appearance by a specific wrestler in one evening's event (whether the tape of said event is "pirated" or not is not relevant to this discussion; "ABC Wrestling FaceMasher XXV aired 32 Octember 1984" suffices) over the course of thirty years of wrestling is a colossal effort; one that is theoretically possible mind you, but not one that will be accomplished in the time normally permitted an AfD discussion.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> the content is legitimate, but so are the concerns with OR and excessive detail. The "how to" guide concern does not strike me as serious because describing the move is necessary for understanding it. However, I suspect that most of those here who, as I did, heard about this AfD from WP:PW believe that no major changes are necessary to these articles. This is not the case. If there are no secondary sources that describe the way these moves are performed--no books, websites, magazines, etc.--and if no such sources are cited, then there is really no way to say that the articles pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. For now, I'd be in favor of keeping the articles. However, if verifiability and excessive detail concerns are not addressed within, say, a month, and the vote were to come up again, I'd be inclined to favor deletion. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 14:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is hardly an indiscriminate collection of information. It is a collection of relevant and often-seen information from a large-scale, mainstream work of fiction that has been in existence for several decades.

<dd>As I said before, I'm in favor of keeping most of the articles, provided that sources are added in something of a quick manner.

<li><b>Comment</b>:No one has mentioned the fact that the removal of these articles would cause disruption and confusion on every single wrestling article on wikipedia; leaving moves and terms mentioned on these articles with no real discription of what they are. Most move articles were moved out from the big five (aerial techniques, attacks, holds, double teams and throws) so that they could be referenced correctly (i.e. <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharpshooter_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)">Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandible_claw.html" title="Mandible claw">Mandible claw</a>) The real problem is that with no central base of information these terms would end up being sorted out with its own article.. terms like <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerbomb.html#Rydeen_bomb" title="Powerbomb">Rydeen bomb</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebuster.html#Complete_Shot" title="Facebuster">Complete Shot</a> currently categorized under other terms would end up having their own articles.. leading us to have hundreds of articles.

Documented, notable, fitting W: policy this and W: policy that. As far as each move having its own page...ok wiki's not paper. Thing is if they all get merged then you going to get the people complaining about the size of the article. The nominator says "Absurdly excessive detail" would they prefer vague?

<li>While excessive detail is not in this case a reason to delete, do you really think that any level of detail is appropriate for any article? The fact that WP is not paper does not mean that any subject should receive an article or that no article could be too long. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 03:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"do you really think that any level of detail is appropriate for any article?" I don't think that is what Xiahou is arguing Croctotheface, but rather the notion that "Absurdly excessive detail" is used as an argument in favor of deletion in this discussion. His statement regarding the non-physical properties of wikipedia was a reinforcement of the absurdity of that stand point. Simply put, editors of Wikipedia shouldn't be forced to take into consideration the length or verbosity of an entry (that otherwise meets the standards and guidelines of Wikipedia), especially when it's being written in plain English in a way to display the unique differences between various items, or creating a entry for an item that might need one due to having a large number of variants or a lengthy history. Additionally, Merging isn't much of an option due to the size of the meta article it would create. Personally, I feel that if articles like <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axel_jump.html" title="Axel jump">Axel_jump</a> for figure skating have the right to exist and have, as far as I'm aware, never been challenged for "Absurdly excessive detail" and "unverifiable original research," why should these articles? <a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVladamireSteelwolf_c290.html" title="User:VladamireSteelwolf">Vladamire Steelwolf</a> 05:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles are claimed to violate policies against original research, neologisms, and verifiability, but the nominator is selectively ignoring parts of those policies that make them inapplicable, as some commenters have explained many times. The rather bizarre interpretation of WP:NEO being used—that a term used only in a limited community and nearly unheard of out of it is a "neologism" in Wikipedia terms, even if within that group the term is understood and the definition widely agreed upon, regardless of how long it has been in use—would mean that practically <i>any</i> jargon term not taught in grade school would be a "neologism".

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles aren't original research or unverifiable. These moves are identified by the television announcers as they happen, and broadcasts of wrestling events where the announcers identify the moves can serve as references. I haven't watched wrestling in quite some time but I believe that there are several broadcasted events each week, one week of TV watching for reference gathering could provide references for a large swath of frequently-used moves. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradtcordeiro_239b.html" title="User:Bradtcordeiro">Brad T.

<p><b>Strong keep all</b> - It sounds to me like the nominator (not a real word i know) has something against wrestling or else NO knowledge of it and wants to cripple the entire Wrestling Wiki project on a technicality, deleting these articles would be an absurd move and only prove to sow that Wikipedia is more concerned with its own petty technical rules than to actually serves its fuction: To be a comprehensive guide. As someone learning Pro Wrestling these pages re a valuable asset, and I for one would have a difficult time without them, I am sure others are in the same boat as me there.

<li><b>Keep due to bad faith nom</b> - it really seems like the original nominator had contradictory reasons as to why they should be removed. A lot of said that the reasons cited are inapplicable with regards to the article's context. Nominator also nominated multiple articles along the same vein, and so the nomination may be viewed as an attempt to undermine continuing work of article building in the subject matter.

<dd>Wikipedia policy doesn't require us to not have lists of external links. It requires us not to promote spam and random collections of links.

<p>non-notable musician, claim of notability was that he was "popular", no discography/biography or anything else that would merit inclusion. Part of the reason for removing the db-bio tag left on my talk pge was "dead Nigerian musicians aren't exactly over-represented in Wikipedia" <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 18:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'll repeat what I wrote on the article talk page (partly directed at the tagger and partly at the article author): "I removed the db-bio tag, as it was not appropriate for the article (it clearly <i>did</i> assert the importance of the subject, and a quick browse of the Google hits confirms his notability), but written references are needed for the article (and any other articles on Nigerian musicians or other subjects the author is thinking of writing). For instance reviews in newspapers or music magazines, or books on Juju music that support the article. I see a few books on Amazon that seem to include stuff on Bakare<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Juju-History-Ethnography-African-Ethnomusicology/dp/0226874656" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Juju-History-Ethnography-African-Ethnomusicology/dp/0226874656" rel="nofollow">[36]</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ethnomusicology-Modern-Music-History-Stephen/dp/0252063430" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Ethnomusicology-Modern-Music-History-Stephen/dp/0252063430" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Books_5e58.html" title="Google Books">Google Books</a> also has some hits."

<p>The result was Keep - Clear consensus. Not certain what "Test Case for films not yet completed means", we normally look at each case on it's own merits and the existence (or non existance) of one article does not justify the same for another article. <font face="Arial Black">--Kind Regards - <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font color="blue">Heligo</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font color="red">land</font></a></font> 03:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't feel it's necessary to guarantee the release of the film in order for it to be notable. The article has the appropriate tag for a future release, which warns the reader that the film is in production and has been scheduled, but the information may change before then. Wikipedia has similar tags for other types of scheduled events. It's not possible to guarantee with 100% certainty that a future space flight will take place (a number of factors could indefinitely delay or change the plans) but an article is still warranted, and a tag is placed to warn the reader. No crystalballing is done, only facts that a reader could easily find for themselves regarding the production. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 19:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All films in development and production are subjects of rumors, unauthorized leaks, and intentional misinformation. There is never a guarantee of completion, but even if completion could be guaranteed, a film can not be guaranteed "notability" in advance. Entertainment magazines, and promotional materials often spread unreliable rumors. Some sources, such as IMDB or Variety can be much more reliable when discussing completed projects than describing projects in development or production... The assumption is generally that these articles are highly speculative and subject to change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By selecting Ocean's Thirteen, I have deliberately selected a high-profile film property, which is being advertised, which is currently in production, which has a promotional page from it's production company, including a teaser trailer. I maintain that even these materials give us little reliable information upon which to build an article, and that the article is necessarily bound to contain inaccuracies, unless it is left extremely bare of any detail, in which case it is not a suitable article for inclusion at Wikipedia. Simply put, this is an article about a non-existent subject. Should Hollywood's hype and marketing budgets be sufficient to guarantee an enyclopedically notable product before it's even been seen by a reliable critic, objective outsider, or in fact by anyone?<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 18:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You bring up some good points here, but what I'm cautious about is the unilateral denouncement of all sources regarding unreleased media (I assume this extends beyond films into other unreleased/advertised media). I believe that it can be notable before it has been seen (but it should obviously exist in some form beyond a rumor). I'm interested in hearing more counterpoints as well. <font color="#0099CC"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 18:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While there can never be an absolute guarantee of notability for a future film, you can be reasonably certain of its notability. Wikipedia does not deal in absolutes; most of the guidelines are left intentionally vague. Notability is one such guideline. While it may be a future film, the notability is directly asserted by the notability of the previous films; no matter what the outcome, if this movie makes it or fails it will be notable as a flop or a success. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 20:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

But if you acknowledge that we don't know the future of this film, whether it will be completed, who will appear on screen, how it will be received, what the plot will be, and that we're dependent on the equivalent of promotional press releases for information on what this film "might be," then you'll have to see how speculative a wikipedia article must be... that is, it must be speculative, or mostly devoid of content. I don't see why we should let Wikipedia become the home of highly speculative articles, even if it has sources for its speculation. Besides, how notable was Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, really?

<li>It is ABSOLUTELY a good faith nomination, I do believe this film is unsuitable for a Wikipedia article, I made my reasons clear, and your assumption is inappropriate. This is a vital issue to be discussed, and I find the reaction of the community rather surprising. I thoroughly read about several instances where people had nominated large groups of articles for deletion simultaneously, for identical reasons, which does not always go well. One of the suggestions repeated in various places was to propose one title first which is representative of the group, and based upon the precedent set, decide how to proceed. I deliberately selected a case which is representative, and which I strongly believe should be deleted. You apparently disagree, but this does not make this a "bad faith" nomination. In any case, I have now learned how remarkably low the standards of notablity are, and how naive the general public is with regards to currently hyped entertainment product, almost all of which it seems is deemed notable in advance of its production. Fair guess that the U.S. alone will produce at least 300-400 films this year that meet the notability standards of Wikipedia, and 80-100 of which will be regarded notable without haven even been seen.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 00:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> This artist seems to be a name within the fuji genre and has quite a few google hits, and having conducted a small resarch I feel confident that he is not a hoax and that he is a notable artist ithin his genre and probably wihin Nigeria in general. Webpages visited mention him as "<a href="http://www.africasounds.com/Valentine.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.africasounds.com/Valentine.htm" rel="nofollow">a well known performer in Nigeria</a>" "<a href="http://bennloxo.com/archives/2004/11/16/king-of-fuji/" class="external text" title="http://bennloxo.com/archives/2004/11/16/king-of-fuji/" rel="nofollow">the hottest thing in fuji right now</a>" and "the king of fuji", and Nigerian news report that <a href="http://www.thenewsng.com/modules/zmagazine/article.php?page=1&amp;articleid=2296" class="external text" title="http://www.thenewsng.com/modules/zmagazine/article.php?page=1&amp;articleid=2296" rel="nofollow">Obesere has bought a million dollar home</a>]. In other words i think the 6th criterion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is met I also believe that the sources indicate that the "large following" criterion of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is met, and the many interviews from independent internet news media certainly attest that "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.". I don't think a discography is a necessity for a musician being notable particularly not within non-western genres, but the article mentioned linked to on the talk page mentions his recording history (I have tried to incorporate it into the article). Most importantly I think keeeping and expanding this article is a necessity in the fight against the <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> - not only western music is notable! I acknowledge that wider set of references would be preferrable but I think that we have to be more lenient on references these kinds of topics - african musicians simply don't get the media coverage that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> does - even if they are every bit as notable as musicians. And the fact that the article is expandable is in fact an argument for it's being kept. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus"><small>tlahtōlli</small></a> 19:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It might be worth pointing out that the edit war might have avoided if the users who believed the link to serialz.to was not valid had discussed it on the serialbox talk page. MrDarcy above actually suppresed the discussion by advising <a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOri_Redler_3c58.html" title="User:Ori Redler">Ori Redler</a> to stop discussing the dispute. [Ori Redlers talk page:<a href="../../../o/r/i/User_talk%7EOri_Redler_0d07.html" title="User talk:Ori Redler">User talk:Ori Redler</a>].

Please see <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>. "The first resort in resolving almost any conflict is to discuss the issue on a talk page." Mr Darcy suppressed the discussion. That is also why I asked him to explain his actions, but he chose not to do that. In any case, this is irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted, I mentioned it only as a comment since you referred to the edit war in your case for deletion. Mark M 22.01.07

<dd>The question of whether the link was allowed or not had been discussed and settled with a clear consensus earlier on the page.

<li><b>Keep!</b> There's a sort of willful absurdity to the argument that Serial Box is not significant because it lacks a formal, well-publicized source/distributer. IT IS AN UNDERGROUND PRODUCT. It's authors/originators deliberately stay hidden, with the file in question being distributed through non-traditional channels. In spite of this, it has seen wider distribution and is much better known among the Mac using community than many 'real' commercial software products. Those calling for the deletion of this entry have profoundly misunderstood the nature of the subject at hand; underground publications, by definition, do not have formal, static, verifiable sources...but there is absolutely no doubt that the product is real and significant. --DeeMT 25 January 2007</li>

<p>Nysted Music can be re-directed to "The Lee Nysted Experience"</p>
<p>Any one of the following can be used for "The Lee Nysted Experience" Band/Ensemble clearly does not "fail"</p>
<p>1.) AMG (World's largest source of music info.) 2.) THE ORCHARD.com Largest digital label in the world signed Lee Nysted...see link. 3.) 99% of all digital sites now carry Nysted Music, including parts of his second album with noted artist Todd Sucherman, drummer for STYX with Wikipedia page. 4.) Retail outlets like BestBuy, and Starbucks are listed as having signed Lee Nysted (See THE ORCHARD.) 5.) Matt Walker, (the drummer) verified musician in Lee Nysted band / ensemble. Same for Todd Sucherman, the drummer.(See Wikipedia.) 6.) Lee Nysted web site verifies all digital sites as does Orchard. 7.) Artistopia verifies the above 8.) Google: Lee Nysted and you will find 15,000 sites that will verify the above. 9.) Several of Lee's songs are played right now on the largest radio stations in the world. (See Orchard) Criteria for inclusion have been met many times over. ("any one of...")</p>

I am sorry for implying that any of you are "vandals." Someone (or, in the plural) has been vandalizing my sites worldwide; not just here. I have little time for this, but it is important for my business that an accurate depiction of what and who we are is entered herein.</p>
<p>My employees (At NystedMusic, LLC.)on my (MySpace site) have encountered numerous "kids" with nothing better to do with their time than to deface and destroy my good name.</p>

<p>Ive been following this article for a little while, the initial speedy request was commented that this article was notable because there was newspaper coverage of the wagon wheel. The creator of the original article claimed that "The players in the story are dead and the businesses closed so it is not a commercial page but rather a page of regional information and a link to the architecture of the 1940s and 1950s." A few days later the <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagon_Wheel%2C_Oxnard%2C_California_19e6.html#Future" title="Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, California">Future</a> appeared, which simply seems to be a plea from the investor or the seller concerning the merits and potentials for future economic ventures. I had a scent of that before the future part was added, but left it alone. Now I think this article reeks of someone trying to make money.<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDUBJAY04_bab5.html" title="User:DUBJAY04">DUBJAY04</a> 23:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC) I may have used the wrong forum for this, but I basically wanted to make sure that this didn't become a pitching ground for a sale of this property, which the article initially was, and then was reverted back to after initial changes. Although I was born in California, I have no knowledge of the Wagon Wheel, and have attempted to edit this article to make it the best possible. I believe in the validity of this article, but am not sure how to keep it from regressing into spam. I guess this was an attempt to let Schafphoto, who previously had his username deleted because it was an ad, know that an article should not be used to sell a property, or whatever his motives are. If possible, I would like to remove this article from AfD, but would like to keep an eye on it to be sure it doesn't revert to pure advertising.<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDUBJAY04_bab5.html" title="User:DUBJAY04">DUBJAY04</a> 23:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination for deletion is completely baseless. Some portions need to be re-written (just like every other article on Wikipedia) to maintain a neutral point of view, so take the time and the effort it takes to contribute to the rewrite <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDUBJAY04_bab5.html" title="User:DUBJAY04">DUBJAY04</a>, instead of trying to get it deleted. The Wagon Wheel is a significant part of Oxnard's history, and I suspect will be a significant part of it's future as it is one of the most visible portions of the city. Take all things into consideration before making such a hasty judgment. <a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmcgov_b426.html" title="User:Dcmcgov">Dcmcgov</a> 09:29, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Wagon Wheel is a significant part of Oxnard's mid-century history, and it is the most recognizable structure in Oxnard for the many people who do not exit the freeway, because it is remarkably unchanged since 1947. In California almost all the freeway frontage has been redeveloped or replaced with concrete sound walls, yet this building stands as a classic element of roadside America. The original developer of the Wagon Wheel died in 2001 and has been labeled the most important developer in Oxnard history, the Wagon Wheel was his first real estate investment, and the Financial Plaza towers on the Oxnard page were one of his latest. The building may well be nominated for the National Register of Historic Places, and as a Oxnard Landmark in the next 6 months, or it could be demolished to make way for a new development. The demolition will bring with it another flurry of newspaper articles and news stories, and make the Wagon Wheel even more noteworthy after-the-fact. In the end, whatever happens to the Wagon Wheel, the people of Oxnard want to know, the people driving on the 101 freeway want to know, and the preservationists and lovers of roadside Americana are going to want to know, how big an audience do you have to prove to be on Wikipedia?--Schafphoto 16:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)schafphoto</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If the city is studying an Environmental Impact Report on the structure, it may very well be eligible for some kind of historic preservation. Even if it isn't, the building still appears to have enough history to make it notable. Maybe some cleanup is necessary, but outright deletion isn't. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 22:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>You guys can say that all you want but there are 1000's of bands on here that aren't as notable as Ghost Of A Fallen Age. Yes the album may be in the "pipeline" but on Smartpunk @ this link: <a href="http://www.smartpunk.com/product.php?item_id=20237" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smartpunk.com/product.php?item_id=20237" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> you can see that out of all the albums they sell Ghost Of A Fallen Age is ranked #10 because of how many people have bought the album on Pre-Order. They are ranked above bands that have been on here for a while and are considered "more notable" just because this band is newer and you haven't heard of them doesn't mean they aren't notable. The band is nominated for this year's <a href="../../../t/a/s/Taste_Of_Chaos_c45b.html" title="Taste Of Chaos">Taste Of Chaos</a> Tour, the band's manager and label are working out details for that right now, because <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alesana.html" title="Alesana">Alesana</a> who are Ghost Of A Fallen Age's label mates have just signed with Fearless Records and the owner of that label runs <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warped_Tour_b64d.html" title="Warped Tour">Warped Tour</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/a/s/Taste_Of_Chaos_c45b.html" title="Taste Of Chaos">Taste Of Chaos</a>. Once again the album will be sold in Bestbuy, Target, Virgin Records, Tower Records, Hot Topic, Amazon, Etc... On Feb 6th when the album is released. Again, some of the bands already on here aren't even sold in a market that large. I think you should do a little more research on a band before you go off and assume they aren't notable.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I agree with everything Norgret1 has said, I think this band has just as much information as any other band on WIkipedia. Also I checked out the smartpunk page and Ghost Of A Fallen Age is on the front page of that site also; featured with notable bands such as: <a href="../../../a/n/b/Anberlin.html" title="Anberlin">Anberlin</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_case.html" title="Classic case">classic case</a> Also, Ghost Of A Fallen Age is ranked #10 out of all signed artists. They are right behind <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_Out_Boy_5bcd.html" title="Fall Out Boy">Fall Out Boy</a> which I'm sure you've heard of.</p>
<p>-Jonnyrebel 07:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
The band was followed on tour by The Lynchburg News &amp; Advance and had a front page article written about it. Their new album was also mentioned in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Press_%28music_magazine%29_c3db.html" title="Alternative Press (music magazine)">Alternative Press Magazine</a>.</p>

I am afraid that by insisting on hiding the true facts you show that you are not interested in having an unbiased discussion in an issue in which you admitted self not to know much about, you will not win this consensus you are after by playing techniqual edit/delete games (you= the sysop who started this process here).

Have you read the Wikpedia guidance: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a> it states clearly there that one should consider editing articles BEFORE and NOT after NOR while articles are suggested to be deleted or being deleted. Its says clearly: "<b>Before listing an article for deletion here, consider whether a more efficient alternative is appropriate</b> " Monty53 11:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Note</b>. I've added related article Web-APP, created by the same editor as the original article, possibly to circumvent this AfD. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 22:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why all these speculations? Web-APP was redirected to WebAPP before the article was deleted. It only shows that you guys did not do your homework, you have not read the discussion og logs of the deleted articles. I demand that all these speculations and personal attacks will removed from the discussion here. Kindly read the discussion at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application</a> where it was stated that BOTH there is a need for an artilce about WebAPP and that a redirect link should be made, to your knowledge this redirect link was added originly by a sysop and NOT by me nor by anyone from WebAPP project. Your appology would be appreciated.

<li>Your apology would be appreciated, I have never blanked your userpage, your personal attack on me should be deleted from this discussion.

</li>
<li><b>Note</b>. I very nearly speedied this when I saw it on CSD earlier, and then again when I saw the tag added. Do we really need to go through this AfD? One of the previous deletion comments mentioned copyvio; if that is the case it should be blanked and sent there. The only thing stopping me doing these things myself is a lingering worry that in spite of its dreadful state at present the article's subject may well be notable; as Robertissimo says it is difficult to Google for. Any other opinions? --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 22:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As nominator mentioned, any means short of an AfD will be contested by the author until the alpacas come home. Copyvio's a tight fit; it looks to be written by the team responsible for creating the program in question. At best it's a prod candidate for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, at worst it's <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 22:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are hereby challenged to provide information of where copvio "right fit", it does not, you are confussing this article with something else someone else wrote 2 months ago which also was not copyvio as he used his own text. What do you mean "it looks like" please come with facts and not feelings, thank you. Monty53 07:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You are hereby requested to check the difference between the letters R and T. The facts are I said the article is not copyvio, my feelings are that you need to <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAM_9e2a.html" title="WP:NAM">calm down and listen to what we're saying</a>. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 11:53, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am trying to, but there is so much information written here that is not true, but sysops have allready decided on the basis of this information to delete the article. It feels like unfair trial. I wanted to add "history", "references" and "security" as well as edit the article, but from what I see around here it would be a waste of time as the decision was allready taken place without even giving a chance to edit the article. So this is quite frustrationg, anyway thanks for noticing this frustration! Monty53 12:01, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> While noting the arguments detailed below, this article still appears to fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. And if this statement is correct, which I am happy to say is a decision for a more senior member of the community, argument is pointless.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 23:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, why all these speculations? The suggestion to write an article about WebAPP was made by several sysops and article contributors here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application</a> Again, I do not see one good argument for deleting the article except speculations and now hanging on a "bigger fish" eg. "a more senior member..", lets admit it, non of the sysops here whom decided to delete the article has a clue what open source scripts are, because if they did, they would just learn that hundreds if not thousands of such articles are placed everywhere in Wikipedia, that those articles are notable and are in the true spirit of Wikipedia for telling about free, open source popular scripts. Monty53 11:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Answers (if I may?)</b> Firstly concerning "spam" and "non notable": The US gov. has just published an article concerning a security patch released by the WebAPP project in www.web-app.net. Why would they do so if it was "non notable"? ( <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-6688" class="external free" title="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-6688" rel="nofollow">http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-6688</a> ) I mean no harm and no personal attack, but I do have a doubt that the person/s who deleted this article at the first place knew what they were saying when defining this free open source script as "spam" or "non notable". Both well notable Roger Moore and Tony Curtis are using this script for free in their work for unicef (for free too). Are they also spammers? The article was there for 2 months nearly and actually got positive responses from several sysops!<br />
Secondly concerning copyvio.: one of the developer of the WebAPP site tried publishing an article where he used some of the text in the "about ino" in <a href="http://www.web-app.net" class="external free" title="http://www.web-app.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.web-app.net</a> it was his own text, so he did not violate any copyrights issue. I am no developer in that site, you can check it your self with a search on my nick "monty53", I started using the script few months ago.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Thirdly concerning personal attacks: I do not buy this "heart breaking" story. To have a personal attack, a name of a person should be subitted on some framing information to who it may be, I never did so, but this person did it himself (above) he also suggested that he was attacked for being belonged to some sort of "anti-open-source conspiracy", very interesting too, I never wrote that either. All I did was quoting few words from his personal page, the explanation for these words was given by him above and NOT me.<br />
Next, I never blanked anyones userpage, this is complete nonesense!<br />
Monty53 23:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b>. The userpage-blanking appears to be a case of mistaken identity. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy's</a> page was blanked by Webapp, who was apparently the author of a previous version of the article. The fact remains, however, that Monty 53 did in fact repeatedly remove the speedy tag from this iteration, despite the template's clear instruction for the primary author not to do so. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 23:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Questions</b>. How many of you read the original article by user webapp? This article was added redirect link by a sysop from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP</a> and was given positive feedback by several sysops, the article was untouched by sysops for several months until suddenly one sysop arrived today and decided to delete it without any warning whatever! Isnt that vandalism or power abuse by a sysop? (or am I personaly offending someone again?). How many of you read the discussion in redirected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webapp" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webapp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webapp</a> DEMANDING an article in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a>&#160;?

<li>Why telling lies? user by the name webapp copied some of his VERY own text and added it in some place in the article. And what has webapp actions got to do with this new article we are discussing? I see that ego is a very important for some of you as resoning for voting.

<li><b>My last word</b>. And after that I will keep my mouth shut. google on a bad day produces 15,000 hits for the WebAPP project: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-50,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22web+automated+perl+portal%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-50,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22web+automated+perl+portal%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-50,GGLD:en&amp;q=%22web+automated+perl+portal%22</a><br />
Please read the discussion in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Web_application</a> where it was originaly suggested by sysop to submit an article about WebAPP. After this article was submitted (by webapp?) it was given a redirect by a sysop and stayed untouched for two months (?). To say that me or webapp or anyone else made this redirect link is simply not true. The original article was given several positive feedbacks and users contributed with more content, this article was deleted today instantly without any warning. The new article placed by me is different, and was also deleted instantly, again for peculiar reasons, if one is unhappy with the content of the article he/she could have demanded to edit it, but the trigger was pulled too fast and another article (complete different one!) was deleted again. I am asking you to read carefully the discussions and articles that were deleted and see it with your own eyes before deleting it again, this aticle is not perfect and certainly needs editing, but deleting it will not serve anything or anyone except some ego or revenge for some unjustified offense who took place against one of the sysops here.

<li>So you are suggesting that all articles that are missing some information should be deleted? Is that the new Wikipedia policy? I guess one has plenty of work to get done with... deleting 99.999999999% (if not all) Wikipedia articles for the crime of being incomplete. Again I have not seen one good argument above for deleting the article execpt for some hurt feelings by one or another sysop. Has Wikipedia turned into egopedia? Monty53 06:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Ego has nothing to do with this. Anything anyone says about this being personal is <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">bollocks</a>. This AfD and the PRODs that preceded it were intended to remove an article that appears to describe an otherwise non-notable website. If the article's content and external links assert its notability (which is defined as several non-trivial, reliable published works sourced independently of the subject of the article) then it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, and by extension, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and may stay. As <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> pointed out, time spent arguing the point here is time not spent improving the article so it appears to meet these criteria. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 11:53, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how to use a Wiki and never have before but this has not only inspired me but the article in question will in fact inspire many, who have never "wikied" before to do so. After reading the comments here, it seems that it's a matter of politics. You either keep the article showing good faith and the acceptance of free will or remove it to clearly display a type of bias dictatorship. Are we saying that all articles start off complying with all guidelines? Are all current articles in compliance? I don't think so. That's what makes this look like a bias and deliberate attack. Shame on you all. I hope Wikipedia does not continue practicing singling out certain articles before they have a chance to grow and prosper as this one seem to have. WebAPP has a history of growth and prosperity and that can only be proven with time. Look at the responce it's causing now. I say keep an open mind and let's not make a stand on the importance of Give this article time! <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedcambron_d8b6.html" title="User:Tedcambron">Tedcambron</a> 12:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedcambron_d8b6.html" title="User:Tedcambron">Tedcambron</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tedcambron_9ec2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tedcambron">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Summary of events so far:</b><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>1.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application</a> contributors meant that since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webapp" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webapp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webapp</a> is redirected to the article about Web_application there was a need to start a new article at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a> with a redirect link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a> (please check discussion at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application</a> for more information.<br />
2.) An article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a> was added as requested and a sysop made a redirect link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-APP</a> too.<br />
3.) Some sysop added a request for instant delete which was changed by another sysop for a request for more contribution as well as editing. After a long discussion and editing the article was accepted and one removed the tags asking for those.<br />
4.) The original article was surviving without any troubles whatever for over a month and was further edited and added text. Presumingly a user by the name "webapp" added some text he copied from the development site at www.web-app.net a text written by him which consisted on one sentence.<br />
5.) A sysop suspected a copyright violation and deleted the entire article (!).<br />
6.) I came into the picture and since I had no backup whatever of the original article, I decided to submit my own (new) article instead and remove these irrelevant tags about spam and requests for delete, since "we have allready been there and allready did that".<br />
7.) One has decided to restart the discussion of having/deleting/editing the article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAPP</a><br />
8.) One has decided to add a vote for deleting of this article without even considering to edit out the original article or teh new article, an action that goes in contradiction to the original guidance of how and when one should add "delete vote".<br />
<br />
My question: what is the point to have a new discussion and vote if we have allready been through this! If you guys decide yes/no and tomorrow one sysop will have a bad day (as it happened in this case) and will decide to delete the entire article because some small editable issue what does this discussion above worth? Can any sysop overrule earlier discussion and turn up side down the entire democratic process in Wikipedia? How many more times will we need to go through this deleting discussions? This makes no sense at all.Monty53 19:29, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the articles' nominator for deletion (and as one not involved in the subject at all until I added a speedy tag to one version earlier this week), all I can say is that, despite the lengthy defense of the subject, no one has done the simple thing, if it is possible, and added references from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that help establish its <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, which would in turn help one of the two meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (with the other, presumably, then being turned into a redirect). In other AfDs in which I have been involved, this is often a sign that such sources are not available. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 19:42, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see the strategy, since no one here realy has a clue what open source scripts/projects are, "lets make them sceptic by minor techniqual issues and they will agree to delete". I have a surprise for you: sources references, history and more will be added and that should not be diffcult, I got approx. 15,000 hits in google when searching for the term "Web Automated Perl Portal". But why couldn't you ask for this BEFORE you started the deletion process, do you expect me to produce all this with a knife over my head? Is that a new Wikipedia policy? Monty53 19:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also see a strategy. If one decides to take an openly objective view, then the comment is quickly nullified by defamation of the poster by labeling them as some kind of "single purpose user". Treating people in this fasion makes an intellegent person reach a conclusion that there's been a "click" formed in wikipedia and outsiders aren't welcome. I am a human being not a sysop here. Is this what it's all about? Is someone on a self centered mission of sorts? I do have experience with this type of behaviour and can help out but the first step is to own up to the real issue. This is not an uncommon practice but will impede the prosperity of any function and everything conected with it. I hope this helps. If anybody needs help understanding what I've mentioned, please ask. I have a tendancy to believe that most people can see things from a hightened level. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedcambron_d8b6.html" title="User:Tedcambron">Tedcambron</a> (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Ego Challenge</b> I hereby challenge the sysops above whom voted and excuted "delete" to delete these two similliar articles at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phpbb" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phpbb" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phpbb</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaBB" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaBB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaBB</a> reason: lack of resources, copyrightsvio (they also copied pasted text from their original sites), and nonnotability. Needless to mention that WebAPP is not less popular open source and free cms portal script. After doing so, come here and tell us that you have no plans of converting Wikipedia into Egopedia. Before I forget, YaBB and WebAPP are sister scripts they departed from each other 5 years ago. phpBB has by the way implemented doorman security idea (which they got by inspiration from WebAPP). Ok no time for talks, sysops show us that you have guts! Monty53 21:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>meet the criteria for deletion. I don't think they should be candidate for this either. Are there more? Probably, but let's look at this with an open mind and understanding that people are a complicated creature and we must control our inherent emotions for the good of mankind. I'm sure that once a decision is made we can move forward and that's really what everyone wants to do. Now the question is, will the WedAPP article be given the same amount of leaniency as other articles or will the article be deleted which, in itself, make for an interesting article.<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedcambron_d8b6.html" title="User:Tedcambron">Tedcambron</a>(UTC)</p>

<dd>I stand corrected. Neither article establishes notability. Neither has reliable third-party references. But back on-topic: I am withholding my keep vote pending <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary sources</a> that establish notability. The <i>Kentucky Lake Times</i> article sounds interesting, but the original apparently has gone missing and it is impossible to know what it may have said. The alert of a security problem doesn't do it for me either; Symantec doesn't rate the risk at a particularly high threat level. Has anyone else written about this software? I find the behavior of the defenders of this article, including the recent delete of the AfD notice, disappointing. If more energy continues to be put into contesting and disrupting the process, I will conclude no sources are forthcoming and add my support for deleting the article. <font color="purple">✤</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 15:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am afraid it is no reason for a party, this guy means business, he will delete YaBB!. Gentlmen I withdraw back my challenge, please do not delete them. YaBB can be improved so can WebAPP, phpBB is so bugged (the code) so it is a service to the public if you delete it, phpBB websites is defaced by dozens everyday. But again this is about the article content, and not the source code. But seriously if we are to discuss notability, please check the forumboards on <a href="http://www.web-app.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=forum&amp;board" class="external text" title="http://www.web-app.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=forum&amp;board" rel="nofollow">WebAPP forum support</a> there are over 10,000 well noted posts there by several thousands webmasters from several thousands websites who happened to use the WebAPP free, open source script, its still not the hundreds of thousands, who happen to use Wikipedia, but soon..

<li><b>Request for guidance</b> It appears that one or two sysops here provided false information while deleting important information. It looks like one is trying to create a case for reasons that do not follow Wikipedia policy and guidance, and use these actsin support of representing the case. I am considering to complaint against this unacceptable actions and ask for help in forwarding a complain. Monty53 12:17, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> It has been cited a little or non interest whatever by the sysops to discuss the suggested proposal for delete. It was also cited non or very little interest of the sysops to check the logs, original article and updated versions. The only sysop that keeps posting on the case has at start mentioned that he lacks knowledge in the field and asked for help, this help was not provided to him by anyone yet except the article contributors. I therefor ask you (the sysop whom started this discussion) to kindly dismiss the case. Thank you Monty53 13:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>What's really going on here?</b> It seems that once again I find a serious decision not based on the dynamics of real life, but on "kaotic control". I've studied kaotic science and can explain that more if need be. We have an example of all defenders being categoried as one group and that goup gets labeled in an udesireable fasion. This is not acceptable in the real world as people are individuals and everyone deserves a human right to be unique in thoughts and opinions. I also take exception to the following statement:</li>
</ul>
<p>"If more energy continues to be put into contesting and disrupting the process, I will conclude no sources are forthcoming and add my support for deleting the article" If I read this at face value it states that a decison will be based on a condition that has little to nothing to do with the subject. I don't know how wikipedia works but for a decision to not be contested would be indigent of a dictatorship. Not that there's anything wrong with that type of political system. It's just not widely accepted. To state that anything I may have said as disruptive is debateable. I've only tried to help out a worthy cause. If helping the decision making out by contesting a decision is not acceptable here, then I stand corrected and I appologize for any inconvinience but too conclude "no sources are forthcomming" because of it, is deplorable. It's a completely different subject and should not be deluted to make a point. Let's also take a look at how the article has continued to grow not knowing if it will ever be accepted. That should speak volumes. Most people would have given up. Living in uncertainty is not anything I wish on anybody. Gentlemen, please do unto other as you would have done unto you.<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedcambron_d8b6.html" title="User:Tedcambron">Tedcambron</a></p>

<li><b>To JonHarder</b> You are the first sysop to delete the article because you assumed that it was copied from the about section in www.web-app.net (information I got from user webapp), you meant that it was a copivio issue, but it was made clear to you that the poster "webapp" has written the original article and he can not violate copyrights by copying from himself. Why do you allow another sysop complicating the issue even more? According to webapp you asked him to simply edit the original article not to start the 3rd ww. I think that you ought to stop this discussion because it has started by a misunderstanding. And could have been avoided if one would think (ask for editing) before acting (deleting) which is infact the recommended policy from Wikipedia in such issues as you must know. Monty53 21:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I've looked at the links provided in the article, and see only one that is a media article (announcing the release of WebAPP) ... the others seem to be download sites and similar. Of course, if I'm wrong and better references are added that do show notability more conclusively, then it shouldn't be deleted. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 21:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

But again this is not the issue! There was an article there from before that was approved by several sysops. The discussion here started because of a misunderstanding concerning copyvio and not notability. webapp copied one sentence from his own article on another site, and a sysop that cited that thought that the article was a copyvio, but one can not have a copyvio when copying from oneself! Are the people that vote here really check all the details when they vote? If not, please do. Thank you Monty53 21:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note to the delete nominator</b> You were saying that "ballot tags" is a usuall thing to have in such discussions, this is not correct. There are hardly two articles suggested for delete with this tag (out of hundreds!): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_18" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_18" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_18</a> Thus, it is not a common thing to have. I know you were unhappy about this discussion here at the first place and tried several times deleting the article without a prior discussion or giving a chance for editing.

<dd>I have "point", is this why you blocked my ip there now? This is a clear vandalism, you removed the link to Wikipedia article where it was suggested at the first place to make this article. It is a very important link. And you removed it without even discussing it with the article editors, shame on you. You are abusing your power as a sysop. You also removed an important message at the top of the article with important information. This are very cheap tricks to win arguments in. Monty53 22:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>My ip is blocked for no justified reason by a sysop</b> How sweet, I am being asked to edit the article so it will comply with some (new) ideas a sysop discovered after the article was mistakenly deleted for alleged copyvio. And while doing so, I found out that another sysop deleted an entire links section on the article (clear vandalism) and also ban my ip so I can not do any editing at all. Is this the way Wikipedia is working in? I doubt it. I think that I am being tortured by few kids on the block, I just don not understand how they ended up with sysop pistols in their hands, who gave then this power. <b>FOR THE LAST TIME I AM ASKING, HOW CAN I GET A SYS ADMIN TO COME HERE AND SEE THIS POWER ABUSE BY ONE TWO SYSOPS HERE.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I suggest you find a better reason to nominate this article for deletion; official websites for actors and actresses of <i>any</i> variety are some of the <i>most</i> reliable sources for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verfiable</a> information. Currently the article passes both <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with flying colors. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 00:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wrong. The official sites are the <i>least</i> reliable sources for <i>this</i> variety of actress. The biographies that pornographers publish are almost always complete fiction, made up by the people who sell the magazines, videos, DVDs, and so forth, to accompany the pictures/films. For example: The same simple set of pictures of the same person could be "Erica, a 19-year-old co-ed from Ohio" and "Ustenia, 18, Czech Republic" in two different publications, according to the target market. This is because the people photographed usually do not want their true biographical information published, because of the nature of the industry that they are in. <i>They are, by deliberate choice, unverifiable.</i> The only source of biographical information that this article cites is from a web site that is advertising DVDs. We have no way of knowing that this web site is not doing just the same as what other such pornographers do: making up biographies from whole cloth.
<p>For a particularly amusing example of how unreliable the purported biographies in these advertisements are, consider <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/6838719" class="external text" title="http://www.blogger.com/profile/6838719" rel="nofollow">this advertisement</a>, <i>equally as (un)reliable as the web site that the article cites</i> (since it is simply yet another "official" advertisement), where the subject of this article is stated to be <i>male</i>. There is no fact checking going on here, and this example alone should convince you that truth and accuracy is not the intent of these web pages. The pornography industry not only has no reputation for fact checking and accuracy, it has entirely the opposite reputation for making false biographies up. <i>These are not reliable sources. They are advertisements and most likely complete fiction.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In reply to Uncle G's point about biographical notability criteria. The relevant one is this:
<dl>
<dd>Notable actors [...] who have appeared in well-known films [...]. Notability can be determined by:</dd>
<dd>[...]
<ul>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>[...]
<ul>
<li>Name recognition</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I would argue that the films listed are well-known, at least within their genre (in fact, I understand they are considered by some to be genre-defining). There does appear to be an active fan base, and Jensen is described in numerous sites as a cult figure (although none, unfortunately, are reliable sources). Name recognition is the argument I was building upon with the large number of hits mentioned above. A significant proportion of those hits are not advertising. Unfortunately, none of the non-advertising sources appear to be reliable, so this may be destined to failure anyway, but I am sure that *somewhere* sources exist. Where did the information we have here come from anyway? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:06, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
