<li><b>Keep</b>. 'Talk like a Pirate Day', which I notice does have an article here on Wikipedia, was also made up one day. It does not, as far as I can tell, have any importance whatsoever.

<li>Quintus, I try to understand the effort you put in FTE Day and the significance it may have for you, but have you ever read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">the policy about notability</a> in Wikipedia? For instance the fact that a topic is considered notable, and so suitable to be included, "if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other"? We are not questioning FTE Day in itself (or perhaps someone has, but this is not the point). The fact is, something is notable (be it a song, a crime or an event) if it is widely known, referenced and studied. Give yourself and FTE Day time to grow and become renowned. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 12:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I completely understand where you are comming from, but i doubt that it is going to get more renound then it already is. To me, it seems like being mentioned on national television seems to qualify it as notable. I agree it is still a bit obscure, but there are many other more obscure articles on wikipedia. Why argue over this one when it HAS been mentioned on national television. Probably a few hundred thousand people heard it announced on the TV. It is true that probably reletivly few have taken it to heart, but there is a group. And since it was mentioned on comedy central, I think it is notable enough for wikipedia. IMO. -- <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintusMaximus_09d5.html" title="User:QuintusMaximus">QuintusMaximus</a> 12:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

It's even been officially declared by the governor of the state of California and the mayors of the cities of San Francisco and Chicago, and is being sponsored in part by the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange_421d.html" title="Chicago Mercantile Exchange">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a> magazine<a href="http://www.miltonfriedmanday.org/press.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.miltonfriedmanday.org/press.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.
