<p>I can't seem to find this anywhere, so I'll ask here: What's normal ettiquette for how long you should wait after an article survives AfD before renominating it? There is an article which survived three months ago which needed some real improvement, and nothing has been done to improve it, despite its being tagged for improvement. I believe, now as then, that the article isn't needed, but I don't want to nominate it yet if the general consensus is that three months is too short. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 03:32, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide</a> has some background on this topic but the short version is that there is no hard-and-fast rule. It's been proposed several times but any hard rule is likely to do more harm than good and just subject us to even more wikilawyering than we already have. That said, premature nominations are generally shouted down pretty quickly. Here are the general rules I use:
<ol>
<li>If the situation has changed (new evidence, different facts, sources found to be fraudulent, etc), an immediate renomination may be appropriate.</li>
<li>If the "keep" decision was conditional (such as "keep because John said he'd clean it up") but John shows no signs of actually working on the article, a renomination within a few months is entirely reasonable.</li>
<li>More generally, 3-6 months seems to be the accepted period for a reconsideration of an article.</li>
<li>Decisions closed as "no consensus" can usually be reconsidered a bit earlier than decisions which were explicitly closes as "keep".</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Regardless, be very sure to provide links to the previous discussion(s) in your deletion nomination and to explain why you think that a reasonable period has passed in this specific case. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> Please explain what you call "unique google hits".

<ul>
<li>Google is acting really strangely! Try the search "game freaks 365". It returns 140,000, but then try to click on the 6th or 7th page- the results then reveal that there are only 77 unique hits. I definitely tried this search a week ago and it wasn't acting funny like it is now- it just returned 53 unique hits. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnpseudo_5ea4.html" title="User:Johnpseudo"><b>johnpseudo</b></a> 15:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmm.... I kept clicking and it got to page 30 and said, "291 - 296 of about 387". I don't understand the relevance of this. If you put wikipedia in google and go for unique hits, it gets "Results 21 - 30 of about 33", which is very little</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Can someone explain the whole unique google hits? John had almost explained it to me and then I tried it on Wikipedia for unique google hits and seeing so few when it's I think the 3rd highest pageranked site really threw me off. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 04:24, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm... google for "wikipedia" gets "Results 561 - 567 of about 280,000,000". wikipedia.org gets "Results 821 - 829 of about 174,000,000". I'm not sure how I got the first one.

<dd>140,000 is the total hits, but Google by default shows only unique hits. So, you need to go to the last page, and click the <i>repeat the search with the omitted results included</i> link. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>In the example above, "game freaks 365" returns 140,000, but when you reach the 6 or 7th page, there are only 77 unique hits, right? Well, the 77 are the unique hits, the 140,000 are hits that are found in the same sections of the sites (in example, in a forum you may get one hit, but when you expand the search results, you may get 50 or 60 hits in a single thread of the forum). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 06:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the range of unique google hits to tell if a website is not notable vs. partially notable vs. clearly notable vs. super-notable? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 06:20, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test</a> for all the gory details. The short answer is that 1) the large number (280,000,000) is only an estimate, 2) the maximum possible returns from a google search are capped at 1000 and 3) duplications within that 1000 are suppressed by default. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, but it doesn't say what is the right number that a google unique test should have to determine notability. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 09:49, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Deliberately so for several reasons. First, the quality of the hits is far more important than the quantity. 5 hits in scholarly journals could be enough to establish notability but 1000 hits in blogs and other self-publications are probably not. Second, different topics are subject to different degrees of skewing in their on-line coverage. 1000 hits about a modern-day pop star says, well, relatively little. 15 hits about a 17th century musician, however, is significant. Third, the way Google returns results can skew the evaluation. That's why the google test must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and used with great care.<br />
In my experience, the Google test is more useful as a negative test than a positive one. For example, if someone claims to be a notable pop star but google finds only a few thousand hits and most of them trace back to a few dozen blogs, that's clear evidence that the person has <b>not</b> yet achieved popular status. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The answer is there is often *no* way of knowing the number of unique Google hits. Google gives the number of unique hits that exist within the top 1000 results. That produces absurdly low results for very some popular terms. It is also tied intimately with Google's ranking alogorithm, which happens to be a trade secret. So, for Google raw hit counts below 1000 we might say its "low" depending on certain factors. But if its over 1000, we really can't say much. In any event Google hit counts (unique or raw) never indicate (or disprove) notability. Anybody arguing they do, should read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and also check a dictionary. It may be good to remind some people that notability and encyclopedias did exist prior to Google. And beleive it or not, there are high quality well researched publications that aren't given away for free on the Web to every person who's mastered Google. Seriously, there is. We want good articles, which require multiple independent reliable sources, that cover the topic non-trivially. That has nothing to do with Google hit counts. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 01:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Rob comment that this doesn't matter. The thing to get notability is multiple non trivial sources. 10K google hits may be blogs and thus not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. 2 google hit may be Time magazine and the Guardian. Comments about Google is helpful in an AFD discussion if for no other reason as to prove you took a look rahter than agreeing with the previous commenters.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 16:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Don't agree completely. A new band which claims to be very popular but has no hits outside its MySpace page is very suspect, and in such a cse Google is a very good indicator of notability. A battle between two cities in 1438 with only 2 Google hits may still be very significant though. A low number of Google hits, tied with the topic of the subject (recent, pop culture), can be a very good indicator of lack of notability (but indeed, even then it can be overruled by other reliable sources). On the other hand, a high number of Google hits on its own is very rarely an indicator of notability, since they can not be adequately checked. And distinct Google hits are a good way of showing that while 400 Google hits can look impressive, they only come from 12 distinct websites or so. Google is a very useful tool, for providing sources, but also for a first indicator of notability, if used wisely and with caution. But all people saying that 'X may have 50,000 Google hits, but only 120 distinct ones' must be shown their error for this misuse to stop (or lessen). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The process for reinstating a deleted article is being circumvented. The article for one "Allen Greenfield" was deleted as it was deemed that the subject was a "non-noteworthy person." Apparently, some of Mr. Greenfield's associates are attempting to recreate the article under the heading "T. Allen Greenfield." If I am to understand correctly, if they had admin permission to do this, the original article would be unlocked and they could introduce the subject under its old heading.

<p>In my opinion, it seems ludicrous that users are claiming this webpage in non-notable, considering the facts brought out on the AfD.</p>
<p>Also, there is a small group of like minded editors who actively make the same decisions on AfDs who are stating their opinion on this AfD.</p>
<p>This entire AfD is a bad faith nomination. Even User:Hipocrite, who often makes comments in tandium with this group, admits on the AfD that it is a bad faith nomination.</p>
<p>I know bad faith nominations have been closed before, can I solicit a third opinion about this AfD?</p>
<p>Caveat: To be open about who I am, I have been in a bitter edit war with the nominator and his small group of like minded editors for some months.</p>
<p>This is why I think a neutral third opinion on this issue is really needed. Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 17:50, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If neutral opinions are needed, simply leave the discussion open. Others will see the discussion and join in. If the facts are as clear cut as you think they are, the decision will be clear. Leaving the discussion open (and the article tagged) for a few days is a small price.</dd>
<dd>We do have a mechanism for speedy-closing truly abusive nominations - nominations which are patent vandalism. This does not appear to qualify. It may be controversial and you may disagree with the nomination passionately but in the end, speedy-closing the nomination often ends up inflaming the controversy, not quelling it.</dd>
<dd>I commend you for your recognition that you are too close to the dispute to decide the issue yourself.

<dd>I would like to better understand the process. The nomination states 0 google hits, which its clear they did not even attempt to search for the website as they are familiar with CommonDreams as they have critisized it as a source in the past. Is the nomination suppose to be what the discussion is about, for instance can I nominate articles with something completely wrong, then hope someone else makes a valid point later? Is the nomination reason taken with anymore weight then anything else? is it just a "first word in" on the topic kinda system? Any information you can offer would be appreciated. Thanks.

<dd>Thanks User:Rossami, for the 15 months I have been on wikipedia, I have been really troubled at how wikipedians can work so hard on an article, adding well referenced material, and how easy it is for someone else to remove content.</dd>
<dd>Especially troubling are policitically motived AfD's, which in my opinion, this group seems to participate a lot in.</dd>
<dd>Granted, there is a less organized group of liberal editors who often fight these deletions, but the stark difference between ourselves and this group who often deletes political articles, is that we are attempting to <b>keep information on wikipedia</b>, whereas this other group wants to delete information which is contrary to their own POV.</dd>

<dd>Generally, the closing admin is expected to ignore all of the false or poorly reasoned opinions, whether they are keep or delete. If the nomination is false, that's just one more opinion that doesn't count, IMHO. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 03:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've now come across a number of AfD discussions where the nominator did not notify the article' originator and contributors and I also forgot it myself. Fortunately, there is a bot. However, I think the current layout of the AfD interactions does not help to remind editors, since the suggestion is some place below the highlighted colored 3-step instruction. Since many users will not read beyond step 3, and since this step is actually about notification, I would suggest to include already there a hint to also notify other interested parties (with a link to the more detailed section). <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 13:06, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've looked through the last 8 or so archives and didn't see anything on this, so I'll venture out for an opinion.</p>
<p>I've been adding the delsort templates in chronological order - but find that in long discussions they tend to get lost in the discussion. As they're not technically part of the discussion, is there any problem in putting them at the top, just under the nominator's rationale, no matter when they're added? I've noticed this a couple of times, and it seems to be a bit more logical place to put these templates, rather than breaking up the "flow" of the article. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 02:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By providing independent sources which have mentioned this game in a non-trivial manner. I could set up a website with a game, but it wouldn't automatically deserve an article. If we can only source something directly from the subject in question, there is no way to know whether what they are saying is accurate. And the existence of other articles does not mean this one should also exist; Wikipedia is (by its nature) not consistent. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 15:32, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I see a number of AfD's, especially on webcomics (that in the AfD become well-sourced and get a keep), that are being put up for AfD as a replacement for a source tag. It's a waste of a lot of people's time really, and a waste of the Wikistress it causes to some people in some cases.

<dd>No, unfortunately. We can tell people "please search for sources before nominating", but if they choose to ignore that, we really can't do anything about it. Because for some articles, no sources exist, and those should be deleted.. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If the unreferenced tag wasn't motivating the editors, and the AfD did, I wouldn't see it as bad necessarily. I think this has to be on a case by case basis, because the description you are giving is vague and general. Is it a particular editor making all these AfDs? Is it a particular editor responsible for creating the unsourced articles in question? If not, I don't think there's anything that "can be done" per se. <font color="#00688B"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 22:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's one thing to send it through AfD after some time with an unsourced tag, but I think his issue was people who just skip straight to AfD, without making any attempt to get sources. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 22:10, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It depends. If the article is a month or two old, and has only a few edits, then yes, it needs some tags. If it's from 2004, and has a hundred edits, and no one has bothered to add any sources, there likely aren't any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Tag it anyway, but be expected for the tag to sit there and generate nothing. Regardless, if tagged, people should have a month or so , maybe two, to find at least a couple of good sources. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 00:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a nominator of a few webcomics recently, I can guarantee that I had searched for sources before nominating, but of course I can't access all possible (offline) sources. Looking at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a>, I can see no examples of webcomics that were clearly kept after sources were added during the AfD. The closest may be these ones from late September (<a href="../../../c/y/a/Cyanide_and_Happiness_480a.html" title="Cyanide and Happiness">Cyanide and Happiness</a>, no consensus AfD, not really a keep), and early November (<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everybody_Loves_Eric_Raymond_0b71.html" title="Everybody Loves Eric Raymond">Everybody Loves Eric Raymond</a>, again a no consensus, not an outright keep). Furthermore, there is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Suburban_Jungle_ad5a.html" title="The Suburban Jungle">The Suburban Jungle</a>, no change between start and end of AfD, no consensus. So, of 18 "open debates at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics</a> page, four ended in no consensus, and all others were deleted: none of them ended in a clear "keep". Which of those AfD's should not have happened? Looking through all the closed cases there, only one was an incorrect AfD (<a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregular_Webcomic%21_9265.html" title="Irregular Webcomic!">Irregular Webcomic!</a>), almost all the others were deleted after the AfD. Again, where's problem? On the contrary, the major issue seems to be that we have loads of non notable webcomics and that <i>not enough</i> of them are taken to AfD. We can even see that of the 46 articles considered "OK" by the project, 11 already have been deleted!</p>
<p>For the moment, we have <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starslip_Crisis_f4b4.html" title="Starslip Crisis">Starslip Crisis</a>, where the sources added were to show that it received many WCCA nominations and some awards, but then again, the WCCA are deemed non notable by a previous AfD. But this may end as a no consensus, perhaps. Again, I don't see that this AfD should not have happened and preventing this would be very bad. Other current AfD's include <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Terinu_%28second_nomination%29_45eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Terinu (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Terinu (second nomination)</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Greeneyes_%28second_nomination%29_3d25.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greeneyes (second nomination)</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Final_Phoenix_506f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Final Phoenix">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Final Phoenix</a>, and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warbucket (second nomination)], all but one quite certain to end in deletes.</p>

<p>The following changes have recently been discussed and there seemed to be a reasonable amount of support for them, so I'd like to pursue them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new entries to the top. Received considerable support, so I think we should just decide to do it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Pro:</b> more eyes on late entries, which at present get a fraction of the&#160;!votes of the ones at the top.</dd>
<dd><b>Con:</b> automated scripts add to the bottom, contrary to normal practice in many discussions (e.g. village pump).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Keep and cleanup: articles can be closed as "keep and cleanup", they will be revisited in a month and if not substantially improved can be tagged for speedy or brought back to AfD. Add an "expedited cleanup" category and encourage the keep&#160;!voters to actually fix the article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Pro:</b> Fixes the problem of articles repeatedly getting "keep and cleanup" with nobody actually cleaning them up; in keeping with Wiki philosophy of judging the subject not the content, while actually getting round to deleting truly crap articles on good subjects, so leaving redlinks which may then prompt a new good article.</dd>
<dd><b>Con:</b> More bureaucracy, needs policing in some way.</dd>

<li>Both sound reasonable to me. As to the second, I'm not sure a second AFD would help, because people may send it to cleanup yet again, or call it a speedy keep "per the previous nom". We should interpret "keep and cleanup" as "keep iff cleaned up". <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I strongly oppose any speedy deletion of articles that are kept but not cleaned up in any arbitrary time. I disagree with the pros - the redlinks wouldn't be a good thing in those cases, and could just as well be replaced with something worse. Perhaps articles that are "keep and cleanup" should be stubbed by the closing admin? That way, the article sticks around and people know it's a subject accepted by consensus, and the cleanup is forced to occur because the poor bits are gone? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:04, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with the opposition to speedy delete if nobody cleans-up. Also using {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} is a more targeted approach than {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} and may produce better results. AfD should be reserved for articles that cannot be improved, not a thumbs up/down critique of an article's current state. I think WP benefits more from patience rather than impulsiveness. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't agree with that. If an article is said to be "keep with cleanup" and it isn't cleaned up, then who does it? "Cleanup" becomes "crap". Articles should have a month if voted keep and cleaned up, then stubbed to the barest minimum. Articles so stubbed and that are reverted to states with unsourced and unverified statements should be considered vandalism. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 06:10, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of these methods do work, if editors follow them up. I would suggest wording it as <i>keep and relist</i> with it automatically be added. On the one hand we need more flexible procedure, on the other any added complexity can be taken advantage of. But any improvement which will decrease indefinitely repeated AfDs is worth trying.

<p>So when creating the deletion debate page, we're now supposed to: "Please use an edit summary such as Creating deletion discussion page for <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageName_474b.html" title="PageName">PageName</a> because ... replacing PageName with the name of the page you are proposing for deletion and providing reasons for deletion".</p>
<p>What would be the point of my wasting my time doing this? This is basically asking me to take the full text of my edit and put it all into the edit summary. Perhaps the edit summary itself will then need its own edit summary. The AfD process is tedious enough without expecting people to post long complex pointless edit summaries. If I nominate an article for AfD and put "AfD" as an edit summary, that's good enough. When I create the deletion debate page, everyone knows the first edit is the creation of the page, so I don't even see why any edit summary would be needed, much less one which contains the full text of the first edit. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main AfD page gives a bunch of examples of when it is appropriate to bundle AfD's together. Because a bunch of articles are in the same category doesn't necessarily mean they should be bundled together.

Apparently incensed -- and with an apparent majority as of now to delete or redirect the article -- a couple of the editors (including the author of the article, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Talk%7ENorth_America_81b2.html#Usage_of_.27North_America.27" title="Talk:North America">who has willfully removed information in the parent article regarding this very topic</a>) decided to <a href="../../../c/a/n/WP%7ECANVASS_3bfe.html" title="WP:CANVASS">canvass editors</a> at the Spanish Wikipedia to vote in the AfD to 'keep' it, effectively stacking the deck. Some of those editors have already voted, and I'm sure a comparison of the wikis will reveal the editors. Anyhow, for lengthy comment, <i><b><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_North_America_%28Americas%29_9067.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/North America (Americas)">see the nomination here</a></b></i>.</p>
<p>This is rather deplorable -- to ensure an equitable outcome, I ask that some administrative action or oversight occur regarding this AfD and actions stemming from it and that corrective actions be taken. Thanks! Corticopia 01:04, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to say I'm rather appalled by the fact that this article was not deleted. An unnannounced video game with not a single reliable source to support it's existance, only speculation on fansites... Do other admins feel that the result of this AfD was no consensus? In my opinion there was not a single good argument for not deleting the article. <small><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">JACO</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">PLANE</font></a> • 2007-03-3 16:04</small></p>

<dd>Exactly. I'm more on the side that feels it should be deleted, but since it was decided to be kept I just wonder who and why it was deleted? There's no record or any information explaining it's deletion. That's what I'm looking for. --Michaelzheng 09:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I mentioned this on the Brandt AfD talk page, but I should mention it here, too. If you want a rough count of opinion summaries in long AfDs, you can use Firefox's XPath Checker extension. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1095/" class="external autonumber" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1095/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> You can use XPaths like these</p>

<li>id('bodyContent')/ul/li/b/text()[contains(.,'erge')]</li>
<li>id('bodyContent')/ul/li/b/text()[contains(.,'elete')]</li>
</ul>
<p>to pull out and count the summaries. It's not perfect, as people use bold for other things, so it shouldn't be used when closing, but it is a quick way to get a sense of the numbers. Oh, and if you can't see all the items found, just make the window bigger until the scroll bar appears. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 17:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That pattern works for discussions back through August 2005. Prior to that, the naming convention was Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Article title. Going further back, debates before late December 2004 were not stored by preserving the sub-page - they were archived by hand to a sub-page of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Wikipedia%7EArchived_delete_debates_a169.html" title="Wikipedia:Archived delete debates">Wikipedia:Archived delete debates</a>. Debates from 2003 and older were generally moved to the article's Talk page if the decision was "keep" and the discussions lost if the decision was "delete". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:51, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I just went through the AfD procedure for the first time. Man! What a workout! I'm still not sure that I did everything according to protocol. This procedure is far too complex - or at least, the instructions are. It seems like the kind of thing that a bot or script could do. I'd like to see something along the lines of {{afd|controversial|bio|reason}}</p>
<p>Let the bot figure out the creation of the entries on the log pages, the talk pages, the article pages, etc., as well as the entries in the one-line edit summaries. The way it is now, it is too easy to put the tags in the wrong places, to click on the wrong links, to copy and paste the wrong text ...

<p>I do not think that the Aveda page should be deleted. It is no longer written as an advertisement, I have spent upwords of 3 hours correcting edits that were made by a different salon in an attempt to promote themselves. This company is more than notable as it has established salons and a reputation world wide and is valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If somebody could <i>please</i> help me to re-write this so that the advertisement tag can be taken off and the article taken off the list of deletions, I would very much appreciate it. This is a company that helps people world-wide, and it should not be deleted for the simple reason that one salon tried to ruin it. As for the external links on the bottom of the page, I believe that they should be kept; it is important to view the differences between lifestyle/concept/experience centers, and people can either visit the sites to see these differences or, if they are in the area, Aveda asks all salons to offer full tours and information to all clients.

Mine was a sort of preamble to starting a deletion discussion. I tend not to do that on the talk pages themselves, because if the article is deleted, then what I write there gets deleted as well. Also, would you have time to consider what I posted a few sections further up? The reply to the old AfD discussions thread.

<p>I have come across a situation where a couple of Editors wanted an article deleted, and then, when they were losing the argument, they went to the page to edit it to make it worse and more likely to be deleted. I am tempted to add something to the AfD ettiquette to state what I would have thought was obvious, which is that if you have voted delete (or redirect/merge which comes to the same thing) you should not edit the page in question while the AfD debate is going on.

<dd>Obviously a nominator shouldn't trash an article to get it deleted; anyone doing that will produce a backlash. That's obvious enough not to need a specific rule, I think. A blanket rule against editing by delete/merge voters would be bad -- it's perfectly reasonable to, say, argue for deleting the whole article as OR and then cut a section that has <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problems as well. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 23:14, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

So this applies to pages in general, not just articles. The basic point is that pages that can be improved, should be improved, not deleted. When you nominate a page for deletion, you are saying that it cannot be improved, so you should not be changing it (except for Copyright, BLP, or similar serious problems). <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Things can occur in the course of an *fD that weren't obvious at the outset.

<dd>Utter nonsense as extrapolate this to say some fan-boy cruft page containing utter nonsense which reflects badly on Wikipedia. Then what you are saying is that editors who say delete cannot go in and edit the page&#160;?. Obviously the fan-boy is going to feel somewhat narked and will quote your proposed change to AfD policy to stop any cleanups.</dd>
<dd>The converse is that I have come across the situation where when it looked like I was losing the AfD I dug around and edited the article to improve it. The article 'won' the AfD. It is thus unfair that according to your suggestion some editors cannot edit when others can based on how that vote in an AfD. There are no sides to an AfD just an outcome that is the consensus as to what improves Wikipedia. If to improve means a redirect or delete then so be it: that is the consensus and your proposal would unbalance articles by placing a handicap on one of the consensus viewpoints. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 03:14, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's 'cause there aren't any. Common arguments to keep are "here's the evidence rebutting the argument(s) for deletion". Trying to list all possible "keep" arguments would be pointless. On the other hand, listing a few of the more common "delete" arguments helps readers understand what is <i>not</i> a valid argument for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. This page has NPOV problems as it does not present a balanced view of deletion, i.e. when to delete, and when not to delete. The bias, if any, should be to use deletion only as a last resort when all other options (e.g. improve, merge, etc.) have been exhausted. But this page makes only a brief mention of the alternatives, then goes on at great length about the deletion process. I would prefer to see a little more balance. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:31, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Okay, let me be more clear. I tagged a section, because it does not represent an NPOV. There are two points of views, equally valid presuming the policies are kept:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keepists</li>
<li>Deleteists</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the article discusses how to list an article up for AfD. There should be a section on how to participate in an AfD, and it might as well go on this page. This is the section on how to contribute to an AfD page. I'm saying that this section is POV, because the entire section is NPOV except the bullet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments commonly used to recommend deletion are: "unverifiable" (violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), "original research" (violates <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), "unencyclopedic", and "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">non-notable</a>", if for example, a person does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (it is advisable out of courtesy to use the latter term, rather than the former). The accusation <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">VANITY</a> should be avoided <a href="http://www.nabble.com/AFD-courtesy-problem-t939597.html#a2434386" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nabble.com/AFD-courtesy-problem-t939597.html#a2434386" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and is not in itself a reason for deletion. The argument "non-neutral point of view" (violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) is often used, but often such articles can be salvaged, so this is not a very strong reason for deletion either.</li>
</ul>
<p>It tells people how to vote delete, but the keepists don't ever get advice on how to be a keepist. If someone wants to be a deletist, they get guidelines on how to be effective. If someone wants to be a keepist, they have no choice but to muddle around making mistakes over and over again until they learn by the school of hard knocks. I think that this needs to be resolved. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 14:53, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see where the problem lies. It's not a POV problem with the text, it's a POV problem with the user. If you approach the situation with the notion that there is a camp of "keepists" and a camp of "deleteists", then you're going nowhere fast - AfD simply does not work that way. What is supposed to happen is someone presents a reason for deletion, and either that reason is not good enough or someone presents some counter-evidence. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 21:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since McKaysalisbury indicated that it would address his complaint, I have gone ahead and made the addition<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion&amp;diff=117142636&amp;oldid=117139452" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion&amp;diff=117142636&amp;oldid=117139452" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (with minor rewording) that I suggested above.</p>
<p>The new bullet reads <i>"If you wish for an article to be kept the best thing you can do is improve the article to address the complaints given in the deletion nomination and debate. You can search out <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">references</a> showing the notability of the subject, and refute the deletion arguments given using policy, guidelines, and examples from our <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured</a> articles."</i> I do not believe this should be a controversial change, since it simply advises people on existing practice (if you fix the page, we will not delete it) and recommends adding citations to articles. Given that lack of citations is the primary reason for nominations based in both notability and verifiability, this is about the best piece of advice you could possibly give to a newbie wanting their article kept.</p>
<p><s>I also simultaneously made a minor change to the preceding bullet point, which may have been erroneous. (It made sense at the time, but I'm having nagging doubts now.) This was removing "unencyclopedic" along with a paranthetical comment which appeared to be saying not to call pages unencyclopedic. Since the sentence mentioned three terms rather than two, it is possible that I misinterpreted it and would appreciate being corrected if that is the case.</s> Never mind, I figured out what the sentence was trying to say and clarified it. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 22:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>our good and featured articles.</i> You are in effect suggesting that these articles be used as precedent. I do not recall seeing this mooted specifically before, and in any case I do not accept it. They may represent long-ago decisions, they may contain major flaws--many articles have been promoted over opposition. As a practical matter, this would require those trying to maintain standards to monitor not just AfD, which is certainly difficult enough, but every Good and FA discussion. I understand the need to say that existing WP articles' mere existence is not enough precedent. . I do not think anybody doubts that. Also, I cannot remember hearing this G &amp; FA comparison argument used in AfD or Deletion Review in the last few months.

<p>I don't think that it's a good idea to include a bullet point saying to make sure systemic bias is not exacerbated, because it's far too easy to misapply.

<dd>Actually, Deletion Review won't touch that one since the result was "redirect" which is a variant of "keep". The decisions about redirects and renaming are solved on the respective Talk pages. In this respect, AFD decisions are not definitive - they can be changed by any consensus of future editors to a different destination or even to an independent article.

<p>Some time ago, on this very page (look above for # 11 Battlemaster game page) I asked for the clear rules for articles about the games. Everybody agreed that such CLEAR rules are needed and the other articles like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchy_Online_6871.html" title="Anarchy Online">Anarchy Online</a> are the crap currently and should be deleted as well like <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a>. BUT only this one article of <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a> is deleted while others live.</p>
<p>I asked for the clear rules but nobody replied, so I tried to rebuild this article from the scratch to keep all <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> required (<a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleMaster_2436.html" title="BattleMaster">BattleMaster</a> had the links to independent Reviewers articles - it's quite rare for the article about a game) and what? Someone keeps deleting my work without even checking it! I protest against the vandals among the administrators! <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerewyn_1325.html" title="User:Merewyn">Merewyn</a> 17:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think they should, unless they are explicitly a bad-faith nomination or a frivolous one, or they are about someone who does not meet notability standards or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> et.al at all (I think I've seen one that was speedily closed as CSD A7, and another as CSD G11).</p>
<p>There is a good reason for this. I feel, by leaving all AFD's open for the 5 day period in full, it opens them up to the wider Wikipedia community. Longer period - hopefully more views.</p>

<dd>In general, certainly. However, if every single person for 3 days has agreed that an article is, for instance, a terrible POV fork, there is really no point in allowing it to stand for another two days. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 23:35, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bad faith noms are pretty apparent, though occasionally while the nom itself is lacking and openly recognized as such, some such noms end in a delete consensus. Unless the nom is completely fruitless and frivolous, or contains personal attacks, it should stand and let the community review it. As far as meeting the guidelines, they are just guidelines and not binding policy. It is the purpose of AfD to determine community consensus on those matters in relation to inclusion/exclusion. <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> already allows overwhelming obvious cases to be closed.

<dd>I concur with one exception. If the article unambiguously meets a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion for speedy deletion</a>, that criterion may be applied immediately and the debate closed. Vandalism or copyright violations should not be allowed to remain for 5 days just because the nominator was unfamiliar with the CSD process and used the AFD process instead. Speedy-closes based on CSD cases A7 and G11 are allowed but if there's any room for doubt at all, the AFD discussion should remain open. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 14:06, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree. There are over 100 articles per day. It is a lot to asked not only the admins patroling them to close, but perhaps even more importantly, the editors evaluating and weighing in to review. While I definitely prefer a conservative approach to early closures, I think it is very helpful to the process to clear out AfDs as soon as consensus has been established. I think it is almost exclusively early closures that are not conservative, or early closures on high-traffic AfDs where people want to have their say in the matter, that cause problems and inevitably end up at DRV. It is in these cases that AfDs should always be left to run the full course. What we need to focus on are those AfDs, but establishing a blanket rule that <i>all</i> AfDs must run the full 5 days will just clog up an already overburdened system. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a> 19:18, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On two or three occasions I have AfD'd an article and everything goes fine until I get to the 3rd step. I copy the afd3 template onto the log page, add my edit summary, preview or save, and my comments get added to the last entry's nominator summary. See Apr 1 deletion log, #23 Red and white nights. The AfDtemplate is on the page I nominated, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Deseret_64b8.html" title="Nation of Deseret">Nation of Deseret</a>, the discussion page is created with my comments, but the article does not show up on the Apr 1 log. I've AfD'd other articles and had it appear correctly, but at least one other time this has happened. Now my comments are attached to #23's nomination and I can't get them out of there.

<dd>You're missing part of step 2, where you add this template to the deletion discussion page:</dd>
<dd>{{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | cat=Category | text=Reason the page should be deleted}} ~~~~</dd>
<dd>That template creates the heading that separates one AFD from another. If you click the "preloaded debate" link in the article's AFD tag it should add this template automatically; otherwise you can just paste it in.

<p>I think such a rename would promote "discussions" rather than "votes". After all the intention in a nomination is creating a discussion over the "usefulness" of an article. The proposed change is indeed mostly symbolic but I feel the end results might be worth it. They are both AFDs so the shortcut wouldn't change. -- <small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">chi?</a></sup> 22:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um... why does including the word "discussion" rather than "deletion" change anything? It makes sense for CfD, because CfD also includes merge and rename decisions. AfD does not, and renaming it might encourage people to start bringing their rename and merge discussions here. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moore cowbell!</a></small> 22:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't agree. It isn't uncommon for an AfD to end up with a merge, keep or even move. -- <small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">chi?</a></sup> 23:00, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, but it isn't binding either. A redirect is arguably binding, since that can be seen as equivalent to "Delete but I'm going to make something useful with the title". A merge outcome is widely considered not to be binding, move outcomes are <i>definitely</i> not binding, because that is an editorial decision that should be made by people familiar with the topic, and a keep decision is just a decision not to delete it. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moore cowbell!</a></small> 23:05, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. The primary purpose of the AfD process is deletion. People who nominate articles for AfD with the intention of having them merged or redirected are told outright, "Do not bring articles to AfD unless you want them deleted." <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C;">howcheng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 23:10, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. If articles are brought to AfD one outcome is deletion, another is merger, another redirection, another cleanup, another nothing. "Articles for Discussion" captures this as poorly as "Articles for Deletion". A better term, though I <b>do not</b> advocate changing the name at all, would be "Problem Articles Considered for Change" WP:PACC. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 23:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> "Articles for discussion" doesn't read well.
