<li><b>Comment</b>: I strongly disagree with the deletion of this article. But firstly I am am a frequent Wikipedia reader but have never contributed personally, and hence some of the comments on this page are extremely difficult to understand because of the slang and abbreviation they use. I feel this is somewhat intimidating for anyone that is not within the Wikipedia community to contest a deletion and in particular this one. As I am not an enthusiast, my opinion on the subject of deletion is therefore perhaps not quite as learned as others versed on Wikipedia definitions, however I do not feel that it is any less valid. I am a <a href="http://www.darkgalaxy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.darkgalaxy.com/" rel="nofollow">Dark Galaxy</a> player, and this first came to my attention when <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> posted on the <a href="http://www.turnengine.com/forums/" class="external text" title="http://www.turnengine.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">Dark Galaxy forums</a> in a rather menacing tone threatening to delete the article if anyone reposted. I took offence at the aggressiveness and the threat of deletion and so I post here to try to prove there is no scheme by anyone associated with Dark Galaxy to advertise using Wikipedia. As far as I can see, there seems to be two accusations here; Advertising and lack of notability. Wafulz kindly links to a <a href="http://www.turnengine.com/forums/showthread.php?t=32859" class="external text" title="http://www.turnengine.com/forums/showthread.php?t=32859" rel="nofollow">thread</a> which purports to be part of an advertising drive, as evidence of a purpose to advertise, however Wikipedia is not mentioned at all in the thread until Wafulz does so. The thread is a little under three months old, however there has been a Dark Galaxy article on Wikipedia for several years. In fact, the DG Wikipedia article was in existence long before the <a href="http://www.darkgalaxy.com/manual/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.darkgalaxy.com/manual/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">DGWiki game manual</a>, which is referenced by <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> as a source of information that has been lifted directly to the Dark Galaxy Wikipedia entry. However in all probability the text in the DGwiki game manual was lifted FROM the Dark Galaxy Wikipedia article. The article was originally posted by a group of DG players from <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.somethingawful.com/" rel="nofollow">SomethingAwful.com</a>, and was an independent action unknown by the rest of the DG community and creators. There is no motivation or purpose to advertise, however that doesn't change that the article still may be considered as advertising. I believe the article can be changed if it constitutes an advert, and this is the action I would support as opposed to deletion. As for notability, I think that this is something extremely difficult to prove or disprove in the case of a game thousands and thousands of people have come into contact with. The original article was not written by an official from Dark Galaxy, though it was written by a player(s). I understand the questioning of this as DG has no great notability perhaps; however it does have notability nonetheless. I think an editing to lessen the effects of accused advertising is the best course of action. --Tatsyrup 15:27, 2 August 2006

<li>Then it was my mistake to assume that you had been behind the article. However, it doesn't matter who is behind it- it still merits deletion for failing to be notable and for basically being an advertisement.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There is some consensus that no matter the motivation or author, there is some advertisement in the article. I however disagree with the notability. Over the years, the article has been edited heavily and I no longer recognise it from when I last viewed it some months ago even. These edits have created the advertisement. I proposed that the article be changed to satisfy all that there is no longer any advertisement, merely information. I suspect some still have notabilty issues, however is this not a fair compromise? --Tatsyrup 15:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:Reply</b> Unfortunately, no. It's not just that it's an advertisemen; it doesn't meet notability standards- why should it be on Wikipedia if it's not notable?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Only the most notable browser games deserve articles. For example, Kings of Chaos deserves an article simply for its success and history, let alone its popularity.

<li><b>Comment</b> Even if we re-write it to be less like an advertisement, it would still not be notable enough to be on Wikipedia. Was this article deleted for the same reason last time as well?

<li><b>Comment to Comment</b> - Pulling the "notible" card is an unwinnable argument for both sides. No matter how notable a topic, or in this case Dark Galaxy is, it is easy to simply dissmiss it with one subjective opionion that "that's not notible enough". This article needs to be rewritten, and wikified. It needs a NPOV, regarding the good and bad of Dark Galaxy, but does not deserve censorship. Delete this, then delete all under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MMORPGs_8c14.html" title="List of MMORPGs">List of MMORPGs</a>. Why not be amenable to rewrite? Charley 19:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

It doesn't seem appropriate for Wikipedia to have an article on a browser-based game that hasn't even been completed- this is borderline crystal-balling. I've also noticed that several of the articles in the list of MMORPGs are also up for deletion, so I don't know if you've considered that. This is not in any way censorship- if the game becomes more popular, wins an award, receives mention from a reputable third party source, or becomes more meritable then it might be eligible for an article.

<li><b>Revise to fulfil requirements</b> To put a name to this, I am the author and I wrote this article to fill the void of the empty page associated with the 'Dark Galaxy computer game' heading which came up when I originally searched. I didnt realise that there had previously been issues with articles about Dark Galaxy, but the presence of a heading is somewhat misleading, both to those searching, finding no article under that heading, but also for me, as I would have avoided writing this if I had known of the issues surround the topic. If the topic is not worthy of an article, then why have a heading?? I dont mean to whinge, because if the article doesnt meet requirements then fair enough, but arrogant speculation about my intentions regarding advertising is unwelcome, as I am merely a player who enjoys the game, and also interested in contributing in many information repositories online, be it in a forum, a review, or in this case by submitting to wikipedia. The article is not meant to read like an advertisement, and I can assure you I have no ties with any member of the Dark Galaxy team in any way. I can't actually see where it reads like this. It's not like I have said 'this game is the best, come join up and play' or offered any incentive or tried to draw people in. I just tried to outline the game and how it works. I also don't see how it can be an advertisement when there is no commercial gain from a player signing up. It's free and there is no obligation to give anything in return for playing. What am I advertising? OK admittedly there is the possibility to join the premium membership, but that is completely optional and not necessary to access the FULL game. Also, the copyright issue, I was under the impression that an attributed reference, quoted and not attempted to be passed off as my original work was merely a quotation / extract, and not an infrigement. But it is not only the technical details which baffle me... I spent a significant amount of time authoring the article, and as commented, yes it was my first, but why should that be any line of reasoning for deleting my article? I was under the impression that input was an important part of wikipedia, and I didnt realise that fresh input from a new user would be so hostily met. It doesn't encourage new users to contribute, nor does it give me any inclination to try and submit again. As I said, I can accept it if the criteria are not fulfilled or I have overstepped the mark on a regulation. It is my first submission and I could not be expected to take in every last minute regulation plus I am only human, with an individual style. I followed the guidelines on first posts etc offered by Wiki and tried to follow the suggestions, but obviously I fell short. Due to references to regulations I have breached, I cannot offer a 'Do Not Delete' opinion, it is not my turf, nor my rules, but I do feel that rectification of the article to fulfil requirements would be a better course of action. On rereading I agree that the NPOV is an issue, as I have unknowingly written merely from a proDG POV, but that can eaily be changed. There are things about the game that I or any established player who understands the game could give contructive criticism for. The notability is a tough one since as mentioned, the game does tend to appear only in game directories, but surely there are reports which do exist, it is a big game (on reputation I mean) but nevertheless the fact that the game has run for I believe 5 years or more, from its humble beginnings to its latest incarnation with multiple servers running and has long had a well established user base of thousands of players actively involved. Apologies if I am barking completely up the wrong tree here, I am not well versed in the ways of Wiki but I am a little agrieved that a genuine and honest attempt to contribute has been met with such comments, and although I accept intrinsic faults in my style, I don't see a well founded basis for many of the rejections offered. Would someone who is a seasoned submitter mind revising the article to an acceptable state, or merely pointing out where it needs to be revised so I or someone can do it in the hope of achieving a satisfactory balance that everyone can get one with. --Beemat 02:20, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The "headline" for the article didn't exist. That is how Wikipedia works- if it cannot find an article under a name you have searched, it allows you to create an article under the heading. However, this is is no way an invitation to create an article for every heading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And regarding advertising:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i><a href="http://www.darkgalaxy.com" class="external text" title="http://www.darkgalaxy.com" rel="nofollow">Dark Galaxy</a> is a <b>free</b> online, browser accessed, turn-based strategy game using 'Turn-Engine' game creation technology.</i> Right off the bat, the first sentence emphasizes the game's website and the fact that it is free. Then in the conclusion:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is a basic and although it may not seem so, it is a very brief outline of a highly intricate and feature packed game, and many of the advanced features, strategies and methods have not been mentioned. The best way to learn and eventually master the game is to play. It is a great deal of fun, and a sense of achievement is easy to attain of enough attention is given to the game. Success is relative to the amount of time and effort put in, with the most successful and dominant players logging in multiple times per day throughout the whole round and entering commands even in the early hours of the morning if required. This is not to say that anything less is insufficient. A player can have just as much fun logging in once a day or even less, although this would rule out entering the upper player ranks.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is significant emphasis to the reader that he/she should play this game. It reads like one long essay describing the merits of the game, why you should play, and how to play it- more importantly, none of these are reasons meriting a Wikipedia article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reasoning behind the deletion proposale is <b>not</b> because some of us don't welcome new users or hate this article- it's because we don't find the game to be particularly notable or verifiable, and these are two important aspects of an article. This is all in addition to its article reads like an advertisement. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:32, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment to comment</b> The heading was indeed already there. I merely searched 'Dark Galaxy' and the heading 'Dark Galaxy (a science fiction strategy game) turned up at the disambiguation page. I never specified 'sci fi startegy game' thus I came to the conclusion that it was already there. If it had have been just 'there is no article...you can search for it yada yada yada' I wouldn't have written anything simply because there would probably be a reason it didnt exist. As to the idea that it is 'not an invitiation to create and article for every heading' I had no intention of writing under every blank heading, and I dont understand this comment since the way a topic gets covered is by someone submitting an article about it. If everyone thought 'oh its blank, I'd better not write anything' then where would Wikipedia be? This however is neither here nor there... I dont mean to get into a rant. About the article (which after all is what we are here for!) What I do agree now is that fair enough, I can see how that might be construed as advertising, and I see I should have been more objective and less opinionated and of a proPOV, but I still think that it warrants a rewrite more than deletion. I'm not fighting a cause just for the fun of it, because at the end of the day if it's gonna go its gonna go. I assume, like me, alot of people use Wiki to find out about endless number of things, and although its a game, the information is (or after a rewrite would be) more useful and extensive than the short blurb I have ever found elsewhere. Just wondered, if I did find 3rd party reports on the game (notable sources obviously), would linking them here go any way to show notability? Because although it has not been found by a quick Googling, it doesnt mean a) there isnt any, or b) the game isnt notable enough. By nature and genre, it is not going to be all over the headlines, just reported in related places. Regards --Beemat 09:27, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then that means somebody forgot to remove it last time it was deleted. Also, yes, reputable third party sources that are unaffiliated with the game would be nice to have.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, Wiki is getting so visited that possibly modern notability should be determined purely from searches/visits in Wiki itself alone, instead of relying on other websites (and so few and dominant). The beauty of Wiki is in it's open nature instead of being an echo of wholly commercial endeavours, and it would be bad for that to change. Get the gurus to set it up so you can use Wiki's logs! No other suggestion at this time. This suggestion refers to notability of subjects/websites only, not of actual article content.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 60.231.170.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_60.231.170.143_223e.html" title="Special:Contributions/60.231.170.143">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>I have found one reference to him in the <i>Newcastle Herald</i> (his hometown paper) of 15 July 2005. The article reads "With Lawson as the writer and Wilton as the artist, Azerath was born and the comic book is now sold in comic stores throughout Australia and New Zealand. Published by Phosphorescent Comics, Azerath has found a dedicated following since the first issue was released in April 2004." It is marginally verifiable but I doubt he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">our notability guidelines</a> yet and the article meets Geogre's law. <b>Delete</b> until he becomes more notable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is an extremely unuseful and misleading article, because it suggests that every Batman story that Miller has written is part of the same "canon", distinct from the main canon, which simply isn't true. DKR and DK2 take place in the same "possible" future, true; but "Year One" is official continuity. Besides which, two books do not make a "universe". <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 11:03, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> What Seb Patrick said above is categorically false. Miller intends all of his stories to be read together: "Anything I come up with about any of these characters is DKU. DC winds up adopting just about all of it, anyway."<a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Spawn/Batman even mentions that it is a companion to DKR on the inside cover. The All-Star Batman and Robin page on Wikipedia mentions that he intends those books to be part of the same universe, which he himself calls The Dark Knight Universe. He also said that it is his own Batman: Year Two, his intended follow-up to Year One<a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> . That said, all of his Batman work has an explicitly stated internal continuity regardless of which books are official DC and which aren't. Calling the article "unuseful" and "misleading," therefore, is both unuseful and misleading to this discussion. Furthermore, this article existed as Frank Miller's Batman for over a month without setting off any red flags. So why is the new title suddenly grounds for deletion? It is a resource for Batman fans and fans of Frank Miller to see which works he has written on the character and what chronological order they proceed in, from the beginning to the end of Batman's career. This information is valid, alluded to in previously existing Wikipedia articles, and unavailable on other pages. It serves as a reference page, much as the "List of _____ Episodes" pages do. It also fits into multiple categories on this website such as Batman storylines and Batman writers. It can also be said to be a subcategory of Miller's work, ala the View Askewniverse (which, by the way, gets its own page) in relation to Kevin Smith. Finally, the fact that this was earmarked for deletion because it supposedly contains "false" data is further proof that it contains previously unknown information to users such as those posting above. Apparently, few of them knew that there was a Dark Knight Universe or that Miller's Batman work is internally consistent. Furthermore, the article itself states and has always stated which of these stories are Official DC continuity and which are not, another reason some have earmarked this for deletion. Rather that have an itchy trigger finger (not to mention a belittlement of the author and his or her intent) perhaps we should look at this article and see that it indeed describes a specific, verifiable DC alternate storyline that is only alluded to on other pages, none of which describe its full scope. For all these reasons, the article should stay. <a href="../../../s/s/a/User%7ESSantoro_917f.html" title="User:SSantoro">SSantoro</a> 16:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>5. "Spawn vs. Batman is a companion piece to DC Comic's The Dark Knight Returns." (Spawn/Batman inside cover). You would have to do a lot of logic leaps to pretend he's not talking about the same thing.
<ul>
<li>This is really tenative. He dodges a lot of those Newsarama questions, and referring to a book as a "companion piece" doesn't mean it's in the same continuity (e.g. V For Vendetta and Miracleman, which Moore has described as companion pieces on multiple occasions). This continuity seems to exist more in the mind of one Newsarama editor's opinion than Miller's mind, and constructing these sorts of fanon continuities from works that inspired later works smacks of original research. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 03:31, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After all the posted quotes from Miller himself, the link to IGN stating the same information, and evidence from within the books themselves, you continue to insist that this article "smacks" of orginal research, i.e. fabricated information. The IGN site and Newsarama even reference "Comics in Context" as further evidence of the DKU. It's even well known by the fans, and you can see this if you frequent comics forums. Miller coined the phrase DKU, discusses it periodically (in multiple sources), and clearly considers his other Batman stories as a reference point whenever he writes a new one. According to another, no longer posted, Newsarama interview, <i>Miller stated himself that he asked DC to let him classify his works officially under the DKU label</i>, in which he would explore his own interpretation of the DC Universe. I know this is now unverifiable since the site has been taken down. Yet to support this, I reference again when Miller said, "Anything I come up with about any of these characters is DKU."<a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=27218" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> This in and of itself proves the existence of the DKU, and that all of Miller's Batman stories are part of it.

<li>Frank Miller is not the publisher. DC is. DC decide which continuities tie into one-another, and which are canon. Notwithstanding the fact that Miller is the sort of person who will contradict himself in interviews over this sort of thing as the years go by (and the vagueness, as outlined by other commenters above, of some of the statements in interviews), it doesn't matter what he "intends" - it's to do with what he's commissioned to write, and what DC decide to do with it. Of all the stories mentioned in the article, <i>Year One</i> is the only one that takes place in official DC continuity, and DKR and DK2 are the only ones that are recognised as being in the same one as each other (if Miller has decided to go and tell his own "Year Two" with ASB&amp;R, then he's going against everything DC publicised the All Star line as, as that line is categorically supposed to contain completely continuity-free stories, a tenet he's clearly completely reneged on). I still maintain that the article is misleading by suggesting that Year One and DKR are part of the same continuity - they are NOT. Year One is part of a continuity in which, for example, Tim Drake is the third Robin. DKR does not acknowledge Drake's existence, having Jason Todd as the second and Carrie Kelly as the third. No matter what Miller's intentions as a writer, the final say goes to the people commissioning and publishing the books - i.e. DC Comics. You mention yourself that the article used to exist perfectly fine under a different name - and frankly, I can't understand the reason for the change. "Frank Miller's Batman work" is a perfectly acceptable title and a perfectly acceptable article. "The Dark Knight Universe", however, is an inherently problematic one, because it leads to this very debate we're having here - which means it clearly isn't encyclopedic. I maintain that it's misleading, because it's based on one person's opinion of what is canonical, and also because with the recent announcement of the title of the next Batman film, it suggests a connection to <i>that</i> universe. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESeb_Patrick_a83c.html" title="User:Seb Patrick">Seb Patrick</a> 08:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your implication that the artist has no say over his own work and that only what DC decides matters is ludicrous. If I write a movie and publish it with MGM and then write a sequel and publish it with Fox, that does not mean that the movies are unrelated. Kevin Smith's Askewniverse is published by Miramax, Universal, and their subsidiaries. Since Miramax didn't publish Mallrats, does that mean that it has nothing to do with Clerks, despite what Miramax says? Miller's statements aren't inconsistent. He says and has always said that his Batman stories are connected. Spawn/Batman (published by IMAGE and not DC) says it's a companion piece to DKR, but according to your logic, that is impossible since DC wasn't fully in charge. Miller can certainly, without the permission of even care of DC, publish his own stories. That's why most of them are officially outside DC Continuity to begin with: Miller publishes what he wants, regardless of "official" DC Continuity. Year One contained some dramatic revisions to the DC Universe itself, and DC accepted it as tthe new origin for "Modern Age" Batman. Nevertheless, Miller is writing ASB&amp;R to follow up Year One in his own way. The All-Star label is not undermined by this. They hired Miller and Grant Morrison to write ANY stories they wanted outside DC Continuity (i.e. giving the author's frreedom to choose). Miller chose the DKU and Morrison chose the Silver Age. Honestly, given the citations, direct quotes, and the multiple other internal Wikipedia references, it seems more like some people are in the mood to delete something, regardless of whether it requires deletion. My defense hasn't been weak or "original." I don't think it will hurt Wikipedia to leave it up, unlike a band vanity page or the like. <a href="../../../s/s/a/User%7ESSantoro_917f.html" title="User:SSantoro">SSantoro</a> 13:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate it. I'm not hellbent on keeping the article up, but I do believe that Miller's artistic intentions, as indicated in his quotes, deserve some sort of mention in some of the related articles. Though as per putting the name of an unofficial parallel storyline into an encyclopedia, that point is well taken. The thing that initially set me off was the implication that the article was based on fabricated "fanon," which is untrue. The author, not the fans, created, named, and continues to discuss the universe. Nevertheless, DC has (regrettably from my perspective) failed to give him his his own "universe" in an official, this has DC's stamp on it sort of way. <b>Though again I wonder about Kevin Smith's <a href="../../../v/i/e/View_Askewniverse_0618.html" title="View Askewniverse">View Askewniverse</a>.</b> The films are put out by different companies, yet maintain an inner continuity AND a Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been thinking about this a bit since this discussion started. I understand people's concerns about this not being encyclopedic, and it is true that this list isn't. So it's alright that it gets deleted from Wikipedia. However, I've found that it's been very successful in getting people to add extra information which would never otherwise be compiled, and I attribute that to it being posted on a Wiki. So I was wondering if people have a recommendation for another Wiki that could be a useful host for such a list, so I can continue to work on adding to it? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 11:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I won't take it elsewhere unless it gets deleted. I was just trying to find a way that I can still work on it in Wiki form if Wikipedia won't have it.

<p>This article seems to have no notable basis as a real-world concept. It describes something that sounds like a specific theory (references to information technology impacting workplace, a "philosophy", etc), but provides absolutely no sources, proponents, or evidence of notability. I can find nothing out on the net that could be used to substantiate the article. The article was created two years ago, by a user whose sole two edits were this article, and has received no other content edits.

<dd>But none seem to have anything to do with "information technologies" being "integrated into the organizational structure of businesses", "the cost of communication decreases", etc., which is the specific concept this article is purporting. "Democracy" is such a widely and variously used word that many common adjectives such as "worker" are going to pull up hits when combined with it, and not all phrases are going to share a coherent core concept to base an encyclopedia article on. In this case, I've found nothing that would apply to this article. If the above examples were to be used as the basis for some other article called "worker democracy" at a later date it would be unrelated to the current text, and this AfD will do no harm. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 07:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In answer to both comments, the articles I cited all seem to be talking about the same thing the article is, even if they do not mention specific details. Also, Tychocat is right, I saw alot of overlap as well, which is why I was very careful when pasting these links. I'll consider changing my vote, due to Oberst's comments, and to the fact that I was never really 100% behind this article in the first place. I'd like to think that those links might be of some help to other voters, since they took so long to find, but if they aren't, so be it.

<li><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a>, the press coverage you describe is from the band's own webpage. Can you verify these articles independently?

<li><b>Comment:</b> I appreciate the idea to redirect the article, however, the only problem with the above said compromise is that HHO Gas is not a Brown's gas. This was reported in the cited sources of Santilli's International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Paper, and the Company website science page. So I think that would be an even more misrepresentative change to redirect people to the Brown's Gas page than to keep the original page. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyohio02_eaa1.html" title="User:Boyohio02">boyohio02</a> 18:37 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is the second article relating to new hydrogen technology which has been recommended for deletion. There is obviously an unknown but disturbing agenda at work here. This is user intimidation. There is no excuse for what is being done to me. I have worked long and tireless hours working on this article, finding sources for the information, discussing both sides of the issue to ensure article neutrality, citing all sources used, ensuring that the sources are credible reliable and verifiable. I have studied this subject extensively to ensure accuracy. IF this page is deleted, I contend that it has been done so based not on sound wikipedia policy, but on personal disagreement with the article's ideas and facts. This represents what may only be described as user intimidation and bullying. I have also studied the rules and guidelines for Articles for Deletion (AfD) and this article does not meet the criteria for deletion. I will not be silenced by intimidation tactics by both users and administrators of this website. I have not committed any infractions or violations of the wikipedia policy, and my article does not deserve to be discredited and deleted as though the article which was written is my own personal view. The article is not original research but a compliation of information gathered from multiple credible and verified cited sources. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoyohio02_eaa1.html" title="User:Boyohio02">boyohio02</a> 18:00 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Keep</b> The company responsible for this Hydrogen Technology Applications, Inc. has had research funding from several investors since 2000. Financial reports can be found through a simple google search. There apparently are several patents filed with the USPA for an engine claimed to generate this gas, although that is no guarantee that the technology is viable. I do however find it hard to believe that a "hoax" company would remain viable for so many years without one if its investors asking pointed questions. E.G. UTEK (a UK based company) claims 10% in Hydrogen Technology Applications, Inc. and is currently listed in NASDAQ and the NYSE. One would imagine that any company, whose goal is to make money, making such an investment would expect a return or at least evidence that a return was probable. Innocent until proven guilty. If you can't disprove the claim then the logical response would be wait to see if they can prove it.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_0a1b.html" title="User:Anon">User:Anon</a> 13:37 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>AS per the previous statement regarding "blasting" the page with dynamite per <a href="../../../h/o/a/WP%7EHOAX_ea37.html" title="WP:HOAX">WP:HOAX</a>. <b>From the Official Wikipedia Policy:</b> <i>Verifiability, not truth</i> One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by <i><b>reputable publishers</b>.</i> The goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and reliable encyclopedia. Editors should cite <i><b>reliable sources</b></i> so that their edits may be verified by readers and other editors.</p>
<p><i>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by</i> <b>reliable sources</b>, <i>regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cite</i> <b>peer-reviewed scientific publications</b> <i>and check community consensus</i> Scientific journals are the best place to find primary source articles about experiments, including medical studies. Any serious scientific journal is peer-reviewed<i>.</i></p>
<p><i>Make readers aware of any uncertainty or controversy. A well-referenced article will point to specific journal articles or specific theories proposed by specific researchers.</i></p>
<p>The article which was reverted and removed addressed those uncertainty and controversy. Viewing the history will show the added section on the controversy. The <b>Reputable Publishers</b> and <b>Reliable Sources</b> provided are for Verification purposes only. I cannot confirm the findings of these sources, and as it is stated, that would be original research, and that is discouraged. As per the <b>peer-reviewed scientific publications</b>, I have listed that journal as the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy Volume 31, Issue 9 , August 2006, Pages 1113-1128. and specifically at the following website. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006" class="external text" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006" rel="nofollow">| http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.11.006</a> and <a href="http://hytechapps.com/aquygen/international_journal.pdf" class="external text" title="http://hytechapps.com/aquygen/international_journal.pdf" rel="nofollow">| International Journal of Hydrogen Energy- Full Article</a></p>

<li><b>Point of Reference</b>: This is the last comment I am going to make regarding this Subject! At some point when this technology is more readily available and becomes common knowledge, The article will be rewritten anyway so If its deleted, so be it... Therefore I am not going to waste my time with people who believe that EVERYTHING about this gas is a HOAX. I am however going to state for the record that this is in fact a real product. You can argue that this gas may NOT be a Revolutionary New form of Energy, but NOT That this is a Real Product. You can call up Donald Wann<a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/old/atc/Machine.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/old/atc/Machine.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> with The Fulton County Area Technology Center in Kentucky (a state employer) and ask them if they are using HHO Gas, They will tell you Yes. I called them and confirmed this. Fact is that HHO Gas is being used in commercial applications. The overwhelming reason that this article was submitted for deletion was on the basis that it is a HOAX. I submit that if that is the case, I have been fooled by one of the most Elaborate and Expensive Hoaxes in history!! For anyone who is interested in more information, please view the following video from Google Video. It is 15 minutes long, and there are interviews with credible people about their use of HHO Gas. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=660759158947266385&amp;q=HHO|Google" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=660759158947266385&amp;q=HHO|Google" rel="nofollow">Video - Approx. 15 min</a> You can also download the powerpoint presentation provided by the Fulton County Area Technology Center in Kentucky. <a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/morenews_files/waterwelder.ppt" class="external text" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/morenews_files/waterwelder.ppt" rel="nofollow">| Powerpoint Presentation by Fulton County School District</a> and Here <a href="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/news.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fulton.k12.ky.us/atc/news.htm" rel="nofollow">| News Article from Fulton County School District</a></li>

While it is quite interesting, a think-tank or NGO creating a term or publishing a discussion paper does not necessarily create an encyclopedic concept (i.e. notability, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). I can't find any immediate indication that the concept has developed any significant usage outside this organization.

<dd>Interesting point. My mind is changed enough to feel it merits a redirect to Little Dot. How much is there to say about this particular comic, though? It's a spin-off of a spin-off, and I wouldn't say 13 years is particularly long at all for comic books. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Little+Dot%27s+Uncles+and+Aunts%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Little+Dot%27s+Uncles+and+Aunts%22" rel="nofollow">37 Google hits</a> is not inspiring, either.

<dd>I'd say there's at least enough to say about if for a full-length non-stub article. To start with, there's the task of describing the more prolific aunts and uncles themselves (if you're not familiar with Little Dot, she had hundreds of aunts and uncles, all of whom were obsessed with one particular thing). It's hardly unprecedented to have an article on a children's/humour comic, there are dozens of them, in fact. As for 13 years, it is definitely quite a long time for a non-Marvel/DC book to be published. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spawn.html" title="Spawn">Spawn</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebus.html" title="Cerebus">Cerebus</a>, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney%27s_Comics_and_Stories_7573.html" title="Walt Disney's Comics and Stories">Walt Disney's Comics and Stories</a> are a few other examples. <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_%28comics%29.html" title="Bone (comics)">Bone (comics)</a> made it to 13 years too, but that was with a highly irregular publishing schedule. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:40, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you're right about the 13 year thing, and I was just unfairly comparing it to the likes of Archie or Little Lulu. It just seems to me that the Little Dot article is plenty small enough to fit information on the spinoffs. And unless there have been published lists and descriptions of all those aunts and uncles (I can't find any, but maybe they're just not online), it kind of necessitates a pretty big amount of original research and unverifiable information. Making it a subsection of the main article removes some of the pressure to contribute O.R. for the sake of expansion. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The site meets requirement: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." - such as Cast interviews, as well as being the only dedicated site to publish advanced scheduling information from the channel itself.

<dd>You seem to be misreading the guideline. You're saying that the website has published interviews and scheduling information, but that has nothing to do with the requirement. To meet that requirement, Abc1uk.co.uk would have to be the subject of articles in other publications, such as in Entertainment Weekly or Time or some such thing. I see no evidence of that. In fact, when you first created the article, you admitted that it was an unofficial website. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abc1uk.co.uk&amp;oldid=65612378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abc1uk.co.uk&amp;oldid=65612378" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Essentially, it is a non-notable fan site, which is the reason it has been listed here. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:22, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It definitely has the potential to become a fully encyclopedic article about this aircraft, and is already not just about the incident. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 14:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Kusma's comments. I'd like to see this become an article about the aircraft itself, with the "news report" portion of it relegated to just one section of an article on what seems to be a notable aircraft. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 15:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. I believe the aircraft - and the drug seizure from it - is notable enough to warrant its own page, and it should simply be edited and expanded upon to bring it up to the appropriate level of quality. —<a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganCale_a027.html" title="User:LoganCale">LoganCale</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganCale_7022.html" title="User talk:LoganCale">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LoganCale_e338.html" title="Special:Contributions/LoganCale">contribs</a>) 14:07, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Expand and rename: Ok, I accept this could become a good article someday, I would suggest a more telling name like "N900SA DC-9" or something similar.

<p>First about Alexa ranking: almost no-one uses Alexa tool bar in Finland, so Finnish sites do not have as good Alexa rankings as their real traffic should give.</p>
<p>Playray is one of the most popular web services in Finland, and currently the service is internationalizing rapidly - in a same manner like Habbo Hotel (which also has a Wikipedia article and which is a much smaller service in Finland than Playray). The Playray community is very strong and the service has a devoted following. If this article needs to be deleted, then it means that <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogo.com.html" title="Pogo.com">Pogo.com</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo</a>, and many other gaming community service articles should be deleted too.&#160;:(</p>
<p>Check out the categories the Playray article belongs to --&gt; those category lists are full of articles of similar or smaller online gaming services. Why aren't they under deletion? Who defines what services are big enough to be described in Wikipedia?</p>
<p>There's also information about Playray in German and Finnish Wikipedias. These articles are made by several users who really wish to give accurate information. It's a sad thing that someone thinks that as spam.</p>

The title of the work as an entity is more significant than the name of it's creator. laurentdion</p>

<li>I suggested on the discussion page that the artist create a page for him/herself and include a description of this work there. I think that the examples given above are not particularly relevant due to the severe disparity in notability between those works and this one. The POV pushing in the comment above is unwelcome and hardly likely to help your case, Laurent, btw. Wikipedia is, by nature, not a community where "experts" have more rights than anyone else. FDR, for instance, was not an expert in art or art history, but you feel comfortable in using him to speak for your viewpoint. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardjames444_81a9.html" title="User:Richardjames444">Richardjames444</a> 16:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Richard, I appreciate your suggestion. However, this entry is about the EarthMan project, not the artist or creator. This is all new to me, but in reading through all of the guide to deletion and deletion policy, I see no relevent facts to delete this entry. Editing, perhaps. And yes, I am comfortable to quote FDR as above. Perhaps you all have heard of The New Deal and The Federal Arts Projects of FDR and his admin.?!

<li><b>Comment</b>. Laurent, I fail to see how any of the sources you give report anything that's actually in the wikipedia article. In fact, the sources say Earthman is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit on a Segway scooter" and say nothing about a structure (Arts Extra gives a structure, but little information on what it is. The fact that "Air Port" is part of the Earthman project had to be supplemented by you.). I'm also worried about on the sources themselves. So, the articles and the third party sources don't mesh, and the third party sources themselves give so little information about the project that it's probably not going to meet either. If all the information about the project is coming from the primary source (you), then it is in danger of being vanity. Oh yeah, please don't vote multiple times (the closing admin will be unhappy with you, at the very least) - I've striken out all of your other votes. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 06:16, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. ColourBurst, In fact, Earthman is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit". That's the work. It's EarthMan, not SPaceMan, though he is "a guy clad in a genuine-looking spacesuit", "a complex sytem..." designed to keep a person alive in the extreme environments of earth."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See "technical specs. 1 - Human, ... 1 - Silver reflective suit." It is a form of expression and an invention reflecting the reality of global warming, heatwaves, droughts, blah, blah... Spacesuit implies: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit</a> "A space suit is a complex system of garments, equipment and environmental systems designed to keep a person alive and comfortable in the harsh (lack of) environment of outer space. This applies to extra-vehicular activity outside spacecraft orbiting Earth and has applied to walking, and riding the Lunar Rover, on the Moon."</p>
<p>EarthMan is in an "earthsuit" so to say. Say of EarthMan:</p>
<p>EarthMan is a work of art and an invention. "EarthMan is a complex system of garments, equipment and environmental systems designed to keep a person alive and comfortable in the harsh (lack of) environment of Earth. This applies to extra-vehicular activity on Earth as applied to walking, and riding the Segway on Earth".</p>
<p>Those more sournce below are reliable sources that further unfold and are described in the other reliable and verifiable sources published text, photos, video and audio. Published images in the Houston Press and on their website show further what EarthMan is and describe his performance. Ch. 2 News Houston describes and shows video of EarthMan in detail, aired twice during prime time.</p>
<p>Of your concerns about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>: There is nothing "obviously wrong, absurd, or harmful" in the entry, nothing dishonest or unbelievable about EarthMan as a work of art, cited sources have "demonstrable published expertise in the field they are discussing", including the orange show staff and judges. Oh yeah, I am not voting multiple times. I am reiterating the case to include EarthMan as a Wiki article. Below are more reliable and verifiable sources. Note the judges who voted 2 awards to EarthMan. View their credentials as arts professionals and experts in the field. Watch both publications of Channel 2 news prime time coverage including video and commentary of EarthMan. EarthMan is a work of art. It is published multiple times in reputable hard copy, video and internet news, and on the website and news pages of one of America's most reputable non-profit arts organizations.</p>

It's you, no? Uh, and as you nominated for deletion above "Article reads as spam/advertising." What do you feel!</p>
<p>I find this all amusing and laughable. And so I choose to edit EarthMan as such:</p>
<p>Earth Man , also known as EarthMan, is the name of a phenomenon which has polarized people around the world, being either the product of vivid imagination or a creature that has somehow avoided close observation or capture by man.</p>
<p>Earth Man is described as a large, bipedal silver humanoid creature living in remote wilderness areas of the United States and of Canada, specifically those in south western Canada, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, large cities of the U.S. Northeast, and the U.S. Southern states. Some claim it is a creature which may be found around the world under different regional names, such as the EarthMan, Earth(Hu)man or is at least a closely related species. Sightings have allegedly occurred in Malaysia, China, Japan, Europe, and South America. [1] [2] [3]</p>
<p>The majority of scientists reject the possibility of the creature's existence, and consider the stories of Earth Man to be a combination of unsubstantiated folklore and hoax. This is due to current scientific knowledge plus the lack of bones or a body.</p>

<p>EarthMan phenomenon</p>
<p>EarthMan is one of the more famous creatures in cryptozoology. Cryptozoologist John Green has postulated that EarthMan is a worldwide phenomenon (Green 1978:16).</p>
<p>Many who consider the creature's existence a possibility claim that accounts of large, silver, ape-like or "wild man" creatures (or reports of inexplicably large, human-like footprints) from the Pacific Northwest date as far back as the late 20th century. Some researchers have argued that these earlier accounts are consistent with more contemporary EarthMan reports, while critics doubt their authenticity and question the accuracy of interpreting older reports through modern preconceptions. Skeptics also question the authenticity of these earlier reports in general, as many of them were not documented before the 1990s.</p>
<p>The earliest unambiguous reports of gigantic ape-like creatures in the Pacific northwest date from 1992, after a series of alleged encounters at a location in Washington later dubbed EarthMan Canyon, as related in The Oregonian [8] As noted in "Etymology" below, similar reports appear in the mainstream press dating back at least to the 1990s.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>EarthMan</p>
<p>The late Smithsonian primatologist John Napier noted that "the term EarthMan has been in colloquial use since the early 1990's to describe large, unaccountable human-like footprints in the Pacific northwest" (Napier, 74). However, according to Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark, Andrew Genzoli deserves credit for the first formal use of the word on October 5, 1994 (Coleman and Clark, 39-40). Genzoli was a columnist and editor at the Humbolt Times, and that day's front page story showed Jerry Crew, a bulldozer operator on a road-building crew, holding an enormous plaster cast of a footprint. The text began, "While the tracks of old EarthMan [sic] have been in evidence for some time...," before detailing the worker's claims to have discovered an enormous footprint at an isolated work site.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Eyewitness reports</p>
<p>Some cryptozoologists have argued that the most persuasive circumstantial evidence for EarthMan's existence is the high number (possibly thousands) of credible eyewitness reports from individuals, who claim to have clearly seen creatures that they describe as large, bipedal and ape-like and shiny silver.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Psychological explanations</p>
<p>Arguing against the existence of EarthMan, anthropologist David Daegling suggests that EarthMan fills a basic human need for mysteries and monsters.</p>
<p><br />
[edit]</p>
<p>Mainstream response</p>
<p>Skeptics</p>
<p>Wikipedia editors and academics generally "discount the existence of EarthMan because the evidence supporting belief in the survival of a silver prehistoric, bipedal, ape-like creature of such dimensions is scant". Furthermore, the issue is so muddied with dubious claims and outright hoaxes that many scientists do not give the subject serious attention. Napier wrote that the mainstream scientific community's indifference stems primarily from "insufficient evidence ... it is hardly unsurprising that scientists prefer to investigate the probable rather than beat their heads against the wall of the faintly possible" (Napier, 15).</p>

I think the bully is the one who abuses a not-for profit to get free advertising. --<a href="../../../x/r/b/User%7EXrblsnggt_0091.html" title="User:Xrblsnggt">Xrblsnggt</a> 17:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom as spam. As Xrblsnggt said the argument "but everyone's doing it" and didn't work in elementary school, it's a non-notable company. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigtop_067e.html" title="User:Bigtop"><font color="blue">Big</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigtop_cc5b.html" title="User talk:Bigtop"><b><font color="gray">top</font></b></a> 18:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I understand CA being a notable company based in New York, but who makes the call on these other companies in NY with Wikipedia listings: <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflex.html" title="Aeroflex">Aeroflex</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/2/On2_Technologies_6490.html" title="On2 Technologies">On2 Technologies</a>, Spectracom, <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_Marketing_f7ef.html" title="Vector Marketing">Vector Marketing</a> and <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xandros.html" title="Xandros">Xandros</a>?

<li>The "fine line" is at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Assumedly, these other companies meet this guideline. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "fine line" they are walking seems to be INline with the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. An excerpt from the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>: "A product or service is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."
<ul>
<li>So, I think they are much inline per the various articles I've seen on them.

<li>Press releases are specifically not "non-trivial" published works, which is what at least three of those appear to be. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 22:02, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>None are press releases and ALL seemed to be released independent of the company. A press release would announce a product, a partnership, or something of the sort. <a href="../../../h/o/u/User%7EHouKid_479e.html" title="User:HouKid">HouKid</a> 23:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>How are these not press releases? The first two links are from websites whose only purpose is press releases (the first website's name even has the word "press" in it!). The fourth website only has an <i>extremely</i> trivial mention of the company (eg. it has the word "DataSynapse" in it). The third article is borderline, as its pretty much another company talking up their product and mentioning DataSynapse, but it certainly does not constitute "multiple non-trivial published works". <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:46, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How come you nominated this page for deletion? The author of the site hasn't even been given time to write his case of why it shouldn't be deleted.

Please respond as I would greatly like to hear your thoughts on this matter. I run the official fan club of that actress btw.. She may not be up to Masuimi Max's status yet but she has a fan base and we don't understand why the article on her has to be deleted. <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Velvetgeisha (<a href="../../../v/e/l/User_talk%7EVelvetgeisha_2f2d.html" title="User talk:Velvetgeisha">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Velvetgeisha_82ab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Velvetgeisha">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Well most of the aricles on Wikipedia are written by fans of their subject to begin with. I mean.. who would write about something they don't even care about? Some maybe but most have some interrest in their subject. Also just because someone runs and official fanclyb doesn't mean they are die-hard fans... I know of people who work for the managment/agent of bands/actors etc. that get paid to run the fan club. --<small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Animgoth (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Animgoth_07cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Animgoth">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small> 16:40, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I am norwegian and I know many norwegians who don't speak swedish (or understand it) and I know even less that understands danish..we do however have no problem reading danish due to the fact that Bokmål is very similar to the written danish and is in fact related to it.--Animgoth 00:56, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable. Another upbeat post about a person who hopes to be a star one day. Pleasant, but as such belongs more on mySpace than WP. User active for exactly one day, a day which began and ended with this article. Bio cut and pasted from personal website. Potential vanity tagged for over a month, with no response. As far as I can tell, his highest-profile film role was as an extra in a Gene Wilder movie. Seems like a prototypical struggling actor, but the quest for notability does not itself convey notability. Still, I think some discussion is warranted as he's Australian, and to an American like me it's difficult to assess levels of celebrity there. <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 15:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The assassin of King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_Greece_dce4.html" title="George I of Greece">George I of Greece</a> does not seem independently notable.

Even considering his motivation, Wikipedia (on the King George article) seems to be at odds with the rest of the web, where mentions as "deranged" or "lunatic" were vastly more usual than "Macedonian liberation fighter" (Macedonian nationalism at work?).

<li><b>Keep</b>, yes, the content is covered by the article on King George, but it detracts nothing from the quality of Wikipedia on having a separate article on his assasin as well.

<dd>Hello bogdan. Thanks for uploading those articles. But to cite the NYT for a reliable source I find rather ridiculous. Even now, 100 years since then, the average american could not point out Europe on a map if they saw it, let alone in the far 1913 to divide ethnicities. Further, those uploaded articles, <i>if you take a good look</i>, do NOT say, Schinas was a Greek. The first definitely does not and the second has no relevance to any name. So it could be - yes, a portugese pirate as you said on my disc.page. I can see that it in fact IS the origin of Schinas that disturbs you. So the other infos that you pointed out might be kept but - in the matter of the origin it is still a dispute. Accordingly I am changing that remark to the previous, as it is a defile, until a really reliable source is found. --J. Cosmos 12:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The articles say he was a "Greek subject" (i.e. a Greek citizen). They don't mention which were his origins (he may have been a Macedonian, but we need a <b>source</b> for that).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> why can't categories exist in tandem with list? Lists serve their own functions, they are more pesky and wrought with deadlinks, but that's the fuckn' fun of them, why delete them? If anything we should have a new kind of link: A GREEN LINK, which denotes a link which needs to be developed. The dead/RED links should either be converted to bold text or deleted. Yeah deadlinks are band but their should be some way that new links are easily inserted in to our wiki-world. What I like about lists is how they often are added to by newbies, whereas the newbies may not know how to properly introduce a idea in an article's talk page. Again why get rid of the tool known as lists? I dont understand the motivation behind this movement. Please explain. <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 05:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>keep. the categories still won't be comprehensive. a list at least has the possbility and again will compel people to create new entries for bands. Categories for bands work with big genres. Straight edge isn't a big genre. Looking at the categories vs the list should actually sum up the difference and the need for the list, since over half of the bands on the list aren't on the category, not because they aren't notable to the topic but because no one has bothered to create a wiki, again, there is a difference.

<li>The idea of having a page for the officers of a college organization is an unjustifiable drain on wikipedia resources.

<p>The book is being currently published at iUniverse. Unless the book catches fire, drowns in water, or in any other way is destroyed, it will be available in book stores.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I disagree with the "crystal ball" comments -- the book does appear to be available -- but I do agree that the article fails to establish notability. iUniverse is a vanity press; it certainly does not establish notability for the works published through it. Being "available to all bookstores" does not establish notability. If the book <i>actually gets shelved</i> in a large number of bookstores, <i>that</i> would probably establish notability. Failing that, I think we'd need a lot more evidence (a review from a reputable reviewer, etc.) <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 21:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some Glentoran players are professional and others are not (e.g. <a href="http://www.spawrt.com/News/News.asp?Brann-with-lucky-win-vs-Glentoran=&amp;Nr=2591" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spawrt.com/News/News.asp?Brann-with-lucky-win-vs-Glentoran=&amp;Nr=2591" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> describes Glentoran as having "only a couple of professional players") It is unclear whether Mannus is one of them, but as reserve goalkeeper it is unlikely. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 19:28, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> if Mannus played in any of Glentoran's UEFA games, I'd be for a keep, but I can't see that he did and I'm not sure that six league appearances (given that the IPL isn't fully pro as Oldelpaso says) is enough. Or if he'd been the first choice goalie I'd have gone with a keep, but as he's off on loan, that's not going to happen for a while, if at all. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 10:54, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I saw on the second nomination that someone was arguing that FFXIclopedia had been used as a source in Wikipedia and cited <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_XI_character_classes_243d.html" title="Final Fantasy XI character classes">Final Fantasy XI character classes</a> as an example. I am largely responsible for the current content of that page and I took absolutely none of it from FFXIclopedia. I don't have strong feelings one way or another about the AfD, but I do feel strongly that if the argument is to be used that FFXIclopedia is being used as a source on Wikipedia and that's why it's notable, I should point out that at least in one of the cases where it's being claimed as a source, the claim is untrue. -<a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaCha%27ar_c718.html" title="User:RaCha'ar">RaCha'ar</a> 14:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I notice that the person who nominated this page is a main contributor to the <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> page. Again, this page has all the same information as the WoWWiki page. As I stated in the last AfD discussion, if you want to delete this, then the WoWWiki needs a nomination as well.
<p>Regarding notability: All your statements about total users and total traffic and total Alexa rankings are in absolutes. They are not in relative terms. Relative to the FFXI universe, FFXIclopedia is extremely notable. As stated above, it is now the third most trafficked FFXI website, behind one site that caters to 8 MMORPGs, and another that is the premier database for FFXI material. FFXIclopedia is the premier site for FFXI guides and other information on the web. It has even surpassed the official game website for traffic. However, all these numbers are relative. You all seem to want to ignore relative figures. FFXIclopedia is notable. Just because you have never heard of it, does not make it non-notable. Within the FFXI community, of which none of you appear to be a part, FFXIclopedia is one of the most notable sites.</p>
<p>Regarding verifiability: Ok, it can't be verified. Which is why I mention WoWWiki. The person who nominated this page, is a significant editor of the WoWWiki page. Kind of hypocritical, don't you think? Especially when both their entries look almost exactly the same. However, because more people play WoW, any AfD discussion, no matter how weak the arguments, will defeat the nomination. Check out the previous arguments to save the WoWWiki: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_WoWWiki_0631.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WoWWiki">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WoWWiki</a>. None of them were even nearly as deep as the ones made to save the FFXIclopedia. In sum, they said, "It's popular, keep." Nothing about verifiability, nothing.</p>
<p>This whole debate is hypocritical. If you are going to have such a huge stick up your ... then nominate <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> for deletion too. The original person to nominate this article, for the third time I might add, is the biggest hypocrit of them all.</p>
<p>I have nothing further. Just delete it. The Wikipedia as a whole is a farse. It's editors rule in their own little feifdom and cry foul when anyone pushes them out of sorts.

<li>I don't think anything AbsolutDan has to say about this AfD is <i><b>notable</b></i>. He is completely biased about this article and no matter what evidence is presented supporting this article, he will continue to fight it. His previous arguments in the second nomination failed to cause the article to be removed, and it should be no different here. Showing proof of how similar articles are allowed to exist, but being just as non-notable as this article is a completely valid method for keeping this article. You claim that "we would never make any progress", yet that is how the world works. I've watched enough Law and Order (haha joke here) to know that in a courtroom you present previous cases to build your own. I also believe that the people who are part of the Final Fantasy XI community should be the judges on the notability of this article. Just because something doesn't appear in a newspaper or other "reliable source" doesn't mean it's notable to enough people. What we have here is a number of people, who know nothing about the Final Fantasy XI community, arguing the validity of this article. As I've said before, that's just laughable. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 19:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I will not change my vote. They are making the same arguments to keep their article that we are making here. WoWWiki is a notable resource of information for World of Warcraft players. No wikipedian can say otherwise. This entire ordeal about deleting these specific types of articles should raise discussion on a new type of policy. These types of articles fall into a very gray area in Wikipedia guidelines and policies. Things get bad before they get better. I believe the arguing on both sides here should be enough to begin a topic on creating a policy to govern these types of articles. Guildwiki, FFXIclopedia and WoWWiki will not be the last of it's kind to find their way here. They are probably the top resources for people in each of their respective communities, which is absolutly notable, wether or not they are talked about in some reliable source. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 14:15, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just want to say it shouldn't be delete because: the last 3 days the player count raised steadily with each day 150+ new players, the game was in beta fase before this. We even got an article on digg.com about it so I see no reason why this information on how to getting started ingame should be removed.</p>
<p>I also got the permission of the author: Anshar who can be found at #nabu on Quakenet (IRC) to publish this information, he even encouraged me.</p>
<p>Btw, I edited the page and it still is a work in progress, I'll be adding new information to it daily.</p>
<p>Andrew Lenahan, it is a virtual world, you earn money by "sending spam" because you are a virtual hacker, there is no real spam ofcourse. Btw TheFarix, I don't advertise it, I just wrote a guide how you can play the game, I got no personal gain if you sign up for the game or not.</p>

<p>Dear Wikipedia community The attacks against my good name are politically and racially motivated.</p>
<p>Let me calmly respond: Jeff Fisher is a well known unstable person currently unfortunately homeless. His claim that I rigged the 2004 election is of course pure fantasy and as such needs immediate removal <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPiotr_Blass&amp;diff=67360452&amp;oldid=67356901" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPiotr_Blass&amp;diff=67360452&amp;oldid=67356901" rel="nofollow">Removed legal threat</a>). <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 01:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>The Ulam Quarterly Journal pioneered the entire web movement in the USA. We were the eggheads who did it for free and for love. Give me credit and enjoy the web with my best wishes and my blessing</p>
<p>I cannot tell you about being an unremarkable mathematician. Please ask for example Zariski,Grothendieck,Mumford and Deligne Field's medallists or anyone of my students including for example Chris Skinner who went on to work with Andy Wiles or Scott Flansburg who went on to have thousands of students of his own. Finally I ask the community to protect me from defamatory attacks against me and my family. If you are unable to do it then indeed we need to part company today. Ulam Lives! dr piotr blass</p>

I doubt Deligne uses email but certainly wouldn't bother him with this. Finally, according to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics_Genealogy_Project_a991.html" title="Mathematics Genealogy Project">Math.Genealogy</a> Blass had a total of three grad students (neither of the two mentioned above) <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7241" class="external autonumber" title="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7241" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems somewhat notable as a politician, and as a mathematician. Vanity and/or unfamiliarity with Wikipedia procedures are no reasons for deletion if the subject is notable. His research in <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surface.html" title="Zariski surface">Zariski surface</a> seems somewhat notabale, and this compunded with being a candidate for an important election makes him notable in my book. Claims for work on early Internet and being an advisor/close coworker of some famous people, while they would make him clearly notable, need independent sources, but even without them I think he fits the borderline claim for notability.

<p>mhem and ryulong have been truly astounding. They seem to be rather young and I choose to forgive them and to ask them to sin no more. My mathematics speaks for itself and the theory os zariski surfaces which i created with zariski and hironaka has inspired top quality work all over the world---especially lately in Japan where Shimada has made great strides. Moreover the work is being generalized to higher dimesions as we speak with applications to cryptography and physics (parallell universes). Several papers in Compositio Mathematica and in Paris Academy Proceedings may be an indication that the mathematical beginners attacking me need to get a little more sophistication. I shall be happy to tutor them. Let us not have Cultural Revolution a la Mao in Wikipedia with hatred filled youngsters intimidating older faculty.

If Piotr Blass wants a Wikipedia entry on Piotr Blass, the best thing for him to do right now would be to back off and hope that somebody else creates an <i>unbiased</i> article.

<dd><i>Comment</i> There is now a reference for this on the article page, however, the reference only states it is <i>one of</i> the first peer-reviewed electronic journals. Out of the four journals listed by the source as early peer-reviewed electronic journals, only the Ulam Quarterly is mentioned in Wikipedia -- and ironically, all of the other ones were more successful that UQ. The source <i>does</i> back up the claim somewhat, but simultaneously strikes a blow against the notability of the publication or Dr. Blass. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaysweet_f27f.html" title="User:Jaysweet">Jaysweet</a> 17:59, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s><b>KEEP</b></s> (Vote struc out as repeated vote by same IP address) I am so happy to see decent people come to the defense of my page and of the truth . The people attacking us are anonymous and not well informed. My friend and relative Emmanuel Ax is a pianist Mark Levine my collaborator and friend is a very strong geometer in Boston. The red guard type calls him a pianist! The primacy of the Ulam quurterly can be checked with Odlyzko who wrote about us before 1990 as one of the early models of electronic publishing .Reference will be supplied as soon as you stop blocking me or even sooner. Also the journal was typeset in or very close to einstein's office at IAS princeton. I can probably can testimony from there if necessary. Comments by ryulong and salix users are anonymous attempts at smearing us. Perhaps we should just ignore these attacks with so little integrity. As for the links added to my allegedly forging the 2004 election ---let us just laugh---were caused my mental patients. Perhaps it would be best to remove that . It is up to you. The Zeosync drama keeps unfloding. I am the one person trying to salavage this intellectual property---i am the good guy who gets criticed---- There is hope for wikipedia if we can talk at this level.

<li><b>Week delete</b> Following <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> I think there is enough to warrent sufficient notabliity. However I'm still voting delete as I am not convinced we can keep this page sufficiently objective. The page has improved somewhat but we still have not got to the root of how Ulam quarterly and the role it played in the development of the internet, was it just an early use, or did it effect the development of any of the protocols or browsers, or increase its popularity? Do we have any documentation about it? More concerning is the many mentions of Blass in a negative light, in conection with evidence he may have had about posible tampering of vote counting machines. There are many references to him in left-wing/democratic blogs, another recient one is <a href="http://nomorefraud.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://nomorefraud.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Roger Rancourt</a>, and there is even a signed afidavite which mentions his name (link escapes me). It seem like Blass is a contriversal figure at the moment and it may be simplest simply not to have an article, rather than an article which we cannot effectivly maintain.</li>
<li>p.s. As for my anominity, I'm not I have a user page with links just about all there is to know about me. As for anit-jewish motives, I had not even relalised that until Poitr mentioned it. It may actually be the case that the cricicism and attacks on external websites on Blass may be more to do with the fact that hes caught up in a situation which could damage the current govenment (and hence of interest to the left) than for any grounds of race. Still thats politics. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 00:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: There's a lot of name-dropping that still needs to be removed and unsourced material needs to be expunged also, per Wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>). What will be left after all that is a bio with some basic background on family, education, etc., references to <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zariski_surface.html" title="Zariski surface">Zariski surface</a>, and possibly the Zeosync stuff and political campaigning stuff. With all this other non-mathematical stuff, it seems there is enough notability (notoriety?) to establish a keep vote. However, I really have no wish to keep a bio that is mainly kept because of minor scandals of dubious notability or verifiability. Additionally, Blass' mathematical notability was marginal anyway; it's no real loss or gain to have this mathematician's bio or not. As others have commented, it may just be too much trouble. After all, don't we have better things to do than patrol this page with the goal of what, not improving the article (since there's not really much potential in it), but instead with the goal of keeping it trimmed down to a stub or semi-stub? That's really the problem with these marginal mathematician bios. Most of the time, people say "keep" because they don't see the harm in it, and there is some marginal notability. In this case, we have the subject insisting on spending his free time changing the article to his blog/webpage. It's really too much trouble to bother with, I would think.</li>
<li><b>One last comment to Piotr Blass</b>: if Piotr Blass is reading this, I think he ought to know that he <i>really</i> does not want a Wikipedia bio. It's near certain that people are going to eventually edit out most of his additions to result in an article that, in his viewpoint, attacks his reputation and reflects badly on him. I really think if he understood this, he would vote "delete". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 06:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If at some point someone is prepared to write an article documenting the use of the <i>phrase</i> "equal access to justice", the loss of this material will not stop them. There is almost no semantic content beyond what the literal definition of the words might imply, and obviously no sources or assertions of notability. The current article seems to be a back-formation by someone with an interest in inserting material about Lopez (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election%2C_1996&amp;diff=67299424&amp;oldid=66088472" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election%2C_1996&amp;diff=67299424&amp;oldid=66088472" rel="nofollow">this</a>, especially), and combined with the poor writing (whatever "finer points of justice" might be, they are not something people would "access"), gives me no confidence the original editor has a firm grasp on whatever it is they are trying to report on. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 03:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't see anything that meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Maria Danes has 1 album released on a minor indie label. All info I found about Paul Killington was in relation to the songs he has written for Maria Danes. There are some awards, etc that she apparently won, but nothing that would constitute a major music award. There is a contention of regional touring, but that does not qualify under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. If kept this needs an obvious rewrite (no offense to the primary contributor who is obviously new at this) and should be moved to Maria Danes as the current name is not the conventional was of listing. Paul Killington could have brief mention as her songwriting collaborator, but I don't see anything that would come even close to qualifying him for a standalone article even if Maria Danes is kept.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE&#160;!!!!</b> Well, I can't see where you've disproven the factual basis of Maria Daines and Paul Killingtons existence as a major influence on the world in which we live through her music and humanitarian contributions that have made a positive impact on humanity and its behaviour in terms of all living things. So, who am I to stop you from recommending deletion...... I actually wish you would help to re-write the article, and perhaps format this page. It's obvious that you are far more proficient at editing and contributing than we are. So, please, go ahead and operate as you see fit&#160;!!!! By the way, Maria Daines and Paul Killington are very well known throughout the world. Perhaps, a bit more digging, and you shall find that Maria and Paul are REAL PEOPLE&#160;!!!!</p>
<p>Also, it would be a shame to remove Maria and paul from Wikipedia. I don't know how this place operates, but, if your statements are in fact a vote towards the uncertainty of their existence.....I am countering your opinion with my own, that they are true human beings with hearts as big as the universe.....</p>
<p>You vote no...I vote yes&#160;!!!! Now, I suppose we need only have one more person state their opinion, and vote to decide all of this....</p>
<p>In other words......PLEASE HELP&#160;!!!!!&#160;;-)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, yes... I second what <a href="../../../n/o/1/User%7ENo1lakersfan_aff9.html" title="User:No1lakersfan">No1lakersfan</a> said. Nobody is suggesting that Maria Danes &amp; Paul Killington don't exist or that they don't make music. Their existance is verifiable; Maria Dane's 1 album is sold on Amazon.com... I'm also not questioning their dedication to their craft or their dedication to humanitarian causes. The problem is that Wikipedia has guidelines for what musical acts are appropriate for articles. These guidelines can be found at this link: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. If you feel they qualify for inclusion based on this criteria, please explain which criteria they meet (and include a link to a website or cite a print article from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, etc that would prove this.

<p>Oh...O.K. then...if you want proof of their notability....I'll give you a few hints...Maria and Paul have been featured on the BBC Cambridge, and BBC Cornwall as recently as a few days ago&#160;!!!! They give live interviews, and discuss their music and plight to aid in making this planet a better place for us all. Also, Maria and Paul are up for an award for their song, I Am The Owner Of This Coat at an animal activist award ceremony that is to take place this year in Los Angeles, California, USA. Maria has received correspondence with regards to all her hard work from many people around the globe...as can be evidenced by the guestbook on her website. Maria and Paul are not signed to a major record label, however, what determines what a major music label is anymore. What with all the changes in the industry, even a web based band can rise to extreme noteriety without all the trappings of a major record label, and the ultimate position of poverty they have been responsible for of many artists around the world. I'll take small and independent labels over major labels anyday&#160;!!!! Now there's one for your WP:MUSIC article for updating and correlation of Major versus minor label distribution endearing itself to how noteable an artist is.... Hey, don't believe that Maria and Paul are noteable....check this out.... A google search that shows many, many pages of references to Maria and her great work and accomplishments that span many pages with no interruptions in reference to Maria Daines <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=maria+daines&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=maria+daines&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> I guess what I'msaying in reality is, just because an artist hasn't made the grade on the WP:MUSIC guidelines here at Wikipedia, doesn't mean they aren't noteable to many tens of thousands of people accross the planet.</p>
<p>Oh well...I suppose that being part of a UN department of information group that is NGO probably has no bearing on the situation either.... <a href="http://justnicephotos.homestead.com/MusiciansAgainstFur.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://justnicephotos.homestead.com/MusiciansAgainstFur.html" rel="nofollow">[52]</a></p>
<p>Alrighty, I have tried to make my case for Maria and Paul...Let the chips fall where they may.....But, please remember, being noteable by one standard, doesn't mean some one is not noteable by other standards....</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>ZEST 19:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I have notified Maria and Paul of this discussion, I hope they get the message in time..... Perhaps, since you are so kind as to offer assitance, could you please contact them directly to help&#160;???? maria@maria-daines.com</p>
<p>FURTHER TO THE DEBATE:</p>
<p>I would say that this case and my own - I was recently deleted - reveals Wikipedia's true colours. Wikipedia appears to be an elitist organisation of snobs who are more interested in what is mainstream media approved rather than talent, creativity or other work! In other words if you're a 'celeb' you are in and if you are not approved as this you are not!</p>
<p>Wikipedia is clearly more interested in red-tape and bureacracy and advancing the Orwellian nightmare fascist world.</p>
<p>Who makes these rulings as to who is a 'notable' person or band and who is not?</p>
<p>I was not 'notable' enough despite having had an EP out on a proper label (Crai Records), having worked with musicians such as Crum (ex-Hawkwind), Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson (Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals) and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival and the Green Man Festival as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME were simply not good enough!</p>
<p>Faced with this sort of logic is it any wonder that musicians take matters into their own hands and promote their songs online or release their music on their own labels?</p>
<p>Maria and Paul have both been featured on national BBC radio so should qualify under the rulings here even if I don't and I hope to see their entry not deleted!</p>

Calling Wikipedia an "elitist organisation of snobs" and "fascist" isn't really going to do much to convince people to take your arguments seriously. At the end of the day, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia as has <i>some</i> standards for inclusion (notably <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in this case). I'm very sorry if some editors determined that an article about you was not suitable for the project, but that doesn't really have any bearing on this particular article, or this discussion. Realistically speaking, whether or not this article survives will have absolutely no effect on the careers of Maria Danes &amp; Paul Killington, or their ability to release their music.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:24, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I can understand why this was AfD'd, but don't let the amateurish website mislead you. RFD (the magazine, not the website) is nationally distributed, and has indeed been published for three decades now, and is considered both a pioneering publication and an influential one in the rural faerie/queer community. It's written for an audience that includes large numbers of people living "off the grid", so it's no surprise that it doesn't generate a lot of web chatter. Besides, I pulled up 1,740 ghits! Article should be expanded, not deleted. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 06:30, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is the first track on the Incredible String Band's second album. It was not released as a single. It is a pleasant song but it is not a notable song. The article itself is two lines long; I cannot envisage it being made much longer without extensive, autistic padding. "<i>It is 4:44 long and starts in the key of D. It was recorded on 12 July 1968 at Studio One of Abbey Road in North London, England. The acoustic guitar was recorded with a Studer B12 microphone run through an Ampex compressing system</i>" and so forth, except of course that this kind of information is unavailable because the Incredible String Band does not have a Mark Lewisohn. A google search returns two thousand computer-generated pages of lyrics and links to Amazon.com's page for the album.

"Important enough" is a fairly subjective term. WP Corporate Standards are:</p>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: <i>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i></p>
<p>A competent online search will show that C/D/H clearly meets this standard. <b>The article on C/D/H should stand.</b> Leadingindicator5022 18:51, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article has no coherent thesis. It contains only abstruse and arbitrary POV selections of undefinedly "successful" automobiles, consisting of one individual's pet makes and models—straight POV, as it seems. It might be marginally appropriate as a "top ten" blog même, but it is most unencyclopædic. An article specifically and narrowly listing longest-running vehicle models <i>or</i> longest-running vehicle model names <i>might</i> be debatably less inappropriate. Either is arguably just as trivial and unworthy of Wikispace as the present article. <b>NOTE TO KARMANN:</b> I agree with you that racial slurs have no place in Wikipedia (except perhaps as illustrative examples in an article about racism), but your unnecessarily strident language is not helping your case or winning you allies. --<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7EScheinwerfermann_3853.html" title="User:Scheinwerfermann">Scheinwerfermann</a> 02:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, although not for the reasons given - a badly written article only desrves to be edited, not wiped out.

<li><b>Keep</b> As creator of this article, this is meant to measure success by longevity of the nameplate or niche, so this makes possible including long lived cars which might have a lower sales volume, such as the Nash/AMC ambassador. Also rather than just being a list, it has a short commentary on how a car might have earned, or paradoxically gotten such a status despite apparent defects. Most of the articles are sourced to citations that also say the automobile in question was notably a sales success. I continue to be apalled by the exclusionary and negative attitude of so many WP editors who have identified themselves above, and practiced the tactics I have highlighted on my user page as being distressing, especially deleting articles entirely. Deleting articles is usually because the article causes some sort of harm against an individual or party, that is certainly not the case here, and most of the entries are sourced. I am especially surprised by Karmann who contributed an especially low-quality article on the Taurus, which I upgraded in terms of facts and reduced POV, but was reverted. Karmann has since contributed only complaint tags, and now this undeserved AFD. I would encourage all involved to participate in refining the writing and adding other cars, not kicking it down. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 21:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not have any interest in the "debate" between the nominator and the article creator. I agree that Mediation is probably the best route. I went through and did some POV rewrite. It's far from perfect but I'm hitting a road block with sources. Another issue that I'm seeing is with the name. How is a "Successful automobile" being defined? The original intro paragraph didn't lay out the definition in an objective, encyclopedic matter. I do think the article's editors need to better establish this parameter or else the article really has no where else to go. As for the AfD, I'm personally abstaining from voting. It's my opinion that the article still needs a lot of work but I do not know how interest the article editors are in going that path. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 01:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It started out as long-lived nameplate, and got changed. The current defintion is that the nameplate, or similar nameplates must last over 20 years, and be cited elsewhere as being conspicuously successful, preferably outside of WP, though an existing WP article will do. I would suggest changing it back to longest running to distinguish it from the similar, but slightly different list of bestselling cars. Might be a good idea to put a very short limit on summaries, the top selling article does have a few one-line comments. --<a href="../../../w/i/a/User%7EWiarthurhu_a86e.html" title="User:Wiarthurhu">matador300</a> 01:22, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a page about a band that has just signed a record deal.

Google presence is minimal, and the band's website is not up yet.

I'm trying to create stubs for Alaska libraries, and then get back to them all and fill out the information on each library. It's taking a while. Just because a library is small doesn't seem to me to be a reason to delete the article about it. I'd say it's rather significant that such a small town (Anchor Point is NOT big) actually has a library. I'm working on two lists relating to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Alaska_7339.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Alaska">Wikipedia:WikiProject Alaska</a>: Alaska newspapers and periodicals, and Alaska libraries. I'll grant that it might be more appropriate to put this information under Anchor Point rather than as a separate article, depending on what I find out about the library. I also wouldn't bet that it has no rare documents—a lot of small libraries in Alaska have interesting tidbits from the early 1900s and earlier, town founders and whatnot having come up with the Russians or the gold stampeders. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_1773.html" title="User:Deirdre">Deirdre</a> 19:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Suggestion</b> I'm concerned that Wikipedia is full of projects that people start and then never finish (not to imply this is one of them), so this could set a bad precedent. Perhaps if you created the stub pages in your personal namespace (or in a Wiki of your own) and then moved them into the article namespace en masse when they're ready? Simply put a "User:Deirdre/" in front of them like so: <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeirdre_Anchor_Point_Public_Library_20a5.html" title="User:Deirdre/Anchor Point Public Library">User:Deirdre/Anchor_Point_Public_Library</a> - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 21:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Most probably mentioned at some point:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Solar Empire is one of the oldest PHP Games still in existence as a "living" project, with multiple forks and support (continual) from multiple developers. The front website is an informal developer meeting place. Of the official websites, <a href="http://www.quantum-star.com" class="external text" title="http://www.quantum-star.com" rel="nofollow">Quantum Star Solar Empire</a> has an Alexa ranking of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.quantum-star.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.quantum-star.com" rel="nofollow">378,378</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The project (both SE and QS) have consistently been among the top 5 PHP Turn Based and Real Time Strategy Games on the Sourceforge.net site - the standard lookup point for open source projects in all programming languages. Activity has likewise consistently remained above 90%. These two points are a matter of public record. Statistics for all SF projects are available at their respective project listings. With QS (the most popular distribution since 2003), ranking on SF has never fallen below 15,000. Highest point was in May/June 2005 ranked 767. This is the ranking out of all projects on SF irrespective of language, genre, license, etc. The ranking is based on page views, downloads, development stats. It is a seasonal measure but the trend has improved consistently year on year. It's worth noting two SE games are listed - both with similar stats as separate projects. We jointly occupy 2 of the top-ten slots in our category genre most of the time...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Article was originally added by an otherwise unknown player. It was subsequently edited with the support of almost all the current developers and only after consultation with the original authors (none of which are developers). It has since been openly edited by numerous others, none of which have made major edits (our consultation paid off with no disputes evident).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The subsequent contributor did not make things up, if that's a concern. The facts in the article were checked (twice), the writer is a reputable source (a professional PHP and Web Application Security analyst with a Big 4 Chartered Accounting firm; on the role-call at Zend.com as an Article contributor for Devzone; web administrator for upstart <a href="http://www.patternsforphp.com" class="external text" title="http://www.patternsforphp.com" rel="nofollow">Patterns For PHP</a>). Author is also ranked as Guru on the PHP Developer Network forums as a daily contributor to the net's largest PHP Forums. Currently in the process of writing a book on PHP with several others - in fact he's an Administrator for that book project.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The QS blog which covers SE and QS in detail, along with PHP Game Development and PHP Security as topics has frequently been reported on by Zend's Devzone (the company behind the PHP language), Planet-PHP and PHPDeveloper.org - these are the primary PHP related news/blog/article reporting sites for PHP on the web. It's relatively difficult to get listed on these without proof of some professionalism in PHP and a flair for writing relevant, informed and interesting content.</dd>

<li>As stated in the artcile this game is now 7 years old. It's not something that only popped up a couple of days ago. It's likely amoung the oldest still-active PHP games out there.</li>
<li>It's had THOUSANDS (probably ten's of thousands) of unique users play it. Is that notable enough?</li>
<li>It's a fully formed article. If you want to delete something, may I suggest one of the many thousands of stubs that are lying around this place?</li>
<li>This article wasn't created by any of the developers (that I'm aware of). Look at the history. It was created by one "The King of Hearts". When we (the devs) found out about the article, we proceeded to update it and correct many the errors. These devs are specifically listed in the SE history as Maugrimtr, DJCapelis, mjac and Moriarty</li>
<li>Run a google for "Solar Empire". The top 8 results are all for this game, preceding even a TV series's IMDB entry of the same-name as well as the soon to be released "Sins of a Solar Empire" which comes in at ninth entry in the search.---22:09 UTC - 4-Aug-2006 <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriarty_7c81.html" title="User:Moriarty">User:Moriarty</a></li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Someone mentioned a possible WP:V violation due to the fact that it hasn't been reviewed in one of the gaming rags. While this may or may not be accurate it seems a bit silly, CVS logs are _much_ more verifiable than anything out of a new rag, or am I missing something?</p>
<dl>
<dd>CVS logs, near as I can tell (I am not a SourceForge junkie and therefore only have a vague understanding of what CVS logs even are), are either primary sources (e.g. statements made by the developers) or unreliable secondary sources (e.g. forum-esque posts). <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and its cohort <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> explicitly want reliable secondary sources, which do not appear to exist. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 02:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Have you guys changed the rules (WP editors)? The last header said this was a "notability" deletion thing and if you disagreed you could delete the header giving reasons (which is what I did). Now it's been changed and points here and says not to delete the header. I wish you folks would be consistant. This particlar debate is very one-sided as I don't see anyone giving any reasons FOR deletion (now that the notability thing has disappeared). -- 22:09 UTC - 4-Aug-2006 <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriarty_7c81.html" title="User:Moriarty">User:Moriarty</a></p>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. We have a metric ton of articles on various SourceForge game projects; Solar Empire is the 49th most downloaded in the "Turn-based games" category, right between <a href="../../../l/o/r/Attal%7E_Lords_of_Doom_7c61.html" title="Attal: Lords of Doom">Attal: Lords of Doom</a> and <a href="../../../v/g/a/VGA_Planets_92c3.html" title="VGA Planets">VGA Planets</a>, surrounded by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freelords.html" title="Freelords">Freelords</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Xenocide_833b.html" title="Project Xenocide">Project Xenocide</a>, and Promisance. The 'Pedia is markedly inclusive towards commercial games, particularly since pretty much all console releases are guaranteed reviews in major media; OSS games, however, get virtually no press, and therefore are not nearly as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Since WP:V is hard policy, I'm going to lean in that direction unless 1up or Kotaku or somebody has an article and/or review on it. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 07:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
