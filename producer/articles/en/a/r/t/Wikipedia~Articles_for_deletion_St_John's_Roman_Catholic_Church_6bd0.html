<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus (merged)</b>, as I count seventeen delete votes and nine keep votes (plus an odd-man-out merge vote), with issues being confused by interpersonal disputes instead of discussion of the subject. While I don't see a firm consensus to delete this article, what I do see is a rather bare stub (that people were apparently unable to expand or reference during the AFD period), and a consensus to not have a separate article about this church.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I feel certain that there is individuality and historical significance to this <i>church,</i> but this <i>article</i> is yet another attempt at getting Wikipedia to house the local Yellow Pages. No information in the <i>article</i> (that's what we're debating, and any vote that mentions "churches" as opposed to the article ought to be discounted as simply not applicable) indicates what is almost sure to be there. If a rewrite or a new article on the church explained its status, function, and place in history, it would be fine. As it is, not at all.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I suspect that the number of members (5,300) is inflated because it is bigger than the population of the entire town (4,212). The surrounding communities have churches of their own, I checked. According to <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_2_28/ai_114090210" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_2_28/ai_114090210" rel="nofollow">this source</a>, church attendance in Scotland is about 11 percent. If that is the case here, the number has been overestimated by over ten times. Even if church attendance in town is significantly higher than average, it is still far lower than the number given, unless the church has a lot of members that travel from other towns. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 01:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Are people sniffing glue? The article title is "St John's Roman Catholic Church," but the article (anyone read that?) says that it's not the name of the church. Supposing, however, that it were the name, how many <b>other churches</b> have that name? How many in New York City? How many in New York State? How many in New Jersey? How many in England? How many in South Africa? How many in Australia? The name collisions are inestimable. Wikipedia is NOT the Yellow Pages. Please, folks, get sane about this. I know you want every high school in the universe, including all home schools, to be included, but just think for a moment about what happens when you unthinkingly vote "keep OMG why are you nominating this!" on a misnamed, misplaced, empty article like this one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:45, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: as I am the only one who edited the nomination after you did, is your comment is about me or did you think of something to add later? I voted to delete the article, and the church's full name isn't relevant to my comment, only that it's the correct town. The article would need to be renamed to its full name, if kept, and I found a lot of churches named "Saint John the Evangelist", so if all the other churches are added, there would be a huge amount of disambiguation required. I think the church's non-notability is the reason it should be deleted, however. Sorry if I misunderstood you and as for my glue abuse, no comment. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>By no means did I intend you. In fact, we were editing at the same time, so your comment wasn't visible to me when I made mine. I was reacting to the votes above that were repeats of those given whenever the voter thinks that the issue is "notability" and my suspicion that they are afraid that admitting that a particular church is an improper <i>subject</i> is going to transfer into a statement that a particular <i>school</i> is an improper subject. I was simply trying to remind folks that it's not the subject we assess, but the article (per my rant above). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:12, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd like to be. I really, really would, but this has been going on for two years now. When "consensus" gets inflated to be a requisite 80%, it only takes a couple of people who don't read the article but who vote on "principle" to get a vandal article kept. Folks mentioned that the nominator has a history of abuse. Is it possible that his nomination was not "let's get a good article deleted" but "let's get a bad article kept?" The fact that he's controversial means that folks need to keep a tight grip on their knees and not let them jerk so violently as to type a vote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:12, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Maybe you should just keep your own contentious, uncivil rants off the AfD pages. If you don't like the policies upon which WP is built (in this case, the AfD consensus policy) go whine about it somewhere else without insulting people that are voting their own philosophical position. You have absolutely <b>no idea</b> whether editors read the article, vote as blocs, or whatever else. And suggesting that "voting on principle" is somehow wrong is hypocritical, elitist, consdescending and rude. Your vote and rant is every bit as much a "vote on principle" as your largely irrelevant dissertations demonstrate. Referring to an editor's <b>obvious</b> good-faith contribution as a "vandal article" is a clear violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 16:19, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That's funny. I have been here for long enough to watch "consensus," which actually isn't defined by policy, get informally increased from majority to 70% to 80% to near unanimity. I have been here watching and voting since VfD had a whopping 30 articles a day to now it's routine 170 a day. I have been part of defining policy for that long as well. Do I know if votes are bused? I certainly do. Do I know if voting on principle without regard for the article is incorrect? I certainly do. If you feel that my comments apply to you, then that is your business, but, given the fact that this church's membership is greater than the town's population, your conclusion that it is "obviously" good faith is as suspect as that article itself. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:53, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Do I know if votes are bused? I certainly do. Do I know if voting on principle without regard for the article is incorrect? I certainly do." Please cite your evidence for these outrageous claims. You don't "know" anything. These are wild, uncivil, unsubstantiated charges that do not assuem good faith. I do not "feel that your comments apply to me", I am pointing out the absurd and unsupported nature of your ranting, whining charges. Please refrain from these offensive, uncivil rants particularly when flailing about what you "know" without citing any evidence whatsoever. Having, "been here watching and voting since... [whenver the hell you like]" doesn't make your unsubstantiated claims carry any more weight.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:54, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please do not make personal attacks. They are against policy, and, indeed, harm your case considerably. I have seen the evolution of the trends that you are defending as policy, and I can tell you that they are themselves <i>not</i> policy. They are, in fact, counter to policy. Vote the article, per the name of the page: <b>articles</b> for deletion. Do not vote "churches" or "schools" or "notability is not in the guidelines" or "webcomix must stay" or "blogs must go" or anything except the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - there are far too many churches to be listed on wikipedia. This one is not notable, and also there are probably thousands of other Roman Catholic churches out there called "St John's" (I can think of at least a dozen. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 13:36, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
