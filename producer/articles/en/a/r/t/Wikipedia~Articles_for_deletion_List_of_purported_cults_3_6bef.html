<p>The intention of the article is to present a list groups which are named "cult" in the media. No reference to scholarly research on this topic has been provided by the contributors, so they replace that with their own research. Starting with a selection, which media outlets should be considered most authorative. (<i>British Broadcasting Corporation, Encarta online encyclopedia, The Guardian, The New York Times, Salon.com, Washington Post</i>, if you bother). Then there is the equivalent of the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> in place: A group is added to the list, if it is named "cult" in one article of one source.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> So if it's hard to make a certain list, we shouldn't try? Or not try until every last person is happy, which again reduces to never making the list, or making an empty list, since members of groups so fingered would always complain, no matter how it is done? Does anyone envision us ever making a list of, not cults, but even <i>purported</i> cults, that everyone is going to agree on, especially members of the groups listed? Should we just remove 'negative' words from the language, since those described by them disagree with those words being applied to them? In any case, I don't think it is a violation of NPOV to state that a certain source has declared a certain group to be a cult, it's just a fact. Whether the original source is NPOV or not is a different question for a much different day. We shouldn't avoid hard subjects just because we're always going to have bitching and moaning.

<dd>Those are good questions but not applicable here, IMO. There where proposals made that could have resolved the dispute that you, amongst others, chose to ignore and continued editing the article without attempting to find a resolution. I find your characterization of "bitching and moaning", unacceptable as it assumes bad faith on the part of <b>many</b> editors that have attempted constructively to resolve the dispute. Status quo is <b>not</b> an option, not when a disputed tag is on the page for several months. We either find a solution that gains consensus, or this article will remain in disputed land and will end up on AFD again and again. Note that the issue is not that is not NPOV to say that the Guardian referred to People's Temple as a cult. The issue is that to have NPOV, all conflicting views needs to be presented, and that is not the case here. One small mention in a periodical is enough for inclusion, a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> that is unacceptable in such a controversial article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossifresco_e06c.html" title="User talk:Jossifresco">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossifresco_7c01.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossifresco">@</a></small> 22:55, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please don't go around falsely accusing people of crap. I only recently made my first edit to that page (a couple of weeks or so ago, I would guess), and I haven't seen any grand proposals for fixing it; in fact, when I asked a question, I never got a response from anyone. It's undoubtedly easier to make up false accusations against people, but please don't. As to the Jehovah's Witness that keeps messing up the article, he hasn't presented any solutions to fix the article, he's just trying like hell to put his group in the most favorable light possible by making up all-new 'non-unanimous' categories pretty much just for his group, while apparently being unaware that his proposed category is exactly the way the present categories work (and that there are a lot of groups on there that have a lot less sources next to them than his). Are you saying that if I want an article to change, I just have to slap a disputed tag on there, and leave it "for several months" until I get whatever it is I want? Members of these groups are going to dispute the article no matter what we do. I do not foresee all such members coming to a consensus that they are in fact cult members. In such a case, the decisions have to be made without them, whether everyone is happy or not. How do you propose presenting their side of this, posting statements next to each source where each group declares 'we say that we're not a cult?'<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 07:23, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> with POV tag. We cannot have a precedent that equates citing sources with original research. There is an article on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and there can be an article about this.

<dd>In my not so humble opinion, citing sources <i>can be</i> original research. This is not only a serious problem in the cult articles, but in the pseudoscience category as well. There are zillions of primary sources for all sort of positions. Selecting and weighting these, instead of relying on secondary sources (academic studies of the topic, review articles) <i>is</i> original research. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 07:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, that doesn't make something original research, unless we outlaw primary sources as being against the original research policy. Then again, these sources in question aren't raw scientific studies or anything of the sort anyway; the authors presumably obtained facts from wherever, and evaluated them; those facts were presumably obtained from somewhere else also, etc.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommstein_671e.html" title="User:Tommstein">Tommstein</a> 07:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The "purported" is there to make it clear that the "cult" designation is not absolute, and that people have to source entries.

<dd>A proposal was made to name the article List of groups referred to as cults in the media but was not accepted. If it was accepted, this AfD, would have been redundant. Such a name for the article would made it clear that the groups included may or may not be cults, only that they were referred as such in the media. Why do you think it was not accepted? That is the real question.... <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossifresco_e06c.html" title="User talk:Jossifresco">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossifresco_7c01.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossifresco">@</a></small> 16:44, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
