<li><b>Delete,</b> non-notable. Don't see how it can be vanity since the article was obviously written by someone with an animus against Piquepaille. But his blog is simply not that well-known outside of Slashdot. This is not <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Mossberg_1be8.html" title="Walter Mossberg">Walter Mossberg</a> we're talking about. Search for exact phrase "Roland Piquepaille" on Google <b>Groups</b> yields only 56 hits. Google Groups can be a more reliable indicator because website operators don't care about USENET and don't engage in techniques to artificially inflate counts. Generally, for average searches, Groups will yield 1/4 to 1/10 the number of hits on the Web. There are an incredible 123,000 Google hits on the web, the most dramatic ratio between Groups and Web I've ever seen. However, "In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the 326 already displayed." I am not really sure what's going on here but suspect this blog-savvy individual must be wise in the ways of Googlebombing. Anyway... Piquepaille's blog has very little existence outside the Slashdot fantasy universe. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:23, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. Unfortunately I lack the skill or knowledge to produce a proper encyclopedia article. Roland Piquepaille is an influential person on Slashdot. If he wasn't, he would not have his daily articles approved over all of the other submitted articles on that topic. I've put down the basic information that I could verify as true, and not point of view. If more people are allowed to see the article, I'm positive that the information here will grow. Funny thing about the google search too. Is Roland Piquepaille a real person, or just something created to receive all the advertising royalties. Perhaps someone should take his resume and try to verify it. --Anon 16:07, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Influential person on Slashdot" is my point <b>exactly.</b> <i>Nobody has yet suggested, much less produced evidence, that he has any significant influence or notability anywhere else.</i> <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> says "Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of notoriety or achievement. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line)."

<li><b>Comment:</b>. I wouldn't exactly qualify this as a prank or "fiction" in the true sense of the word. While not notable in the Google sense, this "incident" has been featured in various print books describing the supernatural. One should also consider the historical factor (an 1873 incident won't feature as prominently as other things). I'm making a comment instead of a vote because I don't know how much WP documents the "unexplained" (probably the same as "supernatural theories", ie, not much), but I can comment that this incident has been mentioned in various print books in the past. However, if you want an NPOV article, I can't see this being anything larger than a stub, so it probably deserves a merge, at most (and probably a delete, if WP doesn't usually document supernatural theories like this one). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 14:53, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No you didn't. The result, as far as I am concerned, was:</dd>
<dd>You and me were talking different languages. I don't think it makes sense to discuss with you because I don't speak Ungtssese, so I stopped doing it. For example, you seem to think that "exquisite design" can be "good" or "bad", and "A, therefore B" is the same as "B, therefore A". Since you don't try to make yourself clear, your position seems to change every few minutes. Or maybe it <b>does</b> change every few minutes, I'm not in a position to know. It's a pain to discuss somebody like that. Anyway, you couldn't explain how the page is a strawman. You ended up claiming that I knew it is a strawman, which is not true.

<dd><i>this page is really getting places.</i> -- If by getting places you mean mired in quicksand.</dd>
<dd><i>we're starting to get cited opinions on all the relevent issues,</i> not even close. Look at the talkpages if you don't believe me. The current incarnation of the page is that only creationists are allowed to write on the creationist side -- there's no editorial control and it's impossible to make heads or tails of some of the incomplete arguments.</dd>
<dd><i>this page has a great deal of potential to be encyclopedic, if we're willing to explore the ideas on their own merits.</i> -- nonsense. The minority creationist view has a lot of shrill malarky but if it cannot even be presented in a consistent way, how will there be anything like an NPOV comparison?</dd>
<dd><i>i will only say that i have only presented creationist opinions on the creationist side</i> --&gt; I disagree entirely. Ungtss presents his own version of creationist opinions. This isn't anything like an NPOV -- even of creationism. He maintains the strict right to edit out opinions that I know exist in the creationist community but are inconvenient for him to accept. For example, I know that the vast majority of YEC accept a biblical inerrancy, but because Ungtss is one of those peculiar ones who don't, he somehow thinks it inappropriate to include this argument (which is made more often than not by people who are YEC) on that side. However, Flood Geology is trumpeted as if every creationist believes it. That's certainly not the case, there are some creationists that don't think all geological features were created by the flood like Ungtss believes. If this page were to be honest, it would be called "Views of Ungtss and mainstream scientists compared": is that encyclopedic?</dd>
<dd><i>all other mainstream editors are welcome to present the mainstream side as powerfully as they like.</i> -- Does anyone else find it problematic that we are setting up a place in wikipedia where people aren't allowed to edit?</dd>
<dd><i>i only ask that the creationist side not be weighed down by mainstream caricatures and deletions of creationist ideas.</i> -- according to Ungtss' own POV of what that entails.

<dd>It must be very encouraging for the creationist to be able to present his POV without having to worry about someone who actually studies the stuff edit it.

This is because there is so much more to put down from a scientific perspective than there is from a creationist perspective.

<dd>there are indeed people familiar with creationist ideas, but you're certainly not one of them. you've devoted yourself to caricaturing and deleting creationist ideas on the page, and adding loads of irrelevent information to the mainstream column, making it looking equally ridiculous. if the debate is ridiculous, i can't help but wonder why you take such an interest in it ... especially in light of the fact that there are many other evolutionists who think that the page is a great means of allowing the truth of mainstream science to put creationist pseudoscience to shame. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 02:16, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's symptomatic of your idealization that NPOV means treating all opinions as though they are equals. Your opinion, sir, based entirely on non-science, is frankly not worthy of NPOV inclusion.

<dd>As another creationist editor of the page, I would strongly disagree with this. It is Joshuaschroeder who persists in turning the creationist views into a caricature, consistent with his stated aim of making the page look ridiculous.
<dl>
<dd>Phil and Ungtss have demonstrated that they don't even the most basic of science (for example they make claims on radiometric dating that are absolutely absurd). How can we have a constructive article writing if the writers of the article who are supposed "experts" don't know science? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 07:04, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Translation: Phil<b>ip</b> and Ungtss make claims that you don't agree with, so you accuse us of not [knowing?] science and accuse the claims of being absurd.</dd>
<dd>I didn't make claims for radiometric dating. I cited claims made by creationary <i>scientists</i> (including physicists). Joshuaschroeder seems to think that if it doesn't agree with the POV that he sides with, it isn't science and shouldn't be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<dd>&lt;&lt;<i>It lists all the claims and actually cites them instead of the monstrosity we have here.</i>&gt;&gt;</dd>
<dd>I rewrote the section on radiometric dating to list the claims of creationists, citing essentially every one, and Joshuaschroeder deleted virtually all of them because he thought they were ridiculous. He didn't dispute that creationists claim them; he disputed that these creationist arguments have any merit. Any wonder Ungtss would rather he stick to the mainstream science side?
<dl>
<dd>There are creationist who also claim that the earth is the center of the universe (see <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_geocentrism.html" title="Modern geocentrism">Modern geocentrism</a>). Yet their claims aren't included. Why? Because they are nonsense (as they are shown to be in the referenced article). Likewise, putting in lies and non-facts is hardly encyclopedic with regards to presentation. And it is a bald-faced lie that I deleted all of them. But then, creationists do tend to break the commandment to not bear false witness. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 07:04, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The article is not <i>exhaustive</i>, so not mentioning something means little unless the possibility of mentioning it has been suggested and rejected, which I don't believe to be the case here. And geocentricism is only accepted by relatively few creationists, so <i>may</i> not warrant mentioning in an article <i>about creationists' views</i>. Wikipedia is supposed to take a NPOV, and it is disputed that some of the things Joshuaschroeder calls "lies and non-facts" are in fact that.</dd>
<dd>His view of NPOV is clearly that if the majority of scientists consider it to be fact, then those "facts" can be presented as true regardless of the existence of opposing views, and contrary to Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Introduction" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a> ("... we should fairly represent all sides of a dispute, and not make an article state, imply, or insinuate that any one side is correct.").</dd>
<dd>As for his claim that it is a "bald-faced lie that [he] deleted all of them", I actually said that he deleted <i>virtually</i> all of them.</dd>

The main problem seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding between the editors. Some don't understand that creation can't be proved or disproved by science and that the debate is purely about whether <i>available information</i> supports the view that the universe was created by design or not. Others insist that certain assumptions of science are necessarily true, when they are in fact just tools that allow us to make sense of the world and may as well be wrong. This can't be a discussion between scientists and creationists on the existence of a god and the uniformian assumption - these are not falsifiable and are thus not a good subject for scientific debate. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 15:19, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not because this article is inherently going to be POV or flamebait or whatever, but because it is nothing close to an encyclopedia article.

The other problem, that having only two literal columns, and thus only two categories, restricts all opinions to a simple one-or-the-other (the "all scientists"/"all creationists" problem) is another consideration, but ultimately I think that the article is unencyclopedic as is, and has no possibility of being encyclopedic—to make it an encyclopedia article would mean to make it an article on the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a>, which already exists.

It seems there is no hope for this article.. the beliefs of all creationists (or even most) can't be so easily nailed down.. and many of the editors seem incapable of separating their own views on the subject with perhaps the 'mainstream' views.. believing (consciously or unconsciously) their view simply is the mainstream view. Even the title can imply there are only two views.

If X is not a "mainstream" view, the X article should say so, and should summarize the debate between X and the "mainstream" views. Anybody reading about a non-mainstream X shouldn't have to go hunting for the "Comparison of X with the mainstream views" to find out why and what the "mainstream" has to say about X. If the X article does not have this comparison of views, then it is POV propaganda for X, and if it does then the "Comparison" article is redundant. If the X article gets to be too long, it is very doubtful that the best way in general to split it up is to remove the section contrasting X to mainstream views. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:00, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Consider how one distinguishes a Wiki article from a forum argument. I suggest that a forum will accommodate ongoing discussions, with no intention to reach a state of completion, but that it should in principle be possible to complete a Wiki article – that is, to have it include virtually all relevant information in an NPOV form at some particular time. I can’t see how this article could ever reach a state of “completion”, since the debate is ongoing. It is far better to report the present state of the debate in related articles. For the same sorts of reasons, the article will never be “comprehensive”. Furthermore the article assumes that each side of the debate has some agreed account of their position that can be set against the view of the opposing party. This is not the case. Plainly creationists disagree with each other, and scientists disagree with other scientists.

Wikipedia does not "compare" views, as that would be original research. Rather, we report the views of creationists and the views of evolutionists, and let the reader compare. Article's contents seems to be setting up some false dichotomy between "mainstream scientists" and "creationists" (with a disclaimer that not all creationists agree with whoever's opinions are in this article). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 00:14, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is a set of guidelines on NPOV in articles making comparisons between scientific or pseudoscientific positions. I believe that if those guidelines were strictly adhered to (and perhaps a few more sensible ones added) it would be possible to create an article such as this without it becoming NPOV. This topic is dealt with very badly in the web as a whole and it would be great if wikipedia could cover it properly and in an NPOV manner. I think the current version is heavily biased towards the creationist viewpoint but I do not think it is inevitable that this be so. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 09:25, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The problem is that the most balanced treatment on the web to date is the talkorigins archive [www.talkorigins.org]. The creationists, however, think that it isn't balanced at all. <i>If</i> there is to be a debate at all, it has to be in the form of an exhaustive rendering of facts and a willingness (as expressed by the maintainers of the archive) to be constantly vigilant in keeping up to date on the latest creationist fad.</dd>
<dd>If this page is kept, it will either degenerate in a free-for-all posting of whatever flight-of-fancy creationists feel like pursuing with the scientifically-minded scurrying to find the appropriate niche-counter for their nonsense or it will be a complete repeat of the talkorigins archive. Either way, I'm not sure it behooves wikipedia to engage in a rehash of a very tired "debate".</dd>
<dd>My main point, however, is that this isn't really a "debate" at all. There are many alternatives to the scientific mainstream and to post a "debate" as such makes it seem like the only alternative is creationism. More than this, the current slant of the article is definitely YEC in flavor, which is only one type of creationism in general.</dd>

But this page is a breakout of the detail of that debate and has a totally different advantage for the reader--namely, to present data in a table.

But this is not the SciencePedia, this is Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> at least requires that the creationists should get to state accurately the documented history of their nonsense view of the world--which in my view this page does quite well. The page is getting there. 8)) As Mr. Zen complains, this page does not yet have the citations to scholarly publications. We will do that--and we will eliminate the original research that does not have citations to scholarly publications. But let's get the comparison of views first. Mr. Rossami suggests this page presents a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>, but it does not. This page merely tabulates the contrasting views in the debate. Nowhere on the page does it imply that you have to pick one or the other--quite the opposite. The parent page at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html#A_continuum_of_approaches_to_creation_and_evolution" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a> makes clear that there is a whole continuum of views in the debate from "Young earth creationism" to "Materialist evolutionism" (Scott 1997).</p>

<p>Along that continuum, there is less and less disagreement between the creationist view and the mainstream view as you move from the extreme of "Young earth creationism" toward the other extreme of "Materialist evolutionism." Accordingly, the Views of creationists and mainstream scientists compared page merely tabulates the observed differences where the empirical data indicates differences. I definitely agree with Mr. Dawson that we should consider seriously the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_%28Comparison_of_views_in_science%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_%28Comparison_of_views_in_science%29" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> Wikipedia guidelines for tabulating comparisons of science with nonsense. The issue here is how to treat nonsense in a legitimate <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> manner. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 16:32, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> is evaluating a hypothetical article and not the one that currently exists. How are we going to decide what constitutes a reference that we can use as part of the argument? Creationists have views that range from the most absurdist miracle-based ideologies to technical disparaging based on physical misconceptions. To reasonably do the "NPOV" suggested here would mean the article would stretch out ad infinitum. How would anybody decide what was reasonable to include and what wasn't?</dd>
<dd>Much of what the argument against creationism is is that there is a VAST body of scientific evidence against them. I could begin posting public domain sources of the hundreds of thousands of rocks that have been consistently dated to counter the claims that the creationists make against isochron dating. However, this obviously isn't in Wikipedia's best interest.
<dl>
<dd>i'm not editing the page because it looks like it's about to be deleted. the fact that you think the left column is nonsense does not make lining that nonsense up with scientific truth pov -- if anything, it should make the left column look like nonsense in the light of the truth. i think this page could serve the purpose of getting the "issues" of the debate off the debate page and into a side-by-side comparison, so the debate page can consider more of the "big picture" issues, and it's only as long as we make it. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 19:09, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In short, those who are crying NPOV for keeping the article haven't really thought the issue out. Nor have I seen contributions from them that would seem to indicate that they were moving in the NPOV direction. It would be a sad thing if this article were kept as it is. We should expand <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a> and make a reference outside of wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 18:32, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Tribal in nature, distinct related group (linguistically and geographically) from an isolated area in the Alps that did not see the first roads until after WWI. Not genealogy, as it is a small known group, nor vanity, but a note on what may be one of the few remaining tribal (Ladin) subgroups. As to whether it is encyclopedic, it goes to showing background of a more general nature. <i>comment added by anon user:66.28.243.27.

<li>I'm going to swim against the tide here and vote <b>Keep</b>. They have quite a few artists and releases (see <a href="http://www.comfortstand.com/catalog.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comfortstand.com/catalog.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comfortstand.com/catalog.html</a> ) and I think music labels are inherently notable unless they're brand-new and have almost no releases. This one is clearly well past that point. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:29, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I myself had an opportunity to create this page. Of course, if it ends up being deleted that is okay. My life does not revolve around whether Wikipedia elects to have this particular entry amongst several thousand, heh. Of course, they also have entries for "Pepsi Holiday Spice" and "Suicide Girls", so you never know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the confines of the description in it, perhaps I should specify&#160;: Comfort Stand has 20 or so singles (each with 2 songs&#160;: a main one and b-side), but also 51 (and counting) <i>albums</i>. Each album has a good number of songs on it. Sure, mp3.com, et al. may offer several tracks, but they usually don't give the entire cd, with artwork, away for free. If Wikipedia is truly pressed for space, in the sense that they are running low, it is of course all good. However I shall cast a vote myself for <b>Keep</b>. Thank you very much!</p>

<li>While I do believe that all these breakout Middle-Earth articles are getting out of hand, this isn't the place to address it. I think a lot of merging could be done, particularly for the minor articles (of which there are plenty). Of course, any proposal to do this will be fought tooth and nail by the Tolkien fans. A modest proposal I made for combining the all the Kings of Numenor into a single article (with the 3 or 4 important ones still keeping articles of their own) was dismissed as crazy and threatened with immediate reversion if it were even attempted. And yet with many other important works of fiction people have no problem with characters redirecting back to the original book. At some point Wikipedia as a whole has to get some sort of sense of proportion, and some consistency. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:07, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a road. In a book of fiction. Not majorly central to the plot (in the way that, say the Mines of Moria were), and with no break out effect whatsoever on the world. And people think that someone should be chastised for daring to question why this is would be in an encyclopedia? IT'S FICTION, PEOPLE! Put it this way - would anyone voting 'keep' for this consider voting 'delete' if I wrote an article about the recent Chelsea vs Manchester United football match? Be honest, plenty of you would thing that was unnecessary sporting trivia. Well, some people think the same about what you may appear to find tremendously interesting. If you want to know about this road, read the book. It doesn't exist separately. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 21:48, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>cruft</b> /kruhft/ [very common; back-formation from crufty] 1. n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed is cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a broom only produces more. 2. n. The results of shoddy construction. 3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft'] To write assembler code for something normally (and better) done by a compiler (see hand-hacking). 4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code. 5. [University of Wisconsin] n.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I have stubbified the article (something from the original version can perhaps still be worked back in) and modify my vote here. Mankuzhikary held an important position in an ancient church, which in terms of membership may seem small in a country like India, but is the size of some national churches in Europe (see data below). It is important to avoid cultural bias in a case like this, taking into account that language and transcription problems probably makes the information easily available and searchable in English less than complete. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 00:13, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. A Bishop is a fairly senior post but if you check the article, he was a Bishop in the Syrian Catholic Church which is a semi-autonomous church, and not the full Roman Catholic Church. According to <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/syr_cath.htm" class="external text" title="http://i-cias.com/e.o/syr_cath.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a> there are only 30,000 Syrian Catholic Church adherents outside of their middle-east base. If we could get some confirmation of the number of people in his diocese then that might help make it clearer whether he was a substantial religious leader or not. If he only ever had a flock of a few hundred even while called a Bishop, then that would not be notability. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 14:43, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, Iasson, so by your interpretation of the rules which don't exist, one would need 30 or 31 votes for any valid result. Well, about the only article on VfD that's going to reach that quorum is your List of Active Vfd Voters. Without that list we need 10% of nothing, which I think is nothing. So we're back where we started. Listen, VfD is already overburdened with things that should be speedied but are left here for 5 days because people are afraid to go ahead and get rid of them quickly. Having 30 votes on every piece of crap that's listed here is a completely moronic idea, and completely arbitrary. If you want your stupid idea to be policy, there's a procedure you can go through, but I advise you not to waste your time because it stands little chance of passing. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:33, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:What you dont understand is that I may propose 10% minimum participation <b>for this poll</b> (as long as my proposed minimum participation policy may differs for another Vfd poll) but you and another one can propose 1% minimum participation. For this hypothetical case if we use 2/3 majority (strong majority) the minimum participation for this poll will be defined to 1%, or if we use the average method the minimum participation will be defined to 4%(=(1+1+10)/3). <b>Is it clear now? I am not imposing my 10% minimum participation POV, like you and the rest admins are doing for your 1% minimum participation POV or for your 0%(equals to no_percentage) minumum participation POV</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. The point is that there is a policy currently in force that applies to <i><b>all</b></i> articles proposed for deletion - i.e. that a minimum of one vote is cast and the result of the poll is valid as long as the article remains substantially similar to the form in which it was voted on. Whether you agree with this or not, you (nor anyone else for that matter) cannot suggest, impose, recommend, demand, and/or implement etc, a different policy for an individual vote. IM(H)O your proposal would be akin to a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general election</a> in which the vote in one <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituency.html" title="Constituency">constituency</a> required a minimum of 10% participation of those voters who have voted in a local election in the past year for validity and the winner being elected for 5 years, while the adjacent consituency required a minimum participation of 40% of the eligable voting population and the winner being elected for 4 years; with each stipulation being <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unilateral.html" title="Unilateral">unilaterally</a> declared by the first person to cast their vote. Such a system is (IMO) unworkable. If you want to propose that the existing policy is changed, then do so in the apropriate place (see links in my earlier comment) not here. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:50, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. Thank you for your answers. So the vfd policy regarding the minimum participation percentage applies to all vfd polls and it is 0%+1 vote. Where is this decided? Where is this written? Can you point to a poll that has been used in order to take such decision? I have also questions about the decision method that is used in order to extract the decision from <b>all vfd polls</b>. I asked some admins about that, and I received different answers. One said it is unamimity minus one, another said simple majority, another said consensus(?), and another said the only thing that matters is administrator's judgement when he/she performs the deletion. Is there any common decided decision method that applies to all vfd polls? Where is this written? Where is this voted? <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 15:01, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. As I understand it (I've not been here a month yet myself) the votes for deletion has always opperated in this manner. Prior to your attempt to set up a list of active voters, there was no such list of people who had voted in polls. As such a percentage of voters was neither known nor knowable (x as a percentage of y is unsolvable when the value of y is not known), meaning that a validity based on a percentage of (active) voters impossible. The only other option for validity then is an absolute number of votes. The figure chosen is 1 vote (not 0%+1 vote, just 1 vote).</li>

<dd>Whether or not an article is actually deleted or not is the decision of the administrator. This decision is based on the votes and comments on the votes for deletion page. Where a consensus (which I personally define as "all or the vast majority of voters agree") has been reached then the administrator will go with that consensus to delete or keep (or merge, etc) - e.g. consensus (by my definition) has been reached in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Boris_Johnson_839a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boris Johnson">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boris Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Active_Vfd_Voters_dcb1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Active Vfd Voters">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Active Vfd Voters</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Ariel_Ortega_5447.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ariel Ortega">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ariel Ortega</a>. "Unanimity minus 1" is an alternative definition of consensus.</dd>
<dd>If consensus hasn't been reached, and no clear majority exists then personal judgment by the administrator will probably be used. This can also happen in other situations, e.g. if the article was improved part way through voting, the administrator might chose to disregard votes cast before the improvement; I exepct that the decision to keep or delete in the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Olb_5441.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Olb">Olb</a> case will come down to personal judgment. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:13, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. On closer reading, I suspect that link doesn't reveal quite the level of notability one would hope for. The quote from the linked article is, "Throughout his career, he has <b>shared [a] stage</b> along with [such] world-acclaimed artists as...". Presumably those highly notable artists appeared as soloists while Murillo was a member of the symphony orchestra behind them. Even if <a href="../../../i/t/z/Itzhak_Perlman_f3ec.html" title="Itzhak Perlman">Itzhak Perlman</a> is at the front of the stage, I don't think it makes every member of the orchestra (thirty, fifty, a hundred musicians?) notable. I would suggest that for a symphony orchestra (one noteworthy in and of itself), only the conductor and maybe the concertmaster are usually above the notability threshold for inclusion. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 19:08, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There is already an article on the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socially_constructed_reality.html" title="Socially constructed reality">socially constructed reality</a>, a topic in the sociology of knowledge. There is an important book on that title by Peter Berger. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus_reality.html" title="Consensus reality">Consensus reality</a> article introduces a new term for the same concept and doesn't seem to add anything beyond poorly-written personal musings on the subject. Most of the article actually discusses the idea of <i>reality enforcement</i> (which is redirected here) again without indicating whether this is a term used by sociologists or psychologists or providing background. The article could just be deleted, but someone enterprising might find a few sentences worth merging into <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socially_constructed_reality.html" title="Socially constructed reality">socially constructed reality</a>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:00, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The proposal to delete is based on the bizarre assumption that "consensus reality" would have to be "a term in use by social psychologists".

<li>What is bizarre about it? If you don't think this supposed topic lies within the discipline of social psychology, then make it sociology, cognitive science, or you name it.

If it isn't a term of art in some discipline of social science, and it is not a popular catch-phrase or meme, then what is it doing with an article in the Wikipedia and where did the author get his information about it other than out of his own head? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:53, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Another weak <b>Keep</b> and cleanup. There seems to be a difference in connotation and perhaps denotation in the terms. The Social Construction of Reality has a whole lot of heavy academic baggage to go along with it (and is a mouthful to say). Consensus Reality seems to be a newer vintage (and is hip without all the heavy baggage and extra syllables). As BM has observed, it seems "consensus reality" is often used by those holding minority (or whacko) opinions to disparage what they see as the self-imposed blinders mainstream society enforces to avoid consideration of what the minority (or whacko) finds obvious. Seems to be yet another variation on Plato's Allegory of the Cave. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 03:37, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>I vote to Keep this article</b>. I vote as decision method in order to decide whether to keep or delete, to be used the <b>strong majority</b>(2/3) decision method.

I vote for this Vfd poll to be legitimate only if after <b>7 days</b> voters' participation will <b>exceed 4%</b> of the List of Active Vfd Voters. Finnaly I vote to let me speak and vote freely and stop bothering me with your POV "correct" deletion policy. And I am encouraging you to also vote for your favorite decision method, for how long the keep_or_delete decision should be valid (you may vote inbetween one second and eternity), and for the minimum participation percentage that turns this vfd poll legitimate (you may vote inbetween no_percentage_applies(0%) and 100%). <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 12:40, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to disagree with 23skidoo's suggestion that this be included in Jimmy Fallon's article. Only recurring characters belong there; we certainly aren't going to mention every joke he ever told on his years at Weekend Update.

<ul>
<li>Fair enough. I'm not that familiar with Fallon's work, however assuming "Jesus Horse" is a Weekend Update joke, I thought it might be a running gag or a piece of lingo coined by the show that might have been picked up by others, thereby warranting a mention in his article. (i.e. Fallon coined the phrase "Jesus horse"...etc.). If he only mentioned it once, than I concur. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 07:03, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Additional note: I don't have a date for when Mrs. Ruth G. Finn graduated from ASU, but her daughter, Elizabeth R.

<dd>More information: Ruth Finn graduated in 1970, a member of the inaugural class of the college (it opened for operation in 1967). According to my contact at ASU, there were two other women in the inaugural class who did not graduate. Ms. Finn was an older woman at the time she attended the school; her husband was already a well-known attorney in Arizona. There is no reasonable way that the facts as provided to me by ASU can be reconciled with the recitation in this article. I am now tempted to write articles about Ruth Finn and her husband, Herb, both of whom appear to be notable persons in the history of the struggle for civil rights in Arizona during the 1950s and later. --<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 23:04, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article appears to be an original essay, written from the point of view of a disciple of Col. Boyd rather than an observer of his teachings. The central problem is that it's not really about 'Col. Boyd on Warfare' at all, it's a lot of original padding, unattributed, and I get the impression that the author is using Boyd's name to push his own theories.</p>
<p>The two subjects of the article - Boyd, and his teachings - appear to be covered quite well in the articles <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Boyd_%28military_strategist%29_2b67.html" title="John Boyd (military strategist)">John Boyd (military strategist)</a>, <a href="../../../o/o/d/OODA_Loop_046d.html" title="OODA Loop">OODA Loop</a>, and most particularly <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Strategy_%28John_Boyd%29_f60d.html" title="Military Strategy (John Boyd)">Military Strategy (John Boyd)</a>, which is shorter and makes more sense. It is worth noting that 'Col. Boyd on Warfare' is an original title, and the article should really be called 'An anonymous person's bald assertions of what may or may not be Col. Boyd's thoughts on decision-making'. For all the length, nothing of it can really be added to the three links aforementioned.</p>
<p>It was listed for VFD back in June 2004 and seems to have saved from destruction by apathy rather than love. The various discussions in the Talk page's VFD archive came to nothing. Author 68.1.92.42's only other edits are to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Boyd_%28military_strategist%29_2b67.html" title="John Boyd (military strategist)">John Boyd (military strategist)</a>, although his work has mostly been replaced by subsequent contributions. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 19:40, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Opening this can of worms with a <b>Move</b> request to preferably the book, and a very thorough cleanup of the article including POV and readability. By the looks of it, it can be condensed somewhat into a more compact version. The person the article is about is notable indeed, but if the focus is on the article itself, it should be at the very least cleaned up if it's to be kept. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 20:46, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The existence of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Strategy_%28John_Boyd%29_f60d.html" title="Military Strategy (John Boyd)">Military Strategy (John Boyd)</a> makes this article redundant and overkill. The previous VfD discussion mentioned cleanup numerous times and nothing was done. I consider it unlikely anything would be done this time, if kept. Also, the other article states that Boyd never wrote a book on military strategy, merely what would today have been a power point presentation, so it can't be moved to the book. If there's anything true, useful, and not included there already, then merge those elements are <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Strategy_%28John_Boyd%29_f60d.html" title="Military Strategy (John Boyd)">Military Strategy (John Boyd)</a>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:19, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>hello in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentine_Currency_Board_34fa.html" title="Argentine Currency Board">Argentine Currency Board</a> entry in wikipedia it is said that "In 1989, former President Raúl Alfonsín resigned, and in July of that year Carlos Menem was elected President. His early attempts to stabilize inflation failed, resulting in further devaluation of the peso and a serious reduction in the central bank's reserves." there has occured a problem when i corrected this statement repleacing <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devaluation.html" title="Devaluation">devaluation</a> with <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation.html" title="Depreciation">depreciation</a> i was called a vandal&#160;:( IMHO devaluation is when the exchange rate is changed (lowered) by central Bank when the exchange rate is set by this institution, while depreciation is a term used when exchange rate changes (lowers) in floating exchange rate if someone wants to clear this out pls post your answer here</p>

<dd>I used a standard template that warned you that you might be considered a vandal.

<p>and i ve asked there... and about that edit... well when i changed word to depreciation i finnished reading this article (which is very interesting and well written indeed) and restored it finding that devaluation word is still being used supposing that i didnt edit it well i agian repleaced word devaluation with word depreciation having not knowing someone reedited my first edit cinsidering me a vandal... if inflation in argentine was high it must mean there was floating exchange rate and as money being a commodity as other commodities like iron, gold, apples when its price lowered it means it has depreciatied not devaluated (devaluation is when someone from monetary unit like central bank orders to change exchange rate which is set by this authority)</p>

<dd>In the text you give, Devaluation and Depreciation are used as synonims (they are both used for the same thing). In this case, depreciation is a more general term,therefore I think devaluation should be used in this context. Don't forget to check the article's history to see who changed what.

<p>this is nuts! as u can see from the quotation it says <b>devaluation</b> when "...governement may <b>devalue</b>..." and <b>depreciation</b> "...During both episodes, rapid <b>depreciation</b> of the currency..." when there was a floating exchange rate and such exchange rate was in 1989 so peso <b>depreciated</b> according to market, not was <b>devaluated</b> by central bank, governement or other monetary authority <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 217.98.20.20 (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.98.20.20.html" title="User talk:217.98.20.20">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.98.20.20_0f7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.98.20.20">contribs</a>) 15:24, 22 May 2006.</small></p>

<dd>Could you consider the possibility that neither you nor the authors of the articles are entirely correct? In Argentina we've always used <i>devaluación</i> ("devaluation") in both senses. In English "depreciation" is an accounting term, and its article is <i>clearly</i> written with that sense in mind and has nothing to do with currency depreciation. In these cases the usual practice in WP is to have <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> pages. <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation.html" title="Depreciation">Depreciation</a> should be renamed to Depreciation (accounting) and somebody should write <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depreciation_%28currency%29.html" title="Depreciation (currency)">Depreciation (currency)</a>, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to do that. Please give me some time, and I'll try to get a draft. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article just given a one sided view and actually does't reflect the liberty given to minorities in Pakistan. Remeber we have seen several issues even in westren world becuase of Christ even, so its always good , if you respect the prophets and leadors of other religions. This is the basic requirement to live in one world together. Therefore , this is rule that brings harmony and peace rather then distraction. Therefore, i think so the article is just baised and such baised articles should not be included in the Wikipedia. <b>Wikipedia is a place where we look for definite reference rather then disputed one's.</b></li>

<li>The thing is that those two titles you had suggested are just beating around the bush. If there's a problem in Malaysia, just point it out bluntly and stick straight to the facts. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 07:30, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's not NPOV. You <b>claim</b> there is problem in Malaysia (others disagree) and some claim there are problems in say <b>Israel</b> (and others disagree). The policy of wikipedia is NPOV.

<ul>
<li>Literally it's true discrimination exists in Malaysia, but discriminations exists in the U.S. too. Discrimination is just too loaded a word, but then again, the <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumiputra.html" title="Bumiputra">bumiputra</a> system itself is obvious racism. I'm sure there are many who disagree, so I don't think the idea's a good one. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:05, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> as per above. Under the right title, this is a perfectly valid encyclopedic topic. Alleged discrimination against non-Muslims in Malaysia perhaps? Whatever we do, keep it. Just don't keep it at the current title since it does appear POV. The article itself is POV, but that's a different matter (and surprisingly, the material I find most POV is not from the original State Department report). I find it's ironic that the Malaysians are the ones voting to keep this, don't you think? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 07:36, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alleged discrimination is long and still POV. The two titles I suggested "Human rights in Malaysia" or "Status of religious freedom" in Malaysia are perfectly NPOV <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 07:39, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not. It's a fact that the discrimination is alleged. Not an opinion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:05, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't like that title. That opens the door for articles with the titles like Alleged Israeli violence against Palestinian children, Alleged discrimination against non-Jews in Israel, etc. This won't end the controversy. What's wrong with "Status of religious freedom in Malaysia"? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 08:12, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see the point of associating this article to other (future?) Israel-related articles. Btw, this article shouldn't be here on VfD in the first place if you had read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> carefully. Articles which are POV needs cleanup and not deletion. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 08:22, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We are not talking about article that needs "cleanup." We are talking about POV title that cannot be "cleaned up". That title has to be deleted completely once the article is moved <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 08:45, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then why is this article up on VfD in the first place? Any complaints regarding the title of the article should be discussed at the relevant talk pages and move on from there. A request placed in VfD is a request to delete the article entirely. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 09:06, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what's wrong with those titles? If they're excessively long, redirect them. I see nothing inherently POV about them; they're valid encyclopedic topics. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:23, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but in this case there are better titles available, like Human rights in Malaysia. There is currently no article with that title. This information should be part of that article <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 08:47, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And if you manage to get it your way, there would certainly be too much information about discrimination to fit in an article about human rights or religious freedom, and it'll inevitably gets splitted. Back to square one. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 08:57, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>If</b> (and that's an assumption since currently there is not even that article) the Human rights article needs to be splitted, it will have to be splitted to NPOV titled article, not this one. That's not square one&#160;:)) <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:15, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes it's an assumption. But I'd have to say that avoiding the word "discrimination" (if splitted) is not really an option here, as the discrimination part are facts and not just mere opinions. Like what I've said in the talk page, the only thing POV with the title is the "against non-Muslims" part. =) --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 09:21, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And as I replied, not everyone agree that discrimination occurs. That's your opinion, not a fact <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 09:25, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's a fact discrimination does occur, but it's too loaded a word to appear NPOV. Counter-intuitively, it is NPOV, yet appears POV. That's why I think it should either be balanced out by "alleged" (or some synonym of it) or removed entirely. Btw, I've never heard anyone, even the most ardent defender of Malay rights disagree that discrimination exists; they just argue that it's fair and justified. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 09:48, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As an example: Not everyone agrees that 9/11 was caused by Al-Qaeda hijackers, does that make the current 9/11 article POV? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndylkl_090d.html" title="User:Andylkl">Andylkl</a> 10:00, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what is the title of 9/11 article? <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. The title doesn't even use the word "terrorist attack" (just calls it attack -- let alone Al Queda). That's NPOV title <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneGuy_27ad.html" title="User:OneGuy">OneGuy</a> 10:40, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
