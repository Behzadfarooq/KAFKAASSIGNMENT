<li>Claiming that this article is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_fork_623c.html" title="POV fork">point-of-view fork</a>, is false; Wikipedia says this is "creating a new article about a certain subject that is already treated". The article on <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> does not include the majority of material in this article. The main redshift article is about Cosmological, Doppler and Gravitation redshifts; this article is about theories which have been published in peer reviewed journals that propose <b>non-</b>Cosmological, <b>non-</b>Doppler and <b>non-</b>Gravitation redshifts.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The subject is already treated on the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> page. It was agreed in discussion there that a list such as this was not only unnecessary, it represented an inappropriate POV endorsement. As it is, your decision to write this article is the very definition of a POV-fork. You opted out of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> discussion and created a new article to deflect criticism. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 14:22, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- I agree with ScienceApologist that it's apparently a POV fork. However, the <i>cause</i> of a POV fork is often insufficient accounting for that POV in the main article, and a quick look shows that the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a> article is lacking on a number of points, especially as the article he/she apparently refers to is titled "redshift" and not "cosmological redshift". I repeat here my earlier comments on the Talk page: this article certainly fills a gap (I learned something today thanks to it!) but to make it general and NPOV, it should be called "List of redshift mechanisms", and be linked from the redshift article, containing all notable past and current cosmological as well as non-cosmological redshift hypotheses. Such a page will be very useful as general reference, and free from any POV. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 18:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I, Ari Brynolfsson, find that Ian Tresman's article on ‘’’Intrinsic Redshift’’’ is good and very neutral. It does not advocate anything and reports the facts. The use by Ian Tresman of “Intrinsic Redshift” appears to me to be dictated by the fact that most of the processes he mentioned are more likely to work where the densities are high, that is, very close to stars, galaxies and quasars. Such redshifts are properly called intrinsic redshifts. Expanding the subject to “Alternative Redshift Theories” is reasonable, especially, when many people are mislead to believe that only expansion theory of the Universe with its many absurdities can explain the cosmological redshift. (My previous more extensive comments was deleted by somebody that apparently got the point. This is an abreviated version). Ari Brynolfsson, 15:20, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is getting out-of-control. It seems apparent to me that discussions of this sort are only going to lead to a stalemate since people are going to be intimidated by the shear amount of text generated by this AfD. I will withdrawl the AfD if only to rewrite the article as an article about intrinsic redshifts. Would that suffice? --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 17:00, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A separate article can discuss the issues in more detail.
