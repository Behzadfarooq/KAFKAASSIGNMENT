The "winter holiday" season is a neologism and alternative for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a>, and is only ever referenced in the USA and maybe Canada. Also, people do not celebrate "Winter holiday season" as the creator says—they celebrate any given holiday, such as Christmas or Hanukkah. User:Calgary's assertions that "Winter holiday season" itself is celebrated by many is OR at best, and IMO ridiculous. The subsequent sections offer no citations and overall the article is abundant with OR. Additionally, there are many grammatical errors and the author writes that "it begins in Thanksgiving in <i>many</i> countries"...

Pathak lacks multiple non-trivial articles by third parties, shows no charted hits, no national tours. I verify 75 distinct Ghits out of 203 general hits, which speaks to his notability at this level. Also note most of Pathak's Ghits are related to Nurse with Wound, not his own stuff, which further suggests lack of notability. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 09:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Neutral</b> - as someone who has been involved in the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_with_Wound_25dd.html" title="Nurse with Wound">Nurse with Wound</a> article and several related entries, this bio comes as something of a surprise.

<dd>I've lived next to and met a few authors and learned that, in general, getting one book published in not too hard.

<dd>Meanwhile, I know a number of writers who can't even get a publisher to give their work the time of day. Anecdotes aren't all that useful here. There are some people who would include any book with an ISBN, which would include any of those authors, too.

However, unless someone can show evidence to the contrary, this actress appears to be too obscure to come even close to any reasonable notability requirements. Also, the article does not contain much real information that could not be reflected in a resurrected and expanded List of Japanese female porn stars.

<dd>OK, I agree with you here, on this particular actress Hong. You seem to have found an actress who, to my knowledge and ability to track sources, in no way appears to meet notability standards. Obviously she <i>is</i> verifiable, though, and deserves a place on a list. I still say Japanese (or international) and American standards have to different though. The Amazon test for instance, would fail the vast majority of even <i>notable</i> American stars, and shows that even <i>non-notable</i> Japanese porn actresses (such as this one) have a mainstream presence in that country. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I'm actually already giving many of these Japanese porn actresses slack on the notability and verifiability when I mention a Japanese equivalent of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. If we are to strictly use <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, many of them would have an even more difficult time passing. That's why it may not necessarily be to your best advantage to invalidate <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> based on either that it's only a proposal or that it is culturally biased. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be trying to say that there are only two possible ways to establish a <i>Japanese</i> adult actress' notability: By ignoring the vast differences between the two countries and the two industries and applying a test of notability designed for <i>American</i> adult actresses on <i>Japanese</i> actresses, or, if <i>that</i> isn't biased enough for you, by subjecting them to a test designed for general world biography. If <i>American</i> adult actors have been deemed worthy of a special set of notability standards, separate from world biography in general, then adult actors from other countries deserve that same specialized treatment. And how, exactly, are you cutting them slack on verifiability when even the least notable of them have a presence on Amazon? Are you actually saying a listing of a DVD on Amazon is not verifiable? Or are you just preparing your argument for deleting another list on grounds of "unverifiabilty?" The list is already being held to a higher standard of verifiability than many other lists I've checked on Wikipedia, and now any source is going to be disqualified, as what? "Commercial," "personal page," or just "icky because it talks about Japanese porn stars?" <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 21:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I do keep repeating - these porn actresses that I've nominated have no notable mainstream work, no notable magazine appearance, no notable awards, etc etc. So aside from those, what would determine notability? We've got no criteria here to say, "oh, she's been in 22 DVDs so she's notable." How? Why? Why do 22 Japanese porn DVDs, no awards, no mainstream work, etc etc, make a Japanese porn actress notable, while American porn actresses need a lot more than that to achieve notability? Even <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> is still a proposal, so unfortunately, until the English WP decide to come up with a WP:JAPANESE PORN BIO, we've got no grounds to judge Japanese porn actresses on a different set of criteria. I mean, some of the editors reject <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> just based on the fact that it's a proposal. There's no other notability test then, except for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It's already pretty generous that Japanese porn actresses are to be considered under an imaginary Japanese equivalent of a proposed notability test. I repeat - without that, the only notability test left for them is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There's no other test. The only thing left is individual editors using arbitrary criteria and personal opinions to judge their notability. That's hardly good enough. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Comment - if the creators of the article are constantly reverting good edits and adding ad spam, the article should be relisted for deletion with that point made clear in the AfD.

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> The article (at least currently) describes the language as constructed, so all comments about whether or not this language is "fake" are pretty much irrelevant. I have disregarded count completely: first of all, there were too many votes, but also it was clear that some kind of promotion of this debate took place somewhere. The policies this article would have to pass are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, just like every other article. All <i>three</i> are an issue here. Let me handle them one at a time. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> -- the issue here is how to present the substance of the Siberian language work. It's mentioned in the article that "some consider their approach unscientific," but regardless, the viewpoints go way beyond the sources, so <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> dictates that the article should at best be dramatically shortened. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (notability) is somewhat of a problem, because without any published <i>linguistic</i> analysis of this, there's not much we can say. The <i>project</i> may be notable, as it's been covered in some media sources, though, but it's borderline, and the article is really about the language anyway. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox applies also, but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the biggest issue: while WP policy leaves open the idea that we can use foreign language-only sources in an article, it's a <i>bad idea</i> in a case like this one where the claims go well beyond basic description: really, until there are source in English, the en.wiki community cannot maintain a policy-compliant article on this topic. While I considered a weasely "no consensus" close here, it's <i>clearly</i> in the interests of the community to have a decision here, and move on. And consensus is important for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> but not so much for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> anyway. Okay. I hope that explains my reasoning: I read every comment, and looked as best as I could at every issue. I do hope that if there's a deletion review, or any further debate on this topic that those of you who came here to simply add as many votes as possible will <i>not</i> participate: you know who you are, and you're just making all this more difficult. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

This bears every appearance of being an astroturfing campaign; Yaroslav Zolotaryov is a leader in the web community which promotes this.

<dd>Frankly, I can't see why the references must necessarily be <i>in English</i>. Is there any policy regarding that? If so, I'd be very unpleasantly surprised, as it would show utter disregard for the non-Anglosaxon rest of the world!

<dd>Here you go - i know Russian, but i live in Israel, so i think i'm rather neutral, does that count? You'll just have to believe me that i'm rather indifferent to the politics of Moscow vs. Siberia vs. Belarus vs. Ukraine. I also know a few things about <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">Linguistics</a> (that's my major) and in particular about Slavic linguistics and dialectology. And based on all of the above i can say that this project is valid:
<dl>
<dd>It's true that it may be done by a small group - but the creation of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> (spoken by over a millions now) and the creation of modern spoken <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> (spoken by over 6 million now) were also works of very small groups.</dd>
<dd>It's true that this group has a certain "national" agenda, but it is very haphazard and i didn't see anything extremist or outright anti-Russian in it.</dd>
<dd>It's true that to speakers of Russian this language looks like Cockney or Redneck English put to writing, but they completely ignore the fact that it has a dictionary of over 20,000 words and a complete grammar.</dd>
<dd>They also ignore the fact that this grammar is rather different from Russian. The verb tense system is radically different, it has the definite article which is completely absent in Russian, and it has different phonology. All these things are very well documented as actual features of Northern Russian dialects. Now a group comes and makes a literary language out of these dialects. Let me tell you a secret - many major literary world languages started out as compromises between several dialects that were codified by scientists and promoted in schools by governments. After a few generations they became natural languages. Such are German, Indonesian and Urdu, for example.</dd>

Besides, it's true that the original version was nothing but an ugly stub.

Nobody would deny its notability, and many living languages started their carreers the same way. A frequently used method of distinguishing natural languages from constructed languages is this: as soon as a language has second-generation native speakers, it cannot be classified any longer as a constructed language. However, no one would argue that this would be a condition for inclusion here. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>Uszkiełtu?</i></sub></font></a> 19:24, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Interesting analogy. What does Wikipedia say about Romansh? "Romansh is not a single language but a group of closely-related dialects, all belonging to the family of the Rhaeto-Romance languages." And: "Romansh was standardised in 1982 by Zürich-based linguist Heinrich Schmid. The standardised language, called Rumantsch Grischun, has not been very well accepted, and speakers of the different dialects tend to address one another in German." Of course, Wikipedia has an article on Romansh - as it is considered an offical "language" of Switzerland and literature in the Engadine dialect exists since the 16th century.

<dd>"Sinds het voor het eerst werd gepubliceerd, heeft het Siberisch enige bekendheid verworven. De meningen over de taal zijn verdeeld: Oekraïense en Wit-Russische nationalisten verwelkomen het project. Hetzelfde geldt ook voor vertegenwoordigers van nationale minderheden binnen Rusland. Russische nationalisten aan de andere kant zijn fel tegen het project gekant. Beide kanten zien het Siberisch als een typische uiting van regionalisme, of zelfs van separatisme. Hierdoor heeft het project een uitgesproken politiek karakter gekregen en is het moeilijk tot een objectieve beoordeling van de taal zelf te komen" He writes that political discussions about the project make the founding of objective view hard, but the other part of his articles describes language features in neutral way. --Yaroslav Zolotaryov 10:37, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b>: I wonder how this subject is again on discussion, probably people who allow it didn’t even devote a day to researching this language. Its an invented language by a couple of russophobs (or even only one). The "siberian language" is a fantasy which is only based on different dialects all over Siberia (just look at area of it and imagine how many EU countries fit in it).i underline the word DIFFERENT as sometimes met in one village is not met in another (due to very local dialect) Sometimes its not even a dialects it’s a word or phrases used in a single village for a generation or two and noticed nowhere exept that place (its like a “local slang” if we say it modern in words. But Zolotorev makes it a point even if it was used only on 0,1% of Siberian territory and only by around hundred of people living in a village (I probably will insult Zolotarev saying that every yard has its own slang but whatever). Also many of this language is based on phrases of uneducated population and what is presented by Zolotarev as a grammar or phrase building structure due to cutting endings or putting them in to the wrong plague. The bases of all this Zolotorev’s insanity is an old russian (which is no longer used and which was used ALL OVER RUSSIA and not only in Siveria), and when this platform is not enough - mr. Zolotarev takes an Ukrainian language and invents smth from this. As a greatest development of fantasy mr Zolotorev even was thinking of giving Siberean an arabian writing, but I think now he had to give it up coz its “too much”. Also some sources given here by zolotorev are not standing on his point of view or even sometimes made with his cooperation (web sources). I ask mr.Zolotarev not to comment my message (he wont get an answer anyway) because i'm sick enough of his lifejournal messages asking to vote for keeping his language fantasy in wikipedia and I will not devote my time for discussing his fantasies. 213.171.61.131 14:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)Jaroslav S.</li>

For the record, I think all the campaigning around this AfD is a Bad Thing: trying to whip up support in the Russian wiki (where the article was voted down) and among people who voted for deletion previous, is surely not a very elegant thing to do!

My friend Xcobo, he is Lojban lover, said in his LJ about all this "discussion" - "if this is simple non-notable conlang, even simple conlang like Lojban and Esperanto, so why had they come with so big accusations in big amount? They simply feel the strange power of this Language and they fear it". Such were words of non-wikipedic and non-Siberian person about all this meeting, which was prepared by ruwiki in best traditions of Stalin's "judgements".

<dd>Just look at the very beginning of this discussion. Where Alex writes that 'There is no published books on this "language"' (clearly about your Siberian language project), and you response that "This is lie." and cite a number of books about Russian dialects, not your Siberian language project. This your normal way of discussions. Ok, I'm sure that others are able to read and to find your misinformation. I don't think it's reasonable to argue with you directly.

To make the discussion clear, could you please sum up below all the statements that you consider to be illustrations of the notability of the project? Please don't put here references to books published before you started you work on this project or other weakly related stuff. Please put here only facts directly related to the project, such as a number of people directly involved in creation of the language descriptions (core team), which conferences were held and when and number of their attendees, and so on. Also you may wish to expose your and your team credentials to the public. It may help to the community to make a right decision.

<dd>Well, this doesn't really answer my question. I've no doubt that many Russians are very nationalistic, and some of these let it get in the way of logic. But the plain fact is there are obviously hardly any non-Russian, native English speakers who can even evaluate the sources on this article. It seems like a waste of time for us to even debate it. Either way, we are relying on the explanations of fellow wikipedians who <b>can</b> read the sources. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 00:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I try to help as much as i can. My native language is Russian, but i live in Israel and i am very far from being a Russian nationalist. I support Siberian language out of linguistic curiosity (linguistics is my major) and the political cause of Volgota is of little interest to me. As i mentioned earlier in the discussion, this is a conlang developed by a small group, but it is rather more than <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> or <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovio.html" title="Slovio">Slovio</a> - this actually aims at becoming spoken as a revived natural language. Thus i find it linguistically valid, albeit rather haphazard at the time. Think of it as a language developed by a wikimob instead of a commitee. The times they are a-changing. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E. Aharoni</a> 05:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I may be showing my age here, but seriously -- Op Ivy and Rancid were <i>huge</i> in the late 80's early 90's alternative music scene.

I once sent a Sweetest Day card. It's a "Hallmark holiday" but in midwestern states it does bring in a lot of revenue in for flower, candy and card shops. I'd say that makes it notable, if only for the economic benefits for certain industries. It may also be notable for the controversy surrounding it.

<li>I added the hoax tag to the article because the <i>Herbert Birch Kingston</i> story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a hoax in my opinion. <i>Primary source</i> information from The Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper published October 8th, 1921 and October 8th, 1922 shows a very different beginning to the holiday. Here is a more factual account of how Sweetest Day began: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612</a> . (I realize that this version needs further editing/removal of caps/formatting) I do not believe the category of Sweetest Day should be deleted; it should just be reported for what it is: an 85-year-old hoax. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 16:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure I agree with your hoax tag. There is a difference between "hoax" and "popular mythology". The popular mythology of the day is that Kingston created it as day to honor orphans and shut-ins... and that version of events has been widely reported. This should be in the article (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <b>verifiability not truth</b>). If there is an alternate version of events that can be sourced (i.e. the Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper article, this could be included as well as an alternate, sourced, version of events.

<li>Well, show me some wiki guidelines on holidays which say that a non-religious, non-official, non-notable holiday, and I mean this strictly--not just what has been mentioned--should be included. I wouldn't even have problems including fictional holidays, like "<a href="../../../f/e/s/Festivus.html" title="Festivus">Festivus</a>", from <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> which I'm sure is on wikipedia, because that's notable, but its notability stems from the fact it was on <i>Seinfeld</i>, not from the fact it's a real holiday. I take the position that holidays, real holidays, not just those invented, as this one is, by corporations and without involvement from the people, at a religious or state level, must include celebration or commemoration--I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this. If it were fictional, it'd be notable as a joke. But as real, it's about as notable as "Win a Hawaiian getaway week". A few pop culture references do not a holiday make--they may make something else. But as long as it's an entry whose purpose is presenting a holiday, <b>delete</b>. If they want to call it other than a holiday, they can add it back.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I take the position that holidays [...] must include celebration or commemoration — I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this.</i> — Then please read the article. It actually tells you how this holiday is celebrated or commemorated.
<p><i>A few pop culture references [...]</i> — There are no pop culture references in the article.</p>
<p><i>real holidays, not just those invented</i> — Most of the holidays that you categorize as "real" were in fact invented. Many religious holidays, which you accept, were invented, for examples. They were just invented longer ago than 1921. All secular holidays, such as <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbor_Day_7e6a.html" title="Arbor Day">Arbor Day</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_%28United_States%29_60e9.html" title="Labor Day (United States)">Labor Day</a>, are invented. Your espoused criterion that holidays must be "real" and not "invented" is an entirely faulty one. Your <i>actual</i> criterion appears to be who the inventor of the holiday is. You're happy to accept holidays invented by churches, legislatures, unions, and television programme scriptwriters, but not holidays invented by greetings cards and gift companies. That's a highly subjective judgement, and not a particularly consistent one (given the inclusions of scriptwriters and unions). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. It is a failure of our duty as encyclopaedists to exclude things from Wikipedia that we personally don't like, or think shouldn't exist.

<dd>Thanks. Well, the only argument for keeping offered other than "gee it's already so long, it sure would be a shame..." or "I think it's neat" is that is has some value in the study of linguistics, which I consider a dubious claim at best, and I think it was well responded to. People need to realize that Wikipedia is not a repository for "interesting stuff" - how interesting something is is definitely not a criterion for inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm new to Wikipedia, and not sure I understand all nuances; but similar sort of material might have been found in an old-fashion 'dead tree' encyclopaedia. The old encyclopedists were not against including articles you could learn from; and I think the phrases main function is to illustrate language similarities and differences. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoergenB_358a.html" title="User:JoergenB">JoergenB</a> 12:32, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The suggestion to group members of particular language families together in tables (thereby showing the similarities with greater ease) was made in October 2005 but no one was willing to make the appropriate changes. Showing phonological similarities between languages is best done with individual words and showing syntactic or morphological similarities is best with phrases that aren't necessarily "common." The scope of hypothetical nameless "old-fashioned" encyclopaedias is not really relevant unless one wishes to change Wikipedia's consensus-forged policies.<a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 02:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that organising by 'language groups' is superior for displaying the similarities and differences. (There is some controversy about grouping, and indeed about the whole classical tree model for language relations; but (naively??) I don't expect much controversy in this case.) I am quite willing to undertake a reorganisation along these lines myself. However, I fear I do not understand all of your policies (even if I've read some recommended guidelines and have browsed some talk sides and histories, trying to understand 'what really goes on'). Is it OK and normal to do a drastic re-organisation of a page, while a discussion on its deletion goes on? Will this influence the voting process in some way? I'm not so happy about the idea of doing the work to-day and finding out that it's all been deleted to-morrow, without letting people viewing the result and possibly reconsidering their votes.</dd>
<dd>I also would like to know if there is some simple way to make a manual index of a page (apart from the automatic one). If I reorganise by language branch, I think it would be useful to complement this with an alphabetic index. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoergenB_358a.html" title="User:JoergenB">JoergenB</a> 12:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As a debating ploy, this is a fairly good "I win" button, but it has nothing to do with consensus. This is what riles me: not that the page has been once again proposed for deletion, but rather that the rules have taken on such a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankensteinian</a> life of their own that some people feel cowed to say that "while yes, the page is valuable, the rules say it should go; so it is written, so let it be done."

<dd>I've given some of them.

It has an almost six year history of being at Wikipedia, with thousands of edits by more than a hundred editors. All of that vanishes if the last text is simply transwikied.

<dd>I agree that this list is not a tool for serious linguistic comparison, however it is wonderful for more informal comparisons. E.g. it's something of a revelation to monolingual English speakers that a language could have three ways to say "please." Examples are also really the only way to get a sense of how the language sounds.</dd>
<dd>As AdiJapan points out below, the introduction is a problem. However the rest of the content seems perfectly encyclopedic to me. Some articles on individual languages (e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek.html" title="Greek">Greek</a>) have a short list of phrases in the language, which is what this article mostly consists of. So perhaps there is a problem of <b>organization</b>, which can be resolved by splitting this article into smaller articles and linking them through an index page or category, but the <b>content</b> itself should be improved, not deleted.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a dictionary. However, examples are of great educational value for the general reader. We're talking about a small number of examples per language, not a phrasebook. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClayoquot_80b5.html" title="User talk:Clayoquot">Sound</a></sup>
<dl>
<dd>"Informal comparisons" sounds like trivia to me. Having language samples is never frowned upon, but if you want to get the feel for how a language sounds you should use excerpts from literature or lists of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimal_pair.html" title="Minimal pair">minimal pairs</a> instead of tourist phrases. No recent language FAs have these kinds of lists because they're considered too trivial for serious encyclopedic articles. / <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Isotalo_5ad2.html" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Isotalo_e370.html" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 08:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I see your point. Looking over these comments, I get the sense that this AfD debate tends to split along "serious linguistics" versus "populist" lines. Are 15-20 examples of phrases per language, along the lines of, "How do you do?", too trivial for inclusion? I would argue that the general reader does not think so. Wikipedia has room for both literary and popular examples. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/l/a/User_talk%7EClayoquot_80b5.html" title="User talk:Clayoquot">Sound</a></sup> 16:33, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hi, author here. Snooker commentary is a world unto its own, and it does have these patterns to it that <i>could not</i> be easily incorporated into any other articles. I have been open in my admission about the citation problem, readily incorporating the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> function wherever I feel my own version on things in unacceptable for this encyclopedia. I would love to be able to cite everything but I can't, surely you can see how this is difficult to do. I would like to hear the opinions of a few snooker fans who can vouch for most of this information, since this is the only way to cite it to my knowledge. I would suggest the article be kept, but with some infoboxes warning about OR etc., leaving it open for others to suggest citations. I have recognized this as the main problem with it. If this thread <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbfivelive/F2148574?thread=2811631" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbfivelive/F2148574?thread=2811631" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> goes any way towards convincing any of you that this information is true, if only tenuously verifiable, then great. It's the best thing I could find on the web, but I appreciate it's still not great as a reference source. I'm not going to argue any further, if you feel the need to delete it it would be a shame from my perspective, but I do understand that it doesn't meet certain criteria, and will probably never make it onto the Main Page as a featured article! <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolkris_3f10.html" title="User:Poolkris">Kris</a> 14:53, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> This is a great article, it gives a real insight into snooker commentary, and people who are voting for deletion obviously just don't follow the game of snooker. Everything in it is true. Yes, it lacks citations, and yes, it is in need of input from more NPOV Wikipedians, but this can be worked on over time, I don't think it would be wise to just delete the whole thing. I understand why people voting for deletion are doing so, but as a snooker fan I would urge you not to. You make me laugh Renosecond, putting this article up for deletion. Not the first article deletion debate we've been in is it? I like what you said about Lancsalot's vote: <i>"<b>Personally, I feel</b> that this vote should be deleted ……… as it just states <b>opinion…</b>"</i> And you have some gall telling the author himself he has no right to an opinion regarding keeping the article. There's no wonder you've been banned from Wikipedia in the past, I enjoyed the little tantrum you threw about it as well. It seemed you didn't quit after all – we wouldn't be one to get a bit hot-headed when someone doesn't agree with us would we? Then say things in the heat of the moment? Anyway, all I can say is if this article gets deleted it'd be a real shame. Pre1twa 13:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Much as I appreciate your staunch support Pre1twa, I think the best thing you can bring to this "forum" is silence, cheers mate. I'm enjoying this debate and agree with most of you, be it for or against the article. You're all intelligent people, but I don't agree with the encouragement of disallowing opinions, that would perhaps belie the very reason this page exists. So please stop suggesting such things Renosecond. The ultimate root of everything we as a race perceive as knowledge is opinion, we just trust others more than others. I will stand by my above <i>Keep</i> stance, but likewise won't complain if a delete was arrived at, because in the cold light of Wikipedia rules, all deletists are probably correct. I said I wouldn't argue my case any more — and I'm not, I just don't want an inherent bias to stem from disregarding all the people who vote <i>for</i> the article. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolkris_3f10.html" title="User:Poolkris">Kris</a> 03:46, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> IMHO, many people think that Wikipedia is a strong reference base because of its 1.3 million articles. I like to see information about CitiWiki. Because maybe you don't need wiki softwares, but any information about CitiWiki concerns me.

With a strict deletion policy, Wikipedia can not be Wikipedia as many people know and use. It's not a top %2 thing, any information that people search is important.

<li><b>Comment</b>: To me, it's dependent on one's personal definition of "non-trivial" mentions per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, about the site itself and not just the topics of breast enhancement, cyberbegging, etc. The blurb about the BBC Three show doesn't mention the site at all, just the breast enhancement market in general, and there's no indication (without watching it or reading a transcript) that it's mentioned in a more than passing fashion on the program itself. Likewise, the Houston Press article is more about cyberbegging in general, and mentions the site in a vague "here are some sites we found" context rather than truly being "about" it. The AVN thing is also just an ad for some promotion that mentions the site in a context of a giveaway. I can't speak to the reliability of Vyuz as a news source, however. Of course, other editors' opinions may vary, so I welcome their input as well, in terms of possibly changing my recommendation. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 16:49, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As mentioned above, I have a user account on the MyFreeImplants website, and I can attest to the fact that the BBC show mentioned the website in the TV program. The program aired yesterday (Tuesday, August 29, 2006) and there was a rush of new female signups on the website, probably a good 90 new girls all from the UK who saw the show. Jahgok 03:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In addition, although the BBC website doesn't specifically mention the website by name, here is the reference to it:
<blockquote>
<p>Laura Taylor has wanted a boob job ever since she was 14. She's so desperate to change her breasts she’s logged on to an innovative website that allows men to donate money to women to help them fund a boob job.</p>
</blockquote>
It is my opinion this is an obvious reference to MyFreeImplants. There are no other websites like this to my knowledge. Jahgok 03:08, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> So where is the wiki page that outlines the minimum requirements for Alexa and Google rankings? Is there a quantitative value that can be derived from using these servics that then corresponds to a thumbs-up or thumbs-down for a wiki inclusion? And why are those two companies chosen as the barometer? Or is is mearly a persons opinion based on those services? One would easily assume that a website with poor search engine optimization would be penalized on wikipedia! And not based purely on the facts realted to said website, but based on the skill level of the web developer for the website. Jahgok 17:34, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - 'Sam and the City' is a well-known part of the Sydney Morning Herald website. It's there every weekday and gets hundreds of contributions - it's not an independent blog but part of the Herald's website. I don't think lack of writing for print media should be something that excludes people - if you write for online media and work for a notable enough source then surely that should establish some sort of notability?

<li>You suggest wrong. The third criterion of that site states that if "the content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster", then it is notable. This is the case, as the Herald is a well-known online newspaper, etc. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:54, 4 September 2006 (UTC))

<li>No, you are wrong.

<dd>BLP stands for biographies of living persons. People keep vandalising this article for some reason, and I know for a fact that it has caused the subject of the article distress.

<li>OK, I think you're probably right about this being a keep now.

I'm from England originally, so I realise that Radio 1 is a significant radio station, but in my day the presenter of the Rock Show was never anyone notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> er.. actually I don't want to step back from calling this AfD a "daft" one. For a start, 'daft' is hardly a strong word to use, but more than that, if everyone nominates an Afd without checking it out a little first, how is that going to make Wikipedia look when, as will happen, far more famous names are AfD'd? I'd hazard the word daft...

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I didn't withdraw my nom, otherwise I would have said so. I was thinking out loud – admittedly that's probably also daft behaviour. Moreover, this isn't an issue of me not knowing the facts, OK? I'm English, I know what Radio 1 is, that's not the issue. It didn't occur to me that Radio One DJs were notable by dint of that status alone, which seems to be what you're arguing, not implausibly, which is what I was trying to say: hey, that's a good point, I didn't think of that. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 13:33, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Now how about my comment that <i>Believe me, a BBC Radio 1 DJ is notable. etc...'</i> - I'm guessing you were either not quite awake when you said that 'faith based assertions' etc.. or, much more likely, you just don't know the situation via a viz Radio 1 in the UK. Well, I'm afraid I can't prove anything to you or anyone else about how major a player Radio 1 is but - and so you'll just have to believe me (or do a little research!) - but it's a little like ABC or CNN or whoever else is the main media organisation in the US.

<li>Wiki says: The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.[7]...........Well Whiskerville is distributed online via a few places. One is Whiskerville.com obviously, two is Testcase.net and three is Jokethemonkey.com (Alexa Ranking of 541,246 and 10K in pageviews a day). So on any given week Whiskerville is seen by over 10000 people on the internet. Does that work? Or am I stretching it? And just so you know, I am not the guy who does whiskerville...I'm just a fan. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.6.59.197 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.6.59.197.html" title="User talk:24.6.59.197">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.59.197_4008.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.59.197">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Two things I'd like to comment on are that this is not a vote, but a discussion and relatedly, the discussion needs to apply to the notability (and therefore appropriateness) of having Whiskerville as an article. Being a great web comic or even being one of many that might need to be removed for lack of notability is not an argument for keeping it. The most recent comment above from 24.6.59.197 is much better at stating a case for keeping the article (although just because jokethemonkey.com gets 10k views doesn't mean they're all looking at Whiskerville). If the article is kept, it needs to do a better job at establishing this supposed notability. There are no links to any press coverage, awards, or any other reason to think that Whiskerville is just a slightly web-syndicated personal website (and given the ease of syndication on the web, that's hardly expansive viewership). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 16:26, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The Whiskerville page on Wiki says this "This article is being considered for deletion in accordance with Wikipedia's deletion policy. Please share your thoughts on the matter at this article's entry on the Articles for deletion page. " That means we have every right to share our thoughts on this matter. Whether it be by a comic pointing us here or someone suggesting we come here. This is a free site, and we have every right to voice our opinions. Also Whiskerville is published in an Oregon Newspaper. If you delete Whiskerville from Wiki then I DEMAND that you guys flag all other Webcomics that aren't in print. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.6.59.197 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.6.59.197.html" title="User talk:24.6.59.197">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.6.59.197_4008.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.6.59.197">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>Look, that's exactly what I'm trying to point out to you, except just sharing your feelings doesn't help an administrator make a decision to keep the article or not. Your feelings need to be backed up with solid proof of notability as it relates to the rules of Wikipedia which have been quoted a few times now ( <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are two examples). If you'd like to make it a goal to have all webcomics not even as notable as Whiskerville removed, then I would applaud your effort if it's deemed that this webcomic should be deleted. I will AfD those articles when I come to them, too. I didn't hunt out Whiskerville or webcomics, I AfD what I see that meets what I think are the criteria when I happen to see them. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't delete</b> - Provides an accurate, concise description of a respected webcomic. Author tours conventions with the authors of Mac Hall, 8-bit Theatre, and CTR-ALT-DEL - thus at least three respected authors in the webcomic community believe him to be a peer.

Yes, some people once floated the idea that Wikipedia ought to throw out all our content policies about "reliable sources" and "no original research" and instead we should write encyclopedia articles about every web comic that manages to reach the arbitrary milestone of 100 comics. Then we realized that was a bad idea because 1) It's not that noteworthy that somebody managed to draw five comics a week for two and a half months, 2) Nobody would ever consider writing about every blog with 100 posts or every flickr account with 100 photos or every wikipedia editor who writes 100 encyclopedia articles, and 3) If no third party reliable sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy are writing about those 100 comics, then we really shouldn't (and can't) write about them either. We're an encyclopedia, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an internet directory. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:15, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately the 100 comic limit was one of <i>several</i> criteria intended to work together, instead of a single arbitrary milestone.

A more accurate search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=m9n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=fractal.structure+music&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=m9n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=fractal.structure+music&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"fractal.structure music"</a> gets us down to 31,300 results; again most are about the fractal structure of music, not Max Holod.

<p>Contested PROD, nominator stated "NN local politician withg copyvio issues" (bio is largely from the local paper). The copyvio issue may be fixable, assuming that other reliable sources can be found to substantiate the details of the mayor of a small town, but per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it is highly unlikely that being mayor of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a> is a significant national office which in and of itself confers encyclopaedic notability. For comparison, this town is rather smaller than <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a> (where I live). I know one of Reading's former mayors, he is a schoolteacher at my son's primary school. The two roles are of roughly equivalent importance, in my view. The world has many tens of thousands of mayors, most of them worthy and sincere individuals, but only one of them is <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, and it's not this one. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:49, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a few points I want to get out:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been reading through <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, and the <i>Sources</i> section specifically says that local newspapers are an acceptable source of information. I was also very careful to attribute the article, as I did not want to make it seem as if it was plagiarization - I wanted it to be clear that there was a source, and that source was attributed</li>
<li>After reading the <i>Information to be included</i> section, I see that I haven't really put much of value into this article from a historical perspective - I will fix this up, however I believe that 5 days is too short a time. Can I request that a deletion decision be deferred until 1 month from now, Sept. 30th 2006? By then, if the article hasn't been updated or reached an acceptable level of content, I will tacitly agree to it's deletion</li>
<li>I would propse that, if this article is pegged as being worthy of deletion, that a thorough cleanup be done on the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_municipal_elections%2C_2003.html" title="Ontario municipal elections, 2003">Ontario municipal elections, 2003</a> page as there are numerous articles that I have seen there which contain less information than this one (see <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Thomson_0ed8.html" title="Wayne Thomson">Wayne Thomson</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Farbridge_b510.html" title="Karen Farbridge">Karen Farbridge</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_MacIsaac_4e92.html" title="Rob MacIsaac">Rob MacIsaac</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Peterson_1d2e.html" title="Lynn Peterson">Lynn Peterson</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wayne Thomson = former incumbent mayor. Karen Farbridge = former incumbent mayor. Rob MacIsaac = current incumbent mayor. Lynn Peterson = current incumbent mayor. This line of argument holds no water whatsoever. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Peterson_1d2e.html" title="Lynn Peterson">Lynn Peterson</a> was the mayor of Thunder Bay - even though her article is a stub, it's still a valid encyclopaedic topic. <i>Stub</i> is not a criterion for deletion. Checking the rest, they are either mayors of former mayors of reasonably important cities - not <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Bridge%2C_Ontario_b29d.html" title="Iron Bridge, Ontario">Iron Bridge, Ontario</a>, but <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>. Encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>He was never mayor of Thunder Bay - he ran, and lost (according to the article.) I'm pretty sure every mayor of Thunder Bay is an encyclopaedic topic, but I don't think the same is true of failed candidates. <i>Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage</i> would almost certainly be true of any mayor of a large city (and Thunder Bay is the largest city within about a thousand kilometers) But he lost. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Update on the above list of candidates: Hmm, it appears I did miss the fact that they were all past mayors. However, what about <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Upson_60d4.html" title="Donna Upson">Donna Upson</a>? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStraxus_2a2e.html" title="User talk:Straxus">User Talk:Straxus</a> 19:43, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
An interesting mix of viewpoints is being shown - on the one hand, it is stated that <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay</a> is too small a city to really merit much attention (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">User Talk:JzG</a> above). On the other hand, it's being claimed that the city is a big one and that as a result the mayoral article should be preserved (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilyD_17e3.html" title="User talk:WilyD">User Talk:WilyD</a> above). In a multi-contributor environment like Wikipedia, I realize that it's very difficult to apply editorial consistency, however I would refer again to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> page and say that I will attempt to bring this article up to that standard in one month. I'm also not trying to turn this into some sort of contest - it matters not to me who won or lost a given election, but rather that historical background on the election is present for readers to analyze. As far as my own opinion about <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay</a>, I lived there for 18 years and it is definitely the largest city within a long range. It's approximately 800 km to any city which is larger than it, and it serves as the nerve centre for Northwestern Ontario (of the population of 250,000 in the region, it contains about 110,000). I believe that it qualifies it as a local 'major city', and the much lower population densities in Canada mean that the major cities are significantly smaller than in the UK. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStraxus_2a2e.html" title="User talk:Straxus">User Talk:Straxus</a> 13:34, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've done some further research, and it turns out that mayoral candidate is not the only historically interesting information about this person. It appears that he was both Board Director and Chairman of the Thunder Bay Chamber of Commerce, and he is also currently on the Board of Directors of the Thunder Bay Airport.</p>

<li>Thanks for pointing out my very poorly worded comment. I didn't mean to say that Thunder Bay as sparsely populated. I meant to compare the population density of Norethern Ontaio, to Southern Ontario. The northern part of the provine is more sparsely populated than the southern part, and Thunder Bay represents a major population and activity centre for a large region. Using population unqualified as <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">User:Ohconfucius</a> did doesn't properly represent the importance of the city.

<li><b>Comment</b> I found another source in the Book of Alternative Records, which added additional detail about the date and place of the world record. Plus Katz himself published "King of the Ferret Leggers and other True Stories." I added both these to the page. Incidentally, in 2005, someone linked to the Outside story on the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">ferret</a> page. The talk page reflects that people thought it was "ridiculous" ("Anyone who reads that article swill immediately put things into perspective. By comparison it makes "Reefer Madness" look like a true story") and the reference was removed. But with two sources, I'm now convinced it's not a hoax and I believe the article should stay as is.</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> or</s> <b>Weak Keep</b> but <b>Clean Up</b> I don't quite believe the Outside article is a hoax, but it is RIDDLED with gross factual errors-far too many to be the only reference. It describes ferrets as "a shark of the land, a piranha with feet, fur-coated evil, and the only four-legged creature in existence that kills just for kicks" and as having "the jaw musculature of a pit bull." claims that "A baby was killed and eaten in 1978" (despite the fact that ferrets weigh only 2-3 pounds) and that "little is known of the diseases carried by the ferret because veterinarians are afraid to touch them." despite ferrets having a LONG history as labratory animals. Yes ferret legging does get a lot of hits on google but almost all of them point to reprints of the Outside article. One of the non-Outside sources mentioned in a previous comment is even worse: "With claws as sharp as needles, they are also able scamper up walls and across beamed ceilings in pursuit of moths and flies." which is utterly false and seems to confuse ferrets with geckos. If this article is to remain it needs to have a better source. I am convinced that this jackass-stunt really did exist so I would rather see this article improved by having more reliable references than deleted outright, but without more and better sources it is too unverified to stand.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a> 18:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Google searches would be deceptive on that because the same article that Katz wrote for Outside appeared later in Harpers and then in Katz' book. This would make that one source appear to be 3 sources. Furthermore almost everything on google that is not a direct reprint of that article derives its information from the article. The Katz article's numerous factual errors do render it unreliable and I do stand by the comment that I made earlier on the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferret.html" title="Ferret">Ferret</a> talk page that "Anyone who reads that article will immediately put things into perspective. By comparison it makes "Reefer Madness" look like a true story". However I notice that the Wikipedia article now also has a footnote to the book "Gould, Philip J.; Ralf Laue (2004). Book of Alternative Records. Metro Publishing Ltd.. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1843581264</a>". Not having read it I can't comment on the book's reliability, but book sources are considered as valid as online sources WRT wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffStickney_0321.html" title="User:JeffStickney">JeffStickney</a> 00:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the Book of Alternative Records source has information not present in Katz' article, such as the date and place of Reg Mellor's world record. Just because there are errors about the behavior of ferrets from people who observed the sport doesn't invalidate the existence sport/practice. My guess is that the sport has really died out (perhaps with the Reg Mellor generation), but Katz did capture it (even if poorly or hyperbolically, in the eyes of some), as did others and it should stay here. <b>Please note there are now two sources in the article</b> <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScarykitty_2934.html" title="User:Scarykitty">Scarykitty</a> 15:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one's disputing that this man put Ferrets in his pants, and no one's disputing that people have written about it. What people are disputing (and rightly so) is whether this makes it a real sport, or at least a notable sport for Wikipedia purposes. Even if real, we don't give articles to every nutty competition conceived by bored miners and lumberjacks. However, I have an idea for a compromise: Katz's book might make a decent article even if the "sport" itself does not. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:36, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well... thanks for the sharp and rather unjust decision on your collective parts to vote for the removal of "djdownload.com". If you would kindly take the time to find out a little bit more about DJdownload then you may realise that it is an important part of DJ culture her in the ol' UK, and if you insist on its removal then I suggest that you review and delete "Beatport", Sony Connect, and all the other Online music stores on Wikipedia. Beatport in particular cares to mention (purely for research purposes i'm sure...) the prices of its download on the same wiki article!</p>

<p>This is a tough one. I vote <b>weak delete</b>, and let me go into why. First of all, wikipedia can't put on its site everyone who commits murders. Poor people commit murders every day, and there's absolutely no mention of it on Wikipedia, but some kid whose parents can afford a video game system, and all of a sudden, there's upper-class white outrage. And that's what the article basically consists of, that outrages, asking us to be outraged, <i>plus</i> the normal criminal set up. Now, there is the 60 Minutes stuff, but this stuff isn't fleshed out. Was it merely mentioned as a lead in to a segment, or was the entire segment based on this one kid? I think there's no way of knowing, because I didn't see the show. There are 1.6 million hits on google on it, but it appears difficult to quantify how many are really this Devin Moore... but again, even if there is a large number of internet hits, who gets on the internet? people who can afford it.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 04:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree this is a grey area, but please realise that the incident might be more significant to United States society than a simple murder (as crass as that sounds), as it could be used to justify limitations on civil liberties such as free speech. Honestly, I was surprised when I read this article - I live about 15 minutes from the police station where this happened, and I heard plenty about the killings shortly after they occurred. However, this is the first I have heard about a video game connection. I was aware that there was at least one alleged "GTA murder" in the national media but had no idea that it and this local case were one and the same. As far as I can recall, there was no mention whatsoever in the local media about the game connection, at least not around the time of the shooting. In other words, the video game "defense" seems pretty contrived to me, and it might be a good idea to see how much credence is given to this defense by the courts, legislature, ESRB, etc. If this is just yet another cop killing in Alabama which happens to have idiots running the defense and spouting potentially harmful ideas about the dangers of free speech and media, then it doesn't belong in an international encyclopedia, as bad an incident as it was. If, however, we later see changes in the law or the entertainment industry based on this case (which seems unlikely), then it might be worthy of mention as a social phenomenon. So perhaps delete now, but include it if it becomes a bigger issue? -Barry K. 24.116.114.143 19:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page appears to be a hoax to me, since the article itself states that the show in question doesn't exist. However, it does sort of assert notability, so it didn't seem a good candidate for a speedy. It's a bit difficutl to google as the words "hiatus" and "television show" obviously come up with a lot of unrelated hit. But I'm pretty sure it's a fake.

<p><br /></p>
<p>I'll repost what I said on the talk page: The article wasn't put here as a joke -- the fanbase the article mentions *does* actually exists. Not only that, the article specifically states that the show itself never existed. So what's in-authentic about the article? Something can't be a hoax if the thing it's talking about actually exists, i.e. the fanbase of supporters for the non-existent television show "Hiatus" The only thing that might make this article viable for deletion is the fact that the fanbase isn't that large yet.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Take a look at the original (pre-stub) article. Looks like a clear attempt at a joke to me. Anyway it's irrelevant, as you say this just isn't notable. Something doesn't get an article just by virtue of the fact that it appears on the internet.--<a href="../../../l/o/2/User%7ELo2u_7160.html" title="User:Lo2u">Lo2u</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/o/2/User_talk%7ELo2u_fec7.html" title="User talk:Lo2u">T</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lo2u_7724.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lo2u">C</a>)</sup> 11:33, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fanbase the article mentions has been in existence for just over a week, and consists of a couple dozen people at the outside. Most of the content in the non-stub was either made up, or was based on one posting on the very new fansite. Wikipedia is not for original work, and it's not for stuff you and a few friends just put together.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I noted that none of the pages it links to link back to NATO helmet. And that the image on NATO helmet comes from one of the pages it links to. I generally prefer to keep stubs and ask people to work on them. I note that nominator has already contacted article creator with just this request. (Very ethical. Not like some deletionists.) I've contacted others who have worked on the article to let them know about the AfD. No strong opinion either way on my part. Perhaps <b>very weak keep contingent on someone providing sources.</b> If someone shows up here and says they'll research this, great.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 15:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I just don't think it's neccessarily worthy of research which is why I proposed it for deletion. I have no qualms about proposing a stub for deletion if it seems useless. I don't think an article on a particular type of helmet will grow into something anymore meaningful than it already is, and I just don't think of it as meaningful. Perhaps the article can be deleted and merged to be listed on the main Wikipedia helmet page, that would seem far more productive to me rather than just having a random helmet article on a specific type of helmet. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShazbot85_d6a8.html" title="User:Shazbot85"><font color="DarkGreen">Shazbot85</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShazbot85_611d.html" title="User talk:Shazbot85">Talk</a></sup> 15:33, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came here to find out about the lonelygirl15 phenomenon and found out.

<li><b>Keep</b> - For pete's sake, leave the article alone for one freaking minute and let it grow organically. Over the next few weeks/months, I predict these videos will grow even more in popularity and the truth behind their intent will become clear.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not here to document trends or bandy in crystalballism about whether or not the intent of these videos will ever become clear.

Whilst it's wiki's declared policy not indulge in speculation (i.e. be ahead of the curve), LG15 does appear to have become a phenomenon.

<li><b>Keep</b> Quoting myself from the undelete discussion: The fact that there are articles about other Youtube people at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Notable_YouTube_users</a> shows that people are looking for them. Several of which have passed AfD's of their own. Having watched this debate, to me, the real reason for the delation really seems to be less about the rules of Wiki, and more about the preceived popularity of who the article is about. That coupled with the reasons above means that this article should exist. Dave 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And now a comment: How does internet fame differ from real world? The internet is part of the real world. And please, no "I know it when I see it" answers which amount to little more than a cop-out. Dave 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I preface by sayign that I realize I do not have a lot of edits. When this article was for AfD last time, I could see saying that she was not notable enough, but I think her popularity has skyrocketed since that time even further. There do exist multiple sources including newsworthy sources such as the LA Times referencing her. Also, the whole controversy involving the trademark application along with a few other theories not yet mentioned in the article makes this possible to be a genious marketing event. I think because of all this, she is notable enough to have an entry. 24.168.219.121 14:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP Encyplopedias mustn't dictate what interests people (e.g., articles on the fruit fly need to be there, though not of interest to everyone.). Lonleygirl15 is video literature.... real, fictional, or semi-fictional, boring, interesting? no matter. It is a cultural phenomenon that exists and captures the attention of a lot more people than, say, difficult academic new music, or arcane Sanskrit poetry. Elitist intellectualism has no place in legislating what constitutes general human knowledge. Semari1 16:47, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There was just a AfD earlier this month. This article is based on primary sources. It is perfectly legitimate to cite authors of books as a sources about what tbeir own own books say.

<li><b>Comment</b> Here is the deal. One guy named Frank Wallace developed the philosophy. He published his own books. Since then other authors people have been writing about the philosophy, and Wallace has published their books and articles for them with his own publishing company. I don't know if the latter would be considered secondary sources since they're technically not self-published, but it's all that's available. There are no books that go into describing Neo-Tech that are not published by Wallace's publishing company, that I'm aware of. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 19:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Anyone that told you an article is unencyclopedia because it has only self-published sources is wrong, under the condition that self-published sources are only used a sources for what the author of those sources are saying in an article about the authors of those sources. A book by Frank Wallace is a good source to show what a book what by Frank Wallace says. There's no disputing that. But, since Wallace's books are self-published they're probably not good as secondary sources, which means you couldn't use Wallace's opinion in a different article about something else. The article is not too bad as it is. The way to improve it would be to bring in more books by Wallace and others who write about Neo-Tech. The way to not improve it, is to do what you were doing, which is bringing in posts from anonymous people on forums and even a web page you made yourself as sources. That would be using self-published sources as secondary sources, which means using self-published sources in a article other than an article about the source itself. You made a web page called Pax-NeoTex which is making jokes about Neo-Tech. You can't use that as a source in the article, meaning it's not a reliable secondary source. You could only use that as a source if you're using it as a source about Pax-NeoTex if there were a Pax-NeoTex article. You're not a published expert on Neo-Tech, but a self-published jokester (that is, your web page is a joke page). <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> specifically disagrees with your argument: "Neologisms that are in wide use -- but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources -- are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia." Plain and simple.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's not applicable at all. Do you think <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is a neologism and therefore that article should be deleted? That's absurd.

If there's none, it just means they're not important enough to attract some. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a>, the article as it is is not interesting and will strike almost anyone who stumble upon it as an ad. For the sake of your own cause, please consider making it look like there has been some other consideration than the books. Basically, Islam is defined by the Coran. But if you got out there and did the article only by citing it, it would look unapropriate. I know, it's not a cult, but you get my drift. Or else, consider changing it to articles about the books.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 18:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Books about Neo-Tech are cited in other books, such as in <i>Church Disputes Mediation</i> (Gracewing Publishing 2003, page 287) and in <i>Fresh Wisdom: Breakthrough to enlightenment</i>, ISBN: 1419618555 (page 117), but as far as I know there are no criticisms. So the fact that it is cited, if not criticized, indicates some importance. Even without those citations, it's obviously noteable. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 18:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There's a line between being imporant enough to attract controversy and being notable. But I think I'm loosing my time here. How about we flag the article as "neutrality disputed", and wait until someone (<a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> maybe?)edits a book against it? Then we'll have opposing secondary sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Right, but besides self-published sources being used as a source for what an author says about himself they can also be used as a source for how the author describes his philosophy. They can't be used as a source for asserting whether the philosophy is good or not, of course, but a book can always be used a source for what's in that book. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 02:26, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't make sense to merge. I understand why those who voted to merge would do so though, because they probably were not aware that of the following: Wallace is not the only developer of Neo-Tech. There are other writers who contribute their ideas to make what is called Neo-Tech. Only citing Wallace, you would not get a full picture of the philosophy. The philosophy stands alone because it's a combination of ideas from different people. Wallace's son, Mark Hamilton, has probably written about half of it. I oppose a merge. A merge with <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_R._Wallace_ae51.html" title="Frank R. Wallace">Frank R. Wallace</a> makes no sense. And a merge with Objectivism would be original research because no secondary sources say it is a form of objectivism. The Neo-Tech article is a pretty good article. It's pretty well sourced and defintely written NPOV. There are PLENTY of sources. The books themselves are the sources. It is a good article, and the vote is totally uncalled for. "Bi" who put this up for deletion spends his time writing his own web page called "Neo-Tex" which is a feeble attempt to ridicule the philosophy. He doesn't like Neo-Tech and wants to get rid of the article and wants to remove as much words about Neo-Tech from Wikipedia as possible. Look at what he did to the Neo-Tech article. He tried to cut it down to almost nothing, deleting sourced information: He cut it down from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=59710589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=59710589" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=67813185" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neo-Tech_%28philosophy%29&amp;oldid=67813185" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> That is totally unjustified. Wikipedia is about being informative as possible, not least informative as possible. Bi has initiated this action for all the wrong reasons. Please consider changing your vote, because it's going to be moved back to its own article eventually anyway. Probably no one will change their vote, but at least this is here for the record so anyone can see exactly what this was all about. It is totally improper attempt to delete a fine article, with those voting not having enough background information to make an informed decision. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 03:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think it would be more acceptable to have a full-extent description of the guy's system of thought on his own article than on a separate one. Plus it would put the length of the neo tech citations in perspective with something else, instead of being evaluated <i>per se</i>. Should we wait for <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> to approve, or is there a time limit to these things?--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 14:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - As the original poster I believe it should be kept and I plan to expand it further. If it strikes you as a place to hang links on it is probably because I have really just gotten started getting the information posted. It was a real company that was part of the history of sailing in america and the sailboats are still out there being used. It would be nice if wikipedia could be a center of information on these boats. As far as the links themselves, they are all good sources of information, not commercial. Lasher9999</li>

There's even a story about him being nominated a few years ago for WEF's "100 Future Global Leaders".

<p>"Jumping the couch" has only gained notability because of the notability of Tom Cruise and the couch incident, as well as the notability of Urban Dictionary, who coined the term. I know the term has been referenced by several reliable websites, but there is no evidence of the term being in common usage in everyday speech/writing, as are some other pop culture neologisms such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrosexual.html" title="Metrosexual">metrosexual</a>. Until we see this neologism clearly being used by many people (not just listed on websites as one of the coolest slang phrases of the year), I don't think it should have its own article.

<li>If you'll read that, you'll find that it doesn't apply in this case. Specifically, because there are multiple, reliable independant sources. So no, no one has offered any argument for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was looking at the (redundant) external links section and missed the references section that actually links to pages discussing the term. I'd say it's still pretty close, though, as the source for the MSN article is a slang dictionary (which are somewhat less than highly respected in the field of research) and the other is a self-published source. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:06, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They're not <i>A+</i> sources, I agree, but they're still reliable enough. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:14, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Enough for you, not enough for me. I'm not trying to invalidate your opinion, and all I ask is the same respect in return. If you disagree, that's okay. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:19, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The MSNBC one, at least, is good enough for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - my own feelings don't enter into it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But <i>their</i> source is a slang dictionary. Personal interpretation always enters into this kind of thing, because <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is not a blanket policy. It's up to the community to make the final determination about reliability, and for my part (and consensus often upholds this) slang dictionaries don't hold water. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They still have editorial controls at the like - their source being a slang dictionary (or at least, their mentioned source) is not germane to the issue. It acquires the "endorsement" of a major news organisation during the process, making it reliable. Slang dictionaries are sometimes reliable, but many are not (i.e. Urban Dictionary allows users to submit original content. But a reliable publisher publishing a slang dictionary, or a peer reviewed paper on slang would still cut mustard.) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:40, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>But not only is it a neologism, it's a protologism. This term has not even been <i>used</i> (in casual speech/writing) by anyone yet. If we don't know how people will use or apply this term, what purpose does this serve other than a slang dicdef? --<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchzmo_9c23.html" title="User:Schzmo">Schzmo</a> 15:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s><b>Fails <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a></b></s></p>
<p>This article already went (successfully) through the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Proposed deletion</a> process--yes, it was deleted. Unfortunately, since links remained, and since no traces for the reasons of its deletion remained, it was re-created and subsequently edited by well-intended users. This approach intends to avoid the confusion.</p>
<p>This article was created and edited in good faith, but the very concept and content are, in my opinion, misguided. There is no such thing as an absolute color space--try finding a definition of this concept outside Wikipedia (and ignoring Wikipedia mirrors), and you will fail.</p>
<p>The reason is that the concept of an "absolute color space" doesn't reconcile at all with the well-established concepts of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_space.html" title="Color space">color space</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_model.html" title="Color model">color model</a>. In essence, this article duplicates some of the concepts in both <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_space.html" title="Color space">color space</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_model.html" title="Color model">color model</a>, without really clarifying what a "non-absolute" color space would be. That's because there is no such thing as a non-absolute (relative?) color space. -- <a href="../../../g/u/t/User%7EGutza_f973.html" title="User:Gutza">Gutza</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have to say I really don't understand why this was nominated. I've worked with colour management for many years and the terms and definitions of "absolute colour space" and "relative colour space" are well-known in that field. A Google search brings up several non-Wikipedia references and definitions. It's certainly not original research. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 06:38, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I am the author of the request for deletion, and I stand corrected: the article should be kept. I don't know whether I should de-list it from AfD myself. For anyone curious on what happened, I'll explain myself. I did do my research before proposing this for deletion the first time, and I really didn't find any credible source at that time; I obviously didn't do any more research for listing it on AfD afterwards. Quiddity, I think the article you listed was inspired by Wikipedia content, so it wouldn't count if that was the case (I found several wording similarities between Wikipedia content and that article.) Of course, I can't be certain it was. But Canley's vote and explanation made me search Google again--lo and behold, now I found several very credible sources mentioning absolute color spaces--including a patent application by Seiko <a href="http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1187069" class="external autonumber" title="http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1187069" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>; I'd say Triad was a pretty important cracking group in Nordic countries at least (how do I know? eh... um... my... <i>backup copies</i> of some C64 games here happen to be cracked by them, and if that stuff has somehow come to my hands on the pre-Internet era, that's quite an accomplishment. And yes, I have genuine versions of the games <i>now</i> =). However, the verifiability is a bit of a problem here - "underground" stuff tends, by definition, stay pretty obscure and by definition hard to verify...

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I humbly request that the Wilderness, Armour and Weaponry articles are not listed for AFD until such a time as their contents (or at least the subject matter) has been rewritten for the Combat article. A lot of RS articles did need to go or be swiftly merged, but we're reaching a point of unsustainable deletions and risking information loss and the frustration of those who have been wrestling with these articles for months on end.

This article and the others which could be merged into combat have had a lot of time and effort expended on them. The result is a series of polished game-guides which repeat what is readily available on fan sites without as much pertinent info but in a much more readable format. It would be a lot easier to build up fewer articles with the slices of relevant material added from articles to be deleted. Servicing such a number of highly editted articles has proven to take up vast amounts of time which could be spent actually elevating the needed articles.

<dd>The only content from Magic that isn't now contained in combat or explained in other articles is the needless list of weapons and armour. Information on the ins-and-outs of individual items is very easily obtainable from fansites or the RS knowledgebase and in a blunt format with all the stats which we cannot apply here anyway. At the time the AFD was listed these were not merged, and it's right to stand back and look it again, as your comment encouraged me to do. Now that the other information is merged, the article has carried out its purpose and becomes part of the combat article which in time can be built up to a high-standard. Despite all this, it would have been better if this information was merged properly and time was given to that process before the AFD process began. If one of the other articles which could be merged to combat is listed to AFD before that process is done, I shall be voting keep to stop this running around. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 15:34, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - please don't take offense, Medos, this discussion isn't about whether your site is good or not. It's about whether Wikipedia is the appropriate place for what you've written.

A comment added to the article (rather than talk) states that the subject is not included in the <i>Oxford Dict. of Celtic Mythology</i>. The results in Google books are unpromising <a href="http://books.google.com/books?&amp;q=scathach%20dubglas" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?&amp;q=scathach%20dubglas" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?&amp;q=scathach%20douglas" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?&amp;q=scathach%20douglas" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. As noted at the article talk, the name itself is improbable (<i>Dubglas</i> or <i>Dubhglas</i> are possible).

<li><b>Delete all, but without prejudice</b> No sources given means that these fail WP:V, but if deleted, I suggest the closing admin to add a note to that effect in the deletion logs, so if referenced articles about these topics do get created, they don't get accidently G4'd.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Although Inghean Bhuidhe, for instance, looks like it's probably genuine, no sources have been provided despite a long-standing request.

<li>As this list itself makes perfectly clear if you look at it, when manga is published separately, it is published in a series of volumes, certainly not as separate chapters. That's why the list is divided into volumes, see? And why the ISBNs are per volume, not per chapter?<br />

<li>Umm. I mentioned several multi volume works in the above list of titles. The Hakkenden is a 106 volume work. There are also works like Dickens' <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Expectations_11b3.html" title="Great Expectations">Great Expectations</a>, which has a serial publication. We really don't need every single chapter of a manga like this.

<dd><b>Reply</b> The Hakkenden, as well as other serialized novels, sound like they could indeed use sorted chapter listings then. Indeed, the Hakkenden probably deserves an immense amount more detail than is currently given on it. (It doesn't even have character articles or basic plot overview) But we simply do not have enough interested editors, and the Hakkenden has little or no presence in English.

<li><b>Keep</b> please read <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LISTs</a> if you don't understand the point of lists. Categories are <b>not</b> the same as lists. Since <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_set.html" title="Box set">Box set</a> has an article, List of box sets cannot reasonably be argued to be listcruft. Essentially, nominator has advanced <i>no</i> rational for deletion, nor can I see any. No policy, guideline or proposal even suggests we should delete useful, encyclopaedic content, so I have to suggest we keep it. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Yes, there are times when lists are more helpful than categories, but this isn't one of them. If you are simply looking for examples of box sets, the category is fine. If you are looking for box sets by a specific artist, this list would not be as helpful as, say, the artist's discography either here or elsewhere. It is very unlikely that somebody looking to fill in gaps in albums would choose to do so by filling in missing box sets as opposed to, say, missing albums from a particular artist or time period. Also, please note that there is very little tying these sets together except that they are multiple discs packaged as box sets. This list does not help to explicate anything about box sets, nor could it. That is why it is not, in my opinion, "useful, encyclopaedic content." GassyGuy 18:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In essence, though, what you're arguing here is that this is a <i>stub quality</i> list, and that merely being a stub is a criterion for deletion. It isn't. If you look at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Wikipedia:Featured lists</a> you'll see plenty of lists that meet all of the quantitative complaints you've voiced here, yet been elevated to featured status simply because they're better developed. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

My argument is not that this is a stub - my argument is that it serves no purpose that the category does not serve, and that not only does it not help to explicate on the concept of box sets (which, if it did, would give it some merit as an article), but that it could <i>never</i> help to explicate that concept. <i>That</i> is my argument.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nothing to do with it being a stub for me. It's just a list that is simply too broad and unmaintainable. It's like doing a List of record albums. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
