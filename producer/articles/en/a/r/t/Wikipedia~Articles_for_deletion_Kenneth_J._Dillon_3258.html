<p>This was speedied with the notation "nn bio by user KennethJDillon". If any of this this true no way is it a speedy -- the article at least <i>claims</i> that he's written five books - seems true enough, he's on Amazon, although "Scientia Press" might be in his mom's basement. The other claims seem a bit over the top... but he is (apparently) president of Spectrum Bioscience Inc. (whatever that is), he was a intellgence analyst did write some paper about that al Queda guy. I dunno, is he notable? I can't really tell, and I'm not gonna vote, I'm just switching this from speedy to AfD. 453 Goggle hits on "Kenneth J.

<li><b>Delete</b> Everything looks wrong on this guy. It appears he <i>is</i> Scientia Press, or is at least its only author. All the external links in the article point to Scientia Press' web site. He identified an Al Qaeda operative as responsible for the anthrax mailings, but I can't find any claim of this that doesn't trace back to Dillon or Scientia Press. The FBI posting for the guy makes no mention of the anthrax episode at all, nor can I find any mainstream news organizations reporting the claim. Dillon has a PhD in history, but claims to have made major medical breakthroughs in areas of, uh, <i>alternative</i> treatments like "Biophotonic Therapy". His book, "Close to Nature Medecine," has an Amazon rank of #2,146,676. He's developed a cognitive cure for depression. Oh, and apparently he can solve our nuclear waste disposal problems. How do we know these things are true? Why, because he told us so himself. Either this guy deserves the Nobel prize in everything, or he's a total crackpot. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:36, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let's see. One the one hand, the <i>AIDS book review journal</i> (which you cited), which is compiled by a general librarian and is not peer-reviewed, recommends Dillon's self-published book as "A recommended book for medical libraries for its historical content and possible basis for future research." On the other hand, the library at the major research institution/teaching hospital I work at doesn't have either of his books on healing, Dillon is not published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and his only exposure in the mainstream press is three letters to the editor. Does notability outweigh verifiability? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm Kenneth J. Dillon. Six comments.
<ol>
<li>Slow down.</li>
<li>Consider that you may be dealing with something you have never encountered before. Historian turns scientist? Doing scientific detective work is right up my alley. Get used to it.</li>
<li>Many of the responses are relying on indicators that may not be as useful in this case as in others--e.g., self-publishing, which I assure you works a lot better than trying to get really novel ideas past editorial gatekeepers. Eventually, I hope to turn Scientia Press into a normal science publishing house, with books by many authors, and spin it off. If prestige conveys credibility, then the fact that one of my books was published by Smithsonian Institution Press is relevant.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia article does not make a claim of "major medical breakthroughs", nor does it claim that my cognitive therapy of depression is a cure.</li>
<li>It would not be reasonable to expect you to read much of what I have written, but you might find at least the article identifying the likely Anthrax Mailer<a href="http://www.scientiapress.com/findings/mailer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scientiapress.com/findings/mailer.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> worth reading. The evidence cited there suggests that FBI takes it dead seriously. It very much looks that, more likely than not, Abderraouf Jdey was indeed the Mailer. And my credentials for being the kind of person who could identify the Mailer in this manner are impeccable.</li>
<li>Read several of my items. You will see that I'm not a "total crackpot", and that what I have been working on is not unimportant.</li>

<dd>I formated your comment a little, I hope you don't mind. No one is citing your theories' validity as a reason for deletion. If you can cite mentions of your work or yourself in primary or secondary sources your biography would be worth including. Until it does meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> however, it does not belong. Even if you had cured cancer we would not include your biography until it was verifiable and published in reliable sources. This deletion is not an attack on your character or your importance, just that a biography on you should not be included in an encyclopedia. kotepho 12:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seconding Kotepho. Wikipedia's goal is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. One of the consequences of this is that autobiography is discouraged, per <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, as inherently unverifiable. As noted above, you do not seem to have been covered in any of the traditional media sources that would tend to show you had achieved notariety.

<dd>To bring up a specific issue on the verifiability, the article suggests that the FBI takes these theories on the anthrax mailings seriously. Can you offer any external source (like the FBI themselves) to confirm this?

<li><b>Comment</b> FBI has been badly burned by the Hatfill case, so it is understandably reluctant to identify a suspect in the anthrax mailings unless it has actually apprehended him and obtained a confession or rock-solid confirmation. Not likely with Jdey. However, there is quite a bit of evidence, cited in my Mailer article, that FBI takes him very seriously. As I note, evidence and logic suggest that, more likely than not, he was indeed the Mailer. As for my article on "The Trojan Origin of Roman Civilization", you would do well to read it yourselves rather than to accept someone's dismissive opinion. But I certainly understand what you are talking about in terms of verifiability. It is undoubtedly true that my work has not been covered in the traditional media. According to that criterion, my bio article does not belong in Wikipedia. So I will delete the article myself. Best wishes. Kenneth J.
