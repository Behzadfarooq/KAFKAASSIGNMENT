<li><b>Keep</b>. It would help matters if nominators could adhere to some standard of accuracy. The article is less than seven months old so it cannot have gone for nine months without expansion. Looking at it I don't see any reason why it <i>should</i> especially need expansion. It's a perfectly good stub, useful in its current form. The nominator's claims about lack of notability are also misplaced; there is no consensus on notability criteria apply schools; many people class public schools as inherently notable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:39, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

It has come to my attention that <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> is attempting to pack the vote by soliciting votes solely on the talk pages of people he believes will vote to delete. Rather than get into a sterile voting war by emulating this disgraceful and unwikilike campaign, I will simply register my disapproval here while noting that I intend to dispute deletion on <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> on these grounds, should Gateman's underhand activities appear to influence the vote unduly. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:30, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Disputing the vote on those grounds is absolutely absurd, not to mention indicative of being a sore loser. Gateman isn't influencing anyone's vote, he's simply bringing it to other Wikipedian's attention. If he chooses to inform those more inclined than not to vote delete, that's his prerogative. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:33, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Feel free to. If it goes to <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> I will dispute the keep on on the grounds that there is an organzied group (<a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Votes_for_deletion_archive_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Schools_93a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Schools</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">User:GRider/Schoolwatch</a>) advocating and advertising a "keep" vote on no merit contained in this and many other articles.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:53, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The two things are unequal. Anybody can watch schoolwatch,whether he intends to vote delete or keep. There is no electioneering. Here, on the other hand, as one of those solicited says herself, was a case where you went to a past delete voter and asked him if he'd vote delete. You only went to the people you thought would vote the way you wanted. Schoolwatch is public and doesn't go around people's talk pages soliciting votes. I don't think this article will be deleted, however, even with your vote packing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gateman and I have reached an agreement on this; we are both focussing our efforts on schoolwatch, which has been edited (and should continue to be edited) to remove anything that might be described as advocacy of either deletion or keeping of listed schools. The archive will continue to be updated but predictions will no longer be made. The parent page has had pro-keep wording removed. We both think this is better than each setting up competing pages that would duplicate effort. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:37, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tony and I have come to an agreement. We've NPOVed <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Votes_for_deletion_archive_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive</a> and suggest everyone visit <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Schools_93a8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Schools</a> for a neutral stance on the issue or or I suggest <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_BEEFSTEW_8c5d.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW">HERE</a> for a great suggestion on how to treat school articles fairly and impartially when you vote.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:44, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually I don't endorse BEEFSTEW (which you link to above) as "fair and impartial". I agree that it makes a reasonable case for the particular form that it advocates, but that form is not the only form of good school article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:44, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Eventualism is not something I believe in on this site either. Many articles are incapable of being worthwhile even if they were on here for 50 years.

<ul>
<li>The claim that it has not improved over the last nine (or seven) months is simply false. I expanded the article yesterday, and there's room for a good deal more work to be done. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 06:48, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And you've done a good job with what there is. But none of it's notable. The only claim to fame this school has is that it exists. If that is "keep" critera then why don't I have my own article about me. I exist and I serve my community. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 07:17, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I take issue with is the fact that some people have been voting to delete for the "reasons" that the article hasn't been improved and isn't expandable. Both of those claims are demonstrably false, but the votes based on misinformation continue. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactitious_db8d.html" title="User:Factitious">Factitious</a> 01:51, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It's clear that you're all arguing apples and oranges. Some people think that school articles should only exist if the school in question is in some way distinguished from other schools; others think most types of school are distinguished enough in themselves, as public institutions, to be notable.</li>
<li>On eventualism, I have to say that in my view the whole Wikipedia project is a triumphant vindication of the principle that great things can be built in small, almost infinitessimal steps. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:46, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is why we need an official guideline or policy established for schools. The two sides will never agree. We need Wikipedia as a whole to set the criteria one way or the other because there obviously is no true consensus right now as most school votes seem to be going 50-50 or close to it. While that may be enough to keep most articles, it's not consensus. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If there is no agreement, how can we have a schools policy? In general I think it's fair to say that school discussions have been going more like 55/45 against delete for some time now (with particularly interesting articles getting 60/40 and more). I think it's quite possible that there could be substantial change in the long term future, and if this happens then we can talk about a schools policy. Meanwhile it's probably a bad idea to list schools articles for deletion; it's much, much easier to just clean them up. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:18, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aaron, I'm basing my comment on <b>sixteen weeks</b> with hardly a single school article deletion, despite there having been over 150 school VfDs. I think I'm on pretty firm ground here. It's accurate. Nominate a few more preschools, perhaps, but I don't think it makes sense to put yourself through all that effort while the situation is as it is presently. That's intended to be helpful. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:02, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Whilst I don't want to be spammed with a VfD reminder for every VfD I've ever voted on in the past, I wasn't <i>that</i> offended I received a solicitation, and viewed it more as a good faith human watchlist at work. If it become routine though, I'd probably leave in frustration&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 05:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And just when we thought we'd put the solicitation thing to rest above. Someone goes and steps over the line again. I propose this VfD be closed and it be relisted again as I believe that this VfD's vote is entirely tainted (due in part to me and now <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a>). <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 06:00, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think this is bad for Wikipedia no matter who is doing it. <b>I've asked Yuckfoo to join our voluntary agreement not to engage in electioneering.</b></dd>
<dd>I propose that this VfD be left to run its course and the closing administrator (who of course will not be anyone who voted on it) will be perfectly capable of making his mind up whether it's better for Wikipedia to let it stand or relist it.</dd>
<dd>Personally I see nothing to be gained over relisting a single article, though I would not oppose an early relisting of this particular article <i>after this VfD is closed</i>, if it is kept in this particular situation. I would also support an appeal on <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> if it is deleted, though I would not make one in the light of recent events.</dd>
<dd>What we do next is about more than one single article, it's about the kind of Wikipedia we want to have. I don't want one in which open vote warfare becomes a commonplace. Whilst I am convinced that such techniques, if practised by both sides, would marginally benefit inclusionism, the effects of such warfare would be to damage Wikipedia and I would not condone that. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:58, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
