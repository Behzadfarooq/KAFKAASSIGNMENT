<li>Or could it possibly be that the reason it doesn't have references is because it's absurd to believe that 98% of the items on the list are in any way specifically associated with Christmas? I mean come on. Look at the list. Australians specifically associate <i>vegetables</i> with Christmas? <i>Beer</i>? <i>Seafood</i> and <i>barbeque</i>? This isn't a list of Christmas foods, it's someone's Christmas dinner menu.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, it provides a nice, quick, organized way to figure out "Christmas" dishes by country (which considering the large number of dishes listed in the category, is almost a necessity), even if not everything is sourced yet. I am sick of people who put things up for deletion because "most of it isn't sourced". Sourcing takes time, and something unsourced now could have a cite less than an hour from now on this site. Further, if there are "questionable" dishes listed, what the hell is preventing anyone from a.) removing them from the from the list b.) digging up a cite to prove or disprove it or c.) tagging it with "citation needed"? That's what we HAVE <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags and their brethern for, folks. That's why we can EDIT these things. Having such a list is very, very useful (especially given that most individual Christmas dishes in the category for them are NOT listed by country, but by name). Does it need work? I'd say so. But worth deleting? Hardly. - <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">User:Runa27</a> not logged in</i>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>But the point is that almost everything on that list is <i>not</i> specifically a "Christmas dish." There is no point in asking for a cite that people eat turkey or cake or drink champagne at Christmas because it's common knowledge that people do in fact eat turkey and cake and drink champagne on Christmas. That something is eaten by some people at Christmas does not mean that it's a "Christmas dish." The list is based on a false premise. And as always, <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> is not a compelling argument for keeping. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Otto, this is another case among many (the current AfD discussion on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fat_actors.html" title="List of fat actors">List of fat actors</a> is another) where you have insisted that some outside authority or scientific measurement or the like must already have certified clear boundaries for a list. The absence of that kind of authority does not mean a list is indiscriminate, just that cultural lists have different inclusion criteria from, say the list of periodic elements or some category of flora or fauna. We all know that Christmas foods exist. We all should accept that there might be questions about the inclusion of some items on the list. Proper citation can regulate that well enough for our purposes, and if you don't believe that, you should explain why. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:06, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So far, I haven't seen the people in this AfD debate who are arguing <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> to be applying it <b>as deletion criteria</b> in the way that I understand that policy. See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> for details, especially <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">reasons not to delete</a>. Remember, an article that has X problem should usually be kept, so long as there is adequate reason to believe that X problem can be fixed to bring the article in line with Wikipedia policies. In deletion debates, it is not merely necessary to show that an article has a problem, it is also necessary to show that the problem is likely unfixable. In the case of attributions, the usual solution is either (1) add attributions or (2) tag the uncited material or (3) delete the uncited material. Christmas-oriented cooking is a huge subject, with each nation having its traditions, and dozens of cookbooks coming out each year. There's no particular reason to believe that this article is uncitable, not notable enough to exist, or too poorly defined to exist. All the reasons to delete the article that have been brought up so far are, in my opinion, article quality issues rather than deletion criteria, and could be solved within a few weeks at most if some talk page dialogues are started. Does it ever occur to you to bring up quality issues on the article talk pages before bringing an AfD? It really seems to me as if about three-fourths of your AfD nominations are a result of impatience with article quality, rather than being grounded in a thorough understanding of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a> and other policies. I know that policies can be interpreted in different ways by different people, but I do think your interpretation tends to be farther from the norm than usual. I really think it would help all of us if you made more use of <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Cleanup_ae6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">cleanup tags</a> and talk pages rather than doing what seems to me to be hasty AfDs. AfDs should be a last resort, except on articles that are clearly in risk of violating <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 03:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, you've already clearly demonstrated that despite your ability to link to various policies you have no faith in anyone else's ability to read them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I took another look at <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and nowhere does it say that simply because an article <b>hasn't</b> had enough sourcing that it therefore <b>must</b> go, and when I go to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> and look at "Problem with page ... [Item:] Can't verify information in article (e.g. article lacks source citations)" I see this under "Solution:" "Look for sources yourself and add citations for them to the article! Ask other editors for sources using the talk page and various citation request templates. If those don't work, come back here. If it is truly unverifiable, it may be deleted." Clearly, going first to AfD with an article problem is discouraged and actually working on an article that you've got quality problems with is encouraged. These quotations can be found under the section called "Problem articles where deletion may not be needed". I have every faith that you have the ability to read that policy and have read it. The question is, what's your reason for not applying it? Not a rhetorical question, but one that deserves a serious response. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the idea that this can't be sourced is absolutely ludicrous. For most Christmas-related food and drink you have to choose among too many sources. I get the impression "I don't like the subject" is the real argument here, based on what's been said. Deletion discussions should not be popularity contests. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> makes several excellent points. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, the real argument is and continues to be that having sources that say people sometmes eat one food or another on a specific holiday doesn't mean that the food itself is exclusively or even strongly associated with that holiday. Eating something on Christmas doesn't make it a "Christmas dish." I would not argue WP:DONTLIKEIT because I know that it is not a valid reason for deleting an article so I would appreciate it if you would address the actual arguments that I do make and not make stuff up. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As for the inclusion of items on the list that are not there, the nature of Wikipedia is such that anyone can edit articles to add nonsense. However, let's also not forget that anyone can edit articles to <i>remove</i> such additions. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:26, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per recent improvements and per arguments of Black Falcon and Noroton. There are distinctive nationalal and ethnic customs as to what foods and beverages are served at Christmas. It is a bogus argument to claim that something cannot be a "Christmas dish" if it is eaten at other times. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:31, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
