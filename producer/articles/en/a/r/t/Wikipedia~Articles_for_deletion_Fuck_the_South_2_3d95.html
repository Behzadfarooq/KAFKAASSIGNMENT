<li><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> performed the disputed close. It was listed on VfU, and garnered mostly "undelete" votes. <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> judged that there was consensus at VfU to undelete, so he undeleted the article himself.

<li><b>Keep</b>; this website is illustrative of the depth of the divide between red &amp; blue states after the 2004 election, and was immensely popular then.

<ul>
<li>Comment: This isn't about censoring an article because it deals with a profane Web site, it's about deleting an article due to the subject matter's lack of merit. The Web site (including its history) is just a non-notable stink bomb that is "illustrative" of very little other than how the Internet can be used for insignificant, run-of-the-mill, hate-filled tirades. By the way, its Alexa ranking (which, in my opinion, does count) has pretty well been bottom-of-the-bucket insignificant except for a week-long spike to so-so status after the elections (by no means "immensely popular"). In case anyone is interested, here's <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=r&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=r&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" rel="nofollow">a link to the Alexa page</a> comparing traffic to the site in question to Wikipedia.org over the past year. Wikipedia is the orange line. Fuckthesouth.com is the barely visible blip at the bottom of the chart during last November. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 00:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Specious argument. Compare ANY typical private website to Wikipedia over the past year and it'll be a tiny blip. Even many of the most notable and popular would be as well. Look <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=fuckthenorth.com&amp;y=t&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=fuckthenorth.com&amp;y=t&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" rel="nofollow">here</a> and you'll see that this was in the <i><b>top 5,000 web sites</b></i> shortly after the election. That IS notable and significant. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:58, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to call being in the top 5,000-traffic Web sites during one two-week period "notable and significant," well, I guess you're easily impressed. To me it's convincing evidence (as if any is needed) of the site's lack of notability. Using your reasoning, Wikipedia ought to have articles about all the other tens of thousand of Web sites that have at one time or another crossed the so-so 5,000 benchmark. Like I said, non-notable. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 06:36, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, now you want to discard Alexa since it's proven counter to the point you were trying to make when you brought it up. Fuck the South is notable not only because it was a top 5000 web site, but for the other reasons I've already posted here AND that it was a top 5000 site. Regarding your <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> about articles for other top 5000 sites; I never claimed that being top 5000 is the only claim to notability, in fact, the opposite is true. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 06:49, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I can't speak for anyone else, but my delete suggestion is based not on shock, but on expecting website articles to make it clear why the subject is significant. Personally, I have no problems with "undelicate" articles like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I <i>voted</i> in the previous afd after I posted a rather off-topic rebuttal to the subject web site (apologies again), but that included the question <b>"is notoriety the same thing as notability?"</b> which I consider to still be apropos and on topic. After I cooled off and reviewed the article and rebuttal sites on the web, I became the sole <i>Merge</i>, suggesting <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_state_vs._blue_state_divide.html#Polarization" title="Red state vs. blue state divide">Red_state_vs._blue_state_divide#Polarization</a> and <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_presidential_election_2004_5770.html#Election_controversy" title="US presidential election 2004">Election Controversy section of US Presidential Election 2004 article</a> as alternatives to provide some information regarding divisive elements in the US which I think is notable in appropriate article(s). I expressed that I preferred that to keeping it as separate article. I should have included that this was <i>not</i> a <i>keep</i> but <i>Delete</i> if not merged. <a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 00:22, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that AfD remains pretty much binary for the closer: a normal editor cannot merge what isn't kept, and you cannot compel the closer to read your mind to merge to your liking. I would suggest being bold and merging the content yourself next time, and if reverted, back down. If unreverted, you've improved Wikipedia, which is the goal of everyone here. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 04:32, 28 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I find an article that makes sense to merge instead of nominating for AfD, I'll do it in a heartbeat; if it already on AfD, I generally leave it alone until after close of the discussion. I just looked at <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> and found the indication that it was ok to do so, but the request not to blank and not to redirect are in there as well.

<li>I think it's humor, not hatred. Extreme, frustration-based humor that reflects the depth of the political divide at that point in time. Keep in mind that politics wasn't always this divisive, and won't always be this divisive. It rises and falls over the course of decades. This is a valid, interesting, and unmistakable marker of this cycle's peak (I <i>hope</i> that was the peak!) <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:18, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Unfocused. (<b>NB:Unfocused's rationale is the sole ground for my vote</b> -- what follows is a public explanation of why I have userfied this content, and why I take offense at the notion that this is simply called a "hate site" by some.) And, as a native Southerner, personally <b>endorse</b> the site. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 04:32, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is notice that I have kept the content of this page in my user space; anticipating deletion, I pledge it will <b>never</b> be recreated as an article by me. This website was one of several things that prevented my suicide last year, so perservation of the entry is a personal matter for me. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And lastly, I find some humor in the number of "kill/burn the hate site" remarks. We who hate the South hate it for its hatred of others (like say, historically, blacks, gays, Catholics, liberals, the disabled, pacifists, intellectuals, internationalists, anti-capitalists, and "Yankees", some of which hatred indisputably persists.) Objectively, of course, this is just pot-calling-kettle and kettle-calling-pot. But, for devout Bluesies, comme moi, saying fuck the South is like saying fuck Nazi Germany. I can't say, objectively, that the South is evil; but, I can say, having lived there (in Virginia, Mississippi, and North Carolina) and having suffered scorn and violence for the first 18 years of my life, the values which make the South distinctive are values I hate as passionately as I hate Nazism. So it is for many people. And, yes, this is a soapbox, but I take offense at the suggestion that this is a "mere" hate site -- the question is intensely complicated for those of us who have <i>lynched grandfathers</i>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:45, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>My personal history was given to explain why I userfied the content (in a later comment).

<li>Don't go around mocking other people's votes, for Jesus' sake. Some people think this is notable enough, others don't. A vote of delete on an article such as this is not necessarily censorship, it could be just a belief that this is non-notable.
