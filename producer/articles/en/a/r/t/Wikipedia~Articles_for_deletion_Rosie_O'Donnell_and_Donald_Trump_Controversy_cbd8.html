<p>Non-Notable. How can this possibly be considered encyclopedic? Their spat is hardly a controversy, it's a feud and this page is all "he said, she said". There have been much bigger celebrity feuds and the only reason this one is noted is because both are among the most ridiculed "celebrities". There's no Tom Cruise controversy page, no Brad-Angelina-Aniston controversy page, no South Park and Barbara Streisand controversy. The page creator cited the Mel Gibson DUI incident when defending this page, but at least the Mel Gibson page is well cited and well written. It also has a much larger scope and affected his entire career, this feud will be over or forgotten in a month. This article has templates for not citing references, not being wikified and not being neutral. This feud is only "big" because the talk shows make fun of it and the tabloid news shows (like ET) make a big deal of it. I'm probably going to end up nominating this page for deletion, which I don't like doing, but this page is pointless. It also sets a dangerous precedent, because if this feud can become it's own page, why not all insignificant celebrity gossip? -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 15:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator, and the fact that Rosie and Donald are just throwing insults at each other like 3rd graders.

<li><b>comment</b>-On the January 8th edition of Monday Night Raw, the Rosie and Donald contreversy was paroradied by Trump's friend Vince McMahon, with two imposters posing as Rosie and Donald fought in a match which resulted in Donald Trump winning. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.160.216.254_3294.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.160.216.254">68.160.216.254</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.160.216.254.html" title="User talk:68.160.216.254">talk</a>) 21:22, 13 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - per creator - You don't know where this controversy will lead, so you can't judge this article yet until the dispute between them is over. Scorpion noted the Mel Gibson DUI incident because it affected his entire career. You do not know yet how this feud will affect the careers of either Rosie or Trump. Trump has threatened a lawsuit. Is a protracted lawsuit trivial?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You cite WP:V and WP:RS issues. But these become fixed over time. You don't DELETE articles because of WP:V or WP:RS issues without giving them time to be fixed. This article was created one day ago and you're already passing judgement. I agree that if within two weeks these statements aren't cited, it should be deleted. But you've only given it 24 hours. Was the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_of_Saddam_Hussein_8fcd.html" title="Execution of Saddam Hussein">Execution of Saddam Hussein</a> nominated for deletion one day after it was created because it perhaps had WP:V problems? Citation problems can also be resolved over the course of time, and yet <i>it's gotta be deleted because within 24 hours people didn't fix it</i>.</dd>
<dd>Non-notable? "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> is not subjective. Subjective evaluations are not relevant for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations, such as: "never heard of this", "an interesting article", "topic deserves attention", "not famous enough", "very important issue", "popular", "I like it", "only of interest to [some group]", etc." I cite Scorpion's comment above: "this page is pointless". To YOU! This feud isn't entirely trivial. It could affect the careers of Rosie O'Donnell, Donald Trump, and Barbara Walters in different ways. Rosie could be fired from <i>The View</i> largely because of controversies like this. Is this notable? Donald Trump's credibility could suffer because his comments and behavior have been utterly childish. Please consider the arguments made here and your own bias. -- <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo44_3f3e.html" title="User:Rollo44">Rollo44</a> 18:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I can't believe your comparing a silly spat between Rosie and Trump to a major world event like Saddam's hanging... And what makes this tiff more important than the thousands of pointless celebrity feuds out there like Letterman Vs. O'Relly, Elton John Vs. Madonna, Starr Jones Vs. The view, etc. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 18:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not comparing this spat with Saddam's execution in terms of significance. I simply used it as an example of an article that wasn't immediately nominated for deletion because of disputed neutrality. And I never said this tiff was more important than other celebrity feuds. -- <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo44_3f3e.html" title="User:Rollo44">Rollo44</a> 01:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Again, I never argued that other feuds or celebrity controversies are less important or should not have a page of their own.

<li>When I used the term crystalballism I was refering to your rational to keep the article. For example, you stated the possibility of Rosie being fired from the view. My agrument was the we should not keep the article based on what we think may happen in the future. The article may not be crystalballism but the rational certainly was. --70.48.108.229 23:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would nominate such an article for deletion because it would be patently subjective. Furthermore, you are implying that this article is inherently subjective which it is not. I would have no problem with an article such as Hairstyles of Celebrities.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yup, Agent 86 is right on the button. The media coverage bugs me more than the stupidity of the story itself. <a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrewBay_fcf1.html" title="User:KrewBay">KrewBay</a> 02:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is an encyclopedia, not a current affairs show, and not Entertainment Tonight. No disrespect to the article's creator, but I don't think a lot of people will really care about this dummy spit between Rosie and the Don in a few years. It's perfectly appropriate to mention this in their individual bios, but I don't see the need for a page which just deals with this incident. We could probably write a large article about Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's off-again, on-again friendship, but that wouldn't be appropriate for Wikipedia - it'd just duplicate what's in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Richie_40d3.html" title="Nicole Richie">Nicole Richie</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 06:25, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate your sensitivity. I am not arguing that this feud is important in the large scheme of things. However, Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump have in fact acted childishly and I believe their words should be duly noted and recorded. I don't see how adding celebrity information reduces Wikipedia's value or credibility if that information is cited and accurate. I am not opposed to a Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes Wedding article, nor am I opposed to an article on Paris Hilton's Internet Video. I do not care about this stuff. But I am taking a stand because people have <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">every right</a> to construct accurate articles and summaries about these human events - as well as analysis on what this tells us about our popular culture. Those who think these things are not important are not forced to visit and read such articles. - <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo44_3f3e.html" title="User:Rollo44">Rollo44</a> 02:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete.</b> Does not need nor require a full-blown article, as this melodramatic argument is mostly about "he said/she said" babble. This entry should be incorporated in respective articles for both Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump (and maybe even in the article about Barbara Walters) in the same manner as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Jones_7169.html#The_View_and_other_television_work" title="Star Jones">Star Jones</a> episode at The View and the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosie_O%27Donnell_27e1.html#Clay_Aiken_.2F_Kelly_Ripa_Controversy" title="Rosie O'Donnell">Clay Aiken</a> spat. This info can also be incorporated into the article about Barbara Walters, since both the Trump-O'Donnell and the O'Donnell-Jones-Walters spats allude to misrepresentation on her (Walters) part. lwalt 08:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's alot of incorporation into seperate articles; why not have one article that documents the whole thing? IF the event is worthy of inclusion on three seperate Wiki articles, then it should be worthy of its own article. I think that the controversy should only be a blurb on the seperate pages with a link to this main page, much like it is now.Rikkwj 03:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It's interesting that the article on Donald Trump gives only a passing reference to this, while the article on Rosie has a whole "controversies" section. If anything, Trump has gone way over the top, and his article should have more information about his overblown antics, while the article on O'Donnell could tone down the whole "controversies" section. As for having a unique article? Unless something spectacular happens (and it well could -- if one decided to sue the other, or if there was a major backlash against Trump, for example), it's probably unnecessary. "Celebrities" are not inherently interesting or encyclopaedia-worthy, despite the fawning obesiance given them by the media. Indeed, the most interesting and useful angle such an article might take would violate every Wikipedia rule: Trumps rants are clearly misogynist and homophobic. He calls O'Donnell an arrogant bully while taking every opportunity to bully her, and being famous for being arrogant on a world-class scale. He calls her mean while being famously mean, and so on. We can't say it in an article, but that's what's really fascinating about this feud, not that they are well-known people or the fact that they're feuding per se. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 19:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the arguments against keeping this article are very subjective. Who is to judge what is worthy, relevant or useful? Isn't the point of Wikipedia to give people a forum to document (in an objective and scholarly fashion) topics that are not covered in traditional, scholarly encyclopedias? If this article is unworthy, then wouldn't the article on the Mel Gibson DUI incident be unworthy? What about the lengthy and exhaustive list of hip-hop feuds? In the big scheme of things these articles document events that are just as meaningless as the Rosie-Donald feud. Why aren't those articles marked for deletion? The fact is that this is a significant event this year for many people that is being covered and documented by major news outlets. Also, why integrate it into two seperate existing articles when the story involves three different people (Walters, Trump and O'Donnell) with a wide variety of quotes and letters and such. Having said all of this, this article does need substantial clean up and thorough citations.Rikkwj 00:06, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

Your statement "who knows what this will lead to" acknowledges that it is <b>not</b> important <b>yet,</b> and is a reason for deletion, not a reason for keeping. If nobody knows yet whether the feud is important, it should not have an article yet. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:41, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is only <i>one</i> argument for keeping the article. And as noted, it is not very strong. However, the feud <i>is</i> real, verifiable, ongoing, and a subject unto itself. - <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo44_3f3e.html" title="User:Rollo44">Rollo44</a> 23:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
