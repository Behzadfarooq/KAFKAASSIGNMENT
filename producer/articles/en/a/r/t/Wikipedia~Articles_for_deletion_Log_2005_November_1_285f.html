<li><b>Comment</b> Short of 'phoning Fine Gael I can't see if <i>Martin Enda Marren</i> exists and/or is the same as <i>Enda Marren</i>. The latter does exist and I suggest I expand that entry slightly (see eg info from his old school in the link). That names his practice as <i>Enda E Marren</i> which argues a little against <i>Martin Enda Marren</i> as being his full name, but it's not conclusive (could be his father or something). Then <i>Martin Enda Marren</i> can be put to rest. If anyone wants to search add <i>Fine Gael</i> which is his political party to the search string! <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:vCHy-GnI1G8J:www.rockwellunion.com/news/news_people.htm++martin+%22Enda+Marren%22+%22Fine+Gael%22&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:vCHy-GnI1G8J:www.rockwellunion.com/news/news_people.htm++martin+%22Enda+Marren%22+%22Fine+Gael%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 05:10, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Martin Enda Marren was the name used in the first sentence of the article by the anonymous poster who created the article. That is why I moved the page to that name and made the redirect.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not convinced it's that notable.

<dd>If you declare that you withdraw the nomination, and no one comes in demanding that the article be deleted, I'm sure an admin type will come along fairly soon and just quietly close the AfD, remove the AfD tag and we'll be done with it... I think that as a matter of principle, it's best to let an AfD be officially closed once it's been officially opened.

<li>Well, the article doesn't actually establish notability at all; this is a classic "average professor" situation, and it's obvious that she's no more notable than any other professor out there.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The "average professor" case is not one where we should apply A7 speedy delete. That is applicable when the article makes no claim of notability about its subject. The article states&#160;:"Paulin Tay Straughan is a sociologist working at the National University of Singapore (NUS). She is the vice-dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences(FASS), and also serves as the deputy head of the sociology department at FASS. She has a PhD in sociology and is an associate professor." That is an assertion of notability. It does not establish notability but that is a different case. I would vote to delete as the article does not state what Ms Straughan has contrbuted to the discipline but it is not a speedy. Further, my vote could easily change if someone could refer to her research. <s><b>Delete</b></s></li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> It is <s>almost</s>not an A7/nn-bio. More signficantly, per G7, the user requested its speedy deletion *before* anybody else edited it. Even after that point, there's been little revision. Logic dictates we let people speedy delete their self-admitted mistakes. If this person is really notable (I doubt) then somebody will likely create a fresh new article. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:17, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment. This article is eligible for a G7 speedy. However, it does not come within a bull's roar of an A7 non-notable deletion and should not be considered to be a precedent for any other "average professor" articles. As always, we should be very careful not to delete notable people because their current article isn't up to scratch. <b>Speedy Delete</b> under G7. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 10:28, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Spencer himself agrees that I do not merit my own link. However, I strongly argue that www.trikepilot.com does. If one is interested in learning about ultralight trike flying, there is not one other single source on the internet sharing as much information about the sport or as much multimedia for free. Please feel free to suggest how one could otherwise provide this information to the wikipedia without uploading 5Gb or more of videos and content to the wikipedia server? As far as the link is concerned for Spencer Forman, feel free to kill it... that was a sandbox mistake that got out into the wild and I cannot figure out how to get rid of it. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">Spineight</span>→<a href="../../../s/p/i/User_talk%7ESpineight_5791.html" title="User talk:Spineight"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 05:52, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>This complaint states that the entry in question is an "advertisement for a non-notable company."</b></dd>
<dd><b>To address this I have demonstrated below::</b></dd>
<dd><b>(1)What an advertisment is...</b></dd>
<dd><b>(2)How this article is no different from similar, existing articles which could under the definition applied also be construed as advertisements.</b></dd>
<dd><b>(3)What makes something notable...</b></dd>
<dd><b>(4)How the subject of this entry is "notable."</b></dd>
<dd><b>(5)Therefore, this entry should be approved and included in <i>Wikipedia</i>.</b></dd>
<dd>(1)<b>WHAT IS AN ADVERTISEMENT?</b></dd>
<dd>source:: www.dictionary.com</dd>
<dd><b>Advertise</b>: To make public announcement of, especially to proclaim the qualities or advantages of (a product or business) so as to increase sales.</dd>
<dd>(2) Does this article aim only to "proclaim the qualities or advantages of 'stripped art' so as to increase sales"? No.</dd>
<dd>It describes an organization objectively, but does not promote the organization.</dd>
<dd>It describes the organization in a manner similar to that in which Wikipedia describes <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a>. How can one then allow Playboy to have a Wikipedia entry, but not <i>Stripped Art?</i></dd>
<dd>(3) Notability?</dd>
<dd><b>WHAT MAKES SOMETHING NOTABLE?</b></dd>
<dd>source:: www.dictionary.com</dd>
<dd><i>adj</i> <b>Notable</b>: <b>Worthy of note or notice</b>; remarkable:: notable beauty; sled dogs that are notable for their stamina.</dd>
<dd>This definition does not say that something is "notable" only because thousands of people know about it already...</dd>
<dd>But it does say the thing must be "worthy of notice."</dd>
<dd>Now, the fact that thousands of people already know about something could make it notable. But not necessarily. Millions of people are aware that Brad Pitt left Jennifer Anniston. Is it notable? Is it worthy of putting in Wikipedia? No.</dd>
<dd>Then we need a different test. Let's look to the definition of notable, then.</dd>
<dd><b>Worthy of notice.</b> What makes something worthy of notice? Well, why do we have Wikipedia in the first place? To educate through informing.</dd>
<dd>What does this article do? It informs people about a unique business and a unique business concept that yes, thousands of people do already know about. But that shouldn't make it notable.</dd>
<dd>Then why is it notable? Because the business model can be applied to funding other kinds charities. There is a method, and method can be adopted by others. <b>That is "worthy of notice."</b> And a lot worthier than a great deal of the content already on this site.</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - unlike the other two (Tracie Cullum, Daniel McGann), Yates may actually have been a racist murder; I'm not sure if this justifies Yates himself having an entry. If the murder itself is notable, maybe it should be mentioned somewhere else, not in an article about Yates, who is otherwise non-notable. Not sure where that somewhere else would be - some UK race-relations article? Not sure either whether it is notable. It may be too recent to say. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 11:01, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A Google suggests he died a year ago this week. BBC News Online has just two entries, both on local pages, nothing national. I'd say that a year with no more news, plus the lack of a national story on the UK's most comprehensive news site suggests that the story is over and the unfortunate Mr Yates is a non-notable - <i>just another statistic</i>, sadly. <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">●R</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="black">EDVERS</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="black">HELLO</font></a><font color="red">●</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Redvers_261d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Redvers"><font color="gray">EMAIL</font></a><font color="red">●</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers"><font color="silver">DOINGS</font></a></sup> 11:24, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is still a list of random historical or pop-culture "references" in Pokémon, and is a collection of indiscriminate trivia. There's no good place to merge it, and no real use for it as a standalone article. The Pokémon Wikiproject, as far as I can tell, hasn't shown much interest in fiddling with this list of trivia, and other than some vandalism patrol and bot changes, it hasn't been touched since the last AFD.</p>
<p>Please note that this is <i>not</i> a merge target, and deleting it will not result in a bunch of Pokémon stubs popping up.</p>
<p>For those interested, this has been on AFD twice before.

<li>I listed this for AFD a month and a half ago; Apostrophe listed it a second time a week later, and I would have advised him not to. Both times it has received a majority of delete votes; the last AFD had a 2d:1k ratio, with several of the keeps because of the too-quick relist.<br />

<li>Going a month without a major edit is hardly a reason to delete a substantial article which survived two very recent deletion attempts. If you really want it deleted, unlist it and try again in 6 months. 3 AfDs in two months is completely unacceptable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:29, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Both times it barely survived AFD for reasons unrelated to the quality of the article (a mistaken belief that it was a merge target, a much-too-soon relist). Both times it received a majority of delete votes. The only relevant Wikiproject has no interest in doing anything with this.

<ul>
<li>Here's two for a start: (a) AfD now averages some 150+ entries a day, and is more than bloated enough without re-noms of things twice kept in less than two months (b) repeatedly re-nominating an article hurts its chance for natural development and cleanup, as editors are unlikely to work extensively to cleanup something that gets an AfD nomination every couple weeks. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:15, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Was this an actual cultural reference, or someone picking up the merest coincidence with something else? Meowth's ability to speak is reminiscent of Garfield? Even if the script writers confirmed these things, I still don't think Pokemon episodes should have every facet which deals with real life in a article. I mean, one of the episodes contains a samurai?

Relisting a deletion because new information has come up or because the original vote was based on errors strikes me as entirely approprate; but if deletion fails because its relisting was too soon, please do remember to list it again as soon as enough time has passed to dispel that concern. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 04:06, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think "Individual class; not notable" is a statement of fact followed by an assumption; the assumption might be a natural one but I think it may be mistaken in this case. 6.001 is not just a class but a particular course design and as the article mentions, the design of this specific course has been actually copied by other universities. I think voters should be careful to make sure they are assessing the notability of <i>this</i> core class at <i>this</i> highly famous and influential university, and not the notability of a generic class at a generic university. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:44, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not the perfect article, but I assure other editors that encyclopedic writing can be done about this subject.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article asserts notability, and such is demonstrated. Come on; it's a notorious elementary programming class at MIT. Sounds notable.

<li>But surely if it has been copied by other colleges (it's ownly potential claim of notability, as far as I can tell), <i>they</i> didn't keep this title. And (not that I know much about it) I have a hard time believing classes at MIT <i>only</i> go by numbers. When a father asks his son what classes he's taking, does he get the response "7.989, 45.997, 3.141592, and 77.771."

<li>I don't think it's appropriate to ask "would the father of a student know what 6.001 is?" I don't think my father knows what <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elias_omega_coding.html" title="Elias omega coding">Elias omega coding</a> is but that doesn't mean it isn't notable among people who <i>are</i> versed in that field. In the same vein, I'm afraid I don't see why the fact that those people who know it know it by the number seems to be classed as an argument for its non-notability; is <a href="../../../r/u/_/RU_486_c721.html" title="RU 486">RU 486</a> non-notable because its designation is just letters and numbers? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:44, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question isn't whether the father would know what it meant, but what is a class actually called beyond a number designation. Surely when anyone discusses a class, they use some sort of descriptive words. Even the universal "101" has something describing what exactly it is you'll be studying at an introductory level. Other schools that teach this class must use a different title. Whenever I looked through a course catalog at any of the colleges I've taken classes at, I looked at the titles of classes, not just a bunch of numbers, because those meant nothing, and mean nothing without anoither context. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:04, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My reading of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> is that there is no concensus and will not be in the short-term. We can only agree to differ, recognise that schools aren't going to get deleted, and move on to using our limited time on work that will be fruitful like spam, nonsense ... So I believe that real schools should not at present be nominated - verifiability and not notability is the only currently-workable school criterion. In an ideal world, I think we'd assess each school on its merits but I don't see that happening any time soon. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 18:41, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Contains unverified claims of previously-unheard-of "Internet Pioneer" being "one of the primary drivers behind the modern computer revolution" and having made a decision that resulted in "makers of IBM clones and Microsoft" becoming "the standard". The talk page includes comments by his "old systems analyst" apparently trying to contact him, but it is unclear whether these are actual attempts at communication or attempts at giving the article credibility, written by the creator of the page himself (check the history of the article and the Talk page and look at the writing style). The article on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> contains an entire paragraph on Mr. Clark's alleged achievements, which claims that he had a pivotal role in making Intel processors "the standard". The person may very well be real but the "achievements" listed are completely unsubstantiated, so the article is at best a fraudulent vanity page (which should be removed) and at worst entirely false (in which case the page should also be removed and the personal computer article fixed). Google searches on Mr. Clark only turn up his resumé in the Google cache and a bunch of mirrors of his Wikipedia page. The likelihood that this is just a hoax is extremely high.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to emphasize that there are three possibilities. <b>Scenario 1:</b> The information in the article is correct. It is claimed that a heretofore unknown person has had a hand in creating the Arpanet/Internet <i>and</i> played a crucial role in making PCs, Intel processors and Microsoft the industry standard. This is in violation of the "no original research" policy: absolutely no sources have been mentioned, unless the "contact attempts" on the Talk page are considered to be circumstantial evidence in favor of these claims. It appears to be extremely unlikely that the claims could be true. We should assume that this information does not check out, and the burden of proof should rest on those who claim that it does. <b>Scenario 2:</b> The article is correct for the most part but the information on Mr. Clark being an Internet pioneer is incorrect. In this case, the page fulfills the definition of a "WP vanity page" and should be removed. <b>Scenario 3:</b> This article is nonsense and should be removed. — In light of these three possibilities, I fail to see how this article could be retained unless someone steps forward and provides extraordinary evidence for the extraordinary claims made therein. Alskdj 21:55, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment 2</b> Upon closer examination, it seems that the major contributions to the content of this article have been made by a single person with two different userids plus one anonymous IP address, posing as several persons (see the Talk page history and work backwards from there if you're interested in the details or check out <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Albert.clark_dced.html" title="Special:Contributions/Albert.clark">Special:Contributions/Albert.clark</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Allynnc_672b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Allynnc">Special:Contributions/Allynnc</a> and the contributions by 209.22.221.73). Several dubious things stand out. To name just one example, a critical comment has been removed from the Talk page entirely and the Talk page has been edited in an incoherent manner, apparently to make the article seem more convincing. Furthermore, the talk pages related to these users and to the article in question are a complete mess and contain numerous claims that are patently bogus. For example, see <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllynnc_9145.html" title="User talk:Allynnc">User_talk:Allynnc</a> where it is claimed that Mosaic (the web browser) existed as early as the late 1980s. Anyone who looks at the history of this article and the histories plus talk pages of the users involved should see that there's something fishy going on here. Alskdj 22:30, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. I worked in this field from 1984-89, in ARPANET/MILNET design, testing, evaluation of equipment, network architecture, etc., on several government contracts including (mostly) the Air Force. I vaguely remember the name, but don't think of him as any sort of major figure in the field. I think the early history regarding network efforts and AUTODIN are probably correct, but to be frank, they do not really represent notable or widely-known developments in the field. I could probably write articles about at least half a dozen people involved in such projects -- myself included -- that were early implementors of network technology in DOD, but I don't believe that they necessarily warrant Wikipedia articles. And some editors appear to have wandered into the weeds of mythology here, too. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:59, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Although I've heard Japanese intestines (three feet longer than the Western intestine) cited as an example of Nihonjin-ron, that article doesn't seem to be the one I remember. Thanks, though. I think the information belongs in Wikipedia somewhere, and it seems more widespread than the minister cited in the article. The question is, where does it belong.

An article is not needed. I also remark that the two facts used to disprove the claim of Japanese diversity (short time for evolution and same diet of other people) do not in fact disprove the claim. They only disprove that the difference is due to evolution and not, for example, to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_drift.html" title="Genetic drift">genetic drift</a>.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> Interesting storm this. I feel the issue of Japanese intestines is important as a testable and refutable element of Nihonjinron. The same goes for the importance of blood as a social signifier in modern Japan; this ideas was originally mooted in Nazi Germany and is one of the remaining legacies of the Axis alliance. While I do not think this topic should unduly impinge into the medial explanation of intestines, it is important to hold the ideology of Nihonjinron up to a more public mirror. And Wikipedia is perfect for that. The consensus seems to be that the article should stay but should be more appropriately housed. The size of the final article would be largely determined by the information provided by contributors familiar with the debate and who could, in accordance with Wikipedia's policy, enlighten the rest of us and. mpre importantly perhaps, chauvinistic Japanese who believe in unscientific fables like this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 222.229.236.136 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_222.229.236.136_c471.html" title="Special:Contributions/222.229.236.136">contribs</a>).</small></s></li>

<p>I don't think the article should be deleted, but added as a sub-page to nihonjinron.

<p>Background and aims. Colonic diverticula are located predominantly on the right-side in patients in Japan, in contrast to those in Europe and the United States. This study compared the etiology of right-sided diverticula in Japan with that of left-sided diverticula in the West.</p>
<p>Methods. A literature review was conducted from 1950 to 2001 using Medline and Index Medicus.</p>
<p>Results. Diverticula occur predominantly in the right-sided colon (over 70%) in Japanese patients, and even among Japanese who emigrate, in contrast with the diverticula in Western. Incidence (detection) rates of colon diverticula have rapidly increased in Japan since World War II with the increased dietary fiber intake. The increased detection rate over time is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and it corresponds to the distribution of dietary fiber intake. Birth cohort analysis suggests that right-sided diverticula is affected more by environmental factors than other types. Furthermore, the significant relationship of right-sided diverticula with intraluminal pressure in Japan is similar to that of left-sided diverticula in the West, and the pathological feature of these diverticula are similar.</p>
<p>Conclusion. The etiology of right-sided diverticula in Japan (and perhaps also other Mongolian peoples) is very similar to that of left-sided diverticula in the West. The location may represent a difference in morphology of the large intestine between Mongolians (including Japanese), and Westerners, rather than environmental differences. <i><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mutantfrog (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mutantfrog_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mutantfrog">contribs</a>).</small></i></p>

If nothing else, this belief deserves at least being mentioned under nihonjinron. --Matt Dioguardi (first edit by Matt Dioguardi (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matt_Dioguardi_877d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matt Dioguardi">contribs</a>) -- Paolo Liberatore&#160;(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">Talk</a>) 11:06, 4 November 2005 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> with due respect to the previous discussant, citing Yahoo! Japan and other Japanese search engines as "verifiable sources" to the assertion that many agree with the minister of agriculture, is weak and suspect, and should not be used as a litmus test for encyclopedia entries. By entering the same keyword searches for "American," "British" or "Western" intestinal length one gets 276,000 hits, 121,000 hits, and 161,000 hits, respectively. Do these relatively high number of hits suddenly tell us that Americans, British, or Westerns generally believe their intestines to be longer? Of course not. In fact, these numbers tell us nothing at all except that the keywords appear somewhere on the pages in question. A more convincing (and verifiable) source would be a formal nationwide survey, or poll, or series of public statements by elected officials or columnists that explicitly agree with the assertion. Anything else is baseless supposition. <b>Delete</b> per JFW and Paolo Liberatore. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.5.144.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.5.144.3_4d87.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.5.144.3">contribs</a>) 05:34, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><s><b>keep</b> I typed in "British intestin" and " Western intestin" and got no hits on yahoo search. This indicates, as has been pointed out, that the difference is a POV in Japan but not the West. The point about the claim, which most of us suspect has no factual basis, is it is statistically testable. It is, like the idea of blood being a significant signifier, widely adhered to in Japan. Comprehensive encyclopedias must cover modern myths as well as more ancient ones and show us where they can lead. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 222.229.233.242 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_222.229.233.242_916e.html" title="Special:Contributions/222.229.233.242">contribs</a>) 06:25, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</small></s></li>

<li>Comment on Comment: The gentleman, who may be a lady for all we know, did not misspell intestine but instead typed in intestin to catch some other words such as intestinal. The gentleman also made no conclusions but instead pointed out how ideas like these are linked to other (politically inspired) myths.

<li><s><b>Comment to Keep</b>: This article raises a number of interesting hypotheses, none of which have been significantly/scientifically proved or disproved anywhere and some of which can lead to nasty conclusions in line with the Nihonjonron/Nazi thesis/theses. There is an eminently testable hypothesis here: that there is a significant difference in length between the intestines of one "people" and those of (all) others. The idea that the intestines of the Japanese are different is used to prop up the idea, widely held in Japan, that the Japanese are different and somehow superior and special. As part of this process, the idea's apologists come up with figures comparing the relative lengths of the intestines of all kinds of animals, in some Japanese version of The Ascen]]t of Man. In targeting this social, "pseudo-fascist" myth, we end up having to address a wide number of issues, including the lengths of intestines of humans and all other animals. Wikipedia is the perfect place to pool our common, if limited knowledge together in a positive way and not to get bogged down in pedantry or cheap irrelevant shots/deletions.

<p>Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. The thought of how California might be called if it ever was to become independent is very interesting and entertaining, but imo it is not Wikipedia material. It would in my view only become Wikipedia material if a group was to declare Californian independence under that name. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 20:02, 1 November 2005 (UTC) PS. There is a seemingly notable organization called <a href="http://www.newcaliforniarepublic.org" class="external text" title="http://www.newcaliforniarepublic.org" rel="nofollow">New California Republic</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - The fact this group "New California Republic" has a web site, doesn't make them notable. Most obscure fringe groups have web sites. Also, not that it matters, but the above web site, seems to propose something different than the article (e.g. a country made only of the US state). However, I only gave it a short read, and can't tell. It really doesn't matter. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 22:46, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>; Aecis' first idea was right. There are exceptions to the crystal ball policy, in particular when the event will almost surely take place or when the proposal is really notable. This seems not to be the case, however. A search for “link:www.newcaliforniarepublic.org” on Google returned that only 27 pages link the web site of the organization (including the pages in the site). I do not especially trust Google for establishing notability in general, but in this case I think it's fairly accurate.

<li><b>Comment</b>: WP is not a crystal ball, but there has been enough talk about California secession/division that this may well rank its own article. - <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESensor_bf13.html" title="User:Sensor">Sensor</a> 00:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> an article about a <i>current</i> and notable controversy is perfectly fine. In this case, the article should be named <i>Controversy on California secession</i> or something similar, and contain information about the controversy (who proposed separation, etc.). In this particular case, I have some doubts about the notability of such a controversy.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone provides good, solid, verifiable evidence that the phrase "New California Republic" is in genuine, widespread use in California and not just promotion for a website. I am very skeptical (hence my provisional "delete") because the article conspicuously fails to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">cite <i>any</i> references</a> and because Googling on exact phrase "New California Republic" gives unimpressive results. The serious prospect of a "New California Republic" would be of national concern, so I think it is also revelant that an online search of The New York Times from 2000-present yields no occurrences of the exact phrase "New California Republic." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:56, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although it is qualified as "colloquial term," this term appears to have been invented by the author. While I can imagine colloquialisms like "Southern Ivy" or "Southern Ivies," the very nature of a League is formal, and no formal relationship exists between any of these schools, as the article itself mentions.

<li>Keep - This is a widely used term in Southern academia. It is acknowledged to be a colloquial term in the article. Just because some other people haven't heard of it, it's no less valid. I know the Magnolia League was a proposal in the mid-to-late '90's. Check with the student government archives at Emory, Vanderbilt, Duke, etc. I don't think the author made it up, because I have been hearing it for the past 20 years. Why delete a phrase that many Southern wiki-users know? That smacks of regionalism.</li>

<p>"1. Having an Alexa ranking of 10,000 or better 2. Having been the subject of national or international media attention within the last 2 years 3. Having a forum with 5,000 or more apparently unique members"</p>
<p>The site is short on its Alexa, however it has been the subject of media attention, and I am referring to the site itself, rather than the forum. It has a forum with approximately 5,000 members, and has had forum membership above that at times. In addition the policies and procedures of the forum have been a topic of discussion on the internet for many years and its procedures have been a reason for the creation of many other forums in the genre as a model and as a counter. It is historically noteworthy in this regard for its forum mamagement, in addition to its content on the actual site itself. Arckanghel</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do consider <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to be a pretty good guide to which sites are noteworthy. While it is impressive that the site has been covered by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_de96.html" title="Electronic Gaming Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>, I don't consider this to be a worthy national media source, since it isn't broad in it's subject matter. What is important to EGM isn't necessarily notable. Also, I'd like to know exactly how EGM covered FFO. Was it a full-page article, or just a sentence or two and a URL? 4,776 forum members is close to the guideline (which I feel is too low anyway.) How many of those users are actually active?</dd>
<dd>Basically, I'm still not yet convinced. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 02:17, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

There has been more in depth coverage in online sources such as ZDNet &amp; IGN, but I don't have a link for those on hand. As for forum traffic, the wiki page cites 4,776 members, 32,574 threads and 793,855 posts on November 1st, and as of this writing on November 3rd the page reports Threads: 32,691, Posts: 800,693, Members: 4,786.

<dl>
<dd>Despite being a member of the site in question, I have to agree with JiFish and others. FFO just does not reach the requirements stated in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. There's no two ways about it, and, no matter how many times people link to that mention --- not an article by any means -- in EGM, FFO just doesn't cut it. C-Man

<dd>I'll concede. There have been a good few arguments for and against on the site itself. Delete.Arckanghel</dd>

It is basically a list of people who have responded in a certain way to rumors or sometimes (joking) questions from the press. Verifiable and factual yes, but not encyclopedic or particularly helpful. I can't think of any use for such a list...To sum up: If this information belong anywhere at all it's the 'trivia' section of the respective persons articles, not on a list of every famous person who's ever said 'I'm not gay' in public.
