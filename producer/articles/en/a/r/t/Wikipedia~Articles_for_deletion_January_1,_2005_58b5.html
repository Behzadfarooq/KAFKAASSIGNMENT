<li>Note this is only about organisation. No-one is suggesting removing any content. Ral315 says there is "no need" to have day-pages. Good, Ral315 can read the (unchanged) month pages as his preference. I prefer day-pages, so I can read them. Organising the content this way, we all get the display we prefer. The re-merged way, we are restricting choice with no gain.

<ul>
<li>Agreed, that's why I had that "if you wish" clause&#160;;). In practice, the daily/month articles will be the detailed view to enable us to build up a really useful historical timeline, whereas the anniversary and years will be of a different format, more high-level and generally more topic based than time-based. Lots of ways into the actual articles is a good thing though, IMO. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 01:02, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Certainly. With few exceptions, I don't believe individual days are notable enough to merit individual articles. If you desire a specific reason from <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, then "Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article" would probably suffice (although I don't believe the redirects would need to be kept). I just don't feel that <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8%2C_2005.html" title="January 8, 2005">January 8, 2005</a>, for instance, is significant enough to merit being in its own article. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 08:51, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would be extremely grateful if some contributors would take a wider view than just articles. We have a tens of thousands of pages in the main namespace that are not articles - lists, disambiguation pages and component pages such as found on the cricket pages. These individual day pages are not so much articles in themselves but building blocks so that we can create more useful articles (see above). With this point of view, I think your concern goes away? <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 11:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I should also add that in general, I disapprove of article text being transcluded (and I was opposed to the cricket pages being transcluded, as well). Lists and disambiguation assist with article navigation; I don't belive that this sort of transclusion does. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:27, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am going to call you on that. Define "clutter". A database is not physical space. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 15:03, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main thing is that it complicates editing because when you hit a section edit link and edit a day, you end up at the day page and have to hit "back" to go back to the month page. Nobody wants that. Also, it's probably slower. Those are the only real issues I can think of. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 15:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Seems odd that the day-by-day log is an acceptable method for AfD but is not for actual real-world events worthy of going in the encyclopedia.

<li>You're trying to explain that a relatively small, rarely edited page needs to be split up by comparing it to a large, frequently edited page. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 16:23, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lol, ok let's follow the chain of events that led <i>you</i> to cause <i>me</i> of logical flaws.
<ol>
<li>Nickpar dislikes the extra mouse click required when finishing up editing transcluded pages.</li>
<li>I put out that the current events page are a drop in the ocean compared to AfD pages, and so he may as well succomb and get a tabbed browser.</li>
<li>You tell me that AfD is busier (The number of clicks required is identical no matter how busy the page is).</li>
<li>You then tell me that actual you were really talking about the utility of the pages themselves rather than the number of clicks required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So it is you that is jumping around with the logic. Anyway all of that is irrelevant. You seem to agree that transclusion is good thing for AfD. Maybe it won't be such a huge boon for date pages (I think that it will, but it will take time as we learn that it useful to link to individual dates sometimes - e.g. dates of people's deaths) but the size of the boon doesn't matter. As long as it's a boon, and the cost to people who prefer to continue to look at the <i>unchanged in look</i> month pages is minimal, then there is absolutely no need to delete these, because they are providing a positive benefit. I note that no-one has argued against that. It all appears to me to be arguments about strict definitions of what is in the article space and an unwillingness to try anything new.... I am glad this feeling wasn't around when Wikipedia was much smaller else we'd have never got anywhere! <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:26, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, I disagree. Transclusion is bad in any event. The only reason it's used on AFD is because it's a necessary evil. And they're not creating a positive benefit- I could split up any page by sections, and they wouldn't create a benefit. That's essentially what you're doing. To view your articles by section, one would have to manually enter the URLs- something it seems like only you would be doing in the first place. In any event, I'm done arguing with you, because no matter what I say, you have your feelings, and nothing I say is going to change them. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 20:38, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, after taking a closer look at the pages it looks like this does indeed work alright, with some nice flexibility addded.

<li>It's actually policy for you to have to give a reason for deletion. So I hope you don't think my asking you to do so is also querulous! I'm sorry if I sound frustrated, but I <i>know</i> being able to link to individual dates is going to be a big boon for Wikipedia long term and I am frustrated that I have not summoned up the linguistic skills to convince others.

<li><b>keep</b> From what I noticed, on the main Jan 2005 page, the transclusion works good, so we need separate pages to make the transclusion work. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 20:36, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Also it would be great if interested parties could check out <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> (the new box on the right) for a way of presenting information that has opened itself up now that we can link to individual pages. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 20:54, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I can understand why these pages would have been unwanted in the past; but now that wikipedia itself has become one of the best online sources for current news, and background on news events, I think there will be enough content for these pages, at least for now on. (But don't create pages yet for dates more than a few years in the past). <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_van_der_Pijll_eaa2.html" title="User:Eugene van der Pijll">Eugene van der Pijll</a> 22:11, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> with Community Discussion about future standards for this type of information. In the long term, cataloging individual dates could be a very useful and innovative use of Wikipedia. The massive hypertext data of Wikipedia enables a better cataloging of the events of an individual day than ever before. However, currently we can only search it by year and day only, not the two combined. Wikipedia should eventually be considered a resource for social science data mining. Combined with semantic tags, maybe we could discover for example whether people are more or less likely to commit suicide on days with bad news or disasters. Or whether different periods of the year are more likely to be associated with different types of historical incidents. Although the standards for this information need to be discussed, a day actually ranks pretty high there up on the quality of encyclopedic knowledge. I think this is an excellent test by Pcb21 and a taste of the future of Wikipedia. Don't cut Wikipedia short.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On top of that, it has immediate value because people are interested in what happened on their birthdays and wedding days, etc. And the edits to Pcb's article will give us ideas about how to manage this information. That's the beauty of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 22:18, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I agree. To tell the truth, a day and year article is probably more useful than a day article alone. A day page (ie. <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>) is only useful for commemoration and superstition. Different and changing calendars, leap years, and other things make them pretty meaningless anyway. Day and year pages would solve the calendar problems through redirects and would open a huge new use of the database. The status quo set-up for dates is NOT the future, and the longer we use it the longer it will take to convert eventually. This is a huge project however. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 22:30, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
