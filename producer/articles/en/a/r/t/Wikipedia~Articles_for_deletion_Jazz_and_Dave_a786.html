<li>Follow up: This pub crawl is extremely popular in Cambridge and is not simply present in one instance. Therefore it cannot be defined as "non-notable". Any suggestions on how to improve the quality of the page in question for it to remain on the website would be helpful. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDav_H_e5d1.html" title="User:Dav H">Dav_H</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDav_H_c191.html" title="User talk:Dav H">talk</a>) 14:02, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, BadSeed, Surely the definition of encyclopedia ("A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically.") entirely disproves your notion that pub crawls are "inherently non-encyclopedic". The phrase "wide range of subjects" surely encompasses that of pub-crawling which isn't exactly unknown of in the wider community! Robin Johnson I'm sad to inform you that you are entirely incorrect in your presumption that this article was made by schoolboys. It was made by a bunch of Cambridge students; who believe it definitely has a right to be publicised as it is simply <i>renowned</i> in Cambridge. As for James084; try and make a cogent point next time. I hope you take this information into account when choosing whether it should be deleted. It definitely doesn't in my opinion as it is, by any standards, a "notable" (as you put it) piece of information. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDav_H_e5d1.html" title="User:Dav H">Dav_H</a> 15:10, 23 January 2006
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Concerning your definiton of an encyclopedia, see WP:NOT. Interestingly the article claims the pub crawl was <i>Devised by idealists James Welland and David Holding...</i> in this case Cambridge students are no better than school boys. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadSeed_1726.html" title="User:BadSeed">BadSeed</a> 15:26, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> i will be sad to see the page go, but no hard feelings. If you would like to join a Jazz and Dave pub crawl for a taster of the experience, feel free to join us on the 7th February at The Maypole 7pm. I hope you all can join the group. I have been dismayed to find rumours of a hoax. This is not part of the idealistic spirit purported by Jazz and Dave.

<li>The article describes a pub crawl made up by two students one day. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_for_things_made_up_in_school_one_day_29ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day">Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day</a>. The article cites no sources where this pub crawl is documented outside of Wikipedia, and neither Ifnord nor I have been able to find any sources. It is very likely that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDav_H_e5d1.html" title="User:Dav H">Dav_H</a>, the creator of the article, is the "David Holding" mentioned in the article as the inventor of the pub crawl. There is no evidence that this pub crawl has been acknowledge by anyone other than its creators and accepted into the corpus of human knowledge, and its creators are clearly documenting it directly here in Wikipedia. This is a mis-use of Wikipedia as a publisher of first instance. The article is both <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'd put my reasons but Uncle G summed it up so eloquently, also I would like to add if you wiki pub crawl you get information on not only pub crawling itself but some of the more famous ones. If pub crawls are inherently non-encyclopedic then one has to question why this is on wiki.

<li><b>Keep</b> I haven't signed up as a user on wikipedia, but is this article really going to do any harm to anyone by keeping it? This whole argument just seems childish to me! However it is hilarious to see people wasting their time arguing over this irrelevant matter! Oh and there are loads of other pub crawl wikipedia entries - just look at Pub_crawl and there's loads under there! Antonin Lauderau.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am a student from cambridge and i have heard of the Jazz and Dave pub crawl. This crawl is in its early stages, but is quickly growing in success. The article is hilarious and what more could we want from a pub crawl.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Jazz and Dave have been rapidly growing in popularity throughout both Cambridge and the surrounding villages. This crawl has become one of Cambridge's weekly highlights and as such deserves a place in such a distinguished body of information.
