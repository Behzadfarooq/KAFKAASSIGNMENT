<li>The <i>editor</i> of a local community newspaper was a perfectly legitimate deletion; it's hard to make a claim that such people are notable enough for articles. However, for the publications themselves, the baseline criterion for inclusion is (or at least was, at one time — I can't seem to find the media criteria at the moment) a circulation of 5,000 copies or more, which this one certainly meets. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The neighborhood may be notable, but the newspaper hasn't got any verifyable presence other than some of its stories being copied to the community website. We can't reliably independently verify its existence, much less circulation numbers, content, etc. I am willing to be convinced otherwise, but someone has to find the sources. Scanning in the circulation description from one of the recent editions (if Canadian postal regulations require one like US do) would probably be good enough, if someone can do that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 21:26, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable paper with a notable article featuring notable editors in a notable encyclopedia. It should be noted that notability is notably dependent on POV. Wikipedia as a notable encyclopedia serving the notable, less notable and not at all notable (not that this includes any of my notable colleagues who are notably here today), should notably strive to present notably unbiased information by ignoring our notably POV tainted notability censors and gendarmes. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:36, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can you verify, in any way, the paper? Verifyability is the other cornerstone for WP. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 22:00, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have reread the nomination a few times and this nom has not in any way claimed that this paper does not exist or that there are verifiability issues with its two lines of text. Are you claiming that this is a hoax? That would be most troubling. Of course, the fact that it is listed in Ottawa newspaper lists <a href="http://dawn.thot.net/ontario_weekly_newspapers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dawn.thot.net/ontario_weekly_newspapers.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://ottawastart.com/newspapers.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://ottawastart.com/newspapers.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> would seem to prove its existence. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:26, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of suggestive links around. I am not proposing that it doesn't in any form exist. I don't even think that. What I am saying is that we don't have enough info to verify that it's big enough or covers notable enough subjects to be a notable paper. I could start publishing a quarterly pamphlet out of my home, about events on my block, and set up as much web coverage and presence that NEN has, within 24 hours. We need some verifyable evidence that this isn't a vanity publication... like, circulation information, article information, etc. <i>Anything</i>... And so far we have nothing. For the love of god, someone who lives in Ottowa, please find a copy and scan it in or something. We need more than a few links and a Wikipedia page to base this decision on. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, I respect your point of view, but you seem to be drifting back to that notability thing again, even going so far as to use the word "notable" twice in the second sentence of your response. I feel like I adequately expressed my feelings on that in my initial comment above. Since we both believe to the depths of our beings that this rag exists, there would seem to be little matter for debate between us, although I would tend to agree that further expansion from the article's modest beginnings may require additional information. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let's back up a bit. You repeatedly say this is a notable newspaper. <i>How can I verify that</i>. What evidence (verifyable evidence) can you put forwards to justify the claim that it's notable? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:15, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You seem to have missed the sense of what I was trying to say. I suggest you read the deletion nomination for this page. Then read my comment. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:19, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not missing the point. We're both aikido-throwing each other. Unfortunately, Wikipedia policy on articles requires notability, defined in a verifyable manner, and not simple existential philosophical arguments as to whether particular things are measurable or not and whether there's any indepentent poitn of view to be found. You can keep going, but you aren't fulfiling the Wikipedia requirement to keep the article, and it's going to get nuked. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 02:27, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please point me to that policy page. Also, since you have already determined that this article is going to "get nuked", why did you ask me a question in the first place? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:31, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

And you are mistaking the tense of the nuking comment: failing to support the article's notability and verifyability will lead to its deletion, which will happen because you're engaging in word games rather than providing verifyable sources on the NEN (and nobody else has, either).

<li>I am perfectly satisfied that the paper exists as indicated by the two links I have provided. You have admitted as much yourself. The article itself is two lines long and makes no claims beyond its existence. Note, as well, that this nomination is based solely on "non-notability". The nom has made no effort to explain what is meant by that and has offered no evidence to back up the claim. That does not work for me, because to spell things out in plain language and for the last time, notability does not enter into my thinking. I do not believe in that tattered POV concept since its definition varies from individual to individual. What is "notable" for you is not "notable" to me, etc. etc. Thus, it has no bearing on me when considering a school, newspaper, book, film or numerous other categories of articles. I will not now, or in the future, make a vain attempt to support this article on that basis. If we have a guideline page for weekly newspapers that lists certain criteria that should be met, I would be perfectly happy to see New Edinburgh News judged accordingly. Since to my knowledge we do not have this guideline, and we have no real policy on "notability", I choose to apply my personal criteria, which is that all newspapers should have pages here, including community newspapers, school newspapers, pennysavers, whatever. If these are word games that lead to the "nuking" of this article, depriving our readers now and in the future, of any knowledge of New Edinburgh News, then I stand accused.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:00, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
