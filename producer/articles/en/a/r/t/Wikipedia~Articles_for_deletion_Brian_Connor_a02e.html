Despite the fact that I made mention on the talk page in response to SJ's suggested deletion tag that Brian Connor was never a televangelist he repeats it here deliberately, I suppose, to conjure up images of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.

<li>KEEP!! There are so few methods by which people who need help can find it. This is one way suffering people can find professional assistance in a field that is not well understood and often misunderstood. Please don't take away that connection. ALSO - notability is easily verifiable. NBC and TLC channels are easily referenced if you must verify appearance, along with articles in print in FHM magazine and other sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.41.184.108 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.41.184.108_ff60.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.41.184.108">contribs</a>) .</small> <small>Note - new user, first two edits to this page -- <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 06:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>Excuse me, but every single source listed is verifiable. What are you going on about? <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 02:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The three linked articles do not provide good evidence of notability. The Guardian UK article only contains a single quote from Dr. Connor -- he is not the article's subject, nor does it claim that he is particularly notable. The article in the Charleston Post and Courier does focus on Dr. Connor (to some extent), but this looks like evidence of his <i>local</i> notability (the Post and Courier's circulation is about 100,000, which puts it roughly in the top 200 US newspapers in terms of circulation, but it's billed as "local news," so this is less than clearcut). Since Dr. Connor is (as far as I can tell) a Baptist, the Baptist Press article is the equivalent of a notice in a trade journal. The other items can't be checked online, so I can't tell whether they're evidence of Dr. Connor's notability. So -- sorry, but I just don't see clear evidence of notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> here. If you can add other linked sources to this article, I'd be glad to revise my opinion. On the other hand, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> doesn't list religious figures as a category, which might be something to consider codifying at a later date.

<dd>Please note: there is no requirement to provide online verification. If notability is verified by citing print publication this is perfectly acceptable, unless of course there is evidence to doubt the veracity of the citation. I do not believe that is the case in this instance<s>, particularly with the religious affiliation of the contributors.</s> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I checked the three linked citations, and they provided at best marginal proof of notability. Therefore, I'm inclined to suspect that the other (nonlinked) citations are probably similar. I encourage any knowledgeable contributors to add linked citations which make a stronger case for notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I'm not sure how the religious affiliation of the contributors matters one way or another -- I try to <a href="../../../g/f/_/WP%7EGF_4344.html" title="WP:GF">assume good faith</a> regardless of the contributor's background.

<li>STRONG KEEP*** Dr. Connor is doing God's work. I have known Dr. Connor personally for 10 years. He was the former paster at our church in Mt. Pleasant, SC and is a very spirit-filled minister. God is using him very strongly in spiritural warfare helping oppressed people. I know spiritural warfare exists because my husband and I have experienced it ourselves and we believe in Dr. Connor. Until it happens to someone you love, you don't have any idea it exists. Thank God for Dr. Connor. kellyc...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.58.234.25 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.58.234.25_f31f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.58.234.25">contribs</a>).</small> <small>user's first edit</small></li>
<li>STRONG KEEP!!!! I know Dr. Connor personally. Several years ago he gave up a very good pastorate to "go toe to toe with Satan." Many, many people have been set free through his "Good Shepherd Institute" ministry. If you go to this web site, you will find that he does not charge a fee for helping the oppressed. He helps others out of love. This is rare today. Please keep this site open so that others may find help. Thanks.
