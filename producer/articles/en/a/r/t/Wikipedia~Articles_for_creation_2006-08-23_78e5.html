<p>Squirrel Scouts are fictional girl scouts in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Lazlo_f636.html" title="Camp Lazlo">Camp Lazlo</a>.</p>
<p>The girl scouts were called Squirrel Scouts. The girls there had a lot to do, arts &amp; crafts, campfires, nature hikes, volleyball, soccer, pine cone sitting, tea parties, croquet, &amp; many more things. However, 1 particularly favoured sport of the Squirrel Scouts was making fun of the Bean Scouts of Camp Kidney, a more underfunded camp on the other side of the lake. The Squirrel Scouts were the group of girl scouts who were about the same ages as the bean scouts and lived in a natural environment setting like the bean scouts. They lived in a camp called Acorn Flats. The commonly seen scouts are Patsy Smiles, Nina Neckerly, &amp; Gretchen.</p>

At Jon Peddie Research we decided to investigate who was the person, or group who came up with the idea of adding a camera to a mobile phone.</p>
<p>We surveyed over 4,000 engineers and managers in the mobile phone and camera market and got over 2,000 replies and a lot with references to (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone</a>)., <a href="http://www.w2forum.com/dictionary/Camera_Phones" class="external free" title="http://www.w2forum.com/dictionary/Camera_Phones" rel="nofollow">http://www.w2forum.com/dictionary/Camera_Phones</a>, <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/j-sh04" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/j-sh04" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/j-sh04</a>, <a href="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/chronology/p14.html" class="external free" title="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/chronology/p14.html" rel="nofollow">http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/chronology/p14.html</a>, which all said “The world's first camera phone was the J-SH04 made by Sharp Corporation and went on sale in Japan in November 2000.”</p>
<p>Dave Cooper from Imagination Technology found an interesting patent filed by Alcatel in European Patent office in July 1992. (<a href="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP1028577&amp;QPN=EP1028577&amp;CY=ep&amp;LG=en" class="external free" title="http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP1028577&amp;QPN=EP1028577&amp;CY=ep&amp;LG=en" rel="nofollow">http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=EP1028577&amp;QPN=EP1028577&amp;CY=ep&amp;LG=en</a>) Source European Patent Office Figure 1: Radio telephone with video player recorder The radio telephone has a hand-held housing with electroacoustic transducers (2,3) behind sound inlets (9,10) and a video recorder (7), a video player (6) and an electronic circuit (5) for image and a sound communications by radio within the housing. The telephone also has a hands-free device. The video recorder has a wide-angle objective (8) and is mounted in the front of the housing with the video player.</p>
<p>And former JPA employee Tommy McClain found a US Patent filled in February 2002 by Miyake; Hiroyuki at Mitsubishi. <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,882,864.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,882,864&amp;RS=PN/6,882,864" class="external autonumber" title="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,882,864.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,882,864&amp;RS=PN/6,882,864" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which was originally disclosed in the 1998 Japanese Patent Publication (unexamined) No. 336498/1998. Source: US Patent Office Figure 2: Cellular phone with imaging device Hitherto, in the cellular phone equipped with an imaging device in which the cellular phone and the imaging device are integrally accommodated, for the purpose of taking a picture while visually recognizing a photographing screen on a monitor, a camera of the imaging device faces in opposite direction of the monitor. Therefore, to take a picture of a user while watching on the screen a person to whom the user is speaking, it is necessary to change the direction of the imaging device every time. In a cellular phone equipped with an imaging device 1 according to the invention, on the front side 1a provided with a monitor 4 of a housing 100 of the cellular phone, a lens 2 of the imaging device is disposed facing outwardly. Further, a viewfinder 3a is provided facing in the same direction as that of the lens 2.</p>
<p>This patent was filled in the US in 2002, and probably was filled in Japan much earlier (Patent Abstracts of Japan, 11-146034, May 28, 1999.) Notice the similarity to the shape and locations of elements to the Kyocera VP-210 in Figure 33. The real first camera phone But the first commercially available phone was correctly identified by Eisaku Ohbuchi-san at DMP Digital Media Professionals, Dr. Peter Weigand at Micronas, and Tony Henning, Managing Editor, The Mobile Imaging Report form Future Image Inc. as being the Kyocera visual phone (VP-210) which was introduced in Japan in May 1999, over a year and half before the Sharp J-SH04</p>
<p>Kyocera Corporation’s President: Kensuke Itoh, showed the VP-210 with a CMOS image sensor with approximately 110,000 pixels and a 2.0-inch reflective TFT color LCD at the Business Show '99 Tokyo.</p>
<p>The phone could transmits and receives images in real time at a rate of approximately two frames per second, making it the world's mobile first color videophone. In addition, users can send and receive e-mail with image attachments by using the P-Mail DX (deluxe) service offered by the DDI Pocket Telephone Group</p>
<p>Source Kyocera Figure 3: First camera phone, Kyocera VP-210 The VP-210 had a 65k color 2.0-inch reflective TFT color LCD (size: approximately 40 mm x 30 mm. The phone was featured in a UK magazine article (PC World) in May 2000 with the SRP of £36.19.</p>
<p>Kyocera Corporation, headquartered in Kyoto, Japan, has been developing high-tech products, high-performance materials and electronic components since 1959. The second camera phone Don Lee at NexusChips had a totally different idea, and said, “As far as I know the world’s fist camera phone was the Samsung Anycall CDMA camera phone, SCH-V200 in June, 2000. The SCH-V200 had a 1.5 inch color TFT-LCD, 350K pixel and 20 pictures storage. It was released at "KIECO 2000 exhibition" in April, 2000. The SCH-V200 was not a successful product. Then, Japanese camera phone, Sharp's SH04 was released in November, 2000.” Source Samsung? Figure 4: Samsung’s SCH-V200 Chris.Turner at Business-Advantage got some data from his friend Tony Henning Managing Editor, The Mobile Imaging Report form Future Image. The Camera Phone was the fifth multi-function hand-held phone developed by Samsung, after the Internet Phone, MP3 Phone, Watch Phone, and TV Phone. The unit featured a fixed lens located on the upper backside of the phone, and the subject captured by the lens is displayed on the TFT-LCD. Once the subject has been framed correctly, the user presses the shutter button on the bottom of the TFT-LCD. The Camera Phone can take 20 pictures at 350,000-pixel resolution and included a CD-ROM for picture editing and a data cable to connect the phone to a PC</p>
<p>We couldn’t find any of references on this phone in English, but found a dozen in Russian, and did see things in the text that suggested it was indeed an April 2000 event. Kudos to Don for finding this obscure little beauty. And the third camera phone How Sharp got credit for being first is a mystery, except that Sharp make such a claim in a 2000 document (<a href="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/h_company/2000/" class="external free" title="http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/h_company/2000/" rel="nofollow">http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/h_company/2000/</a>)... “The J-SH04 was the industry's first mobile phone to feature an integrated 110,000-pixel CMOS image sensor for taking digital photos.” Now it is interesting that the Kyocera and the Sharp have the same resolution, but the Sharp’s camera is on the back side, so it was intended as a camera and not a video conference phone like the Kyocera. Vodafone echoes the claim at <a href="http://www.vodafone.jp/english/release_detail/e20030326_02/e20030326_03.html" class="external free" title="http://www.vodafone.jp/english/release_detail/e20030326_02/e20030326_03.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vodafone.jp/english/release_detail/e20030326_02/e20030326_03.html</a>, and even the history of photography’s timeline (<a href="http://www.marcine.com/photohistorytimelinefr.html" class="external free" title="http://www.marcine.com/photohistorytimelinefr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marcine.com/photohistorytimelinefr.html</a> ) gives them credit. Source Sharp Figure 5: Sharp’s J-SH04 camera phone Like the Kyocera VP-210, the Sharp J-SH04 had a 65k color 2.0-inch screen and could show up 12 lines of text.</p>
<p>It gets a little confusing because also in October 2000, Sharp is credited with the J-Phone J-SH04 and it is shown as a clam-shell.</p>
<p>Source Sharp Figure 6: The other J-Phone? FYI on Sharp, the company started in 1912 making mechanical pencils – check this site for some fascinating history. <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Sharp%20Corporation" class="external free" title="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Sharp%20Corporation" rel="nofollow">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Sharp%20Corporation</a> What about the PDA? David Kasik, of Boeing, who is something of a historian himself, pointed out that the big step that combined the phone, the PDA, and the camera began to happen in 1997. Says David, “Now you can argue that the Xybernaut portable system had accomplished the same thing two years earlier, but it really was not until 1997 that the average person had access to the pieces necessary to assemble a camera phone, which is when it really started happening. PDA's combined with cellular cards and cameras were visibly in use at most technology trade fairs in 1998. So the idea of assembling the technology more or less accreted over a 3-4 year period, and perfectly functional camera phones assembled from off the shelf pieces were out there for a year or so, before it occurred to the cellular carriers to formally offer them.” Camera attachment Michael Kanello posted my question on his blog on Cnet, and L.Cosh-Ishii, from Wireless Watch responded with an interesting side note. Lars said Toshiba who made the 1st camera for a cellphone (see ). The Camesse was stand alone unit in late '99 that connected to your handset and allowed people to take photo's &amp; "customize" them w/PDA type stylus pen &amp; send thru the phone as e-mail attach! Source L.Cosh-Ishii, Wireless Watch Figure 7: Toshibia’s Camesse camera module for phones and PDAs Lars probably saw an early unit because the camera didn’t “officially” go on sale un February 2000 when NTT DoCoMo introduced theToshiba's camesse petit. It was a picture-mail communication tool with a 110,000-pixel CMOS camera with a 312 x 230 pixel color LCD, and touch-sensitive panel to enable the user to take a picture and draw on it. Source unknown Figure 8: Example of picture-mail with hand notation This picture is stored in JPEG format and sent with text as an e-mail to another camesse petit or PCs over the Internet. Though the e-mail is sent or received via cellular phone at a speed of 9,600 bps in those days. The Snapmail system newly developed by NTT DoCoMo then shortened the time required to approximately 26 seconds for a 10 Kbyte picture-mail.</p>
<p>The camesse petit weighs only 170 g, and operates with 2 LR6 alkaline batteries. The body is designed to appeal to young ladies, according to Information Media and Consumer Products excerpt found at Toshiba’s website. (<a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/tech/review/2000/high2000/pdf/h0004.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/tech/review/2000/high2000/pdf/h0004.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.toshiba.co.jp/tech/review/2000/high2000/pdf/h0004.pdf</a>) Additonal information on this very popular device can be found at: <a href="http://photojpn.org/notes/node.php?id=30" class="external free" title="http://photojpn.org/notes/node.php?id=30" rel="nofollow">http://photojpn.org/notes/node.php?id=30</a> No one and everyone And Alexly Trushin at Austek asked, “I understand your attempts to figure out a hero, but I believe the father is not one and unknown. Who was the author of wheel? At the same time, Sharp can have an appointed hero or deputy hero. I do not know the name and I am not sure I'd like to figure out it. Because this question is historical as well as the question who was the father of PDA. Not the name, but the device. David Potter? Jeff Raskin? Hawkins? Or Bill Gates? All together, but nobody individually. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>And Jim Oyler from E&amp;S suggests it may not have been that simple [to find the designer or person with the idea], saying, “As you know, ideas tend to percolate around and no one person actually deserves all the credit. But who knows?” Several others like Andrers Pfeiffer at MicroCosmos Design Report expressed similar thoughts, and Alessandro Gatti at Cresta Systems suggested no one was THE inventor.</p>
<p>Quite a few folks, like Peter Glaskowsky and my son in law Pat Madden, suggested it was Chester Gould. Source US Post Office Figure 9: Chester Gould’s Dick Tracy and his wrist TV, circa 1931 However, Akio Tanaka at Macromedia says he read about it and that it was a team at J-Phone (now sold to Vodafone and is known as Vodafone KK) and Sharp who worked on this idea and popularized it in Japan. It became a killer feature for J-Phone, and KDDI and DoCoMo followed later. Japan was the first market where camera-phones have become the standard. Unsung heroes Wolfgang Gruener at Toms Hardware said, “While you are giving that guy credit (hope you find him) do the same with John Edwards, since he is some kind of a sad story in this whole industry. There is enough evidence that he is the first guy who was running a functional cellphone system, but he forgot to patent this whole thing - i.e. - he is not getting any license fees whatsoever. This guy lives in Dorset, England.”</p>
<p>Rogier Smit at Playlogic International in the Netherlands thinks it might be a couple in the Netherlands. It was in the newspapers because they never received any credit or compensation from Nokia whom they had sent the idea to. “If you do some research,” says Rogier, “you'll find it. It was in the papers about 18 months ago. I think they are still trying to get accreditation and/or compensation.”</p>
<p>Manish Sing at Nvidia was kind enough to contact Mr. Masafumi Matsumoto Corporate Senior Executive Director, Information and Communication Systems Business at Sharp Corporation for us, and learned fromMr. Sing and his other contacts at Sharp that they weren't aware of the original inventor of the concept of "camera with phone" however it is believed it was invented by a young engineer who belongs to their semiconductor division. He (or she) shared such idea with planning people of their cell phone division. The planning people believed that there must be a market since they also wanted to check and see how their kids are doing while they are at work.</p>
<p>So Masafumi-san said that if I want to award someone, he thinks I better gives the medal to the management guy who was responsible for the development of the first "camera with phone".</p>
<p>And finally, I include the observation of Darren McPhee at ATI, who postulated, “Maybe a more interesting story is how this is an industry-first; and no one has jumped forward to take credit for something.” Darwwn’s right and I/we may have inadvertently opened Pandora’s box as all the inventors now call their lawyers in hopes of getting a cut of this explosive market development. Oh dear. Fun stuff One respondent, Steve Carroll of Tigermetrics remembers being at CeBIT in 1997 and making a presentation in front of Vodafone. Maxon and some other Far East manufacturers, Steve says, “They all laughed and even more when we mentioned video [in a phone.]”</p>
<p>Two of our respondents, Bill Homes at DivX says it was his idea (and thanked us for recognizing him), and Ari Firestone at Learn BY DVD in Canada, said he did it in 1991 whilst driving down a back road talking with his stock broker, and to (sadly abbreviate his really humorous story (which we’ll send to you if you ask), says, “As I grabbed the phone and flung it out the window, I screamed uncontrollably at the top of my voice, "they can send a man to the moon so why the hell can't they make a cellular phone with a camera built in to it!!!!" On the other end of the line my lawyer, who also happened to play golf with the then CEO of Motorola's cellular phone division, said quietly, "good idea" as the phone line went dead.” Other fun stuff If you’re interested in interesting gadgets and awards, go to Top 100 Forgotten Gadgets <a href="http://www.mobilemagazine.com/archives/2005/06/top_100_forgott.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mobilemagazine.com/archives/2005/06/top_100_forgott.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilemagazine.com/archives/2005/06/top_100_forgott.html</a></p>

<p>Summary So piecing together all the data we got it looks like the time line for camera phones is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kyocera VP210 – May 1999</li>
<li>Toshibia’s Camesse camera attachment 1999 - 2000</li>
<li>Samsung SCH-V200 - April 2000</li>
<li>Sharp J-SH03 - November 2000</li>
</ol>
<p>As for who is the unsung hero(s), well we still don’t know, but maybe someone reading this is one of them, or knows one of them and will write us (jon@jonpeddie.com) and enlighten us all. Epilog – The inventor After we completed the survey and published our results in two places ("Jon Peddie's Tech Watch," July 18, 2005, Volume 5, Number 14, Jon Peddie Research, Tiburon Ca., "Handheld Multimedia Devices: Semiconductor and IP enabling multimedia on handhelds and phones," copyright 2004, Jon Peddie Research, Tiburon Ca.) which got world wide distribution, some diligent readers kept digging, and in November of 2005, Wolfgang Gruener of Tom's Guide Publishing found THE inventor of the camera phone.</p>
<p>Equipped with the information from the above research, Gruener poked into Kyocera's massive Japan operation, in the hope to find the man, woman or group behind the idea of the VP-210.</p>
<p>It took several weeks until I was able to find the right contact, reported Gruner. But eventually, Masumi Sakurai from Kyocera's PR department at the firm's Kyoto headquarters assisted us and I spoke to Kazumi Saburi.</p>
<p>Source Wolfgang Gruner, TGdaily Saburi led the VP-210 project back in 1997 as section manager of Kyocera's Yokohama research and development center and brought the device from idea to life. Today, Saburi is the manager of the Fifth Engineering Development Department for Mobile Communication Equipment in Kyocera's Corporate Mobile Communication Equipment Group.</p>
<p>Where did Saburi get the idea to build a camera into a cell phone?</p>
<p>"Around that time, cellular handsets with enabled voice and SMS communication capabilities were considered to be just one among many personal communication tools. One day a simple idea hit us - 'What if we were able to enjoy talking with the intended person watching his/her face on the display?' We were certain that such a device would make cell phone communications much more convenient and enjoyable."</p>
<p>So his initial thoughts were centered around a video rather than still cameras, something that is only recently become more popular in phones. "We knew that a handset must be equipped with a camera and a full-color display for visual communications of any kind - the former is required for catching the image of the speaker and the latter for showing it on the receiver's terminal. This pretty much outlines our first idea," he said.</p>
<p>Saburi's idea was to have users exchange pictures by email, using the SMS services of the phone network. He began working on the project back in 1997, and "the Kyocera visual phone came to the market in 1999, but we had nourished [the idea] for several years before we started development."</p>
<p>Looking back in the historical records 40 years ago, UK banks told John Edwards that no one ever would be interested in carrying a phone around all the time and ultimately denied him a loan to develop and market his cellphone idea. But Saburi didn't have any such difficulty. "Top management aggressively encouraged us to develop the product. We also believed that such a product would improve Kyocera's brand image."</p>
<p>Saburi's research on how consumers used cameras was a big reason for inventing the camera phone: "The cell phone's strongest feature is its portability. This alone creates the application opportunity for the camera phone: We imagined that users are likely to accept the minor weight addition of a camera in a cell phone and carry around 'weightless' photo albums to enjoy with friends. But they do not use heavy cameras or bring along traditional physical photo albums all the time. A cell phone with a camera and color display provided a completely new value for users: It could be used as a phone, a camera and a photo album. This is also where we started from a marketing point of view. From a technical view, we were also confident that we could develop such a device. The approach was to combine an existing teleconference system and a primary wireless data transmission technology."</p>
<p>The phone was a quick success in Japan and was the beginning of a cultural change in how phones were used. "After the release of Kyocera's visual phone for DDI pocket, now Willcom, and J-phone, now Vodafone K.K., introduced the service "SHA-mail" ["photo mail"], which greatly contributed to boost the sales of camera-installed cellular handsets in Japan. SHA-mail greatly changed Japanese telecommunication culture. A key factor to support the boom of camera-installed handsets was in my opinion the evolution of the camera module. We saw remarkable downsizing of the modules, the quality and function were amazingly improved - to a level that was almost equal to digital cameras."</p>
<p>As you can imagine, squeezing a camera into a phone wasn't easy. Saburi remembers plenty of challenges. "I remember that I had discussions with R&amp;D staff, project members and top management several road blocks we came across - again and again. What is the best angle for camera mounting? How can we improve the data transmission speed for minimizing the time lag while talking? What is the best balance of the image quality and frame rate? What about the battery? We faced a pile of challenges that we had never had before." About a dozen engineers worked on the key technologies, taking about two years to build the first model.</p>
<p>Today, Saburi is in charge of Kyocera's cell handset R&amp;D, and he is working on phones with auto focus and 3 megapixel resolution. "In Japan, we are currently enjoying taking pictures and playing music on our cell phones. We can even make payments with our handsets, just like you use a credit card. We call this the 'osaifu-keitai' function. My guess is that the next big thing would happen after a seamless ubiquitous network environment is established."</p>
<p>I asked Saburi if there is anything he could change about mobile phones and the way we use mobile phones, what would it be? "We should not forget the key function of phones. Cellular telephones enable us to communicate with anyone, at anytime, from anywhere. This is the strongest feature of cell phones. We should focus much more on this feature of communication, which would allow us to extend battery life. How much fun would it be, if we could enjoy endless multi-communication, without having to worry about the battery? Of course, this is my personal opinion. I myself prefer the simple cell phone models that focus on just the communication feature."</p>
<p>And there you have it, the ultimate irony: the inventor of the camera phone, for all his influence over how technology is used, is the ultimate cell Luddite! I hope you enjoyed our journey to the heart of this innovative technology as much as I did. Final comment (honest) I (Jon Peddie) want to point out that this article and the research behind it is a classic example of how Wikipedia works and why it is so rich and valuable to the world at large.</p>

<p>Zach is also a very talented singer. many people in his community recognize him as the singer from the school christmas concert. he made the headlines on the Prescott Journal, and The ST. Croix Valley Boys Choir, (SCVBC) decided to let him join in 2002. He sang with the SCVBC for only one year, however in that year he had climbed to the top rank the choir had. Zach stopped his singing for Four years as his voice became deeper. He then Sang kareoke at a bar for his uncle's wedding. "Suddenly the bar tender and All the drunks at the bars were telling me how far i could go and how good i was so i thought, 'hmm maybe i chould try this again',". Zach tells us.

<p>(Verb) The act of urinating into a sealable bag and then dropping it off a higher platform, primarily stairs. This act is primarily found at college campuses in the north-east. This new rising trend originated in Ithica University in New York. Three freshman students performed this act for almost a year untill professors gained wind of their doing. Along with the professors discovery it started to spread rapidly throughout other nearby colleges. The three students who wont be named were cought and expelled from the university. Although there are such high risks with performing this act many students go forth regardless and capel during college parties and other occasions.</p>

A Brazilian punk rock/emo Band originated from Rio de Janeiro founded in 2004. First metioned as nobix the original members of the band are William Byers (Vocals - Nobix), The Founder José Walter Pereira (Bass), Gulherme Guth (Guitar - Nobix), and the outrageous drummer Pedro Henrique Lucena (Drummer - Nobix). In october 2004 Nobix came to an end with the leave of the drummer Pedro Henrique to dedicate its' self for football. In 2005 Nobix Stayed on a pause trying to form anothe rooster with a new name Radact with a new guitarist João Pedro Brandão (Guitarist) and with a slightly modification in the rooster william went from vocalist to drummer, but still there was no vocalist until the year of 2006. In the year of 2006 the band got a second guitarist Pedro Caetano Leite (Rythym Guitarist) and a new vocalist jazz influenced Matthew Carter (Vocalist. The name was then changed to OCK (over Cast Kids) but there was a conflict because the name apparently was already the name of the [fall out boy] official fan club, so the name changed to 3 to fall where it still remains now a days. 3 to fall has being doing shows in schools and future projects for shows around Rio de Janeiro and Brasil. With its Blast from the Bass the high drums and the Distorted guitars conflict with the low vocals 3 to fall has being conquistating its place on the music business.</p>

<p><b>Bhashaindia.com</b> is a website started by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to promote Indic language computing on the internet. Most of India's internet users do their business in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>. Much of the remainder of the population prefer to do business in their respective regional. These people often lack access to computing facilities. For example, despite being one of the most comonly spoken languages in the world, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> has little presence on the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_on_the_Internet_3d9b.html" title="Languages on the Internet">internet</a>. As such, tools for Indic language computing have not been developed.</p>
<p>The website is divided into two sections to cater for developers and linguists seperately from end users.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Indic [IME] is availible from the website. The Indic IME enables computer users to type Indic scripts, (including conjunct formation), using a variety of keyboards.</p>

<p>FLI - Flexible Line Interpretation[1]. This is an enhanced graphics mode on the 8-bit Commodore 64 computer. It was invented by Roland Toegel, who is also known by the alias Crossbow in the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">Demoscene</a>[3]. The importance of this graphics mode is that it allows higher quality computer graphics on the <a href="../../../c/6/4/C64.html" title="C64">C64</a> platform. This term and technique has been used in the subculture of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">Demoscene</a> circa 1990's[2]. The technique uses a hardware trick to enhance the original graphics modes of the <a href="../../../c/6/4/C64.html" title="C64">C64</a>.</p>

<p>Nicholas Cordova was born on July 29, 1986 in Anaheim, California. He spent the first 4 years of his life living in Corona, CA before moving to Orange, CA where he would grow up. Nicholas or Nick as he is known to most attended St. Norbert's Catholic school and was apart of the first kindergarten class. After St. Norbert's, Nick went on to attend Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, CA. There Nick played football for his freshman and sophomore years before pursuing a job to help pay for his expenses which would utlimately help his single mother focus the family funds on his two younger syblings, Candace and Daniel. Nick began working at Produce World in Orange, CA. While most would struggle to balance work and school Nick seemed to do it with ease. He maintained both an honor roll worthy g.p.a and a nice bank account. Nick would go on to graduate with honors and academic commendations from Mater Dei in May of 2004. He decided that it was in his best interest to attend Fullerton College so that he may save money while at the same time attend one of Orange County and California's best Community Colleges. During his Second semester Nick would answer the call of opportunity as he always does and left Produce World to work for Kaiser Permanente in the Pharmacy. Nick was like nothing the company had ever seen, he was a favorite of both staff and the members of the health care provider. After two years of hard work and a 3.6 g.p.a., Nick would leave Fullerton College and his home of Orange County for San Diego State University where he starts this fall as a Junior. The future holds many things for this bright young man. Teacher? Lawyer? Professional wrestler? Of course! It is all just a matter of time for this talented young man.</p>

In this type of motor, also called the Scharge or variable-brush AC commutator motor, a different method of injecting the speed-varying e.m.f. into the secondary winding is employed. Referring to Figure 45, the supply is led to the rotor winding through slip rings, the rotor winding being the primary. The secondary winding is on the stator. On the rotor is an additional regulating winding with a commutator. The ends of the stator (secondary) windings are connected to brushes disposed on the commutator.</p>
<p>The first point to notice is that when the rotor is at standstill, the rotating field sweeps past the secondary winding and the brushes at synchronous speed. As the motor gains speed, the frequency in the secondary windings and, due to the commutator, the frequency at the brushes are both reduced simultaneously. No matter at what speed the rotor is moving, the brush frequency ties up with the secondary frequency and, as a result, voltage can be picked up from the commutator and injected into the secondary windings.</p>
<p>The method of varying the e.m.f. injected into the secondary windings is by altering the amount of commutator spanned by each pair of brushes. The pairs of brushes are arranged so that they can be moved simultaneously equal distances from the in-line position. When in-line, each pair of brushes rests on the same commutator segment. At this position, each secondary phase winding is short-circuited and no phase voltage is injected; consequently the speed is that of a normal induction motor. Movement of the brushes in one direction or the other increases or decreases the speed. Brush movement can be done by hand wheel or by means of a small servo or pilot motor, remotely-controlled. The general characteristics of this rotor-fed motor are the same as those of the stator-fed type.</p>

<p>The Knoffler Calls are from the late 80's or early 90's; They are seemingly random calls that are in this authors opinion the funniest prank calls that have ever been done. Most are "R" rated for language and in some calls racial slurs.</p>

<p>The Grob 109B was developed out of the Grob 109 by Grob Aerospace of Mindelheim Mattsies of Germany.</p>
<p>The basic concept was that of a two seater self launching motorglider with a 57 foot wing span. The basic airframe construction was in fibreglass. Total weight was around 1870 lbs with a load of 506 lbs. Cruising speed was in the region of 100 knots on the 90 horsepower engine. Though Grob made the engine, it was based on a VW car engine The engine could be turned off in flight and propeller could be feathered. The aircraft then became a pure glider, with a best glide ratio of around 1:28. The pilot and passengers sat side by side and enjoyed excellent views from the large perspex cockpit.</p>

<p>Uglynet is a social networking site that was founded in February 2006. Launched in mid August of the same year, the Uglynet social network aims to provide a meeting place for anyone who considers themselves ugly.</p>
<p>On the premise that ugliness is equaled by someones inner-beauty, the site promotes pride in their members bad looks. Various competitions are available to members, including the ongoing 'Ugliest Countries' competition (based on a ratio of members from each country compared to population) and 'World's Ugliest Person', where members may sign up for rating by site visitors.</p>
<p>Membership of the Uglynet social network is free. The site advertises upcoming features which include individual blog hosting and the ability to make contact with other members. The site has a simple user-interface that resembles the columnar approach of yahoo.</p>

<p>This movie tells the tale of Sam Seed, an insane mass murderer who is set to be executed at the hands of Warden Wright. While strapped in the electrocution chair just before the executioner flips the switch Wright askes Seed, "Do you have any last words?" Seed replies, "I'll see you again." After three failed attempts to kill seed, they pronounce the man who has blood seeping from his eyes yet is still breathing, dead. Seed is bound and buried alive. The enraged, blood-soaked madman claws and bites his ways to the surface and now is bent on destroying everyone who caused him to suffer.The reign of violence that follows will redefine the boundaries of extreme gore, physical &amp; mental torture explored through cinema.</p>
<p>Based on a true story. Seattle 1972</p>

<p>From the BBC television series 'Doctor Who'</p>
<p>The Daleks would not have got were they are now without the use of weapons. In the early days of Doctor Who, the Daleks main weapon was the famous 'egg whisk' gun, which produced a 'deadly blue flame' 'Doctor Who and the Daleks' (1971). Throughout Doctor Who, they have also sported the sink plunger style weapon, which main use is opening encrypted doors, although recently in 'Dalek' (2005) it suffocated one of the scientists at Henry Van Strantens alien museum, and in 'Doomsday' (2006) the 'Cult of Skaro' used them to extract information from an unfortunate research worker at the Torchwoood plant. The plunger stayed the same throughout Doctor Who, but its gun did not. In 'Planet of the Daleks' (1979), they were machine guns that could spray hails of deadly bullets, however, this did not have much affect on the the thick skinned zombie like creatures that inhabited the planet. When Doctor Who retutned to our screens in 2005, so did a brand new Dalek. They now carry a ray gun which can do unthinkable damage. After the metallic cry of 'Exterminate!' the gun produces a stream of sharp, blue light which almost electrocutes the victim on contact. The ray gun is so powerfull that it can penertrate even a Cybermans metal armour, as they found out in 'Doomsday' (2006). Along with those two deadly weapons, the Daleks also carry a protective shield, which can withstand bullets and most handheld weapons. This makes the Daleks almost invincible, although their middle eye is their only weakpoint. A direct shot their would blind a Dalek and render it useless.</p>

<p>River 94.9 is a commercial radio station based in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. The station, which broadcasts to South-East Queensland, opened in December 2001 in the old studios of Star 106.9, Their playlist originally included pop music, rock and dance with specialty programming including 'Wild Nights', licenced from Wild FM. In late 2003, after some small changes in administration, most specialty programmes disappeared. Still claiming to be 'the hit music station', they began playing less pop music and more hit music from the 1980s and early 1990s. They now position themselves in the competitive market as playing "The Biggest Variety of Hits from the 70's, 80's, 90's and whatever" with a no repeat workday.</p>
<p>The station is owned by Rural Press &amp; Bunderburg Broadcasters, forming part of the Star Broadcasting Network which also currently has radio stations in Bundaberg and South Australia.</p>
<p>As of 2006, the shifts included Waynee "Poo" Roberts (former 4IP DJ) (breakfast), Jodie (morning) and Jay Goldman &amp; Kane Reiken (drive). River949 is the first station in Australia to have "now playing" in the PS of their RDS (radio data system).</p>

<p>To 'Pull a Watson' To organise a night out for a celebration of yours but not turn up. Usually turns out to be a better night out than if you were there. Number one excuse for not turning up is ‘Dicky Tummy’, other excuses can include Passport revoked, dog ate my car keys and I’m washing my hair.</p>

<p>A term used by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Blumer_e279.html" title="Herbert Blumer">Herbert Blumer</a> in his theory of <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_Interactionism_b4f4.html" title="Symbolic Interactionism">Symbolic Interactionism</a> to refer to the positivistic (<a href="../../../p/o/s/Positivism.html" title="Positivism">positivism</a>), often quantitative, scientific methods of sociological research which he largely rejected in favour of qualitative approaches such as <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnography.html" title="Ethnography">ethnography</a>. Variable analysis would typically involve the isolation of two variables in a process, one 'dependent' variable to be measured and another 'independent' variable to be controlled, much as in the study of physical or biological science. Blumer viewed this approach as simplistic and as glossing over the complexities of social interaction, leading him to be viewed as the founder of a new sociological school known as <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic_interactionism.html" title="Symbolic interactionism">symbolic interactionism</a>. The term can equally be used by extension to refer to the use of such analysis, and the objections to its use, in other fields.</p>

<p>Ohio State</p>
<p>Offensive Tackle, 1970-1973-</p>
<p>You could make the argument that for one season, no offensive lineman had a better season than Ohio State's John Hicks had in 1973. He won the Lombardi and Outland Awards and finished 2nd to John Cappelletti for the Heisman Trophy. How loaded was the 1973 Ohio State team? RB Archie Griffin finished 5th and TB Randy Gradishar 6th. Hicks, along with Griffin, was the main cog on one of the most dominant offensive teams in college football history as the 1973 Buckeyes outscored teams 413 to 64 and blew out USC in the Rose Bowl.</p>
<p>The comeback: That Hicks was the road grader for such great running backs as Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson is all the more amazing when considering what he had to overcome. The 6-3, 258 pound tackle started as a sophomore in 1970, freshman weren't eligible, and helped them go to the Rose Bowl. In 1971, he started off the season in dominant fashion before injuring his knee and missing the last six games of the season. He came back to become an All-American in 1972 helping the Buckeyes to go back to the Rose Bowl. Then he had his monster 1973 season. A first round draft pick of the New York Giants, injuries would put a halt to his pro career.</p>
<p>The Rose Bowls: Hicks was the first player to ever start in three Rose Bowls and was part of a monster Ohio State. The unbeaten Buckeyes lost to Stanford 27-17 in the 1971 Rose Bowl. The 1973 Ohio State team got steamrolled by USC 42-17. 1974 would be Ohio State's year as they beat USC 42-21 as Hicks led the way to 323 rushing yards.</p>
<p>Dominant offensive lineman of his era?: While Alabama's John Hannah and Michigan's Dan Dierdorf are widely acknowledged as the top offensive linemen of the early 70's, Hicks certainly deserved consideration. The Buckeyes went 19-2-1 in his last two seasons and 28-3-1 during the three full seasons he played in. Certainly Ohio State had as much talent as any program in the nation during that time, but Hicks had as much to do with making their offensive machine go as anyone on the team and it says something that he finished ahead of legends like Gradishar and Griffin for the Heisman.</p>
<p>Honors:</p>
<p>First Team All-American - 1972, 1973 2nd in Heisman Trophy - 1973 Outland Trophy Winner - 1973 Lombardi Trophy Winner - 1973 First Team All-Big Ten - 1972, 1973</p>

Zach's father has a career in the military and met his mother who was a medic at the time. The were maried and had Zach in Wurzberg, Germany. when he was about six month's old his family moved to Fort Hamilton, in New York City. At age three, his family then moved to MiddleTown Ohio. he doesn't remember much of That period in his life. then he moved to Fort Carson Colorado where he lived for two years. He currently resides in Prescott, Wi, a suburb of Minneapolis and St. Paul.</p>
<p>Acting</p>
<p>Zach started acting when he moved to Prescott in 2001. He was found by luann sebelko, the director of lil' Abner at The Great River Road Theatre. Zach held a major role as Pappy Yokum and was the youngest cast member to acomplish a major role. "Zach at age twelve is one of the best actors i have worked with" director luann sebelko comments. the next year Judy johnson became the director and cast Zach originally as Gallahad, but do to his age many of his cast members thought was too young for this role. He was Then switched to Sir Kay in the Great River Road production of A Connecticut Yankee. Judy Johnson also directed the next year and Cast Zach as Will Parker in Okalhoma! However in that same year a tabloid came out that said Zach had snuck into the womans dressing rooms and was flashing people. The GRRT board quickly took on this case. "I was furious that somebody could make something like that up just because they disliked me", Zach said. At the meeting the board announced Zach innocent for lack of evidence. as the meeting came to a close, the people who started the tabloid, (we cant say their name for their protection) said that the entire thing was made up. Even though Zach was innocent, just to silence others and the press Zach was replaced by Alex Helberg, and was switched to Ike Skidmore. In the Same Year Zach worked with Claudia haas in her production of A MidSummer Night's Dream, at The Phipps Center in Hudson. he held the part of Theseus. "cluadia and the entire Phipps center was so kind to me, Claudia showered me with compliments." Zach says. Also Zach was involved in the schools Drama Rama class. he was nominated by his community to be on this team. He competed with teams from other schools in the fields of improv and short skits. His team took first place all four years he was in the class. at these compititions Zach was honored to recieve the covetted Actor Of merit Award four consecutive years. "The first year i won the AOM award my heart stopped, i couldn't beleive it" zach replies. Zach Currently holds the Record for most Actor of Merit Awards. Just behind him is Kylie Miner who holds three. His Drama Rama coach Dianna Marshal says, "working with Zach has been a pleasure, i can count on him to hold any kind of major role, also he listens to my direction." Zach Aspires to do more shows and aspires to be in movies. he loves when opprotunity knocks. "It takes more than an ugly rumor or a tabloid to get me to quite. you will never stop me from acting, because as long as you're jealous of me, i will remain on top". this quote was included in Zach's testimony for the GRRT board meeting.</p>
<p>singing</p>
<p>Zach is also a very talented singer. many people in his community recognize him as the singer from the school christmas concert. he made the headlines on the Prescott Journal, and The ST. Croix Valley Boys Choir, (SCVBC) decided to let him join in 2002. He sang with the SCVBC for only one year, however in that year he had climbed to the top rank the choir had. he sang at churches and local fairs for about two years and he was a regular form of entertainment in public places. Then Zach stopped his singing for Four years. "I just didn't want to do it any more, my voice was cracking and i wasn't as good as i was before". Zach explains. He then Sang kareoke at a bar for his uncle's wedding. "Suddenly the bar tender and All the drunks at the bars were telling me how far i could go and how good i was so i thought, 'hmm maybe i chould try this again',". Zach tells us. Zach soon competed at Hastings Days festival 2006 and was the youngest one to compete. He took Third place singing hits like 'If I could turn Back Time", "I found Someone", "I knew i Loved you", and "Don't Stop believin'". In august 2006 he competed in the Pierce County Fair and sang "If i could turn Back Time", the crowd gave Zach a standing ovation but he did not place. However a talent scout asked him to sing at the Ames Center in April. Zach enjoys singing and wants to someday have a record deal, but for now he says doing live concerts is fine for him.</p>
<p>writing</p>
<p>Zach is also a published poet and has six books that have yet to be published. The Earth, Zachs best poem to date is being published in a compilation called excellence. it can also be found in Zachs self titled book Zach, and in his just written compilation The Very Best Of Zach. with Zach's permission we are able to give you a copy of this poem,</p>
<p>The Earth a heavenly body hurling though space but if we could see her saddened face cars leave her scars and thugs take drugs war after war leave sore after sore the earth a heavenly body hurling through space but if we could see her saddened face we would see the beauty we will soon erase.</p>
<p>Zach has a collection of books as well, here is a list</p>
<p>Zach Released 2004 Time Released 2004 Pain released 2005 I Am Me Released 2006 The very best of Zach Released 2006 Dreamer Realesed 2006</p>
<p>Zach is to this day his best book, with the hits "In his Shoes" which focus' on children being picked on in school. This book also includes "The Earth" which is above. Time and Pain ultimately flopped except for the few poems like "Thousands of tiny lights", "The comeback", "The Hollow Man", and "Success". Zach stopped writing for about a year because he focussed more on acting. When I Am Me came out, it was his second best book. This book is considered his comeback. This book sparkled "Life Highway", "I Wish", and "Someone". After the success of I am me, Zach released a compilation titled The Very Best Of Zach, which includes all thes poems listed above. Zach is curently working an a book called Dreamer, which is to be released late 2006. It is anticipated to be greater than I Am Me and Zach.</p>

<p>Caudete is situated in a cross of ways. In their municipal term three independent communities are united , the Comunidad Valenciana, the Región de Murcia and Castilla- la Mancha. For this reason, Caudete has a lot of monuments to visit and many cities near from it. In first place, in Caudete there are the Church of Saint Catherine (iglesia de Santa Catalina) in the town centre. This church was built in the 14th century and it have examples of the gothic, renaissance and baroc styles. Above the Saint Catherine's Church there are the castle. This castle was built by the Muslims in the 12nd century. In town centre too there are the Saint Joseph's Monestry (monasterio de San José) built in the 16th century. Next to the monestry there are the Our Lady of Carmen's Church (iglesia del Carmen). This church is in the main square of the town. Outside the center town is the monumental district of San Francisco (el barrio de San Francisco). This district counts on the San Francisco' s Church, neobyzantine style, and the famous bullring "The Sands" of Caudete (Las Arenas de Caudete). These two works and all the district were constructed by the Count of San Carlos in the beginning of 20th century. Outside the town, following the pretty stroll of the Way of the Virgin (el Camino de la Virgen), is the hermitage of Our Lady of Grace. This hermitage was built between the 14th and the 18th centuries. This church counts with a valuable artistic treasures, from the mantles of the Virgin to gothic painting tables. Our Lady of Grace is the patroness of Caudete. But the greater touristic attractive of Caudete is their celebrations of Moors and Christians. This celebrations are celebrated between the 5th to the 10th of September, in honour of Our Lady of Grace and count with more of four hundred years of antiquity. In this celebrations the people of the town get dressed of moors and christians and remember the medieval time of the town. Other celebrations are the Dances of the Boy (Bailes del Niño) in Christmas, where the people of the town dance traditional dances in the squares, the popular celebrations of San Antón and San Blas, in January and February, the Easter, in March or April, and the celebration of Our Lady of Carmen, in the 16th July.</p>
<p>Aside from the touristic attractive of the town, Caudete counts with a communications network that unites the town with the beaches of the Costa Blanca (Benidorm, Torrevieja, Denia, etc) in less than one hour as well as with the big cities of Valencia, Alicante, Murcia or Albacete.</p>

<p>Jani was signed to Charlton from Sami Hyypia's former club MyPa 47 of Finland in November 2004, towering Tanska is entering his third campaign with the Addicks.</p>
<p>The six-foot-three central defender took a while to settle into his new surroundings but the 2005/06 season saw the uncompromising youngster show exactly why the club went to such lengths to secure Tanska's much sought-after signature.</p>
<p>Arriving in SE7 in a hail of publicity, Tanska initially had problems nailing down a regular starting berth for the U18s and picked up just six starts for the senior academy side in the remainder of the 2004/05 campaign.</p>
<p>The following season was a different story, however, and only Kieran Murtagh, skipper Grant Basey and Dane Springer managed more than the 15 starts the competitive young Finn accumulated.</p>
<p>Anjalankoski-born Tanska, who also opened his U18 scoring account with a fine headed effort against Crystal Palace in November, turned professional in the summer of 2005.</p>
<p>Tanska might not be the last player to join the Addicks from MyPa, either.</p>
<p>When he signed for the club, the Addicks also completed a deal with the Finns whereby the English club has first option on any promising youngsters emerging through the MyPa ranks <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Jani t.jpg">Image:Jani t.jpg</a></p>

<p>History The Flash was the first comic book hero to be featured with superhuman speed, debuting in 1940. He developed other power related to his speed powers, such as time travel, vibrating his molecules to pass through solid objects, etc. With different people who assumed the identity (Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West, Bart Allen), his top speed changes. Barry Allen is the fastest, claimed to travel "faster than the speed of thought". He was also the most expericned with time travel. Wally West has an unbreakable connection with the Speed Force.</p>
<p>Another prominent speedster is Quicksilver, first appearing in 1964, in the early issue of X-Men. Quicksilver originally could run up to 175 mph, and with a 500 foot approach run up a building 300 feet beofre being overatken by gravity, or run on water for 1000 before sinking. However, after exposure to the Terrigen Mists, he vibrates his molecules through time.</p>
<p>Superspeed is a popualr superpower because of its flashiness,and everyone wants to be fast.</p>

<p>I don't feel qualified to re-word the definition without distorting the meaning; this term seems important, so maybe you can think of an accurate way to represent it:</p>
<p>"Hsinchun Chen's team also analyzes the syntax, punctuation, and writing style of e-mails and forum postings in order to identify authors and individual terrorists. The characteristics are very specific: the use of commas or a certain greeting, for instance. "You can never get a fingerprint online, but you can get a writeprint," Chen says. The system is surprisingly effective. A "writeprint" —an amalgam of a writer's compositional quirks—can pinpoint an author within a small subgroup of, say, 20 people with about 90 percent accuracy. "If there is a new message, I can tell you if it's from Bin Laden or his lieutenant," Chen says."</p>

<p>Connor O'Hanlon was born on the 19th of March 1993 and is the most impressive and most wanted young player in the game. With clubs like Manchester United, Deportivo La Coruna and Tottenham all battling for his signature, he is sure to have a good future in professional football. He plays central midfield in Gaelic Football for Chullhian Gaels in Omeath, County Louth. However in soccer he plays on either wing though he prefers the right wing as he is right footed. He has incredible pace and leadership qualties and can dribble the ball majesticly. He passes the ball emacutely and can shoot from long range and with power. He is a huge Celtic fan and loves the club and it is his dream to play for them and by the look of things that could easily become a reality.</p>

<p>68.190.159.75 00:57, 22 August 2006 (UTC) Patti Fritz is the current Repersentative for district 26B in Minnesota. And is the DFL canidate.The mother of 5, grandmother of 16, and her husband Jim have lived in Faribault for more than 30 years. Patti has been on the front lines helping people as a LPN for 29 years at St. Lucas Care Center.</p>
<p>She’s seen how nursing home costs can eat up the family farm. How day care costs can exceed the mortgage payment. And, how prescription drug costs can cripple the life of our seniors. She’s seen enrollment decline in our rural schools along with the necessary funding for a quality education, and she vows to make sure that our kids and our schools get their fair share so that all our kids succeed. Patti will be a passionate advocate for the working men and women of District 26B and won’t hesitate for one second to put her district before her political party. What’s important to her district comes before pleasing her party leadership. This district deserves better. It deserves a representative that will put the interests of her district before those of her own party if she has to. It deserves to have schools that are funded at adequate levels and nursing homes that receive the resources they need. Teachers shouldn’t have to pay for their own teaching materials and students shouldn’t have to hold fundraisers for up-to-date schoolbooks. Nursing homes shouldn’t be so strapped for cash that nurses and nursing assistants work 10-15 hours a day in unfavorable working conditions. This isn’t fair to our community and this district deserves a representative who will fight everyday to make sure these wrongs are righted.</p>
<p>Patti Fritz will be a strong advocate for District 26B. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to contact the campaign.</p>
<p><b>Patti Fritz on the Issues</b> On Education</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“There is a reason that Minnesota’s economy boomed in the 1990’s – we had a well-educated workforce fueling our state’s economic engine. To be able to return to those times of economic prosperity we have to invest in our public education system – now.”</p>
<p>-Patti Fritz, Representative for District 26B</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Public schools are the cornerstone of Minnesota’s success. A generation ago, Minnesota began a bi-partisan effort to invest in education. For thirty years I have watched that investment pay off. I sent my children to Minnesota schools that lead the nation in teacher quality, graduation rates, and college entrance scores. Minnesota schools taught our children to compete in the modern economy of computers and technology. As a result, most of my generation enjoy</p>
<p>a thriving state economy with a per-capita income</p>
<p>beyond the national average.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>However, over the past decade Minnesota’s</p>
<p>governors and legislators have failed to provide</p>
<p>leadership for public schools. They have failed to</p>
<p>invest enough resources to insure that teachers,</p>
<p>administrators and support staff have the resources</p>
<p>they need to educate our children. As a result, class</p>
<p>sizes are increasing, rural schools are closing, and</p>
<p>school employee wages, benefits and pensions are</p>
<p>being cut to meet budget constraints. All of this</p>
<p>impacts the quality of education that our children receive – and that impacts our state’s long-term economic prospects.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a State Legislator, Patti Fritz will work to guarantee that all children in our public school system will receive a high quality education no matter where they live or what school they attend.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On Health Care</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“I am uniquely qualified to fight to improve our health care system in Minnesota. As a health care provider, I see the negative impact the health care crisis has on our community. As a State Legislator, I will work to gain affordable, accessible and high quality health care for us all.”</p>
<p>-- Patti Fritz, Representative for District 26B</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You do not need to be a health care worker to know that our health care system is in crisis. We all know that insurance premiums are constantly on the rise; that small business owners are struggling to maintain coverage for their employees; that working families are</p>
<p>seeing their take home pay eaten up by increased costs;</p>
<p>that seniors are barely able to afford their prescriptions;</p>
<p>and that more and more Minnesotans are going without</p>
<p>healthcare coverage.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Patti Fritz is a health care worker and she knows the</p>
<p>impact that this crisis is having on our community in</p>
<p>Minnesota. As a LPN at St. Lucas Nursing Home in</p>
<p>Faribault, Patti sees first hand how the lack of</p>
<p>affordable and accessible health care coverage</p>
<p>compromises our quality of life and does not reflect</p>
<p>the values of our community. She sees that people</p>
<p>without health insurance incur significant medical</p>
<p>debt, delay getting necessary medical care, live with untreated illnesses – and some even die younger as a result. This impacts our whole community – healthy individuals can contribute more to a safe and prosperous society.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a State Legislator, Patti will work to control the costs of health care coverage and lower the cost of prescription drugs so that all members of our community will have access to the care they need and deserve.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the Economy</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Over the past three years, our state has taken in less revenue than it has committed to spend. We have continuously operated under large deficits and as a result of restrictive tax policies those deficits have led to harmful cuts to health care, education, and public safety. For example, by cutting Local Government Aid, state lawmakers have jeopardized our ability to fund such things as our police officers and fire fighters.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
“My campaign is about the bread and butter issues – jobs, health care, and education. These are issues that will allow us to all get ahead and leave a brighter future for our children and grandchildren. That’s what people tell me they want their elected officials to focus on – and that’s what I am going to give them."</p>
<p>Patti Fritz, Representative for District 26B</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While we scramble to cover the cost of providing essential community services, the true long-term solution to the ongoing state budget deficit is to revive Minnesota’s economy and create living wage jobs for everyone. In general, state revenues are down due to</p>
<p>decreased levels of income tax being paid. This is a</p>
<p>direct result of Minnesotans making less money,</p>
<p>earning less bonuses and losing their jobs altogether.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If we reverse this disturbing trend by creating</p>
<p>good jobs with living wages, health care coverage,</p>
<p>and retirement plans, we will be able to generate</p>
<p>enough revenue to balance the state budget. While</p>
<p>it is important to hold the line on government</p>
<p>spending, we have to create an environment that</p>
<p>allows us to solve the state deficit without relying</p>
<p>on devastating cuts to social and public services.</p>
<p>Reviving our economy and putting people back to</p>
<p>work will not only be beneficial to the economic well being of the state, but of our families and communities as well.</p>

<p>Christmas at Maxwell's ©is an inspirational but light romantic Christmas drama, a story about the human struggle, the power of love, forgiveness, trust and uplifting the human spirit. It is the story of a fortysomething man confronting the overwhelming effect his past actions seem to be taking on his life and his family.</p>
<p>The movie was written, directed and co-produced by William C. Laufer. Tiffany Laufer was the director and co-producer. LauferFilm.com is the production company.</p>
<p>Many successful projects are the result of support from family and friends, but not so many projects have quite as many family relationships as Christmas at Maxwell's. One of the main ones is the Tiffany and Bill relationship – they are a daughter / father team and make up Laufer Film.com. This somewhat unique film team has been working together since 1999.</p>
<p>Christmas at Maxwell's was shot in Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, Chagrin Falls, Lakeside and the Marblehead areas. Maxwell's Hospitality House is the set for the Lakeside Ohio scenes and is owned by Cecil, Kathryn and Jeanne Maxwell. Cecil Maxwell is the former mayors of Cardington, OH and the former owner of Riverside Dairy.</p>
<p>“We feel there's an incredible untapped potential for this type of film. Many people across the country are underserved by much of what Hollywood is offering. Our aspiration is and has been to make intelligent and inspiring films, that appeal to the imagination and intellect and do so while blending in a sense of humor and love.” (Bill Laufer). LauferFilm.com is located in Cleveland Ohio.</p>

<p>Commonly referred to as RPLND, it is a procedure to remove abdominal lymph nodes to treat <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testicular_Cancer_948d.html" title="Testicular Cancer">Testicular Cancer</a>, as well as help establish its exact maturity and type.</p>
<p>Testicular Cancer spreads in a well-known pattern, and the <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lymph_nodes.html" title="Lymph nodes">lymph nodes</a> in the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retroperitoneum.html" title="Retroperitoneum">retroperitoneum</a> are a primary landing site during spread of the desease.</p>
<p>The procedue is becoming standard treatment for clinical stage I and II Non-Seminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCTT) because of the low mortality and relapse rate with this procedue, as compared with the alternative, which is observation. Also, NSGCTT is considered more aggressive than Seminomas, the "other" kind of Testicular Cancer.</p>
<p>The potential problems in RPLND have mostly to do with nerves: they might get damaged or cut, resulting in infertility, an inability to ejaculate, or even an inabiloty to have an erection. This is why most often, a nerve-sparing technique is used. A less invasive form using laparoscopic technique (L-RPLND) exists, which is more costly, time-consuming, and requires special equipment that not every hospital may have. Open RPLND (O-RPLND), which is perfeomed by opening the stomach to get inside, has more room for problems, but is an equally effective way to get the lymph node out.</p>
<p>Adjuvant Chemotherapy is considered equally effective, but complicates follow-up regimen, as it may complicate therapies in case of relapse.</p>

<p>The album "Only In Your Wildest Screams" hit stores in late July, 2006. The album was critically acclaimed, although not as musically intricate as Wet Screams later work, Angry Salamander. The band toured ruthlessly behind the album, promoting it. It did not, however, land on the Billboard "Top 200" chart.</p>

<p>The album featured hard-hitting percussion layered beautifully with urgent harmonicas, light guitars, and a marimba which added an amazingly interesting sound to an already interestingly-sounding album. The lead vocals by Matt Buotte were catchy--although sometimes a little rough around the edges. The background screaming by Mike Nicholas, no longer with the band, added a charming touch.</p>

2. Global Diss (Pt. 1)<br />
3. Blazes Pride (Diss Part 2)<br />

JetsOwner.com is the home of the Return of the Jets Campaign, a grassroots effort to bring NHL hockey back to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Founded by Darren Ford in the spring on 2003, the website acts as a hub for all supporters to get information on the history of the Winnipeg Jets, check out the latest news regarding their possible return, chat in online forums, and much more. One special feature of the website is its detailed, in-depth look at just how the NHL can return to Winnipeg. Also Included, there is an online campaign e-store, relevant press clippings and various polls.</p>
<p>The campaign has received ample media attention, including features/interviews on both local and national Canadian television, US radio and even on CBC's Hockey Night in Canada. Other media attention include dozens of magazines and newspapers across the country. The ultimate goal of the camapign is to see the National Hockey League return to Winnipeg, a city that lives and breathes the sport and where so many feel it belongs. The three main keys the site cites as crucial to this re-birth are a newly improved collective bargaining agreement in the league which makes operating a franchise more affordable, a brand new arena which Winnipeg now has with MTS Centre, and a dedicated ownership group with deep enough pockets to lure an existing franchise to Winnipeg. The rallying of these indiviuals seems to be the last obstacle to conquer. Although the interest throughout Winnipeg's corporate community seems to be there, it remains underground for the time being.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, and the NHL, have been without the Winnipeg Jets since the spring of 1996 when they relocted to Phoenix, Arizona. Since then, the franchise has lost far more money than they ever did while in Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Cale Bowd, was born in Cambletown, Australia in 1989, He started his first serious year of running at the late age of 17. All though he was never quite the runner in his primary school years, Cale has progressed to a high level througout his highschool years. He won his first race at the age of 15 at the Zone athletics carnival in the 1500m, progressing to the sydney north area gaining a place of 5th.When achieving this, Cale realised that he may have the potential to do better things towards his running.The next year with some limited training Cale hoped to do better and work towards reaching the state championships. He did this by gaining 6th place at the Sydney North cross country championships.Entering a competition at such a high level had Cale very excited and although placing 65th in the N.S.W all schools championships he was still happy to have made it.Throughout the past year Cale has been training hard and has recently joined a training group with Gosford Athletics Club, among with several other elite athletes aged 14-19, in hope to represent N.S.W at the National X-Country Championships in Hobart, Tasmania.This was cales main goal for the 2006 season and although Cale did not finish with a promising result at the N.S.W All Schools championships, a good average throughout the year in State meets has gained him a place in the N.S.W athletic team to compete at the National Titles in August.Cale is in good faith that he will continue to progress with his running in the near future and hopes one day to represent Australia at the highiest of levels.</p>

<p>Nicholas Ballard is regarded by his peers as the world's best backgammon player. His nickname "Nack" dates to his college days when he had a roommate also named Nicholas, so they became "Nick" and "Nack." He is ranked #1 on the "Giants of Backgammon" list, and is the only player to be ranked in the top 10 in every survey taken since the inception of the list. He also excels at other games, including Scrabble, where his rating when he retired from the game would rank him in the top 10 in the world. He is the inventor of the backgammon variant "Nackgammon," in which the starting position is varied from standard backgammon.</p>

<p>Attractio (Latin for something which excites interest and attention) is in the new theory of feeling and emotion (<a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotional_Intelligence_4445.html" title="Emotional Intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</a>, Peter Schmidt, 2006) the moment of pleasant emotion and motivation that makes things having a value. It’s a <i>sui generis</i> category of experience and different from sensations and thinking. Attractio, physical sensations and thinking constitute feeling and emotions.

<p>Silentwulf, also known as Eric Ogden, is a young teenage filmmaker. Filming from the early age of 10 and on, he has become a internet celebrity. His first hit was "Funny Faces", which premiered on several websites, including AlbinoBlacksheep. Another popular series is "Insanity". Eric is often compared with internet superstar Fredryk Phox. Silentwulf is currently working on a series called "Counter-Clips" which a comedy/drama based on the online game "Counter-Strike:Source". He is also working on future episodes of "386 DOS Witticism", which pokes fun at old computer games. Silentwulf films, mostly contain silly, off-the-wall humor, but some films contain political, or more mature humor. For example, in Funny Faces 3, Eric makes a fool out of political filmmaker, Michael Moore. Silentwulf still makes films to this date, and is often chatting in the forums section of his website.</p>

<p>June 26, 2006 - Dreams Inc., (DRMS.OB) parent company of Field of Dreams® retail stores, announced today that Jorge Salvat has been named franchise president of the popular sports memorabilia chain of stores, located in premier malls across the country since 1991. Salvat comes to Field of Dreams® with more than 25 years of experience in the franchise environment, including 10 years in senior management. “We are pleased to welcome Jorge to the Dreams family, and believe that his experience will dovetail well with our goals for our Field of Dreams® franchise stores,” said Ross Tannenbaum, president of Dreams, Inc. “His proven success and understanding of our marketing objectives give us confidence that he is the right person to lead our stores to new heights in the next few years.” Tannenbaum noted that Field of Dreams® has 10 company-owned stores as well as 19 individually-owned franchise locations with both divisions in a growth mode. “With Jorge on board, we will be able to execute our dual-pronged strategy to expand both store types in a well considered and complementary fashion.”</p>
<p>Salvat spent the past six years as president and CEO of Cartoon Cuts, LP, a chain of hair salons catering expressly to children. In his tenure there, he doubled the number of stores and was responsible for a significant increase in profitability. He has extensive knowledge of the franchise business, with experience both domestically and internationally. Salvat will be responsible for overseeing the current franchise locations as well as implementing an aggressive growth plan as part of the company’s overall franchise strategy.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to be in a leadership role at Field of Dreams®, with its extraordinary array of sports merchandise and memorabilia, and equally pleased to be working among the visionaries at Dreams, Inc.,” said Salvat. “This talented team has created a terrific work environment that has translated into remarkable success for Dreams and its subsidiaries, and I am fortunate to be a part of their exciting future.”</p>

<p>ISO 19114 provides a procedural framework for evaluating the quality of digital geographic datasets, consistent with the data quality principles defined in ISO 19113. It consists of three classes of conformance: one for quality evaluation, one for evaluating data quality and on for reporting quality information.</p>
<p>The ISO standard itself costs roughly $90 to buy from ISO, and is under copyright so not too many details aren easily available over the internet.</p>

<p>The 200 BULLETS was born in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> from the combination of all the experiences brought from each of the four components.</p>
<p>Three months have barely passed since their coming together and they are already contacted by the independent label Kosentostre to publish a mini Ep.</p>
<p>This is how "10 Minuti di Panico" comes out. A crude, direct and immediate record that, despite being a small promotional cd, it becomes straight away a cult. Reviews (Rocksound, Punkster, Punkadeka and many others) are enthusiastic. First print is exhausted and reprinted after only 6 months.</p>
<p>It is from this record that the fist single of the band is extracted: La dolce Morte. This song immediately becomes a mini hit, it is broadcast by the radio and for a long time (source: Vitaminic/Nielsen) it's the italian punk song more downloaded from the web.</p>
<p>This exploit brings them all around Italy and gives them the opportunity of scheduling a 28 dates tour in the States in the autumn of 2004. In the same year they open with ToyDolls, ConckeyRejects and tens of other Italian and foreign bands.</p>
<p>At the end of 2005 the band changes drastically its formation, and so 200 Bullets refresh their sound and prepare the new songs for the new album. They are the only Italian band coming out on "Nothing Set in Stone", a punk compilation distributed in the UK and in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>. After this, they play two triumphal concerts in London the 24th and 25th of June 2006 and an English label proposes them to publish their record in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It's the kind of punk you have not been listening since a long time. They don't care. They play having a good time and they make you have a good time. Live attitude. Punk attitude. 200 Bullets are always on tour, they love music, they love playing, they love punk.</p>

<p>An <b>amateur fire brigade</b> is a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_fighting.html" title="Fire fighting">fire fighting</a> force consisting of nonprofessional, sometimes volunteer members. Although largely superseded by professional <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_fighter.html" title="Fire fighter">fire fighters</a>, amateur fire brigades were quite common [in the United States] during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and can be seen in the film <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangs_of_New_York_2d4c.html" title="Gangs of New York">Gangs of New York</a></i> among other places. They were originally organized by <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance_companies.html" title="Insurance companies">insurance companies</a>, but <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_house.html" title="Fire house">fire houses</a> eventually turned into a sort of social gathering place for working-class men.</p>
<p>This led to a number of problems, however. Each fire brigade tended to have a "turf" it patrolled, putting out fires in order to reap the reward paid by the insurance company, but <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turf_war.html" title="Turf war">turf wars</a> could lead to conflict among different brigades. In <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and other places in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, for instance, it was not unheard of for two or more brigades to arrive at the scene of the fire and fight each other instead, while the building burned to the ground. Looting of the building in question was also quite common. See the incomplete article <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_house.html" title="Fire house">fire house</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_fire_brigades.html" title="History of fire brigades">history of fire brigades</a>.</p>

<p>Documentary accompanying the film <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangs_of_New_York_2d4c.html" title="Gangs of New York">Gangs of New York</a></i>; it originally aired on (I think) the Discovery Channel prior to and immediately following the film's release.

I'm primarily putting this here because I want to get the ball rolling for other editors, using info from the documentary, which can be validated and expanded upon using other sources.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-23_78e5.html" title="Edit section: Jimmie Lewallen, one of NASCAR's earliest pioneers.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jimmie Lewallen, one of NASCAR's earliest pioneers.</span></h2>
<p>Jimmie Lewallen (Born 22/8/1919 - 16/10/1995) was born and raised in High Point, North Carolina, Jimmie Lewallen started racing motorcycles in 1934 before switching to cars in the late 30's while helping to distribute "spirits" to those in other areas of the state and especially High Point, NC. Early moonshine running went hand in hand with racing. He competed on the old one-mile dirt track in his hometown in 1940 before going off to war.</p>
<p>He entered the army in 1941 and between then and 1945 he fought in the ETO (European Theater Operations). He was at the Normandy landings and served in Europe, Africa and the Middle East Campaigns. He received the Bronze Star Medal, Good Conduct Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal &amp; Bronze Star Attachment (Triple), World War II Victory Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII and several Battlefield Commissions. He was wounded twice.</p>
<p>After returning home from the war, he went to work at a local Machine Shop and continued to race at wherever a track could be found. On October 12, 1946 a meeting was held at the Rex Hotel on Peachtree Street in Atlanta Georgia. "Big Bill" France, Red Vogt, Buddy Shuman, Jimmie, Raymond Parks and others were in attendance. This was the meeting that actually "formed" NASCAR. There were 12 or 13 people present when it was formed. Bill France offered him a chance to "buy into NASCAR" for $500.00 and he turned him down. He said, "it would never amount to anything".</p>
<p>Part of the appeal of the automobile to the average southern Piedmont boy, both before and after World War II, was the mechanical abilities that they had picked up in both the war, and in their own back yard. These backyard mechanics often worked late into the night, until they got their cars into shape from racing. Drivers frequently ran two or three races a week, requiring mechanical knowledge to keep the car running well.”</p>
<p>Jimmie Lewallen was one of these shady tree mechanics. His son Gary remembers helping his father, working late into the night. "We’d work 'till one, two, three o’clock in the morning trying to get the car ready for the weekend, having to do it about every night after school. It was a family deal.” These drivers and their families put their heart and soul into racing.</p>
<p>Jimmie Lewallen was one of the original drivers that competed in the first race that was sponsored under the NASCAR banner at the old Charlotte Speedway. Lewallen finished 16th in that race winning $25 for his efforts in a 1946 Ford.</p>
<p>France and his group ran the 1948 season as a test year for the company by running strictly stockcars and a modified series. The actual first season of strictly stockcar racing occurred in 1949. Jimmie raced "officially" from the inception of NASCAR. The France family says it started in 1960 on the "Grand National Circuit", the "Sportsman" Circuit and the "Modified" Circuit. The GN circuit is now the Busch series but then it was the "CUP" series.</p>
<p>He went on to compete in 139 Cup races through 1960. Though he is not credited with any Cup wins, he finished second four times. Jimmie did most of his racing in the Modified and Sportsman series, where he won dozens of events.</p>
<p>In 1950 he won the Modified Championship at Bowman-Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, NC.</p>
<p>In 1953 Lee Petty Engineering running in the NASCAR Grand National Division expanded and ran a Dodge Diplomats for Jimmie at Palm Beach Speedway, finishing second to Petty. Both cars were prepared in the Randleman, NC Petty engineering shops.</p>
<p>Jimmie's NASCAR career spanned some 12 years and from 1953 through 1955 he finished in the Top Ten in the points standings.</p>
<p>Although he continued racing professionally until 1975, Lewallen joined what is now Vann York Pontiac and worked there for 39 years. He also was a co-founder of the Old-Timer Racing Club.</p>
<p>Jimmie lost his battle with cancer in 1995.</p>

<p>Ron Eliran, long considered "Israel's Ambassador of Song", is a one-man show combining the best of Israeli Traditional with the best of Contemporary International. Eliran, who was born in Haifa, Israel, received the "Violin of David Award"—which is the Israeli equivalent of the "Oscar" and "Grammy" combined—for the hit song "Sharm-El-Sheikh".</p>
<p>Eliran has toured extensively throughout the world, performing in a variety of languages. Most recently he was a guest performer at the "Budapest Festival of Freedom" where his original composition became the Festival's official song. Eliran also wrote both lyrics and music for the Broadway hit show "Don't Step On My Olive Branch", and for the widely acclaimed show "Nightsong", in both of which he starred.</p>
<p>Eliran has captivated audiences on Israeli and American TV as well as in live performances in New York's Carnegie Hall, in Washington's Kennedy Center, in London's Albert Hall, in Montreal's Place des Arts, and in Los Angeles' Music Center.</p>
<p>In the wake of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, Eliran, together with Gad Yaccoby, then Israel's UN Ambassador, wrote a song about the late Prime Minister's life. Eliran performed his poignant song in front of a crowd of 200,000 people at "Rabin Square" in Tel Aviv as part of a live nationally televised tribute for the fallen leader.</p>
<p>On August 31, 1997, Eliran performed in Basel, Switzerland, at the Centennial celebration of the First Zionist Congress. His performance took place in the same hall where Theodor Herzl first prophesied the birth of the Jewish State exactly 100 years ago. Eliran sang with the Basel Symphony Orchestra a song he wrote named "If you will it…" about Herzl and the Zionist saga.</p>
<p>Whether in an intimate club or in a big hall like Madison Square Garden, Ron Eliran is a distinctive voice who brings his people's roots to life with love, nostalgia, humor and showmanship.</p>

<p>Maurice John</p>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>Maurice “Maury” John (born in 1919; died in October, 1974 in Ames, Iowa) coached at Moberly Junior College in Moberly, Missouri; Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa; and Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. His teams compiled impressive numbers throughout his career.</p>
<p>A graduate of Central Missouri State (1941), his teams first attracted national attention at Moberly. John was a breathtaking 280-79 (.780) in his twelve seasons there. His Greyhounds won two national junior college championships (1954, 1955). John was inducted into the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Hall of Fame in 1984.</p>
<p>Taking over at Drake for the 1958-1959 season, John had to compete in the stellar Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). Bradley, Cincinnati, Saint Louis, and Wichita were very worthy opponents; Tulsa and North Texas were not as strong. Basketball purists loved it when John would coach opposite the big names in the Valley --- Chuck Orsborn (Bradley), Ed Jucker (Cincinnati), John Benington (St. Louis), and Ralph Miller (Wichita). Outstanding competition notwithstanding, John was named MVC Coach-of-the-Year an incredible four times, and three years in a row (1964, 1968, 1969, 1970). On February 27, 1971 against St. Louis, Drake fans were chanting, “Don’t go, Maury, don’t go,” but it was too late. He had signed a contract that afternoon to take over at Iowa State after thirteen seasons in Des Moines. He was 211-131 (.617) as coach of the Bulldogs.</p>
<p>John’s 1968-1969 Drake team was known probably more than any other. For serious basketball fans the names of some of the Drake players (Willie McCarter, Willie Wise, Dolph Pulliam) roll off the tongue, and the team is discussed in reverential tones to this day in Des Moines.</p>
<p>Once at Iowa State, John described (James H.) Hilton Coliseum as “an $8 million palace,” and he was 43-35 in three seasons there. John ended his ties with the Cyclones in July, 1974 because of illness, and he died on October 16, 1974 in Ames.</p>
<p>John may be best remembered both as a magnificent recruiter and as a coach who was ahead of his time. He was in step with Hall of Fame coaches Al McGuire of Marquette and Ralph Miller of Wichita --- they saw African-American players as skilled performers on a basketball court and amiable people off of it, while the general population may have seen them in a negative, noncontributing role off the court, but in an acceptable role on it.</p>
<p><br />
Notable Games and Accomplishments</p>
<ul>
<li>the February 6, 1961 game in Peoria against Bradley, stopping the Braves’ 46-game winning streak there (DU won, 86-76),</li>
<li>the December 11, 1961 game in Des Moines against eventual national champion Cincinnati (DU lost, 60-59),</li>
<li>four championships in five tries at the Queen City Tournament in Buffalo, New York in the 1960’s,</li>
<li>four MVC titles won outright or shared (1964, 1969, 1970, 1971),</li>
<li>the December, 1968 game against Al McGuire’s Marquette Warriors in Des Moines (DU won, 68-63),</li>
<li>the March 8, 1969 MVC playoff game against Louisville in Wichita (DU won, 77-73),</li>
<li>the March 20, 1969 NCAA tournament game against John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins in Louisville in the Final Four (UCLA won, 85-82),</li>
<li>the November, 1970 publication of John’s book, Drake’s Belly-Button Defense,</li>
<li>the March 13, 1971 MVC playoff game against Louisville in Peoria (DU won, 86-71),</li>
<li>the March 18, 1971 NCAA tournament game against Notre Dame in Wichita (DU won, 79-72, in overtime),</li>
<li>the March 20, 1971 NCAA tournament game against Kansas in Wichita (DU lost, 73-71; the game was John’s last at DU), and</li>
<li>the magnificent three-year run at DU (1969, 1970, 1971) when the team went 69-20, and</li>
<li>the start of a turnaround at Iowa State the moment John arrived in Ames.</li>
</ul>
<p>John was named the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) Coach of the Year in 1969 while taking Drake to the Final Four. He was chosen for the MVC Hall of Fame in 2000.</p>
<p>John’s death drew scant attention in Sports Illustrated. It said simply that he was “a former national basketball coach of the year.”</p>
<p>No coach has matched his winning percentage at Drake (. 617), and no Drake coach has been to the NCAA Final Four since he was (1969). No Drake coach has been to the NCAA tournament three years in a row like John was (1969, 1970, 1971), either.</p>

<p>ANACS was created by the American Numismatic Association (ANA)to correct major problems facing the coin collecting hobby, namely counterfeit coins. The ANA is a not-for-profit educational association for collectors of coins, tokens, medals and paper money. The ANA is chartered by the U.S. Congress. In the 1970's, the ANA board of governors saw action was needed to remedy the confusion created by the counterfeit and altered coins that were flooding the coin collecting industry. Their solution was ANACS, the American Numismatic Association Certification Service. ANACS began with only two experts located in Washington D.C. Washington was chosen to be nearby to use the Smithsonian’s Numismatic Collection and the services of the Treasury Department. ANACS certified its first coin as genuine on June 15, 1972. As the need for its services grew additional experts were added to ANACS staff.</p>
<p>In 1976, ANACS was moved to Colorado Springs where the ANA had its headquarters. Three years later, ANACS began grading coins using the book “The Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards for United States Coins,” that the ANACS staff helped to create. Coins were given a technical grade for each side, "the obverse" and "the reverse". The service became very successful and within a few more years ANACS was grading nearly 3,000 coins a month. Today the ANACS grades about that many coins in a single day.</p>

<p><b>ayecove.com is dominated by coves of the north west of scotland with a little help from their friends.</b></p>
<p><br />
Ayecove.com was born on the web in March 2005. After many suggestions that we (a sound group of coves) really needed a place on the web to all be able to come to to interact and catch up, and with no idea where to start or what to call it, a google search was carried out. On finding out how easy it is to own a website for yourself I got going. Humming and Hawing on a name (cove had to be in there somewhere) I decided ayecove was the best pick of many (like nahcove, soundcove and bigcove!).</p>
<p>Why? The site is aimed at keeping a close group of friends closer, though distance separates us further. The majority of the sites members are from the fair Isle Of Lewis, though we also have many members in the form of friends gained over our time served on the Mainland of Scotland. The site gets visited by people on all continents of the world. Because so many friendly coves, back then and still today, work overseas and on ships we need this to be a home from home for them, to keep them in the loop and make them sure we haven't forgotten about them.</p>

<p>I have added a one liner for my site along with text copied from my sites 'Background' page. The material is not in any way copyrighted, i know this as i created the website and wrote all the text and took most of the pictures, all the other pictures/text on the site was provided to me by friends and family and is also not copyrighted. i hope this is enough, i'm not sure what else to say.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-23_78e5.html" title="Edit section: Ellesmerocerida /Cephalopoda">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ellesmerocerida /Cephalopoda</span></h2>
<p>Ellesmerocerida comprise the ancestral nautiloid stock from which all other cephalopod orders were derived. All Cambrian and lower Canadian (Early Ordovician) nautiloids as well as many upper Canadian representatives are included.</p>
<p>Ellesmerocerids exhibit wide morphologic variation. Primitive forms are minute cyrtocones with closely spaced septa and a marginal siphuncle bearing sort septal necks. Overall ellesmerocerids are characterized by moderate endogastric curvature, and a marginal siphuncle with irregular diaphragms, ellipochoanitic septal necks, and thick complex connecting rings. Variations include annulate orthoconic longicones, exogastric breviconic cyrtocones, forms with thin connecting rings, and those with subcentral siphuncle.</p>
<p>Ellesmerocerida have been divided into three suborders, Plectronoceratina, Ellesmeroceratina, and Cyrtocerinina. Plectronoceratina form the ancestral stock which originated in the Late Cambrian. Only two families are known. Ellesmeroceratina form the bulk of the order with six families, three of which, the Ellesmeroceratidae, Baltoceratidae ,and Protocycloceratidae are major. Only three families, each represented by a single genus, are assigned to the Cyrtocerinina.</p>
<p>Plectronoceratina consist of forms in which siphuncle material is expanded into the chambers where unbounded by septal necks, forming siphuncular bulbs. Siphuncles are fragile and poorly preserved, with rings composed mostly of organic material. Transverse partitions in the siphuncle known as diaphragms are irregular in form and erratic in distribution where found. Septa are close spaced, the siphuncle is small and ventrally located. Two families are assigned, the Plectronoceratidae for straight to endogastrically curved forms and the Balkoceratidae for those that are exogastrically curved. Plectronoceratina originated in the Late Cambrian and form the ancestral stock not only of the Ellesmerocerida, but of the entire cephalopoda.</p>
<p>Ellesmeroceratina consist of ellesmerocerids in which the connecting rings are well calcified, are appreciably thickened, and may show layering. The siphuncle is ventral, diaphragms are rather common. The predominant and core family, the Ellesmeroceratidae, consists of laterally compressed shells with short phragmocones and rapidly expanding apices. They may be straight or endogastric.</p>
<p>Cyrtocerinina are ellesmerocerids with well calcified connecting rings that extend as bulbs into the siphuncle cavity. Necks may be short or long. The three recognized genera are quite distinct from one another and are each assigned to its own family.</p>
<p>Septa, dividing the chambers in ellesmerocerids, are generally closely spaced. In Plectronoceratina as many as 35 may occur in a distance equal to the corresponding diameter of the conch. The opposite extreme is encountered in some baltoceratids were the cameral interval approximates the diameter of the conch. Ellesmerocerid siphuncles range in size from one-half to one-fifteenth the corresponding conch diameter. Forms in which the siphuncle occupies one-third to one-tenth the conch diameter predominate. An exception to the usual ventral position is found in the Shideleroceratidae, in which the siphuncle is central or subcentral. However the inclusion of this family in the Ellesmerocerida is of doubtful validity.</p>
<p>Five major nautiloid orders are derived from Ellesmerocerida. The Endocerida come most likely from within the family Endoceratidae with the lost of siphuncular diaphragms and the addition instead of endocones. Actinocerida came from the Cyrtocerinina, most likely from Bathmoceras, with further development of endosiphuncular deposits. Discosorida are though to be derived from Plectronoceratina. Michelinocerida (Orthocerida to some) are derived from the Baltoceratidae, a family of the Ellesmeroceratina. The fifth, Tarphycerida are thought to come from Bassleroceratidae, which are derived from Ellesmeroceratidae. Whether basslerocerids should be included in Tarphycerida or Ellesmerocerida (Ellesmeroceratina ) is debatable. Where the Barrandeocerida and Oncocerida fit with respect to Tarphycerida is yet uncertain although Tarphycerida seem to be the root stock. Oncocerida is considered the root stock of serious or orders leading to modern Nautilus . Thus we can trace Nautilus back to the Ellesmerocerida in the Early Ordovician.</p>
<p>The Michelinocerida gave rise to a completely different sort of cephalopod, first to the Bactritida and Ammonoidea, and ultimately to modern coleoids – cuttlefish, squid , and octopus.</p>
<p>Finally, the Endocerida, Actinocerida, and Discosorida are dead end groups, with no derived orders.</p>
<p>Although the Ellesmerocerida are confined to the Ordovician Period, their progeny are still with us.</p>

<p>Kirkcaldy Town JFC were formed in June 2005 by Ian Duff and Dean Kerr. Since then, the team has seen many players and coaches go by. The coaching staff now consists of Ian Duff and Stanislaw Ocimek who make a good partnership. The team play thier home matches at Ravenscraig Park in Kirkcaldy and play thier matches in a non-competitive Fife Football Development League (FFDL). In thier first season they played seven a-side in the Central and East Fife Soccer Sevens Association League (CEFSSA). Kirkcaldy Town have got a very healthy number of players, including team captain and central defender, Scott Donaldson and top goalscorer, Callum Stalker (19 goals). In this thier first season of 11 a-side, the squad hope to improve scorelines and performances. However, all our players enjoy themselves fully, no matter what the scoreline is! <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Fck.jpg">Image:Fck.jpg</a></p>

<p>a radiation sensor consisting of a set of or multiple parallel plates that are placed in the path of a radiation beam. This sensor is commonly used in radiation therapy systems where it is necessary to monitor the delivered dose of radiation to a tumor.</p>
<p>The plates, which enclose a gas, are subjected to a polarizing voltage. When a radiation beam crosses the plates, it creates ionization in the gas. The resulting ions will collide with the plates and create small currents that can be read by external amplifiers to which the plates are connected.</p>

<p><b>Black Aura on an Angel</b> Black Aura, based on a true story, is a romance thriller that depicts the devastating effects of a woman's mental illness on a blossoming affair. When Angel meets Phaedra, she is instantly captivated by such a beautiful, mysterious woman. The two embark on a torrid affair, and soon fall passionately in love. Shortly after, Phaedra begins having jealous rages over Angel's imagined infidelities. Angel's dearest friend and psychic, Jennings, seeing what Angel can not, warns her to get out, but she is in too deep. Black Aura on an Angel explores sensuality, insanity, and salvation and asks the question, "If you try to save someone, can you lose yourself?"</p>

<p>fuckpaypal.net is a PayPal Critical Site.

<p>The site is linked to the webmaster's main page, silic0nsilence.com.<a href="http://www.silic0nsilence.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.silic0nsilence.com" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> The webmaster began the page in April 2006, after purchasing the fuckpaypal.net domain. The webmaster, who calls himself 'silic0nsilence', started the page after a buyer scammed him during a sale, and PayPal offered no assistance to gain back his money or property.</p>

<p>In October 2005, 'silic0nsilence' put a laptop up for bids on eBay. He had excellent feedback, and had sold in the past. The winning bid went to 'RH'. He uses this name to protect the buyer. After the buyer sent the payment via eBay's <a href="../../../p/a/y/PayPal_ad69.html" title="PayPal">PayPal</a> payment system, silic0nsilence shipped the laptop. When the buyer received it, he praised the seller. About a week later, the buyer placed a chargeback on his credit card stating the item was not as described. PayPal allowed the chargeback even though a return policy was not stated. The seller attempted contacting RH several times, with no luck. The seller was out $615, and the laptop. He contacted PayPal through email and their hard-to-find telephone number. He was continously told to 'wait 75 days' so that PayPal could attempt to get the funds back. After 75 days, he contacted PayPal again, only to have them tell him to 'wait 75 days.' Fed up, he contacted the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Business_Bureau_a595.html" title="Better Business Bureau">Better Business Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>In April 2006, the website was online. silic0nsilence began telling his story to the world, and offered PDF documents and names as evidence. A picture of him is shown holding a sign that says, "FUCK PAYPAL." Imposed on the picture are the words, "They may win.. But I'm going down swinging'" Under the image, the words "Justice will be served is displayed." The page then tells his story, and offers several updates, the first being added on April 7th, 2006. Around this time, he was contacted by NCO Financial Systems, a company PayPal hired to obtain the money. Frustrated and getting no answers from PayPal, he decided to sue the company.</p>

<p>In May 2006, silic0nsilence filed a Small Claims suit in Clarkstown Justice Court. The trial date was June 13th, 2006. 5 days before the trial, PayPal's Senior Litigation Paralegalist Michelle Squires contacted silic0nsilence. She argued that PayPal did attempt to get the property back, but failed. She also told him that a clause in the PayPal User Agreement stated that he would have to file a claim, and travel to California where PayPal was located to dispute and problem. She threatened that if he went on with the suit, their lawyer would file a 'Motion To Compel', which would halt the trial, and force silic0nsilence to pay PayPal's lawyer fees. 20 years old, and threatened by PayPal, he agreed to settle as long as PayPal gave him information about the buyer so that he could commence in a suit against him. They complied and did so.</p>

<p>In July 2006, silic0nsilence's article 'Getting Screwed by PayPal' was published in 2600 Magazine. This brought much attention and support to him and his site. Since receiving the buyer's information, he attempted contacting him several times with no luck. It was time to put an end to the frustration after almost a year, and file a suit with the buyer. silic0nsilence was contacted by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_People%27s_Court_6919.html" title="The People's Court">The People's Court</a> to show his case on television. He agreed to show the threat of PayPal fraud on national television. However, RH declined. The trial's set date was August 15th, 2006.</p>

<p>On August 15th, 2006, Clarkstown Justice Court Judge Flick awarded silic0nsilence default judgement against RH after he did not show in the amount of $671.12. This was the money silic0nsilence asked for, along with interest and court fees.</p>

<p>silic0nsilence now has to wait for his money. If not paid, RH's wages can be garnished. After he is paid, he plans on paying back PayPal, and finally being able to close his PayPal account.</p>

<p><br />
Ma.Lourdes Pascual Manliclic(a talented girl). Born last September 10, 1990 in Cabanatuan City bloomed at last. It was the first baby girl, pregnancy of Dorotea Manliclic her mother. A daughter of a good man became a mayor of Gen. Natividad- Nueva, Ecija gained the throne for only one term. And admired to join politics again but unluckily, he lost his turn because of usual fraud. Her father’s named was Mario Manliclic. She had 6 brothers and 1 sister. She’s the 7th in the siblings. She studied nursery stage at the age of 4 but as her mother’s response, “Madessa, nah not yet ready for school. Still called a baby, always bringing a bottle of milk and nap at class time.” Moreover, she continues studying. At the preparatory stage, at the age of five she graduated at J.C.L.C (Jesus Christ Learning Center).</p>
<p>At young age, her talent in singing sprouted. Her parents discovered it when, “hoy dad, tignan mo yung anak mo! She’s shaking her shoulder while at the same time the graceful music sounds.” That was it. The first song she learned was “Pearly Shell”. She danced while singing. Next song was Wooden Heart; Tomorrow; If We Hold On; Sulyap and move on through years she learned many songs…ECT. In the Politics Period: campaign, Madessa usually sang. The exposure blasted that time. She sang with no shyness.</p>
<p>As time goes by, there was a confusing problem about family. Life brought a miserable thing. That was when her father addicted in gambling. No one can stop him from being addicted. He lost a lot of money. The time comes, when no money to lose. He tried to borrow from a bank, and it was over. Family increased many bills and it was bankrupt. Happiness turned over. No more money, all properties sold out. Her family transferred other residence to bring new life. Their destination went over in Silang, Cavite. Her family found once more the beginning not the ending. They made new business, a rice center with poultry supplies and reloading station. In addition, as I think it became successful. In one branch made it to 4 branches. (2 in Silang, 1 in Carmona and Rosario-Cavite).</p>
<p>Madessa studied her grade school moment (1997-2003) in Silang Central School- a public school but high quality teaching. Singing talent was her asset to grow popularity. As time goes by, her hidden talent in singing blooms again. Her teachers exposed it. She joined many contest at last. High school life comes up then. She studied in Cavite Institute a.k.a CI. (First and second year). She met several friends and great teachers. Her talents boost and enhance more of it. Not only her singing skills but also others, revealed. She got a several achievements because of joining extracurricular and organizations. Challenges never stop her changed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, another trial approached her. It was the saddest thing for her. The memorable date (first day of school) that was June 6, 2005, her mom transferred her from new school, Rosario Institute (R.I). It was so dispiriting. She dun no what to do. She really does not want to transfer other school. It was so disgusting. Pains are running all over through her veins. She wants to shout loudly, and tell the world what she felt when the destiny brought her to this miserable moment. The depressing insight conveyed into her life. She wanna tell all of you people, she do love you deep inside her heart. Hope to see you again. She really misses the bonds of Mahogany, now called Makiling.</p>
