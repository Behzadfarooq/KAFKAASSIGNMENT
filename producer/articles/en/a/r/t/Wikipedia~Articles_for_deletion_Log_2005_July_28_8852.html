This and its various allied "universities" appear rather notorious in this business and get several hits on news sites in connection with fake degree scandals. As we have articles on several of these interconnected Liberia-registered diploma mills, I find it completely reasonable to have articles on the people who actually run the scam.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Running a diploma mill isn't much of a personal accomplishment.

<ul>
<li><s>I am not an expert on this, but as I understand it, these diploma mills are rather ephemeral entities; as soon as one name gets too compromised, the business moves over to another one. They also work in fake "networks", complete with their own accreditation organizations, as a way of falsely reinforcing the image of respectability they strive to maintain. If anything, I would suggest an article on the proprietors is <i>more</i> motivated, whenever they may be identified, and we should have the various diploma mills and other scams they have been running merged and redirected to the biography. That would have the additional advantage of making monitoring for POV edits easier. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - It appears to me that this person is a victim of mistaken identity. She has offered to send a copy of the settlement of the lawsuit, which she says acknowledges that her being named in it was an error: "As far as I can tell my name appeared in a domain registration a few years ago, of which I had no ownership. I owned a web hosting company and I believe that at one time an employee used my credit card to register a customer's domain. The information was corrected (about a week later) but ever since my name appeared on a domain I do not own I have been harassed, stalked, defamed and even threatened by certain misinformed individuals." I think based on this that she's clearly a victim of circumstances, and otherwise non-notable but respectable person. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 11:19, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article does not make any judgement call on what is or is not anarchism. The disambiguation header explains that this is one usage of the term, and that other political philosophies use the term different, and that those other uses can be found on the disambiguation page. As for removing the AC section, there isn't any point for it once the article has been disambigated, because AC philosophy is no longer being described in it. I'm happy to put a reduced version of that section back, as Nat Krause agreed, if that was the limit of AC referance on the page. And I don't know what you want RJ, but you are in fact overemphasizing capitalism in the general article by including AC counterpoints and perspective throughout. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 19:29, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a disambiguation article. It does not serve the purpose of letting "the reader choose between different pages that might reside under the same title." The title of the article says it's disambiguation, but it's not, at least not in accordance with guidelines. Also, therefore, there should be no link to it. I also helped create the so-called disambiguation page and supported it, but have come to the realization that its improper. The logic behind the guidline becomes clear when one sees what it's being used for, by anti-capitalist POV individuals such as Kevehs. The guideline is there for a reason and now we can cleary see what that reason is. The article is clearly inconsistent with Wikipedia guidlines and should be deleted. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:34, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Kinda funny how you never noticed that when Hogeye was shoving his POV into it, ah well. Anyway, but this article does "let the reader choose between different pages that might reside under the same title." It clearly directs the reader to both the anarchism page (under the anti-capitalist meaning which is far more predominate), and the anarcho-capitalism page (under the AC meaning). So, if you don't think this is directing the reader as described above, what exactly would? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 19:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>You don't understand that guideline or are being purposely obtuse. It's saying that if there are other things that are called "Anarchism" then there can be a disambiguation page to direct people to those other meanings. For example, such a page would let the reader choose between "mutualism" the economic theory, or "mutualism" the biological phenomenon. "Anarcho-capitalism" is not another meaning of "anarchism." It's a TYPE of anarchism. Anarcha-feminism is not another meaning of "anarchism." It's a type of anarchism. Anarcho-primitivism is not another meaning of anarchism.

<dd>I'm already aware of that, and that is precisely the point of the page. It is there to refer not to anarcho-capitalism as another meaning of anarchism, but to the meaning of anarchism that anarcho-capitalists use. It is clear that they use a different meaning, because they feel anarchism entails things that none of the other anarchists do. Further, the standard anarchism definition has not been allowed to be used in the anarchism article because of objections solely coming from anarcho-capitalists, which again arise from the fact that they use the word anarchism to mean something else. And that is exactly what the disambiguation page makes clear right now, it shows both meanings and links to the articles that use them. Now perhaps you are suggesting that there should be a specific anarchism (capitalist) article to deal with their different understanding of anarchism. That is fine, then it should link to the disambiguation page and then provide links to the AC article from there. But either way is fine with me. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevehs_18e7.html" title="User:Kevehs">Kev</a> 21:21, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Wasn't this (more or less) what Hogeye was fighting for earlier? I see RJ's points in that this isn't really a classic "disambiguation" case where there are two completely different meanings or contexts of a word; it would be nice if everybody could agree on one "broad tent" that could fairly encompass all the varieties of anarchism, capitalist and socialist alike. But it doesn't look like <i>that</i> is ever happening, and I, for one, have no desire for eternal edit wars. A disambig page, and sub-pages giving the definitions of anarchism as seen by the disparate movements that use the word, is the best that can be hoped for. Let's all at least agree on this, and then work to "tweak" all the pages into a state that fairly presents their subject matter. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 00:51, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</s> On second thought, <b>Delete</b>... the latest edits to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> have removed the need for this, so we should probably stick with <i>that</i> instead. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 01:24, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Above vote was made before I found the section on anarcho-capitalism in the main anarchism article. That strikes me as reasonably satisfactory. The problematic thing, then, is that the link to the main anarchism article on the dab page reads "Anarchism (anti-capitalist)", when in fact it points to an article that is not entirely about anti-capitalist anarchism. That, plus the fact that the {{Anarchism}} template doesn't mention anarcho-capitalism. But if the main article points to the anarcho-capitalism article, we don't need the dab page. So: <b>delete</b> the dab page, and <b>add</b> anarcho-capitalism to the {{Anarchism}} template. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 06:13, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- there is a lot more in the supposed disambiguation page than disambiguation; there is no ambiguity between these two, <i>Anarchism</i> means anarchism per the manifesto, or more generally as supporting abolishment of all forms of government; there is a reason the word <i>Anarcho-capitalist</i> is used, the very use of that word <i>implies</i> a difference from Anarchism, and that it is not what users will be looking for when they want Anarchism: let <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> briefly explain the distinction and link to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 02:48, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy deleted</b> by me. Not a sentence = not an article. The band may or may not become worthy soon, but deletion is not an assessment of the value of the subject, just of the article. At present, the band is unsigned, so there wasn't really a need to list on RfE, but the <i>article</i> was a phrase without a verb. That's criterion #1, inter al. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:30, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, are you folks dipping into the forbidden cookies? "In the future" is not an argument about the article one way or another. In the future, it will be the future. At <i>present,</i> it's <b>advertising,</b> and, in case no one has read the deletion guidelines lately, that's a no-no. Secondly, if we do play that game and think of the future, this will be an article about a single iteration of an ongoing event -- a single wrastlin' happening. Only those with some significance, some impact, some effect on contexts other than fan delight are <i>requiring</i> an encyclopedia article. I surely wish folks would pay attention to the deletion guidelines every once in a while and not vote "keep" on anything that happens to square with their hobby. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>So by your logic, everything after 2005 in Category:Films by year has no right to exist until the day it is released, because until then it is nothing but shameless advertising. <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 17:46, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it doesn't exist, the article is speculation, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. If it is not merely speculation, but hype, then it is advertising, so yes. What on earth is anyone doing thinking that there should be an <b>encyclopedia discussion</b> of something that doesn't even exist yet? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:28, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My take: in the case of a film, it should have be decided on a case-by-case basis, but <i>very</i> few films should have articles about them before they are released. If a film were a) so important that it was being written about in mainstream newspapers <i>in the news section,</i> and b) the article stuck to verifiable facts about the state of the film at the time of writing. For example, if someone discovered a print of the famous lost 1926 movie version of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>, and it was in the process of being restored, that would deserve an article describing the circumstances of its discovery and its restoration. On the other hand, there is no reason in the world why we need an article on <i>The Dukes of Hazzard</i> prior to its release and review. Until then, fans can sate their curiosity at imdb or the studio's website.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your opinion that she is a "G-list celebrity" is irrelevant. She has 17,600 google hits.

<li>Comment: I agree with you about precedent and consistency, and I'd have pointed to the same thing: We ended up <b>merging</b> those contestants to X-X-Idol-Season-1 and Big-Brother-Season-X. I.e. the contestants weren't allowed to spin-off into the distance with stand alone, would-be biographies, but were largely merged into cast lists and season lists, except for those contestants who managed to do something or be something that got them attention <i>outside of the show.</i> The winners got articles, therefore (because they got record contracts), and any who got arrested or wagged their weenies at Paula Abdul, etc. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:48, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>These are 1) Posed in Playboy at some point (when? is it out now? is it just posing, but not appearing yet) and 2) is going to be on a show on E! <i>that has not been shown yet.</i> Now, again, if there were no MTV reality show mentioned in the article, how would this be an article?

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The intro clearly states that it is a list of <i>prominent</i> Nigerian people. Actually, very few lists of people have a "famous" or "notable" qualification attatched to their title. It seems to be understood that lists of this type include "notable" people only, since there are Wikipedia articles on them. We have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_physicians.html" title="List of physicians">List of physicians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chefs.html" title="List of chefs">List of chefs</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_stand-up_comedians.html" title="List of stand-up comedians">List of stand-up comedians</a> and very few people seem to interpret those as attempts at listing <i>all</i> the physicians, chefs and stand-up comedians in the world - or calling it "professioncruft" or something similar. Why treat Nigerians differently? Generally, it seems to me as if most lists of people on wikipedia naturally adjust the notability bar in accordance with the size of the group the selection comes from. If this article lists Nigerians of some international fame, it can easily co-exist with a longer <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nigerian_footballers_110e.html" title="List of Nigerian footballers">List of Nigerian footballers</a> with footballers that are notable on a national level. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 17:49, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>At the time of nomination there was no intro that stated that it was a list of prominent Nigerians. Now that the page has developed into something more than a single non-wikified name I'm willing to change my vote to <b>keep</b> as well. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansonc_a277.html" title="User:Hansonc">Hansonc</a> 22:32, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: to clarify, if I'd had the chance to vote on list of Alaskans, list of Chicagoans, or list of Martians, I would have voted delete on them too. They're just not encyclopedia articles; they're phone book pages, without any data, and they'll never be accurate because they won't be complete. WP is NOT a trivia game or a directory.

<li>Categories, people, this is what categories are for. Still, I think we need to treat this as a matter of policy rather than deletion, so we can implement the same policy (be it lists, categories, or both) across the board without the "it isn't being done with X so we can't do it with Y" arguments.

<li>To Geogre and Kappa, as well as Skysmith and RJFJR above: There is actually a clearly stated official policy that the list article's title should not include "notable" or something similar. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Lists" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Naming conventions#Lists</a> says <i>"Put a list of Xs as list of Xs, rather than Xs, famous Xs, listing of important Xs, list of noted Xs, list of all Xs, etc."</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Lists (stand-alone lists)#Naming conventions</a> goes on to specifically mention lists of people by nationality (obviously not such a strange concept to those involved in writing the naming policy), saying <i>"People are either <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Finns_69d2.html" title="List of Finns">list of Finns</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">list of French people</a>, preferring <b>List of _ people</b>".</i> Any concerns about this probably ought to be discussed over at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a>, rather than here. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 10:59, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Comment: There are several pros with a list, which have been mentioned in other discussions. Most inportantly, it can contain red links to notable people who haven't got articles yet. This can actually stimulate the growth of Wikipedia and, in this specific case, possibly help counter systemic bias. Another argument is that it helps navigation. Since categories contain subcategories, a top-level list with the most notable names provides a good general overview. Clicking your way from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_people_3b8b.html" title="Category:Nigerian people">Category:Nigerian people</a> through <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_people_by_occupation_90c5.html" title="Category:Nigerian people by occupation">Category:Nigerian people by occupation</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_sportspeople_ca1a.html" title="Category:Nigerian sportspeople">Category:Nigerian sportspeople</a> down to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_footballers_4a9b.html" title="Category:Nigerian footballers">Category:Nigerian footballers</a> to find <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Jay_Okocha_263e.html" title="Jay-Jay Okocha">Jay-Jay Okocha</a> isn't all that convenient. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 10:35, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: The "red links" become a problem when there are many poorly maintained, redundant lists, each with conflicting name spellings (especially non-English names). It's easy for a newbie/novice to create an article with the same name on such a list, without realizing it's not the same person. That's less likely to happen with a stub. These "red links" are bad way that people by-pass vfd process for non-notables. A non-notable person can get on such a list much easier than they could get an article, causing a problem later with a notable person with the same name comes along. Anyhow, I've now realized my problem is with wikipedia's list policy, and not specific to the Nigeria list. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:32, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> After reading the <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com" class="external text" title="http://www.symphonyos.com" rel="nofollow">SymphonyOS web site</a>, a few things are now clear to me. First is that Orchestra is functionally equivalent to Microsoft's HTML Applications (now essentially dead); it uses an HTTP server to render the interface of what amounts to a CGI script, then displays it in a modified version of Gecko. Second is that it's nowhere near done, as evidenced by the lack of development documentation. Finally, the entire distribution is basically a Knoppix clone otherwise. It's not clear to me that this is a notable advance in computer science or even in Linux application design (any random Linux sysop can use Mozilla to render CGI apps hosted on a local computer), <s>so I stand by my nomination.</s> I think that the future versions of Windows are all but guaranteed to come out (Vista is approaching beta) and are highly notable besides, so it's not exactly predicting the future to talk about them. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 20:45, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We can quite happily <b>delete</b> Plastic Taiwan and it will still be here, like that german coin that looks like a nickel that keeps showing up in your pocket or change purse. Its about viral marketing of their own music. A paper flower without artifice, since its already inside your brain, and will come back to haunt you, it doesn't need to be kept here. Even without a mention on Wikipedia, Thick Shoe and Plastic Taiwan will remain as notable as they are, so no harm will be done by deleting their poster, which will show up in a different context and mean another different thing. Next time it will mean "these bricks cannot be resold as used bricks without removing the wheat paste" or "These shoes have been resoled without reference to the ordinary every day".

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> Surprisingly, this <i>doesn't</i> appear to be copyvio. I've done some googling and can't find anything like it, though it is notable, perhaps, that the [<a href="http://hideout.wtks.com/main.html" class="external text" title="http://hideout.wtks.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">page for this show</a>] links into this page as information on its history. If the history is verifiable, though, this seems to be a show with a long history and might be considered notable especially given the set of programs not on vfd at category:radio programs (2 Sense especially comes to mind) and category:radio programme stubs. If <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opie_and_Anthony_2c23.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a> on XM manage to land a spot there, a program on a major radio station in a city like Orlando would seem equally notable. While XM may have national coverage, its subscriber base isn't exactly massive. I personally don't feel that the criteria for non-notable has been met, but I'm not exactly convinced on the matter. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 06:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> This show has a solid history and strong affiliations with legendary broadcast institutions such as WJFK FM, a heritage radio station in a top 10 radio market.

<dd>True, but since 62,960 of these are from their own homepage I stilll dont think this is a very good result.

<li>Keep. Why are people saying "Wikipedia is not a commercial, for-profit advertisement service."? This is in no way a commmercial or for-profit website. The people running the website have no particular interest in getting more people to the site since virtually every law student at a big school is aware of it already. A ton of far less notable sites have unchallenged wikipedia entries because they deal with computer- or technology-related topics that wikipedia editors are typically more interested in. I have no affiliation with the site and thus no "vanity" interest - I'm just saying that this site is definitely well-known among a large group of people and is thus undoubtedly encyclopedic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> If Brian Leiter's Philosophy Gourmet deserves a page, this site surely deserves a page. The list of posters is a quick reference for posters new to the board who have trouble with the way the board works. Unlike other message boards, there are no avatars, no personal pages, no sigs, no images, nothing. It is helpful to have a place to find basic information about the most influential people on the board. As someone who has been using Xoxohth for most of its existence, I recognize many on the list of prolific posters. I would hardly expect this to be the case with new posters. The acronyms section is also indispensable to users who are new to the board. Otherwise, there's a steep learning curve to properly use and understand the board. 208.63.200.3 02:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC) (Graham Wellington, QC [as above])</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep. This website is an extremely valuable source of information for those either going to law school or thinking about going to law school. This website is starting to be mentioned by scholars (Posner, Leiter) and has been mentioned by the Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. This website is growing and more people will be looking for information on it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Very strong keep. This website is becoming a more and more important source of information to law students and even to admissions committees of law schools. As a result, people outside of XOXOHTH have begun taking notice of this site. The Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania Law School has mentioned XOXO, as have legal scholars such as Brian Leiter. The relevance of this website is continually growing, and soon each of the 100,000+ prospective law students per year want to learn more about XOXO.</li>

<li>I suspect that notability is moot, and that this subject is simply <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">too secret</a> for Wikipedia. Reading in between the lines of the nomination by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnvernon_5030.html" title="User:Johnvernon">Johnvernon</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnvernon_dc67.html" title="User talk:Johnvernon">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnvernon_3e38.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnvernon">contribs</a>) and taking into account that user's earlier edits to this article and the repeated mentions of a "private collection", my suspicion is that this article is derived, possibly in toto, from unpublished sources, namely the private papers of a royal servant, held by his family, or an unpublished biography written by a family member. So we have a very serious verifiability problem here. I've looked around for other sources, but cannot find this person mentioned anywhere. (The only person that I can find is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/de/BobSanders/HMSPenelope81.html" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/de/BobSanders/HMSPenelope81.html" rel="nofollow">a William Gardener who was an Admiral's Steward</a>.) It seems that the famous U.K. tradition of royal servants keeping their mouths shut and staying out of the limelight has been upheld and upheld well in this case. The article is well written and laid out (I encourage <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnvernon_5030.html" title="User:Johnvernon">User:Johnvernon</a> to make other contributions to Wikipedia, on subjects where sources can be cited, if they will be like this.) and it is a shame to have to have to vote this way. <b>Delete</b>, unless sources are cited. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:09:38, 2005-07-28 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> given borderline notability and author's request. However, as a genealogist myself, I can say that Uncle G's comment that the information is "too secret" is not really the case. Even if it was taken from private records, almost all of the information (births, marriages, deaths, residences, etc...) for the periods covered in the article is of a type that is readily available in public records to anyone with access to a major genealogical collection - which includes almost anyone within driving distance of a major metropolitan area. Also, as to the author's assertion that a copyright of a 100+ year old photograph belongs to a "private collection", that is also incorrect. The fact that someone <i>claims</i> a copyright to a work that is clearly in the public domain due to its age should not cause us any concern. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:20, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - not notable. The author has created several articles on churches with no established notability and most containing no substantive information other than geographic location and the fact that the church is growing.

Some of the other articles could conceivably be merged with articles on the specific ethnic group under the heading of "Religion". Granted, the articles as they currently stand are pretty pathetic, but most are viable stubs. Sarcelles should be encouraged to write more in each article rather than spitting out 10 stubs a day, however. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> 14:10, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

In the absence of the presentation of any evidence of non-notability for any of them, I say <b>Keep All</b>. Please count a keep vote from me in each case. And lets not bother with the "google test" please. If these groups exist, and no one has so suggested that they don't, the articles should be treated in the same way as articles about comparable groups in the United States. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 15:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> At least in the general articles (EG Korean churches and Vietnamese churches), "church" is a poor choice of words if it is meant to cover all houses of worship, and arguably POV if only Christian churches are to be included; and they don't have any content not obvious from the title. Other than <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Family_1d59.html" title="Jesus Family">Jesus Family</a>, most could probably be deleted for lack of encyclopedic content, but I'd certainly rather see most merged/redired than kept. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:41, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, without specifics, "growing" isn't very meaningful, and in at least some cases probably has verifiability issues, as do some of the location citations. Not much other content in most of the articles. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:50, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thanks for the imput. For a bit of "explantion" the site is only 6 months old. JesusMan has been published in several alternative and undergroung magazines in MA, on and odd since 1987. Myself and Hex have begun the series anew on the net. It will have 100 pages by the end of the year. Your choice, again I was shocked when a fan pointed out that Rubbersuit Studios was listed here, so I just took the next step. Thanks again for the intro for this WikiNoob. 22:16, 28 July 2005 (UTC) Malach</li>
<li><b>Question</b> would it be within Wiki's webcomic guidlines to list <i><b><a href="http://www.rubbersuitstudios.com/stoolsample.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rubbersuitstudios.com/stoolsample.htm" rel="nofollow">Stool Sample Webcomics</a></b></i>, which is a subdirectory of [[Rubbersuit Studios], which contains 6+ original webcomics and is close to 100 pages? I would list it as Stool Sample WebComics, and a description of each title 15:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)~ Malach
<ul>
<li>I'd suggest waiting. Once your comics become popular enough, someone, probably a fan, will get around to writing up a Wikipedia article for it. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 18:37, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Carnildo, that is the main issue I have. I am not the one who put Rubbersuit Studios in Wiki. A fan pointed it out to me that someone had added it here. I thought it would be the next logical step to add JesusMan. JesusMan does not have a ton of fans from the web site but it was very popular in hard print. Anyways thanks again for the critcism.

If someone of this nature is looking for a place that does provide these types of artisitc services, then they would have Wikipedia to credit for finding such a notable and worthy place.

<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of a right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

<dd>That's interesting about the other website. I would be interested to know exactly what they said, and who this "local historian" is. Honestly, on the face of it, it seems a huge interpolation to link some graves found in Houston to Heath, who is regarded as an historical footnote who had a claim to Carolina but never tried to colonize it. The notion that he decided to plant a colony in Texas is quite a stretch, and doesn't seem to have been written about by "legitimate" historians. That's why I would consider this "original research". --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 16:20, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Dear Pedant,

I've been browsing Wikipedia for some information and 
decided to take a look to see if Spiral   Dynamics was
being discussed. I was surprised to see that it was included
in your online mentions; thus, I did a little tweaking to
improve the accuracy (FYI this is a model my partner
Chris Cowan, coauthor of Spiral Dynamics, and I work
with - please see our web references below.) Thus, I
believe we are qualified to make adjustments to the definition.

The reason I am writing to you is the factual accuracy
of our competitor's bio (Don Beck) and the content of the current Spiral Dynamics definition on Wikipedia. I've copied the bio below and inserted notes
as to the questionable entries. Your site suggests that
if 5 or more items are incorrect to insert a dispute.
I have done that and the warning has been eliminated.
You will find the disputed items below under "Issues"
where I have itemized statements requiring fact checking.
In essence, yes, we have a professional interest in this,
thus disclosure applies (we are rather fierce competitors).
At the same time, I feel that the reputation of this work
can stand only on fact and accuracy, which is what I am
seeking by contacting you.

The current definition of Spiral Dynamics suffers from
some inaccuracies which I attempted to fix; it was reverted
to an earlier version. For example, there is no credible
evidence of "the Mean Green meme" under the Pathologies
section. I have reason to believe that the person making
adjustments to the current entries has some interest in
skewing this due to his/her affiliations. To make matters
more complex, and more sensitive, we are involved in a
legal dispute with our former partner, Don Beck. This
matter could get quite antagonistic if it isn't handled well,
which is why I am contacting you. Your description suggested
I could count on your discretion in a sensitive matter. 

Could you please advise as to how to proceed? 

Kind Regards,
Natasha

PS. See below ...



<b>Don Beck</b> is an American management consultant
involved in the theory known as <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiral_Dynamics_1fc9.html" title="Spiral Dynamics">Spiral Dynamics</a>.

Issues:
1) The term "integral theory" is a marketing term
designed for promotion which a number of people 
are attempting to legitimize and using Wikipedia to do so
2) Greater accuracy would be "coauthor of the book, Spiral Dynamics"
3) Spiral Dynamics is a trademark and refers to training, 
a book, and a popularization of a model of adult development (not a theory)

==Overview==

Beck has elaborated upon the work of his mentor, 
<a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare_W._Graves_c4c8.html" title="Clare W. Graves">Clare Graves</a>, to develop a
<a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">multidimensional</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model.html" title="Model">model</a> for
understanding the transformation of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">human values</a>
and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultures</a>. As cofounder of the
National Values Center in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denton%2C_Texas_f669.html" title="Denton, Texas">Denton, Texas</a>, and
<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> of the Spiral
Dynamics Group, Inc., Beck is employing the
<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiral_Dynamics_1fc9.html" title="Spiral Dynamics">Spiral Dynamics</a> model to effect large-scale
systems change in and among various sectors and
<a href="../../../s/o/c/Society.html" title="Society">societies</a> of the world.


Issues:
1) 95% of Spiral Dynamics is derived directly from
the work of Clare W. Graves; there is no elaboration
to it other than some conjecture and the link to
memetics - in fact, Spiral Dynamics is a popularization
and simplification of the work or Graves designed to
appeal to a broader market - it's a contraction rather
than an expansion.
2) The non-marketing definition of this model is as a
'psycho-social developmental model' -  
3) The final line has no supporting evidence other
than marketing claims, a fact check is required.

==Career ==

Beck's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Management_consulting.html" title="Management consulting">consulting career</a>
has taken him to such diverse settings as <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_Downing_Street_fec5.html" title="10 Downing Street">10 Downing Street</a>
to consult with <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair's</a> Policy Unit;
the south side of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> to address
the problems faced by inner-city schools; the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>
to consider the future of <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>; and
the boardrooms of major banks, energy companies, airlines,
and government agencies. Following 63 consulting trips to
<a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> between <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>,
he wrote <i>The Crucible: Forging South Africa's Future</i> (1991) with Graham Linscott.

Beck taught for twenty years at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Texas_430f.html" title="University of North Texas">University of North Texas</a>.
He served as team psychologist for The South African <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springboks.html" title="Springboks">Springboks</a>,
winners of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and associated with the
<a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_Saints_b2f5.html" title="New Orleans Saints">New Orleans  Saints</a>, the
<a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_26c0.html" title="Texas Rangers">Texas Rangers</a> (baseball), and the U.S. Olympic
Committee for Men's Track and Field. He writes a
“sports values” column for the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Morning_News_212f.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a>. He lives in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denton%2C_Texas_f669.html" title="Denton, Texas">Denton, Texas</a>.

Issues:
1) The first line claims that this person has consulted
to the Blair government, this requires a fact check
2) The item with the south side of Chicago has not been verified
3) The World Bank item is being put across as consulting
to the WB - does a single 1.5 hour presentation where
he was not invited back consist of consulting?
4) Consulting to various boardrooms - there is no evidence
to support this other than claims on his website - a fact check is required
5) How can a person without a degree in psychology serve
as team psychologist?
</pre>
<pre>
(the part about consulting to the Springboks also requires a fact check)
6) Have the claims for the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints,
Texas Rangers, and US Olympic committee for Men's Track
and Field been verified - we've checked and have been unable
to confirm any of these claims.
7) The "sports values" column would be accurate with the
start and finish dates, which were some years ago and not very long lived.

<p>I think this is advertising as well, self-promotion. The text is <b>gibberish' <i>and contains</i></b> <i>no references <b>except to works by, apparently, the original author of the book being promoted, this seems to be promotional in nature and</b> original research <b>to boot. And the above</b> spam</i> is enough to bat it out of the park in my opinion.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 19:04, 2005 July 28 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. That you don't like a book or a theory doesn't mean that it is non-notable. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22spiral+dynamics%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22spiral+dynamics%22" rel="nofollow">google</a> lists 30,300 hits for the exact phrase "spiral dynamics", at least the first several pages of which refer to the subject at hand. I reverted an anonymous user's edits. That anonymous user now appears to be Natasha Todorovic, the partner of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Cowan_6742.html" title="Chris Cowan">Chris Cowan</a>, one of the co-authors of the book. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spiral_dynamics&amp;diff=19620268&amp;oldid=16108614" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spiral_dynamics&amp;diff=19620268&amp;oldid=16108614" rel="nofollow">Her edits</a> were POV, poorly written, and evinced little understanding of what Wikipedia is all about. That's why I reverted them, not for ideological reasons. I invite her to make more appropriate contributions to the article. --<a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a> <big>ॐ</big> 19:53, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, pseudoscience is completely legit encyclopedia material, theres a wikiproject called pseudoscience. Also it is obviously a real theory, 480,000 yahoo hits is enough to prove that. The writer of this article is an expert on the subject, but it is not the writer's theory, he just writes about it. Clare Graves seemed to have came up with the theory, but she's not writing the article. Does need NPOV editing though. <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUber_nemo_c380.html" title="User:Uber nemo">Uber nemo</a> 20:06, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would appear that the entire world of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Template%7EIntegral_theory_bab6.html" title="Template:Integral theory">Template:Integral theory</a> could use some POV policing and contextualization in order to avoid commercial promotion. Some effort should be put into finding views from outside the "Integral theory" universe to cite and then keeping vigilant over the inevitable revert wars.

<li><b>Keep</b> – no valid reasons given for deletion. Contrary PoV to an article isn't cause for removal. They should contribute to improving it, such as providing the needed references. The subject is notable and a candidate for encyclopedic coverage, even if in the current state it needs improvement. Clearly a topic with published works is not original research to Wikipedia as was charged. Nominations that <b>bold</b> the words so liberally should be encouraged to delay a bit to enable more cogent reasoning. (It's not the <i>nature</i> of a topic that renders it non-notable, it is the unpublished work of a single person or few people not widely known— not the case here) --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 11:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was hoping I could get a second opinion on this matter regarding edits to this page, related to edits by this <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.200.47.176.html" title="User talk:24.200.47.176">IP</a> who created this <a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhu_5ae4.html" title="User talk:Akhu">account</a>. I have been monitoring the edits associated with this account since July 15, and of late, I have become increasingly skeptical of the intentions of this Wikipedian's edits. I have been very patient with this Wikipedian since the beginning, writing extensively in an encouraging manner how edits to Wikipedia should be made. Although I have been skeptical from the beginning, I decided to "assume good faith" and was hoping that the user would understand that his or her editing style will need to be modulated to resonably expect any of their content to remain on Wikipedia. (See the extensive disscusions on the user and article's talk pages for example.) However, recently I noticed that the exact same content was being duplicated on French Wikipedia. See for example <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=24.200.47.176" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=24.200.47.176" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. In fact, in French Wikipedia the article was placed up for deletion, and I am inclined to feel that this should be done here as well. The site has some content that is meritable, but perhaps not encyclopedic enough to warrant an article. At the moment, the page seems only to be more geared towards promoting the content of the external site. I'd appreciate any thoughts or opinions on this VfD here.

<li><b>delete</b> I'm from the french wikipedia and today I have propose to delete this article (it's exactly the same in french, just translated, see <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicNovatory" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicNovatory" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, if you want, you can follow the french votes here <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Pages_%C3%A0_supprimer/28_juillet_2005" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Pages_%C3%A0_supprimer/28_juillet_2005" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.

<li>Wikipedia is not a memorial. The issue is notability.

<li>So lets go and delete entries for extinct animals, old TV shows, and the deceased, because who cares, right? You say it's doomed to be forgotten, yet it keeps being brought up. It's only doomed because you guys keep deleting the articles we write over and over again. As for notability, enterthedream.net <a href="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=55" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.enterthedream.net/webcomicbookclub/full.php?cid=55" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> hosts reviews for EOI and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28comic%29_7eef.html" title="Penny Arcade (comic)">Penny Arcade</a> did a legitimate crossover <a href="http://www.elfonlyinn.net/blinddate1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elfonlyinn.net/blinddate1.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> with them.

<ul>
<li>Extinct animals are not forgotten. Being deceased or killed is not the reason for encyclopedia, neither for exclusion. Please stop playing word games. "We guys" request proofs of notability (i.e., reason why other people would want to read the article); e.g., a review somewhere.

<p>In this article's defense, I like to note that according to The Notability and Inclusion Guidelines, a webcomic need only comply with the Alternate Proposal to be considered acceptable. I counted weeks of comic strips, and came up with roughly 80 weeks, doing random sampling per month to ensure there weren't bouts of guest strips. That more than surpasses the 33-week requirement. I have not yet counted the number of strips in the EOF archive, but the first few months were every other day upates, the remaining months were sporatic updates; usually 3 a week. I could count 100 strips without breaking a sweat. As to the author of this article, I honestly don't know if it is Josh Sortelli or not, but I doubt he would return from hiatus to write a wiki article and not update his comic. Regardless, if there are suspicions I'll be happy to re-write it myself. Saxon 05:55, 3 August 2005 (UTC) (GTJoe, just figured out how to sign things)</p>

<li>Fine! I give up. I've proven this comic meets the notability requirement. The author and I have both mentioned this comic won an annual webcomic category award and was nominated for another. I've provided a list of links with reviews. Since I know I've done more research than any of you and still no one's mind can be changed, I change my vote to delete. Now we just have to go through every single other webcomic on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">list</a> and delete the ones that don't fall into these lofty, unwritten standards you all have. I simply find it ridiculous this particular comic is being singled out while hordes of lesser comics and their stubs abound, so lets make sure we don't leave the purging unfinished. Saxon 07:46, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Web Cartoonist Choice awards are a joke even in the webcomic community. And, incidentally, I did put a couple of webcomics that fell below the bar on VFD just today, so, at least in my case, your veiled accusations of hypocricy ring false. If there are webcomic articles that <i>legitimately</i> need to be put on VFD, by all means do so. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>) 08:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reads like an advert. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 22:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As the owner of the site, this article needs to be deleted. People who are far to cowardly to discuss their problems with the site openly have used the article to openly attack us, and the moderators here have allowed it to occur. Deletion is the only solution we can settle for at this point, my staff agrees to this point, and so do my members. If this is what the owners of Wikipedia consider "fair and balanced", I pity anybody who has to endure their services being listed here. <b>Delete</b> - Don McGunigale</li>
<li>As a staffer on MMM, I agree that this wiki should be deleted. It was a good idea at first, and while I can perfectly respect criticism, the edits done to the article went past that. Given the choice, I`d personally try to rewrite that to reflect all sides in an unbiased manner, but ce la vie. Let the thing die and rest in peace. <b>Delete</b> - The Sh33p</li>
<li>The so-called "Vandalisim" has actually been a desire to present a more fair and balanced point of view. However, as MMM's staff can't stand criticisim, they won't be happy unless they can control this article. So I say <b>Delete</b> in order to avoid furhter controversy. <small>unsigned vote by user:202.92.76.129 -- <small><a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF9900">Jtkiefer</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/t/k/User_talk%7EJtkiefer_123b.html" title="User talk:Jtkiefer"><font color="#00A86B">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jtkiefer_1273.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jtkiefer"><font color="#FF0033">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jtkiefer_4fd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jtkiefer"><font color="#0000FF">C</font></a></sup></small> ----- 00:53, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>Note that the previous unsigned user was the person who threw in the erroneous information in the first place. Note also that they have a record of vandalism. Doesn't sound like "fair and balanced" to me. I vote <b>Delete</b> simply so that we don't have to deal with people like that anymore. ~AA</li>
<li>This computer is a part of an office network - as such there are numerous users under the one IP adress. As such, the "vandal" is just one of many users who would register under the one IP.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, veiwing the article from a neutral outside viewpoint does leave me with a desire to comment. The "clean" version of the entry reads more like an andvertisment or blantant promotion then an encylcopedic entry. The "vandalised" version reads like the work of somone with a personal grudge. I would say <b>Delete</b>, but I would also add that the article probably shouldn't have been created in the first place. --202.92.76.129 22:56, 29 July 2005 (UTC) (But not the same one as above)</p>
<ul>
<li>As another user on the same network as the previous poster, I feel that its worth mentioning that <b>someone</b> on this IP knows a lot aobut Zoids - check the other edits by the same IP address for proof. All the other articles they've created or edited on Zoids thus far have been well done and, in my opinion, free form any bias or the like. Having no experience with "MMM" thus far and not knowing anything aobut Zoids, I can only assume that they are rather knowledgable on the subject, and that their statements on the subject in the other articles are reasonably informed. Of course, that proves nothing, as it could be the work of two differnt people, both of whom are knoledgeable on the subject (But with one of them having a considerable grudge or possibly a vaild reason for his edits to the article). At any rate, I agree that htis article is not encyclopedic in nature and more pormotional, and should be <b>Deleted</b> --202.92.76.129 02:29, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete.</b> Delete for non-notability, but "weak" because I don't like what I see as being the stronger motivation behind this deletion - i.e., someone connected with this particular subject is basically not comfortable with it appearing in a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>. I do realize this has become an unmanageable nuisance for those involved, but look at it this way: What if, say, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Rove_7dbe.html" title="Karl Rove">Karl Rove</a> decided he didn't like what people were writing about him on Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 03:21, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We tracked the IP to a member of our forums, and from there, we tracked that name to another forum where personal grudges against our site run rampant. Just for the record. ~AA</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> To put it one way, the article is not something you would find in an encyclopedia. Just because you have a personal grudge against a site doesn't mean that you should be using something akin to an encyclopedia as a soapbox for your cause. Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, but it shouldn't be taken too far. -- Pkninja</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Not an encyclopedic entry; it alternatively reads like blatant propmotion or blatant whinging. Either way, it should go. --144.138.25.8 22:58, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As the authour of the Various <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids">Zoids</a> articles done on this IP, I do feel the need to comment here (Yes, I have no connection to the others in this IP above). I was not responsible for the "vandalisim" to the MMM article; while I have had some overly negative experiences with the MMM staff, at the same time I would not stoop to the level of defecing a Wikopedia entry on them as a measure of revenge or similar. Despite this, I must agree with the earlier comments; this article probably shouldn't have been created in the first place and should be <b>Deleted</b>, not for the reasonss of Vandalisim or the like, but because it simply is not encyclopedic and the original article was more likely an attempt at free promotion. I must also agree with <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> ; I feel the MMM staff are being too thin-skinned about this; they must understand that in an article like this, critcisim is a possiblity and they should not try to "control" what is said aobut them. --202.92.76.129 23:07, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that said criticism is actually completely erroneous- we have proof- and stemming from a site with a history of disliking us? Last I heard, this was a site for disseminating correct information, hrm? Don't add things that you obviously have no real knowledge in!</p>

<dl>
<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of a right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

<li>Right, the only reason I'm not a "delete" is that I feel a little uneasy about deleting a policy proposal, however misguided, when we could also just slap a "rejected policy proposal" tag on it and keep it for the record. We could also just <b>userfy</b> it as we've done with other such unpolished proposals. Just a little uneasy about an out and out delete is all, this is definitely not a a full keep vote though. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:13, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Normally I'd agree with you, but in this case, this is not so much a proposed policy; it's more of a declaration of intent by a single user. SuperDude didn't apply the {{proposed}} tag to it. I wouldn't oppose the "rejected"/userfy idea you propose, but only if SuperDude supports it. Surprisingly, he hasn't chimed in yet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 13:09, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Spam. 4 results on google for "podchive". Article was created by User:Idastudios and if you go to the top google result for podchive it says the page website is from "INDEPENDNET [sic] DIGITAL ARTISTS". Aside from this obvious spam and self promotion, the article itself says stuff like podchiving "became popular in late 2005", and in conjunction with the 4 total google hits, it doesn't meet notability requirements. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 00:08, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>
