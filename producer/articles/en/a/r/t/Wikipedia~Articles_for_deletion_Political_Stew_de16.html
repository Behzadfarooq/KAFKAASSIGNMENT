<li><b>Keep</b>. As stated by another user the page has been displayed on Wikipedia for three months until it came to the attention of the user nominating for deletion. (Burmaduck). Burmaduck, if the alias serves as the same as his handle on the site, is a person renowned for spamming the Lonely Planet website which he has continued to do for the last five years due to a failed legal action for plagiarism and once banned from the Political Stew site for grotesque racist abuse of certain members now tries to spam Political Stew. If this is the same Burmaduck he personally threatened one of the site administrators of Political stew who subsequently filed a complaint with the police. The motivation behind Burmaduck's request for deletion is more likely to be out of spite and has probably little or nothing to do with any contravention of the WED.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.15.71.151 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.71.151.html" title="User talk:82.15.71.151">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.71.151_97c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.71.151">contribs</a>).</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b>. The claims by Burmaduck are biased as he was banned from the forum and was involved in a near-legal fight with the current administration of the forum. I think this site is in line with paragraph 1 of the WP:WEB guidelines, as it is a collection of published material of whom the majority cites its sources in well known international broadcasting agencies such as Reuters and the BBC. If it is not, then WP:WEB is against the nature of Wikipedia, as it only offers the chance to a handful of websites to be included in the directory. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Manos_4cb7.html" title="User:Dr. Manos">dr. manos</a> 4/24/06 01:18GMT+2.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Issue of self-promotion seems odd as author never advertised the link on the Political Stew forums - was found independently by a user - nor anywhere else. Site is a non-profit and Political Stew is an obscure combination of words to be considered promotion. Google search for Political Stew does not show wiki link in top results. Given historic links with Lonely Planet and frequent discussion of it on their forums including contributions from their site admins, suggestion is keep. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.205.208.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.205.208.99_2b97.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.205.208.99">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Delete</b> Lies and more lies. The above poster has on numerous occassions told us of his intentions to tie the site in with a national newspaper or corporate sponsors.

<li><b>Keep</b>: A quick lookover of the WP:Web criteria and the site in question shows that Political Stew does indeed meet said criteria. Burmaduck's intense crusade seems hardly founded in concern for the wellbeing of Wikipedia and appears to be little more than a petty personal grudge. His comments should be treated with more than just a grain of salt. However, caution should be taken lest he spam Wikipedia with gay porn links as he has done with both the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree and the Political Stew - this fact can be verified by moderators of both sites. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 218.45.215.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_218.45.215.130_5205.html" title="Special:Contributions/218.45.215.130">contribs</a>) .</small>

<p>We are a bunch of cheap and workshy lawyers who will be prepared to take up the case of why Wikipedia should put this article up.

<p>Apologies to all at Wikipedia but this page has unfortunately been hijacked for a legitimate protest at the actions of the owners and administrators of the Political stew site. Banning people without reason and failing to give a justifiable reason is just not on. We are not going to just go away so sadly all other forays on to external sites by PS will be subject to this kind of attention. Bashtard</p>
