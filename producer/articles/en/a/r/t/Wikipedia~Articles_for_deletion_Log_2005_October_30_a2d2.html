I'm not surprised there's some google presence, since his web pages appear to have been around for several years. Having a website to promote yourself is not really a claim to fame. I'd say <b>delete</b> unless some significance is established.

<dd>Yep, it was a mistake. Yes, you did correct it. However, it taints your future edits in the eyes of others (me at least). Please, don't be surprised if subsequent edits are given a greater deal of scrutiny as a result. Also, in the "reason why she left", you put your *opinion" that her replacement was unqualified (with no citation of who said it). We go by a neutral point of view at wikipedia, not bias. You're not welcome to push a one-sided opinion in any article. When you stick the facts, and avoid your own personal opinion, you'll find your contributions welcomed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:54, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rob the change "reason why she left" was NOT my opinion I put the opinion based on local newspapers articles (they don't seem to be on the internet or I would give you link to them) Personally it doesn't matter to me, I just think the correct info. should be posted without a political agenda. Infact I like your idea of "future edits .... greater deal of scrutiny" I think all edits should need some kind of process to prove it is fact.

<dd>First, getting an account, would be good, as it provides a better way for people to communicate with you. As it stands, any page you use, is shared with others (who probably don't care for the conversation). Second, you can still cite a source if it's a newspaper. Check out various other articles which do this, and take a look at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Essentially, information such as publication name, date, page author, etc.. must be provided (especially if there's no url). If it's a quote, you put in quotation marks. You must make clear its an opinion *not* state it as fact. You must also show other opinions, including the subject of the article's opinion (which is probably the replacement was qualified). Around here, if something's unverifiable, than it's as bad as being false. As for enforcement, verifiability is easy to enforce. We just delete and revert unverifiable claims, as I did with the <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Kadis_f939.html" title="Susan Kadis">Susan_Kadis</a>. I don't have to prove a claim is false to remove it, just that it's unverifiable, which is much easier. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 13:18, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I actually created the original of this article and was surprised to see it up for deletion. He was the 'National Director of the B'nai Brith League for Human Rights' If you'd like, call them up and ask them, but it is true. Second, even beyond his political career which <b>is</b> noteable in the community (fought for accountability and transperancy on a corrupt school board, recycling advocate at city council) and many expect him to challenge Mario Racco for the Provincial Liberal nomination in Thornhill. He was also a 'special advisor to the prosecutor' in the Jim Keegstra Hate Crimes trial in Alberta and is listed on Ernst Zundel's website as one of his detractors. Furthermore, he was never fired from B'nai Brith and was absolutely not asked to leave the School Board. Is he as noteable as Elinor Caplan or Paul Martin? No. But is he noteable enough for his own wikipedia entry? Absolutely. Remember, we are trying to build a massive resource here, with information for everyone. <i>Edit</i>: If you ask me, all of the Vaughan Councillors should have their own wiki entrys. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 05:10, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rob you are accusing me of "ballot stuffing"? I am responding to false information posted not stuffing the ballot. pm-shef we will see if this article is taken down and if it is kept up then I will post the crimminal activity backed with documents from the York Regional Police, Toronto Police, RCMP and B'nai Brith Canada. You are tring to say that your father is notable enough to have an article posted but he has to get his son to write it and defend it. I am all for keeping it up as long as more notable people are kept up. How can you justify Alan Shefman being posted who served only a few months as councillor and no other current councillor or current or former Mayors posted (I posted former Mayor Lorna Jackson the other day) or even other people like Andrew Stronach (Frank Stronach's son and brother to Belinda) who got deleted the other day. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<ul>
<li>*rolls eyes repeatedly*, This is starting to get rediculous. Let me clear some things up.
<ul>
<li>Yes, I am Alan's son</li>
<li>Alan does not even know that this page exists, I wrote it after finding the City of Vaughan entry and noticing that none of the councillors had sites. Since obviously I know more about Alan than about the other councillors, I made his first, as I said before, I am in the process of making entries for the other councillors as we speak</li>
<li>I very much support your posting of a Lorna Jackson article, she is very deserving as one, as are a number of former and current councilors.</li>
<li>Finally, about this "only reason" junk, please get a grip. How many people do you think use wikipedia to find themselves a human rights consultant? Probably none. I posted this article for informational purposes, and if it is kept, I will expand it. Alan <b>is</b> a noteable person in Vaughan, and if it bothers you that much, I'll agree to remove the external link at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, I very highly doubt you have any documents from the police. Especially since he didn't do anything illegal. And even if he did, the Toronto police don't have jurisdiction in Vaughan. Good try though</li>
</ul>
<p>Though on another note, if anon votes don't count (which I wasn't aware of) then do we not have a unanimous "keep" decision? <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 20:42, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>To Pm_shef I would send you a message privately but I don’t know how through here, so I will post it here. I am new and still don’t know how to use all the features here. I think this is getting a little ridiculous so this will be my last post here unless I am asked to answer a question.</p>
<p>It appears that we agree that if Alan Shefman’s article stays up then all the other members of Vaughan council should also be posted. You mentioned you will work on the others, I will also and we both could make changes as needed to all of them (that’s if councillors of a small city is notable enough for wikipedia which I think is questionable) I posted Lorna Jackson up and you appeared to agree with this posting. With all do respect I think we could agree that there are many prominent people in Vaughan much more deserving of an article than Alan Shefman. Among past Vaughan council members who do you think deserves a page? Susan Kadis and Mario Racco are already posted but not as past councillors as an MP and MPP. Do you think any or all of the following deserves an article. Former Councillors David Chapley, Bernie Green and/or Gino Rosati, what about former Mayor Garnet Williams? What about any other prominent Vaughan residents? The only others that I found posted are as following (there are probably more that I didn’t find). Former Chief of Toronto and York Region Police Julian Fantino (who is a personal friend) (wink, wink pm_shef), Former MPP Tina Molinari, Former Federal Tory Candidate Josh Cooper, Vaughan MP Maurizio Bevilacque, Vaughan MPP Greg Sorbara. You know wikipedia puts some derogatory remarks (that are based of facts) in articles, this can be found on the Vaughan page about Michael DiBiase and Julian Fantino’s page to name a couple. It should be no different with Alan Shefman’s.</p>
<p>On another note about your comment about Toronto Police don’t have jurisdiction in Vaughan. If a criminal act is committed within their jurisdiction (Toronto) the city that this person resides in (Vaughan) does not matter in certain criminal acts (for example some none violent crimes) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, Vaughan is not a small city it is the 10th largest City in Ontario and the fastest growing municipality in Canada. Second of all, yes I think former Mayor Garnet Williams deserves a page, though I personally don't know enough about him to write it. David Chapley and Bernie Green did nothing of any note for the community, though if you were to demonstrate that I'm wrong on that point then I would consider not objecting to their posting. I'm not quite sure why you "winked" at me after Fantino, neither I nor my father know him beyond in his capacity as former Chief of YR Police. Furthermore, if Josh Cooper has a site, after having done absolutely nothing of note besides running, and losing for Federal office, then why on earth shouldn't Alan? Also, you do seem to have a personal grudge against Alan for some reason, care to tell why? or who you are? <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 23:44, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pm_shef this will really be my last post. With a population of 235,000 Vaughan is still considered a small city, saying it’s the 10th largest in Ontario is not really saying much. In ten years or so it should be in the same category as say Mississauga. I think that Josh Cooper’s article was appropriate to be posted last year when he was a federal candidate but I think it should be deleted now, I think you would agree. I agree if Cooper deserves a page then Alan Shefman or almost anyone does but I let you know about Cooper because I was trying not to be biased. I will write an article about Garnet Williams, David Chapley, Bernie Green, Gino Rosati and maybe some others that I can think of that contributed to the growth of Vaughan if Vaughan Councillors including Alan Shefman stays up. I don’t mean this as an insult but you may be a little to young to realize this. Chapley and Green were the backbone of establishing the Thornhill we know today. Either Chapley or Green should be the Ward 5 councillor now, not Alan Shefman. If Alan Shefman’s page remains up then I will explain how he became Councillor. Notice how on Mario Racco’s page it mentions “under controversial circumstances” when he lost an election. Who you claim that Alan Shefman will challenge for the Liberal Provincial seat in 2007. Why doesn’t Alan Shefman challenge Susan Kadis for the Federal Liberal seat? He would have a better chance of beating her than Racco. It wasn’t that long ago that Racco beat Kadis. I winked because I know Fantino. I don’t have a grudge against Alan Shefman I just don’t think he deserves an article here or for that matter any Vaughan councilor, maybe the Mayor deserves a page. I live in Thornhill but I am sure you figured that out, last year my lawn had a green sign that kept disappearing. Lucky for me I put up a surveillance camera to see how they kept disappearing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>*raises eyebrow* So now you are accusing him of a crime. I suggest you be very careful with what you say, that could very well be considered slander. Once again, I challenge you to provide evidence of any real contributions Chapley or Green made to the City of Vaughan. I'm not aware of these "controversial circumstances" that you refer to, and since it wasn't in Thornhill, I am positive that neither Alan or Susan had anything to do with it since they are both Thornhill politicians. You also say that "either chapley or green should be ward 5 councillor now." Why exactly? What have they done for Thornhill? Furthermore, it seems to me that Alan received a clear vote of support from the electors, with almost 10% more votes than Green and over 10% more votes than Chapley in a field of 13 candidates. <b>Really, I think your above comment proves that the afd nomination was totally politically motivated and should be discounted</b> <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 04:01, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>My comment about Mario Racco's page saying "controversial circumstances" was just saying that they put these kind of comments up not that Shefman or Kadis was involved in Racco's lose. You have got to agree that Alan Shefman became a councillor under what is mostlikely the most "controversial circumstances" ever in Thornhill. Chapley or Green should be the councillor based on there past accomplishments and past experience alone. Alan Shefman was quoted and admitted himself in an article in the Vaughan Citizen and the Thornhill Liberal that he wouldn't have become councillor if it wasn't for the interference of Susan Kadis. Let me correct you, Shefman didn't get a clear vote of support it was Kadis that got it for him. Please answer my question about why Alan Shefman would challange Mario Racco for the Liberal Provincial seat and not challenge a weaker (based on results when Racco and Kadis ran against each other) Susan Kadis for the Federal Liberal seat. I think you would agree the Federal Liberal seat is a lot more secure than the Provincial Liberal seat. Many expect that Tina Molinari will be re-elected Provinicialy regardless if Racco, Shefman or Kadis runs Provincially. Is it possible to post a video clip on here? The accomlishements of Chapley and Green far and away exceed the accomlishments of Shefman and Kadis. As I mentioned before if councillor articles are posted then I will post Chapley and Green who are much more deserving of articles than most of the current councillors. I really don't think councillor article are appropriate for here, the only ones that I think are appropriate are Susan Kadis as MP, Mario Racco as MPP, Mayor Michael DiBiase and former Mayors Lorna Jackson and Garnet Williams <b>I think you have proven that the only reason you posted an article of Alan Shefman was politically motivated, you mentioned yourself that he is planning on challenging Mario Racco</b> which he will not stand an chance of beating Racco. P.S. you did a good job in cleaning up the Lorna Jackson article. It looks great!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, you have not proven anything. Especially since I said that all the <b>current</b> councillors should have pages. I asked you before and I'll ask you again, exactly what accomplishments to Chapley and Green have?

<li>Generally, the established precedent is that city councillors should only be on here if they (a) serve on the council of a major metropolitan city that's internationally known (i.e. Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver), or (b) are already notable for other reasons and their city council term is just an extra detail. A senior director of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Human_Rights_Commission_5529.html" title="Ontario Human Rights Commission">Ontario Human Rights Commission</a> meets criterion b, so <b>keep</b> this, but the precedent does <i>not</i> support a blanket permission to write up <i>everybody</i> on Vaughan's city council. A city of 235,000 people does <i>not</i> qualify for criterion (a). (Mayors are a different policy entirely; the precedent is much more unequivocally in favour of mayors having articles.)

<p>I am responding to the last comment about the criteria just to make sure I understand about criteria for Alan Shefman’s article. (1) I understand that as a city councillor of a smallish city his article does NOT meet the criteria (2) A Senior Director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission does meet the criteria but in order for this article to stay posted it must (A) be proven that Alan Shefman was director of communications and education for the Ontario Human Rights Commisission and (B) prove that this position was a Senior Director’s position. I have doubts that this position was and/or he was a Senior Director, lots of positions within Governement have “fancy” names to make them sound better than what they really are. I myself was a Census Commissioner for Statistics Canada which I can admit myself was a position that was nothing special or notable as every area in Canada had there own Census Commissioner with this title. I would estimate that there was about 450 to 500 people in Canada with this title during the 2001 Census. If Alan Shefman’s article stays then I will post an article of myself based on my “Census Commissioner” position with Statisitcs Canada. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>No, you won't. By your own admission, "Census Commissioner" isn't a high-power and high-profile job; it's one that about 500 other people hold at any given time. Being a senior director of the Ontario Human Rights Commission is <i>not</i> an equivalent position; it's high in the org chart, has a lot of authority, and there are never more than a handful of them.

<p>Good point I agree with your totally my profile does not belong here just as Alan Shefman's does not, please keep in mind that (a) Alan Shefman's article was posted by his son and (b) he never held a senior directors postion with the Ontario Human Rights Commisission he held a postion that is held by a few hundered people at any given time which is not a high-power nor high-profile position. If you are trying to say that his old position is more senior than his current position, let me ask you. Why would he take so many steps backwards in his career path, going from a so called "senior position" to self employed to school trustee to city councillor in a small city. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>First thanks for correcting your mistake on Susan Kadis's page. It looks good now as what is posted is the truth. If Alan Shefman's page stays because of his so called "senior directors" position with the Ontario Human Rights Commission then I will post all 200 or so current "senior directors” and as many as I could find of past “senior directors” of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. By the way, I was employed by the Ontario Human Rights Commission in the early 1980’s. My title was “Assistant Deputy Minister” The over 200 people across the Province within the Commission with the title “Director” in there name reported to me and was my responsibility. You still did not answer my question about why would Alan Shefman take so many steps backwards in his career path if he held such a high power position with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. The answer is because it was not a senior position. I guess I could get my son to list my profile here as I held a more "senior" position (even though I don't think I am notiable enough to have an article) than the so called "senior directors"</p>
<p>Here is a link to the role of “Assistant Deputy Minister” this is from the province of Alberta, <a href="http://www.pao.gov.ab.ca/learning/corpexec/adm-profile/role-of-the-adm.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pao.gov.ab.ca/learning/corpexec/adm-profile/role-of-the-adm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pao.gov.ab.ca/learning/corpexec/adm-profile/role-of-the-adm.htm</a> , it is similar to Ontario, I just couldn’t find anything from Ontario on the internet. They don’t even list the “directors” because it is not a senior position and is to low in the “ranking of positions” “directors” position within the government is similar to being a department manager at a department store or a grocery store. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.231.242.98 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.231.242.98.html" title="User talk:64.231.242.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.242.98_4546.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.242.98">contribs</a>).</small></p>

I'm going to again agree with Bearcat, this is relevant and the director position is senior. In fact, there is only one person who occupies position of Director of Communication and Education. That person works directly under the Chief Commissioner (the head of the commission) so to say that Alan's position wasn't senior is foolish. Anyways, I added more information, specifically about the help he gave to the prosecution in the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Keegstra_5264.html" title="Jim Keegstra">Keegstra</a> trial in Alberta and also info about the by-election in 2004 when he got elected... i thought that would make the article more relevant. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 05:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair, I should advise you as well that while Wikipedia doesn't specifically disallow such a thing, for purposes of maintaining objectivity and neutrality it's best if people don't write articles about their own family members. Much like the idea of writing about yourself, which is more explicitly frowned upon here, it's generally best to stand back with the understanding that if a direct relative of yours is genuinely notable enough to have an article, someone else will eventually write one. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per Zoe. Almost every hospital will have a lot of search results, but that does not make them notable. A hospital might be notable if it does unusual work or is a highly regarded research institution. Allen Hospital is not that kind of hospital, and is rather small, too. There's 6,000 hospitals in the United States, and probably 5 to 10 times that many in the world. In addition, articles on hospitals need periodic updating, which would be an enormous task with so many articles. Lists of hospitals by state would be large, but far more manageable. Even a table with basic information, like the city, number of beds and any specialties, like neonatal, would be preferable. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:57, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. While I see that some people find this to be a non-notable hospital, I'm sure that it matters to the community which is served by it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is notability the chief criteria for keeping articles on Wikipedia, or are we here to voice our comments based on the merit of the subject? If Wikipedia is simply a place to record the notable, then does that make Wikipedia nothing more than a validation of popularity? If so, then the value of Wikipedia is greatly deminished and I for one hope not. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 02:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability isn't the chief criterion; it's not officially a criterion at all, although it has been a de facto criterion AFAIK since Wikipedia began, certainly for the last two years. Notability is <i>not at all</i> the same thing as popularity. Notability is "The state or quality of being eminent or worthy of notice." Popularity is "The quality or state of being popular, especially the state of being widely admired, accepted, or sought after." In the United States, <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> is not popular, but is very notable. The composer <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schoenberg_ee5c.html" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> is also unpopular but notable. It is possible to establish <i>somewhat</i> objective guidelines for what constitutes notability within a given field, and this has been done for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">music</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographies</a>, and some others. There are however many fields where Wikipedians are unable to agree on such criteria, and on these, articles must be decided on a case-by-case basis and the decisions can be contentious in the case of borderline articles. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:39, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment, no vote (yet).</b> Devotchka is correct. In a Google search I found dozens of articles by the same title but they were ALL Wikipedia mirrors. (I didn’t know that there were quite so many sites feeding off Wikipedia.) I did find a very few hits with searches like “unification of islam and christianity” and some variations but none of those results hit to the “Association...” named in this article. There seems to be some sort of movement within Islam—small, perhaps, but big enough to get some attention—for unification of all the major monotheistic religions, or all religions, under the banner of Islam. I did find one site that was the text of a <i>fatwa</i> denouncing this movement and proclaiming that it was completely against Islam. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 05:08, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> - I am going to defend this article. This is my first article. I started this article on Oct. 12 as a way to gather and organize information about the CIA leak grand jury investigation. About the people, places, and process of the investigation. Before I started it I contacted several people that had been editing Plame Affair. I also put a note on the discussion page that explained my reasons for starting the article. There were no negative comments. This article is different from Plame Affair, which has a lot of political content. This article is a very bare bones article with little narrative, and no long narrative. It is a collection of information about the Special Attorney, Deputy Attorney, the lawyers of record. It is about the laws, the lawyer, and the court. I have started a half a dozen articles that link to this page. And expanded about a half dozen more that link to this page. There has been no negative comments about this page. Also, there has been no POV in this article. I spent a great deal of time, over 20 hours, researching the attorneys and courts. I verified every fact including emailing a law firm to verify information. I have read the rules for deletion, and do not see why this page would qualify.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 00:37, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This clearly should not be listed on AFD. The only question is whether the content of <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_leak_grand_jury_investigation_a072.html" title="CIA leak grand jury investigation">CIA leak grand jury investigation</a> should be in its own article or whether it should be contained within <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plame_affair.html" title="Plame affair">Plame affair</a>. Personally, I think it should remain in its own article, given the size of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plame_affair.html" title="Plame affair">Plame affair</a> already, but it would be nice if someone could make a section in there with an overview and a "<i>Main article: <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_leak_grand_jury_investigation_a072.html" title="CIA leak grand jury investigation">CIA leak grand jury investigation</a></i>" link. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 00:53, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, the expanding CIA leak scandel has spilled over into serveral articles, which is only natural given the gravity and scope of the case and on-going investigation.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Not sure this even rises to the standards of "just a road." A search for "Collins Circle, Albany, NY" on maps.yahoo.com results in "Collins Circle could not be found." A similar search on Mapquest does not find "Collins Circle" and suggests "Collins Place" instead, which turns out to be a straight road which is in Zip Code 12208 and nowhere near the University at Albany's campus at 1400 Washington Avenue, which is Zip code 12222, nor the one at 135 Western Avenue, which is in Zip code 12203. Mapquest <i>does</i> show a circular roadway of some kind near 1400 Washington Avenue on the campus, but while other campus roads are named ("Carillon Drive E.", "University Drive West") this one is not. Wait, Google Maps identifies it as "Evan Revere Collins Circle." However, a regular Google search that phrase shows "Your search - 'Evan Revere Collins Circle' - did not match any documents." I have to think this is just a driveway. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:31, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm new to this Wikipedia thing. I guess I should have read more about the process and rules. I thought I knew enough to start. I am trying to chronicle a new phenmenon in Christianity that has no leader ang goes by or has different names: 'the post modern movement', '<a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergent_church.html" title="Emergent church">emergent church</a>', 'organic church' and the list goes on. Some of these names are dubbed on them from within and some from without. This movement is something that I saw that was not represented in the Wikipedia database of knowledge. In a movement with no leaders or unified body, made up of individual expressions,the individual expressions are part of the informational structure of the movement. Example: like when covering the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Vineyard_Churches_77af.html" title="Association of Vineyard Churches">Association of Vineyard Churches</a> individual people, like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wimber_e1ad.html" title="John Wimber">John Wimber</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonnie_Frisbee_eb8c.html" title="Lonnie Frisbee">Lonnie Frisbee</a> are mentioned, and individual churches are mentioned like <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Airport_Christian_Fellowship_c67e.html" title="Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship">Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship</a>. I guess I started with the individual pages first and not the movement pages first. I guess I did it ass backwards - J. D. Hunt</p>
<p>p.s. I apoligize I couldn't find stuff on emergent church, I guess because I was using caps <b>E</b> vs <b>e</b> in looking for emergent, but other catigories i've tried come up nil'.</p>
<p>p.s. This info that I submitted is not copyrighted; it is taken off of a public disclosure page - J. D. Hunt</p>
<p>Someone mentioned signing up, I initially wasn't sure what that was about. I will sign up. I am not affiliated with any of these groups other than an aquaintence. I thought the Richmond, VA aspect of the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergent_church.html" title="Emergent church">emergent church</a>, as well as, other regions in the U.S. needed to be chronicled, as they are all unique facets of the whole movement. - J.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think that in cases of duplicated content, editors should usually just redirect and not bother with AfD (and if the page should be deleted rather than redirected that should be justified; in this case Engineering Week is a pretty bad title, since it could refer to several other things — perhaps a <i>real</i> disambiguation page could be created here).

<li>In order for it to be equivalent to an Oscar, it would have to have the prestige an Oscar has, the viewing audience an Oscar has, and the international recognition an Oscar has. My guess is that not one in a thousand people would know what the "AVN Award" is (and does it even have a name?) whereas if you say "the Oscar", nobody asks "Oscar who?"

<p><b>Keep</b> I feel though the show can be seen as degrading to women, the women in the films know what is going to happen when they sign up for the show and can say no at any time. It is a fetish for some men and some women and this may be an interest to those who it isnt a fetish of as you'd find that a lot of people havent even thought of the concept and would find it quite bizarre. This article could act as warning not to watch the series to those who would find it offensive and either way it is unlikely those who were not looking for this article would stumble upon it.-john <i>(Unsigned edit by 81.139.49.250)</i></p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Denni notes that the site is offensive. So Wikipedia is censoring offensive material? Not everything in life is pleasant, but Wikipedia is supposed to be unbiased. Soon it will turn into something people don't trust if things are deleted because they might offend someone. I can understand deleting offensive pictures, but if we are turning into censors, people will not trust the unfetterd flow of information that Wikipedia is famous for. <i>(Unsigned edit by 67.185.234.168)</i></p>

<p>I'm getting a couple of warning bells. First of all, the article is created by Jan Gaspers, which get the old vanity alarm going. Secondly, the article is exceedingly vague; if the guy really was a significant scholar, you'd think it'd name some publications, or some academic background, or anything. Thirdly, the Google search for <i>"Jan Gaspers" european integration</i> gets only two hits, which do appear to be relevant but don't seem to establish notability -- if he really was a "well-known scholar who has written ground breaking contributions to European integration theory", you'd think that his name in conjuction with the area he's made ground-breaking contributions to would get a little more hits, peer reviews and whatnot. I can't say that I'm familiar with the field, so I may be wrong; if so, I'm sure the votes will reflect that. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:50, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should probably add that apparently he made a copy of the article at Gaspers, which has been nominated for speedy deletion by someone else.

<p>Unmaintainable list. I can think of hundreds of works in which fictional characters with the rank of General appear, and in soem of them there are many such charcters. If the list were to be anything like compelte it would be huge, and if not it would be seriously misleading or PoV. Why not Postman (fiction) while we are about it? This is really just a "random collection of information" there is no particular theme or fact linking these fictional charcters, and no selective principle to reduce the thousands of entries at least as qualified as the one currently in this list. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:53, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>VOTE AS OF 1 NOV 05</b>: 7 Delete, 2 Keeps, 1 Merge, 1 Comment</p>
<p>With the recent name change, I feel that such a list can be maintained on Wikipedia to provide good links and info about characters in books and films. While the majority of the votes are above are to delete, I feel the article still holds merit, espeically as a list, and that the list article is a good compromomise to the original concept which was an all encompassing article about fictional uses of the rank of General. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 03:47, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>, definitely in that order of preference. This thing is definitely one of the most notable H*R sites, rather lively, has tons of contributors, and has, in my opinion, been one of the good examples on how to use wikis to do something relevant too. I'm kind of yes-no-maybe-dunno torn on whether or not the thing should have its own article, though, but I'm kind of more in favor of keeping it as an article. It <i>can</i> be summarized as a few paragraphs, but would that really be enough? If the Consensus says "merge with Homestar Runner", and the resulting section grows too much over the time, then <i>definitely</i> keep the article and stick it right there on its own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> If an event happened, it is notable enough for inclusion.

<li>I don't usually argue with votes, but this seems very odd. Every event that ever happened in the history of the world is not notable. Establishing that the event occurred by contacting the university would only reference about one sentence in the article, leaving 99% still-unsourced. It could be a copyvio because it is a slight re-wording of a copyrighted article. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:39, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See, the problem is that your premise is false. Every event that ever happened in the history of the world is indeed notable. As for verifiability, see my earlier entry. As I said, "the same criterion applies to the individual details within the article". If this means leaving just a stub, so be it--a stub is better than nothing at all. And I fail to see how it is a "slight re-wording"...it contains the same facts, but it's hardly a re-wording of the particular presentation of the facts that FRS linked to. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 01:45, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> deletion review sounds like a good idea - the current version of the article does have better sources, but there are large falsifiability issues. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 09:29, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> of course; may be speedyable due to continued recreation. However, I note that the article is moving towards a discussion of genetic evidence Neanderthal-human interbreeding, which is a much more scientific topic (right now). If the author wanted to write an article on Evidence for human-Neanderthal interbreeding, and if that article contained a sentence that said, "the idea that such interbreeding is responsible for autism has some support within the autistic community, although no scientific research yet suggests that this is the case.", then I would consider that a reasonable nod to the "theory" that would be appropriate to WP. Until such time as the "theory" has any smidgeon of scientific support, however, it does not deserve its own article. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 19:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> original research.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> as re-creation.

<li><b>Keep</b> The mere fact of a theory's existence makes it notable enough for inclusion.

<li>Seriously? So if I come up with a theory -- for example, right now, my theory is that people don't always think the full implications of their statement through before making them, which I hereby dub the Theory of People Going Off Half-Cocked -- that means it's notable enough for inclusion? So if I were to actually create the article (or, for the sake of argument, got someone else to do it for me), that would automatically make it notable and a valid addition to Wikipedia, simply because someone thought it up and took the ten minutes to write it down? I must disagree. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Considering how manyh "articles" get written every day around here that are deemed personal essays or original research, I'm going to have to disagree with you.

<p>I think much of policy issues are addressed during last edit. The readers may find some unique features which the world is entitled to know.

<p>Nevermind that this article is, as of the nomination, bordering on gibberish. (If someone else doesn't do so, I'll clean it up to readability myself.)

<li><b>Comment</b> - A page remains on this list (Articles for Deletion) for one week, at which point, if there's a consensus to delete, it gets deleted, otherwise, it stays. Seeing as your username is "Operafield defender" and you announce on your userpage that you created the account to keep this particular article from being deleted, you might be referred to a page called <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> - I suggest you check it out now. Oh, and a photo couldn't hurt the article, although it might not save it either. The best way to improve the article is to add <i>verifiable</i> facts that have been reported by other media sources (please see our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>), and citing those sources.

<li><b>keep</b>. First of all, I'm the one who've created this english article on the first place, and also fixed the spanish one (which sucked) to be closer to meeting wikipedia's criteria. So let's make it clear: I am _not_ the author of the game. Now, why do I think it should be kept? Or rather... why did I place this here on the first place? Because I think it's a notable game on the (not to offend anybody) very small world of amateur spanish-language text adventure games genre, and it's also remarkable to how many computer languages has been rewritten, and for how many platforms it has been compiled.<a href="../../../r/v/a/User%7ERvalles_a16b.html" title="User:Rvalles">Rvalles</a> 01:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

Actually, what we gain by deleting it is a little more confidence on the part of our users that we are discriminating in the information we take in. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:06, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b>. The argument for deletion as read above states that the article should be deleted because "googling" for the article topic results in few webpage results. It seems to me that deleting this article from wikipedia would only resolve in less information being available about this game. It also appears that wikipedia is one of the few locations that hosts any english text about this game. Making the english article very valuable to the internet as a whole. It doesn't appear wikipedia has anything to gain from the deletion of this article except for maybe some small drive space. If wikipedia only hosted information that could be found other places that would make wikipedia less of a resource to everyone. JonathanW 04:28, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</s> (sockpuppet)

<li><b>comment</b> One of the basic principles of Wikipedia is that conent needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, that is, that Wikipedia <i>does</i> only host information that can be found in other places. If Wikipedia is to be a reliable encyclopeadia, then readers need to be able to check the accuracy of our content, which means that there need to be external sources for our information. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 11:28, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> The title of this article bothers me because it seems loosey goosey; "Preservation Issues" is too broad. Do I think that this conceptually need on Wikipedia? Most certainly. But preservation issues takes in too many fields that are simular and dissimular at the same time. Document archival techniques are different than restoration techniques on fine art. There is a clear difference between a "historical renovation" and a full blown Restoration of buildings. So if the article is to survive, I feel that it would be most useful in as a hub to the topics (spokes), so to speak. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 14:57, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>: <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preservation.html" title="Preservation">Preservation</a> has links to all of the types of preservation, why not just make sure that every category is covered and let the preservation article serve as a hub? It looks like we need a paper document preservation article, at the least, so we could use the content from this article as a starting point, as it needs to be rewritten. If you don't want to use the preservation article as the hub, and want the title to be more specific, I would suggest "historical record preservation", "document preservation", "archive preservation" or working it into the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archive.html" title="Archive">archive</a> article somehow. Finally, we should make sure that the articles we already have cover everything mentioned in this article. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 16:50, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The reason I started writing a paper on them is because, I wanted to check out how the church community at large treated and welcomed societies misfits. This was one of the first Christian groups I saw that seemed to truely be living this out. This is a small part of a more relational movement called organic churches Groups like this are sprouting up every where and are part of a movement, some have named the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergent_Church_2520.html" title="Emergent Church">Emergent Church</a>. The emergent church is not any one group or leader; its a spontaneous church movement not ran by any religious group or leader. - J. D. Hunt</dd>

<dd>I'm new to this Wikipedia thing. I guess I should have read more about the process and rules. I thought I knew enough to start.

Some of these names are dubbed on them from within and some from without. This movement is something that I saw that was not represented in the Wikipedia database of knowledge. In a movement with no leaders or unified body, made up of individual expressions,the individual expressions are part of the informational structure of the movement. Example: like when covering the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Vineyard_Churches_77af.html" title="Association of Vineyard Churches">Association of Vineyard Churches</a> individual people, like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wimber_e1ad.html" title="John Wimber">John Wimber</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonnie_Frisbee_eb8c.html" title="Lonnie Frisbee">Lonnie Frisbee</a> are mentioned, and individual churches are mentioned like <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Airport_Christian_Fellowship_c67e.html" title="Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship">Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship</a>.

<dd>If you want to write an article on this, and have it accepted, the most important single thing you can do is collect good verifiable <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">source citations</a>. Wikipedia does not accept original research. As far as possible, find newspaper stories, books that have been written about your topic, etc. and try to tell as much of your story as possible in the form of source quotations, with connecting material. For example, the passage above ("I am trying to chronicle... structure of the movement") is a problem, because Wikipedia is not a place for you or anyone else to "chronicle" things. On the other hand, you can say "an emergent church, according to A. B. Christian, is a church which thus-and-such-and-so-and-so. Other observers use other names. For example, D. E. Filosopher prefer to call them them <i>organic churches</i> because their structure etc. etc"</dd>

<dd>"Not notable." I'm afraid that in Articles for Deletion people encounter repetitive situations and start to use various abbreviations. Now "notability itself" is a controversial issue within Wikipedia, there are no firm criteria (and some Wikipedians who do not think notability should even be considered at all). Regardless, in the particular case of Rivendell Christian Communities, <i>if</i> it has been mentioned in e.g. a magazine or newspaper article, or a book about emergent churches, or something like that, <i>it is to your advantage</i> cite sources saying so. Read our article on what an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is, and then make the best case you can as to why an encyclopedia <i>needs</i> an article on this group. If the only reason for an article on them is that <i>you</i> personally are trying to write an essay on emergent churches, that won't fly. However, if someone who has authored a print publication, or an obviously significant website, has mentioned them as an interesting example of an emergent church, that carries some weight. (No guarantees here, I'm just expressing my personal observations about what affects opinions in an AfD discussion.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:40, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>J. D. Hunt, the convention is to indent replies, and to indent them further than the text they're replying to. You indent text by typing colons at the beginning of the line. Each colon represents one additional indentation level, so if you're replying to something with two colons, being your text by typing three colons, etc. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:20, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have nothing against people with a liberal position. I myself am a libertarian. But, as we all know, every one of us has a point of view (or a.k.a a bias). We should try not to use it when writing, which is a hard thing for anybody to do, no matter how principled we are. my experience and study has shown that typically people with a liberal bias tend to dislike Christianity. It is posible for bias in this Wikipedia Proposition. Sorry, I wasn't logged in at the time of the comment, but that is because it was my girlfriend on another commputer in our network reading the comments. Thanks for assuming.

<li><b>Comment</b> Since you are new to Wikipedia, I really have to sugesst that you read through some of the base rules that we have on the, including the article <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 13:50, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am now reading the rules, when i have time. By the way, to state that you believe someone has a bias towards a topic, based on their self discription and private statements, is not a personal attack it's an observation. An attack would be to call somebody 'stupid' or an 'idiot'. All I did was to make an observation based on my opinion. In discussion forums are peoples opinions against the rules. Is there only partial freedom of speech in here. (<a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdhunt_4d42.html" title="User:Jdhunt">J. D. Hunt</a> 06:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC))</p>

<li><b>Response to Jdhunt</b> Again, I strongly suggest that you read the rules regarding <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_personal_attacks.html" title="No personal attacks">No personal attacks</a> and the proper places for these types of discussions, which are usually held on talk pages. This particular page doesn't exist to discuss your perception of someone elses suppossed political beliefs or their qualifications to voice an opinion on the merit of the article at hand; this AfD page exists to gather votes for the article itself. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 13:39, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I read the No Personal Attacks Section, and it caused me to have more questions. Here are my questions. I'm not saying either scenario are my case (and I believe they are not). Here I go. What do you do if you really think someone is bringing a bias, based on their views, in their actions towards an issue or administration duty? (or abuse) And, secondly, what if someone thought they were being persecuted, based on their beliefs, by another member or group? (or abuse) Is there a way to take recorse reguarding that kind of abuse, or does wikipedia allow that, because it considers stating something like that a personal attack. What are the rules and where are the lines drawn. (<a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdhunt_4d42.html" title="User:Jdhunt">J. D. Hunt</a> 14:19, 1 November 2005 (UTC))</li>

<ul>
<li>I was looking for her being mentioned in the national news, hoping she would be more controversial than the everyday, garden-variety student politician, after all the Liberal club is associated with the Australian Liberal party, and the accusation of corruption and financial mismanagement sounds pretty severe. Now Google comes up with <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;as_epq=samantha+aber&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=lang_en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;as_epq=samantha+aber&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=lang_en" rel="nofollow">about 100 hits, of which 36 are unique</a> when looking for her name on English pages ("aber" happens to mean "but" in German). Most of these hits are university minutes. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:00, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> shows that she's made the news nine times over the last year (and I know for a fact there has been more), which isn't bad for someone of her position in my book. Moreover, she is the direct focus of four critical articles in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Australian_d6f4.html" title="The Australian">The Australian</a>.</i> I'm at another university several hundred kilometres away; her notability extends well beyond UNE. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:27, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Factiva</i> requires a subscription, as does the archive of <i>The Australian</i>. What do those sources say about her, does she pass the five-year test, or are the goings-on at UNE just another case of extra-shambolic administration at a student government? When I was at uni we were treated to a very similar spectacle - the previous incumbents had been in power for 20 years or so and were thoroughly corrupt, the challengers threatened to sweep out the muck with the proverbial iron broom and then turned out to be just as corrupt and incompetent. In short, it was an exercise in striking poses, nothing more. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:40, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
