<dd>Let's look at the comment in its entirety, shall we? <i>If you have a martyr complex, I suggest you find somewhere else to vent.</i> This was in respose to your statement: <i>I will use Ghandi's method of peaceful civil disobediance. I defy one thing, your actions. And I am prepared to be hurt by the process. Just like Ghandi, I draw fire upon myself and I am willing to suffer the consequences.</i> How is that not attempting to martyr yourself? Look through this AfD as well as the other two. The bulk of the text is yours. Long rants accusing people of things, long rants repeating the same things again and again, etc. Now let's look at what I said again...nowhere did I ask you to leave. I did, however, ask you to find a different place to vent.

I recommend we investigate why the same individuals attack the same articles. I believe the actions we see here is nothing more than an organized attempt at vandelism. The pack has a leader, and I'll not make any mention of the other individuals. Not every post here reflects the membership in the attempts to form an organized vandelism effort, but one or more posts are a clear example of such and are nothing more than personal attacks, and an attempt to remove ligitimate content from wiki-pedia.

<dd>I trully am sorry that it came to this. But, your repeated actions made it necessary to expose what I consider to be an organized effort to vandalize wikipedia content, and crush valid submissions made by people new to wiki-pedia. I tried to offer an appology. I looked at your submissions and made one of my own that matched yours. A simple two sentence statement of fact. I was surprised that you attempted to delete this as it exposes your true motives. I hope that this does go to arbitration. I want to bring all of this to light.

<dd>The explanation is simple I was ashamed of my behavior and I was going to quit wiki-pedia. I am not used to this type of treatment. I was determined to leave and to delete the article myself. I realized my ill will and bad feelings were not rational. I stopped, and licked my wounds and pondered. Because I come from a background of repect, love and tollerance, I decided to take a stand for truth and these principles, to return and make the way safe for other newbies. I wish to change the environment here, to make it more open and friendly. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 19:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The logic is simple. I'm new and trying to learn. Anyone who just says "Delete" does not teach me anything. Someone who rubs it in is just down right mean.

<dd>Frankly, this subject <i>is</i> nonsense. Not all urban myths get Wikipedia articles...simply the ones that are notable. Celtic toe just plain isn't. A google search shows that there is one entry on the Urban Dictionary and that is all. Eminently non-notable. My behavior which you categorize as <i>mean</i> is only that way because you insist on creating numerous articles about the same subject even though every single AfD illustrates that none of this can be backed up. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 21:18, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>BTW - Since when was then benchmark of notability that work must be published in a peer-reviewed journal? Wikipedia only requires that the source is notable. No these aren't 'scholarly' magazines but the ideas still exist in published form which is enough. Yes the work isn't rigorously scientifically tested but it still exists as an idea, and its not like its published in a magazine that nobody reads either - I really think you guys should give the author a bit of slack on this and give them the benifit of the doubt that they are not trying to disrupt wikipedia, but just trying to contribute, albeit on topics which aren't really notable enough <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 13:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No there is no argument - I'm saying delete this because its not notable. I just made the point (concerning people's comments here and on the Celitc toe page) that notability is not dependent on being published in a peer-reviewed journal. Also, if you read my comment on the Celtic toe page you'll see that I suggested merging it with Morton's toe not deleting it (i.e ditch all the pseudo science stuff and just leave a short paragraph mentionning the urban myth part of it) because although its not scientific it does exist in folklore so should be recognised as such <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMammal4_a688.html" title="User:Mammal4">Mammal4</a> 14:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is now the second article of very questionable notability (the first being Celtic toe ring) that has been added for the sole purpose, it seems, of adding credibility and notability to the idea of the Celtic toe.

Another editor said of the Celtic toe article, "The problem with this article is that it over cooks the information and tries to make out that there is more to the evidence than their actually is," which I think is a good synopsis of the issue.

<p>It would be nice to actually get a look at the three references BrittonLaRoche has given us for Phyllis Jackson's notability, as the link provided only goes to a list of article titles. I realise that it is sometimes hard to get hold of accessable links for peer-reviewed journals because they generally require a subscription, but as the list stands it doesn't prove anything as it is only a list of article titles. I may be able to help as it appears that I might be able to at least view the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology article through my job, which seems to have access (I can't tell for definite now, as I am at home, but will know more tomorrow). If I can get hold of the paper, then I would be happy to email it to any intersted party and they can make up their own minds.

She has now studied over sixty burials, from excavations at Gambier Parry Gardens, London Road, St Oswald's Priory, Blackfriars and Southgate Street. Her research, which looks at the structure of the foot, provides evidence for ethnic and tribal origins, deformity, disease and way of life (for an introduction to Miss Jackson's work see Current Archaeology 144, pp466-70). As always, volunteers and work experience students have provided invaluable assistance with improving the documentation and storage of archaeological material held at the unit. RA</dd>

That makes it my work, in turn I give it freely to the world. I prefer your opinion and your justification rather than to abstain. I am learning the process the hard way. I do not know of any other way to learn in this environment. I've read all the policies and procedures I could in two weeks. Here are some more examples of what I have done for wikipedia. I do this because it takes an extreem amount of effort to request permission to use a photo and then prove that permission was granted. Further the author has to grant the rights in away that makes it usable by anyone who wishes to reference wiki pedia. I found it next to impossible. Its far easier to sketch and prove I did it. <a href="http://thefartist.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://thefartist.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">"The Lost Colony's Creation of Sir Francis Drake"</a> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 19:41, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is the situation as I find it - All of the support Peer Review material was wrong - I have determined this via my own searches of the academic literature. I can also find no evidence of anyone using Jackson as a citation - therefore in academic terms she does not exist.</p>
<p>As for the other references - "Pollard J.

<b>Mammal4 research conclusions</b></p>
<p>I've checked out the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology reference cited above. It doesn't mention Phyllis Jackson anywhere, or Celtic toe, or Morton's toe for that matter. I've read it in moderate detail, and it is a quite interesting article, but not really relevent to any discussion here or on the Celtic toe page. This agrees with and confirms <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a>'s and <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a>'s reading of the article. I can't get hold of the two articles in "the Foot" journal so I can't comment on these. As far as notability, Phyllis Jackson actually scores less unique hits that I do if I search for my professional name! I don't think that I require an article about myself so to confirm what I said originally, she simple isn't notable enough to be included. <b>Strong Delete</b>. If anybody else wants a copy of the paper give me your email address and I will send you a copy. Unlike <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> I don't write under my own name, so am not worried about passing on subscription material (although I sympaphise with his concerns).

If not then let me finish it with the proper credentials. I had never heard of "Osteoarcheology" before. At least the misguided source gave me a new keyword to use in my search. I have found new articles on my own that I will now investigate.<a href="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/9a28f07d7b9ed6eea19afeb4da09e526.html" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/9a28f07d7b9ed6eea19afeb4da09e526.html" rel="nofollow">"Phyllis Jackson Osteoarcheology Academic Reviews"</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - OK that does not link to articles but rather a 68 pg document called "Current and Recent Research in Osteoarchaeology: Proceedings of the Third Meeting of the Osteoarchaeological Research Group (The Osteoarchaeological Research Group) (Paperback)" published in 1998 about their meeting in 1995. The ORG seems to be a hobbist organization - "The Osteoarchaeological Research Group (ORG) was set up in 1993 with the intention of bringing together anyone who works with or has an interest in human and/or animal remains. The core function of the group is to provide a forum for the exchange of news and ideas through quarterly newsletters and regular meetings. We are also interested in promoting the provision of careers advice and training in this field, providing information on services for specialists and considering standards for recording/reporting." - I can find no evidence that this organization has been notable in any way or has made any significant contribution to this area of endeavour. <del>A cursory examination also suggests that none of it members are notable (again happy to be corrected and please do).</del> So what we appear to have is a mention of a non-notable person in a non-notable book by a non-notable organization. I still find the evidence of notablity for this person and their claims to be lacking. Those who wish to keep need to provide something more solid than we have seen before. -- --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 17:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If there is academic any peer review of Phillis Jackson's work, I hope to find it. I won't post any more peer review articles until I can review it or find someone who can send me a copy. If I cannot find a copy then I will note that in the article also. If no one in academic circles referes to her work then there must be a reason. She has been around with her theroies since 1992 and keeps popping up, obviously if they don't refer to her, there is a reason. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 18:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Point taken. I should say since his is "did not express his own opinion." but I'm surprised you are responding for him. Seems to further my point that he is not actively involved.

<dd>Thank you Charles, no need for that just yet though. I'm drawing the arbitration line in the sand, placing aribtration chip on my shoulder, and daring... no I double dare <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><b>IrishGuy</b></a> to knock it off by filing it himself. I'll sweeten the pot. Should you decide to file for arbitration then I ask you agree to this term: the loser of the arbitration will pack his bags and leave wiki-pedia forever. I think it fair to warn you, <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><b>IrishGuy</b></a>, I've brought my bag of garlic, a wooden crucifix, holy water and a silver bullets melted down from saint medalions and a small silver crucfix (worn about the neck) I may be mixing myths but hey, vampire orwarewolf whatever type of newbie biter you are, you are going down. If you are the chicken warewolf I think you are ( who else would bite defenseless newbies? ) you won't do it. If you don't do it please take your "chicken warewolf" label, place it on your forehead and go vent somewhere else. Wiki-pedia is better off with out the newbie biters. All one has to do is vanquish the head warewolf, vampire or whatever and nomral people (especially newbies) become civil and will be the happy place its meant to be. Naturally I'm suffering from the bite of the warewolf, I'm foaming at the mouth and biting everyone... but I'm going after the one that bit me. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrittonLaRoche_27da.html" title="User:BrittonLaRoche">BrittonLaRoche</a> 19:22, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
