<p>Possibly an hoax. All references that can be found about Alberto Martin Goñi say that he's the captain of a Spanish handbol team called Portland San Antonio. Also, I can't find any information about anyone adapting The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. As a fact, the search <i>"Martin Goñi" "the curse of the jade scorpion"</i> only returns wikipedia mirrors.

<dd>This BBB (for Southern California) has 34 Collection Agencies listed of which nine are (like the subject of this article) ranked 'F'. None of the 34 are listed in WP and the only reason I can imagine that this one has an article is that the anonymous user that posted the article has an axe to grind against the company.

<li><b>Keep</b> Have any of you deletists ever even rode on the Viva system? Compared to conventional transit, it is a bus rapid transit line and deserves to be given the status of a rapid transit line! I agree fully that this is the biggest effort in the Greater Toronto Area since the subway, and they already have plans for a Transitway so just keep it as is. How do I know? I commute on viva to school saving precious time (going up 60 kms) and I live within 10 minutes walking distance to a vivastation. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil-hong_fac9.html" title="User:Phil-hong">Phil-hong</a> 03:43, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's a stub, put this info under Viva'a page. Other pages regarding vivastations should be deleted. It can come back later when it is a major hub connecting some form of fixed heavy/light rail transit services. Even though it's a BRT, it's still a fairly light bus service when compared to other transit systems around the world. Just be patient! Just take a few photographs and dump it in the wikicommons. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosNider_e31b.html" title="User:AmosNider">User:AmosNider</a> 2005 Oct 27

<li><b>Keep</b>, <s>Comment</s>: Please give this some <i>time</i>. Viva was launched like just last month and the main Viva article is marked for cleanup for a "higher standard". You can't expect people to have much incentive cleaning up the main article if they see their sub-articles getting deleted even though the subject in question has been marketed as the biggest transit improvement in York Region in who-know-how-many-years. Also, you can't compare this to Singapore: This is Canada; we spent almost 10 years building just 4 subway stations, and the municipalities don't have a lot of money. (This is, at least in te marketing, the York Region equivalent to the Toronto subway. You have to treat these bus terminals like subway stations.) IMHO Promenade (vivaYork) has been wrongfully deleted for the same reasons (at least at this point of time).—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Wing</a> 03:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>PS: To put this in perspective, please read the <a href="../../../l/a/c/LACMTA_Blue_Line_19ae.html" title="LACMTA Blue Line">LACMTA_Blue_Line</a> article. Many so-called “stations” on this light rail line are even smaller than “partialy covered platform<b>s</b>” (many have just one covered platform the size of a streetcar stop) and have no ticket vending machines, yet they are in Wikipedia. When I was in LA and rode the blue line the first time I was completely taken aback by their <i>smallness</i>.

<li>Do you live in LA? Are you <i>sure</i> they are indeed unexpandable substubs? Promenade (vivaYork), which has been deleted and is the rationale for this article's deletion, is found to be a <i>large</i> terminal.

<li>This shows that you are not a Canadian. The growth of YRT and GO was featured in a TV program, and an official of GO was interviewed. When asked <i>why</i> GO stations do not belong to large, mixed transit-commercial-residential buildings, the official replied, "[paraphrase] because Canada has so much land, developers are not interested in cooperating with transit authorities to develop large complexes along with the stations". Unless a miracle happens, you will not find many "large buildings" in the 905 area, even if it's a major transit hub.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 16:22, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I spend about 1/3 of my time in Canada, pending my permanent residenence paperwork, although it wouldn't be unfair to say that Saskatoon and Toronto are only in the same country as a matter of technicality.&#160;;D<br />
But enough about ad hominem appeals. I feel this isn't an encyclopedic subject unto itself primarily because it is, in my estimation, an unexpandable stub, with no current information beyond where it is and the fact that it is indeed a bus terminal. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please define "unexpandable stub", if you have not re-read the article lately. Also, if you were referring to Promenade, it indeed is one of those few miracles, as Promenade is a major mall in the area.—16:44, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernard_%28vivaYork%29&amp;diff=26538385&amp;oldid=26286088" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernard_%28vivaYork%29&amp;diff=26538385&amp;oldid=26286088" rel="nofollow">your changes</a>, you've made the location very specific, and added the context that would be implicit if this were a mention in the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva_Blue_33d4.html" title="Viva Blue">Viva Blue</a> article. You've also added a paragraph about the fact that, for now, it is the end of the Viva Blue line, also quite appropriate to the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva_Blue_33d4.html" title="Viva Blue">Viva Blue</a> article. Seems like you've expanded it into an excellent merge candidate, and I am amending my vote accordingly.<br />
Is there any other possible expansion for this article as a subject unto itself? Was it <i>particularly</i> hard to get land for this specific location (moreso than the other Viva Blue or Viva York locations)? <small>Has it been the home of a cult of Marduk?</small> Is there some other claim of individuality, to make it not an interchangable member of a whole set (to wit, the Viva Blue terminals)? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>As I do not live in the 905 area (I live in Toronto proper), I don't know. I could actually take the Viva to the terminal and see if there's anything else obvious, or maybe write a letter to YRT and ask for some info, but as a non-local this is probably the best I can do. And because of the timing of the AfD, the article will probably get deleted before I can find out anything.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 17:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the edits TheMadBaron, but I'm still not clear why this should go in an Encyclopaedia. I was looking at the precedents page (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents</a>) and see that a company is 'noteable' if it is listed on the stock exchange. I guess if Binatone is, it qualifies. Then, to be consistent, we should keep it, but I'll try and rewrite some more to make it a little less like an advertising or PO brochure! <a href="../../../k/g/h/User%7EKghose_c3fa.html" title="User:Kghose">Kghose</a> 18:54, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, guys, I can kind of understand why you would say that this site isn't very notable, but about the spamming thing: My two brothers and I are <i>really</i> sorry about that. Our site was in it's awkward developing stage, which is when we didn't really get this sort of thing. We had a lot of stupid ideas, which we deleted, but we don't even know WHY we did that spamming thing, especially on the H*R Wiki. We really like Homestar Runner. We went to the deletion logs and read what we had typed and were like, "Wow, I can't believe we wrote something like that." That's the only thing in our history that we are ashamed of doing. Again, we're sorry and hopefully you can forgive us for that. --<a href="../../../z/a/f/User%7EZAF_8844.html" title="User:ZAF">ZAF</a> 15:52, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is highly feasible that this is indeed a publicity stunt. First the "hacking" of God knows what that CrystalCherry is fuming about the kiss with Aaron Carter or something, then the death hoax. This is a cry of desperation on CrystalCherry's part. Probably a way to "win sympathy" - let's call it - so her 'albums' will sell more. As far as I know, Amazon doesn't even have her albums on auction. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahlen_660b.html" title="User:Kahlen">Kahlen</a> 07:32, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>What "sympathy"? What "albums"? I don't think she has any albums out there that can be bought except online, at her website. Google would have turned up at least a few hits for at least one of them - and believe me, I checked and cross-checked them all.

No other sites reference her - professionally speaking - she doesn't exist in the music world. Also - Wiki says she has done "voice work for movies" - well, the IMDB lists no Brooke Anne Burns - the only Brooke Burns it has is the sort-of famous actress - not this one. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 07:01, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. I am a Wikipedia admin and this article is near the top of my list of AfD debates to review next. But because of the length of this debate I am allowing it more time. <s>The article's current contents are useless. It only gives her name and says that she has a website. That's not asserting any notability.</s> I personally don't know CrystalCherry - I have never heard of her - so I have to take the article at face value. <s>She may well be a really famous actress, but the article doesn't reflect that. So therefore it should be drastically rewritten, or else deleted.</s> Even if it is deleted it can be recreated later with better content. (I also usually view a large number of "keep" votes from new users such as this as a sock puppetry effort, but that may just be cynicism.) <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:22, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article's contents seem to have changed either during the time I wrote my vote or after it. It now includes considerably more information. Still, my comments about this article being soon to be reviewed, and the allegation to sock puppetry, still remain. If this debate is not closed by another admin first, I will review it myself, and consider every user who has only contributed to this debate as a possible sock puppet.

<li>I don't believe that photo has anything to do with CrystalCherry, actually. I am pretty sure I've seen it before, a looong time before this pointless "hacked cell phone"-"released pictures" crap. I think the photo looked just enough like Cherry that she "adapted" it as if it was her in the picture, in order to cause more "controversy".

<dd>I actually came to this article via your profile revers. I have nothing to do with it at all in terms of interest. I was shocked to see the similarity between this case and the Anthony case. It will be odd to lose this one and yet keep the Walker case, when the two are so paralleled.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's claimed that 'Fitzmas' will be forgotten in a year, but this may not be the case.

<p>KEEP IT -- just put it in the page with Plame Affair page</p>
<p>Keep it as addendum to Plame affair. It does not match importance, not will it remain as a cultural reference as "Watergate" or the "Saturday Night Massacre" have.</p>
<p>A great part of wikipedia's importance is that it's where people go to find out about the stuff that Brittanica, etc. do NOT cover. This counts~ it's a small cultural part of our history, and will give future readers an idea what not only what was going on, but the flavor of how people felt about it. Imagaine the poor researcher who comes across it 20 yrs from now! I'd like to think that Wikipedia will still be up and running to inform him that Fitzmas was not a typo or mispronunciation in his original source material.</p>

I've seen this term in several places on the Web in the past few days, and it's entirely possible that people might come to Wikipedia for a definition. No more deletionist nonsense!

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a great example of how Wikipedia is special and what it's good at.

I'm not a contributor so my comments might not matter. But I'm actually excited about what Wikipedia is turning into.

<li><b>Merge/Redirect</b> or <b>Keep</b>; The information should be available somewhere. At the moment, we can't see what sort of long-term implications the situation holds, or what weight the term will carry. Regardless of the number of Google hits, the term is, at the moment, neologistic. The current situation could be flash-in-the-pan, or it could end up being another Watergate. The long-term status of the term and article information are, therefore, very up in the air. However, it seems to me that the term has become ubiquitous enough to warrant the information being available, at least for the present, regardless of political feelings. It wasn't coined here, and it's become culturally notable. Now, while I can well imagine that the specificity of the term may well prevent it from becoming common jargon, it could also grow to encompass other similar phenomena. Part of the beauty of WP is the dynamic ability to incorporate concepts, terms, and events that may have significant historical impact, rather than having to wait for years while the ramifications of an event are weighed, costs are analyzed, articles are written, and the editions published. I would also comment that if there are those who think this should be deleted or not simply out of <i>political spite</i>, they should reexamine their reasoning. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchrodingersRoot_1024.html" title="User:SchrodingersRoot">SchrodingersRoot</a> 15:58, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I agree that there is some notability here, but that does not make it inherently worth having an article on wikipedia. Alexa ranks it at ~37,500 (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;q=&amp;url=gamefreaks365.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;q=&amp;url=gamefreaks365.com/" rel="nofollow">link</a>), but I think that number is rather unremarkable, and does not automatically suggest that there needs to be a wiki article on it. Contrary to the implicit claims, the growth of the site is stable, neither growing or declining much. Also, I pose these questions: Do we need a page describing a website which one can just as easily visit themselves? Does this website have some kind of notable permiation of online circles or videogame circles? I don't know. I don't think a strong case could be made to keep, and I do think a convincing case could be made to delete. Having said all this, I think it's too close for me to feel comfortable voting, but I just wanted to try to provoke some more critical discussion. Aside from anything else, I think that when in doubt, it should be left. If it does stay, I agree that it needs to be cleaned up, because at the moment it reads somewhere between an advertisement and an 'about us' page which would belong on the actual site (not here) <small>ps. sorry for the length of this comment</small> --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 07:30, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Even if the family were notable, it would be unusual to have a page named for them (note that <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy.html" title="Kennedy">Kennedy</a>, for example, is just a disambiguation page). Since the only claim to notability relates to Christian Bernhard Hegardt ("a diplomat and undersecretary of state, was raised to the nobility in May 11, 1818") the article should be named Christian Hegardt.... <i>if</i> he could be considered suitably notable, which seems doubtful. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 07:21, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>vanity <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 17:40, 23 October 2005 (UTC) Is this person really notable?

<p>This artist IS notable actually. Why remove something just because YOU don't know about it? Keep this article please. I am certain it will be expanded. Some people are far too quick to censor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then you won't have any trouble establishing that in your article. Why not expand it yourself, instead of leaving it to others? So far, her notability is certainly not obvious. A phrase like "She is considered to be an exciting new talent, and art critics are keeping a keen eye on her progress", apart from being far too vague and approving to be encyclopaedic, gives the impression this person has yet to make her mark. Hard facts would be better. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 02:35, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>User: Saintjohnny <b>Keep</b> as long as it is expanded on. Notability is not an issue in this case, as the artist has had work exhibited and this has been sourced. Disagree strongly with Flapdragon. That said, more info would be useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you think it should be deleted unless expanded, as you say, then you don't disagree strongly at all. I'm willing to believe this person is worth having but no notability has been demonstrated yet, which shouldn't be difficult if they are really notable. Just "having had work exhibited" isn't really enough. We can't include every singer that has performed in public, or every actor who has ever trod the boards. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 16:10, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Saintjohnny As long as a performer / artist / entertainer has done some kind of public, professional work, they can and should be entitled to an entry on Wikipedia. I always thought that this wonderful resource was supposed to be absolutely democratic and open to all. With all due respect, I do feel that you have jumped on this entry and wish to impose a very narrow, very unhelpful set of values, which in my opinion, are at odds with the values of Wikipedia itself. Of course there has to be notability, but a quick surf on Google should confirm that this artist is indeed notable. That said, I will be happy to amend the article (and it is not mine) if you have some constructive suggestions on how to do so. Lesser known personalities have a right to be included too!</p>
<ul>
<li>We agree again -- notability <b>is</b> an issue. Even when space is not an issue, we have to draw the line somewhere with the "lesser personalities". The "democratic and open to all" part refers to contributing to Wikipedia, not being in it! Why should performers and artists be treated differently to other professions? An artist is not notable just for being an artist, any more than a teacher, builder or website designer. There's nothing personal about it; articles <i>must</i> establish that the subject is worth including. I have nothing against this individual, I only asked for some evidence that they have done enough to appear in an encyclopaedia, and there is still none in the article. Yes, that will be to some extent subjective, but there are some guidelines at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It would be great if the creator of the article or someone else who knows about it would just take a little time to make this into a worthwhile article. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 17:17, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Saintjohnny You didn't really address my point. Again, give me some guidelines on what you think should be in there, and I will use them as a basis to expand on this article. What do you want? Your criteria for being "worthy" of an entry in an encyclopaedia are frankly ridiculous. Take a random surf on Wikipedia and have a look at some of the entries under any profession you care to name. Or any subject for that matter. It is most definitely not your role in this to start imposing what should or should not be there, although I absolutely respect your right to raise the objection. I really do struggle to see what your problem is with the entry. I have verified for myself that this artist is a professional in her field, and has had her work exhibited at a recognised venue, by an established and known gallery. Again, please search Google. Your problem seems to be that she is a non entity, not worth (in your view) anybody reading about. Well firstly, I think it is very unhealthy for one person to start deciding what others read, and secondly, your objection has no basis anyway. So, once again, please tell me what you think should be under this entry, and I will endeavour to provide you with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please read the guidelines already quoted. It may be your opinion that "As long as a performer / artist / entertainer has done some kind of public, professional work, they can and should be entitled to an entry on Wikipedia", but Wikipedia does not agree with you. We are still waiting for some evidence of notability. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 02:19, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This kind of stuff was considered interesting enough for a <i>book</i> to be devoted to the subject, a collection of the 61 games Fischer lost in championship chess (since 1958 i think). It was called <i>How to Beat Bobby Fischer</i> and was written by <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmar_Mednis_32aa.html" title="Edmar Mednis">Edmar Mednis</a>. Not entirely sure about the notability of that book, if we get an article on that book some time this list should probably redirect there, but at the moment we don't have one. Whether this belongs in an <i>encyclopedia</i> however is another matter. <b>Neutral</b>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hey, I seem to remember that book! If it is the book I have in mind then it was some introduction to chess, nothing remarkable, and Bobby Fischer's name was on there only to promote sales. That fact is actually important. His name was used not because he was an excellent player, it was because he was well-known and notorious for his eccentricities. Are we going to have n "Lists who have beaten $NOTORIOUS_PERSON at $GAME", as in "List of supermodels more famous than <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naomi_Campbell_a428.html" title="Naomi Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a>", or "List of people who beat <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Tyson_b51d.html" title="Mike Tyson">Mike Tyson</a>"? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 12:56, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, it was a really a book collecting all the games Fischer lost in championship play. I think you might be thinking about <i>Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess</i>, yes that book is <i>truly</i> unremarkable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand above comments like "If there were only a few names it might be notable for that reason, but this is a lengthy list. In a pinch maybe merge with Bobby Fischer." Isn't the fact that it's a nicely long list a reason <i>not</i> to merge or delete it, since it's not a mere stub? If it had, say, a hundred names on it, I'd understand wanting to delete it because it's overlong and uninteresting, or if it had only ten names or so on it, I'd understand wanting to merge it into Bobby Fischer, but the mergists in this case confuse me terribly—if the information should be on Wikipedia at all, why clutter up an already long biography page by adding it, rather than just linking to it? The 46 items currently on the list seems like the ideal length for a list page, neither too short to merit a distinct article nor too long to be easily navigable. If anything, rather than deleting some interesting and valuable information, I'd say <b>expand</b>—provide specific information on how, why, and under what circumstances each person won, since half the reason to use lists like these instead of categories are to hollow specific detailing of each item on the list. The exact same holds true for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_beaten_Garry_Kasparov_in_chess_3d9d.html" title="List of people who have beaten Garry Kasparov in chess">List of people who have beaten Garry Kasparov in chess</a>: expand and clarify, don't delete. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge</b>, to <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fisher_4f40.html" title="Bobby Fisher">Bobby Fisher</a></s>.

<li><b>Do not merge</b>. Merging would in my opinion be a terrible choice. The list would be like a carnuncle in the nice article <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fisher_4f40.html" title="Bobby Fisher">Bobby Fisher</a>. I have a slight preference for <i>keep</i> above <i>delete</i>, but most important to me is that the list is not merged into the main article, which is already over the "traditional maximum length" of 32 kB. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 22:34, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly so. Merging would be the worst of all worlds, much more harmful than deletion. I think we <i>should</i> consider, though, expanding this into a more general article of specifically analyzing Fischer's chess career in detail, since if we had an article like that, it <i>would</i> be a nice place to merge this into. Likewise, a general article for in-depth analysis of Kasparov's records might be the best place to incorporate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_beaten_Garry_Kasparov_in_chess_3d9d.html" title="List of people who have beaten Garry Kasparov in chess">List of people who have beaten Garry Kasparov in chess</a> into. However, making such articles would take some effort and research, so we should <i>keep</i> these articles where they are now until we <i>do</i> have someplace acceptable to merge them into. Or go with my earlier suggestion of just trying to expand the current articles significantly. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 04:05, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This is one of those rare instances when a list nominated on AFD is not a bad one. Items are easily verifiable per WP:V; the construct is neutral, per WP:NPOV; inclusion to the list rests on a simple question with a binary yes/no answer - you have either beaten Fischer at chess or you haven't, there is no need for subjective, non-NPOV decisions over inclusion. Merging this into an article would damage it, as has been pointed out by Silence. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>01:12, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

<li>They're more than a little notorious, even in memory, and are important to the history of traffic engineering. New Jersey's roads were once known for them as much as for anything else, and even where they have been eliminated or bypassed strong traces of them often remain in defaced or vestigal form. Articles on individual circles make that clear: I've added aerial photos in the cases where I can positively identify them and it's surprising how much of even heavily modified circles are still evident. They may even still be known locally by the old name in many cases. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 04:40, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have received a reply from a contact at the Massachusetts Bar Association, publishers of the Massachusetts Law Review, as follows:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You asked about a mention of Lizzie Borden in the Massachusetts Law Review (below).</dd>
<dd>The MLR is mainly organized and cited by volume and page number. "79 Mass. Law Rev. 135" would be page 135 of volume 29 of it, for example. We do note the year and (intended) season on the cover (e.g. "Fall 2000") and each issue has an issue number on the cover (e.g. "Volume 80, No. 3"). The month an issue is mailed doesn't get noted, so there is no specific "March 2005" issue.</dd>
<dd>I did do a quick search on recent issues, and there doesn't seem to have been any mention of Lizzie Borden. There were some old mentions from the MLR. I've attached a screen picture of the results. Can you give me some more context for the mention?</dd>
<dd>I did notice a 1999 Massachusetts Bar Association Lawyers Journal article that mentions an attorney from a firm involved in the case, and the question of the expiration of the obligation of client confidentiality.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I find it interesting that this article never once mentions <b><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Sullivan_7a36.html" title="Bridget Sullivan">Bridget Sullivan</a></b> (the maid) by name. Doesn't seem logical that an article about Bridget (who Lizzie referred to as <i>Maggie</i> - source <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_King_0c8e.html" title="Florence King">Florence King</a>, One WASP's Family) would at least call her by name? <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 01:02, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just found another Law Professor from a "Brown University" - it is here:</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www.law.suffolk.edu/faculty/directories/faculty.cfm?InstructorID=22" class="external free" title="http://www.law.suffolk.edu/faculty/directories/faculty.cfm?InstructorID=22" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.suffolk.edu/faculty/directories/faculty.cfm?InstructorID=22</a></dd>
<dd>I don't know if that legitimizes Andrea Champell any or not, I still can't find any reference to that particular name. But there does appear to be a legitimate "Brown University" Law degree.
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. He is a Professor of Law at Suffolk University who got his <b>BA</b> from Brown.

<dd>All this is interesting, but back to the article. Does it merit a stand alone entry? Are the sources legitimate? Can the information be verified?

The information and image provided regarding the competition are accurate and I believe at least some of the history and stats provided are confirmed in the Titan novels. The article does need to be cleansed of conjectural info and it needs to be made clear that it is not canon as far as Paramount are concerned (and as such, has no place on the ships list), but the information provided in the Titan novels and by S&amp;S Inc. means that this article is perfectly valid given the all-encompasing nature of Wikipedia. -Hayter 15:42, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The problem with including non-canon material is that Paramount don't make any attempt to maintain consistency with their licensees. So anything in the books can be contradicted by any canon series/movies that may appear from Paramount, or other non-canon licensees.

<li>Note that according to the Star Trek card game, Riker's USS Titan is a completely different class. The novel publishers felt no need to maintain consistency with the card game.

<li>Crud, it's even got the wrong kind of marketing! The whole fuss I was thinking of was over a school posting a sign saying "Proudly Sponsored by *local* McDonald's".

<li>The original author has reverted Meelar's version, which I have restored, and created <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_of_schools.html" title="Marketing of schools">Marketing of schools</a> as a distinct article.

<li>I'm very confused as to why another article (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_of_schools.html" title="Marketing of schools">Marketing of schools</a>) has been created when <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_in_schools.html" title="Marketing in schools">Marketing in schools</a> is still be debated for deletion. I can't see any reason why the 'Marketing of schools' article shouldnt be marked for deletion as well, as I put that same text up for deletion when it was found in 'Marketing in schools'. If someone rewrites an article to save it from deletion, the last thing we want is for the unsuitable text to be dumped into a near-identically named article. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 11:34, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I mainly did it to stop someone reverting the original article to the mis-named version again. Feel free to nominate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_of_schools.html" title="Marketing of schools">Marketing of schools</a> as well. Frankly I think there's space for both, though IMV marketing <b>of</b> schools is borderline while marketing in schools is a definite Keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> 17:36, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep the copy at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_of_schools.html" title="Marketing of schools">marketing of schools</a>, but delete this one, as it is not about marketing <i>in</i> schools. A great article could be written about that topic, but this isn't it; it's about something else. An article about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing_in_schools.html" title="Marketing in schools">marketing in schools</a> could cover, perhaps, schools getting textbooks, sports equipment, etc, with name brands all over/in them because the schools can't afford those things otherwise.

<li>And despite Nicodemus' likely desire to ignore it, I do vote to keep school articles. Of three articles on AfD on one day last week, I voted to keep all three. This, I believe, demonstrates that I am willing to do something I would not have done in times past - accept that there is a place for articles on schools. I remain convinced, however, that school articles are subject to the same inclusion criteria as <b>all other articles</b>; that is, they are about notable subjects, and they have sufficient content to avoid speedy deletion per CSD:G1 or CSD:A1. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>However, there is an 85%-90% <b>precedent</b> to "not delete" school articles on the specious criteria of either being a stub or being "non-notable" (in the subjective opinion of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles"). This circumstance is a product of the application of WP policy, in that some 40% of those articles were closed as "no consensus" and are thusly "not deleted". The <b>fact</b> that school articles are simply not deleted on the basis of either being a stub or being "non-notable" is clearly not accepted by "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" is truly baffling. Despite my repeated questioning of why the <b>precedent</b> clearly established by the utilization of the AfD process and the implementation of WP policy is continutally disregarded, I have yet to read a single response that justifies the chronic war of attrition that is being waged against school articles, other than the repeated assertions that they are "non-notable" and that individual editors oppose the existence of the articles themselves. My question is (re-stated): "In the face of <b>overwhleming precedent</b>, why do "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" continue to nominate and vote to delete them? - What is achieved by these repeated nominations other than the continuation of a (clearly lost) battle? - How does nominating and voting to delete school articles that clearly will not be deleted in any way contribute to Wikipedia?"--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 01:04, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>You are referring to individual discussions of individual schools. In some cases, there has been consensus to keep and in some there has been consensus to delete. There is no consensus on any policy as to <i>which</i> schools should be kept. Unlike <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">biographies</a>, there are no guidelines that have achieved consensus. And until the school inclusionists are willing to make a good-faith effort to establish sensible criteria for inclusion, there never will be. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:53, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>We have a good faith belief that all schools should be kept, just as all countries are kept, even the smallest, so there is no need for more detailed criteria. It is up to the deletionists to put an end to this by backing off with good grace. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 17:00, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is absurd to compare deletion of a school article to deletion of a country article. You may have a good-faith belief that school articles should be kept, but that is just what it is, a belief. There is no hard and fast policy that school articles should be kept, and in fact there isn't even a clear consensus to do so. And your intransigent attitude toward compromise will get you nowhere here. I am probably the hardest-core deletionist here, but my ability to obfuscate and stonewall is dwarfed by people such as yourself, who have moved not a millimetre in the direction of a middle ground for school articles. While I have demonstrated my willingness to accept in principle that school articles have a place in Wikipedia, I have seen not the slightest suggestion of a complementary gesture from the inclusionists that perhaps school articles should have to meet certain criteria, as all other articles here do. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because it conflicts with what is objectively true. As the eminent 20th-century Russian-American philosopher Ayn Rand proved, what people think is true or would like to be true does not affect what actually is true.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A school is not a grocery store. This argument stems from a misconception of what a school is. Schools have an existence quite apart from the simple bricks and mortar from which they are constructed. Schools are social institutions with distinct cultures and histories which often extend beyond the life any any individual person or building which forms part of that institution. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 00:09, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>While what you say is true of SOME schools it is not true of all schools.

<li>What a nice piece of dreamwork I see here. Schools no more have "distinct cultures" than Safways do. Except for the obvious differences between, say, a rich suburban school and a poor inner-city school, you can pretty much exchange one school's culture with the next and find zero real difference. If there were a big difference in histories, I would expect to see that reflected in the content of school articles. But despite reading over a hundred school articles (no word of lie, I read every school article Wikipedia currently possesses for California and Texas), I saw nothing to demonstrate that most schools have a distinctive history beyond differences in their opening dates. In fact, one of the biggest differences I saw between schools, based upon the information that these articles contained, was their school colors and mottos. While I'm sure the reality of the situation is different, it's a sad comment on the dismal quality of most school articles here. As far as I am concerned, if schools are important, it is incumbent upon the authors of these articles to convince us of that importance or be prepared to see their articles deleted for lack of content. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 02:14, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm afraid that this article was flagged because of my "editing". This was attempted in an effort to correct the ending of the article which did not coincide with information posted on <a href="http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com" class="external free" title="http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com</a>.

The article describes a well known internet event, which is at least as interesting as <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base.html" title="All your base">All_your_base</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/f/JEFF_K_21fb.html" title="JEFF K">JEFF_K</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Mills is on the leading edge of retail and the projects associated with them have a huge impact on communities, economics, and trends in retail. The article needs to be developed further. An article should not be deleted because it appears weak and someone therefore thinks it is not notable. Most articles start off small and need time to grow. This article has been growing due to the contributions of many users. It needs more time to develop. Information should be added about when it first opened, the retail concepts used, and what makes it unique. For those that want to delete this, please instead focus your energy on making articles in Wikipedia better, rather than trying to rip away the work of others. 24.240.204.226 19:30, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(The purpose of Afd is to ascertain consensus through debate - but dozens of schools nominations show that there is no consensus on this issue, and there will be no real 'debate'. There will be an acromonious shouting match with no-one open to persuasion - leading to an inevitable 'no-consensus' result. I am thus closing this debate, and noting its predictable outcome. If anyone thinks that reopening this 'debate' will acheive anything, or has any chance of producing a different result, feel free to revert my action!

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The Wikipedia deletion rules state that if a wiki has "original research," then that wiki may be put up for deletion. <b>However</b>, this rule was made for papers that are extremely outlandish (eg. Why cat's hate dogs in 1898 by looking at animal weight). If examining the content on this page, it is basically confirmed by human logic, the <i>point</i> of this wiki. The only difference between this wiki and regular thought is that this wiki calls those thoughts "TheoPhasic Science." So are those people who are pro-delete saying that our thoughts are not evidence? *And the materials that are known to humans count as thoughts because that is what they started as.
<ul>
<li>I suggest that this wiki and some of the concepts in this article should be renamed/moved, NOT DELETED. Some of the wiki's concepts are not foreign. If one does a search for some of the <i>ideas</i> without the names, one turns up hits. The only difference is that this wiki is particular and puts all of the thoughts under a new catagory, dubbed "TheoPhasic Science" because it follows a type of logic, such as science, but concerns a lot of theology based questions. The name of phasic is in there to show a bridge between the two. If Einstein had the capabilities to post on Wikipedia, he probably would have, and especially more modern scientists whose ideas are so strange, or named, that they are rejected, yet fastforward several years and they are widely accepted. The only reason why Einstein wasn't automatically rejected was because he had substantial research to back it up. This wiki just needs some links that agree with the information posted. *A large percentage of people didn't believe the universe was expanding till the background radiation was discovered, but that didn't mean that it wasn't true before the discovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> If Einstein published a new idea here, it would also be deleted? Doesn't that prove the utter ridiculousness of this even being considered for deletion? Without Einstein's thoughts and proofs, technologically, as a race, humans would be at least a few centuries behind.
<ul>
<li>Einstein would publish in a scientific journal and then that journal would be cited when someone wrote an article here. What part of "No original research" don't you understand? <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> 20:52, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a group <b>deletion</b> I'm proposing for all the individual Mills owned malls and shopping centers. An article about the chain as a whole is probably appropriate, but none of these individual malls are notable, so their individual inclusion and detailing strikes me as advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b> if the user above would have done some research, which by this nomination it only shows that either they didn;t or they decided to ingnore anything that they have seen, they would have found out they the majortiy of facilites are major enocomic factors in the areas that they are located, some even more so then the over-hyped mall of america. The also serve as major congerating ponints as well, with several placning in the top 5 if not the top tourist destination in the state in which they are located. Also many new builds have served as anchors for substantinal development , where the rebulds have served in major as the core of major redevelopment projects. If these articles are deleted then i will afd ever skyscraper, ever other mall and related srtucture for the reason that these are pening deleted. But this is just another reson why the VFD is the same broken process with a different name.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A lot of small American towns have individual Wal-Mart stores that "are major enocomic factors in the areas that they are located," "serve as major congerating ponints," and "have served as anchors for substantinal development." So by your logic, each of these individual Walmart stores would merit their own article. But these facts can all be noted in the main Mills Corp and Wal-Mart articles, so there's no need to have individual articles about individual malls. Just like McDonalds, or any other chain, the chain itself may be notable, but individual franchises (or company-owned stores) usually aren't. Also, if you follow -up on your threat to propose the deletion of those other articles then you'll be violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I've looked at all the articles and have seen a lot of repetition and nothing that struck me as noteworthy about any of them. As for the Vaughan Mills, I would be willing to excluded it from this AFD in the interest of focusing just on the malls with no obvious notability. But I am very dubious about Vaughan Mills' claim to notability as "one of the largest shopping centers in Canada." One out of how many??? And where's the substantiation of this? Also, its Google test doesn't show much notability - it gets under 62,000 google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Vaughan+Mills%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Vaughan+Mills%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, compared with 196,000 for Wal-Mart and Green Bay <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qPR&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22green+bay%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=qPR&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22green+bay%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>(should the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay%2C_WI_f043.html" title="Green Bay, WI">Green Bay, WI</a> Wal-Marts get their own article too?) and over one million for "Mall of America." <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mall+of+america%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mall+of+america%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:59, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> That's a bit of flawed reasoning. For any given metropolis, there's only going to be one Mills location tops. But for the same area, there could be a dozen Wal-Marts. For example, Vaughan Mills serves the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a>; the same area contains 21 local Walmart stores. <a href="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-Storefinder.jsp?page=sfd" class="external autonumber" title="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-Storefinder.jsp?page=sfd" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>
<ul>
<li>It may not be a perfect analogy, but there's no flaw in the reasoning. You can also look at towns which only have one Wal-Mart store, like Markham, ON <a href="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-StorefinderResult.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://walmart.crosscap.ca/wps-portal/storelocator/Canada-StorefinderResult.jsp" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>, whose Wal-Marts still get more Google hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> than the supposedly noteworthy Vaughan Mills. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 21:24, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> If you're going to be specific, the Wal-Mart is located at Markville Shopping Centre, I go there semi-regularly. So when you do a combined Google search for "Markville Shopping Centre" and "Wal-Mart", it only yields 1,360 hits <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?as_q=Markville+Shopping+Centre+Wal-Mart&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?as_q=Markville+Shopping+Centre+Wal-Mart&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. I looked at the combined hits for "Markham" and "Wal-Mart" and lot of them contain references to <i>other</i> Wal-Marts in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">GTA</a> or Ontario in general, not the specific store at Markvile Shopping Centre, Markham. Some of the results in the same search yielded links to Robert Markham or to stores in Arkansas, lol. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 21:32, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added "Ontario" to the search, and still got almost as many hits as the supposedly famous Vaughn Mills <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22+ontario&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22wal-mart%22+%22Markham%22+ontario&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, even though this was certainly excluding a good number of websites which mentioned this wal-mart without bothering to spell out the name of the provence. Names of the shopping centers are often little-used, in favor of the center's location or the name of it's most well-known store, so the number of hits for "Markville Shopping Centre" isn't really relevant. The point still stands that Walmarts in many cities have a level of notability on a par with, or even surpassing, that of the idividual Mills chain mall in the area. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 22:06, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> Each Mills mall has its own distinct identity; they're regional shopping centres so they have to cater to the tastes of their particular regions. They're also magnets for (tourist) shoppers because of their size, something that can't be said for Wal-Mart, which has hundreds of locations with a homogenized selection of products. Unlike Wal-Mart, each mall has its own distinct set of stores, attractions (skate parks, go kart tracks, bowling alleys, etc.) and architecture.
<ul>
<li>I think you miss the point that Mills Corp is both a brand <i>and</i> a retail developer. A lot of malls were built by a single developer. For example, <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_Fairview_79dd.html" title="Cadillac Fairview">Cadillac Fairview</a> owns a portfolio of shopping centres throughout Canada including the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Eaton_Centre_bc0f.html" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">Toronto Eaton Centre</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairview_Mall_147d.html" title="Fairview Mall">Fairview Mall</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Galeries_d%27Anjou_d4b5.html" title="Les Galeries d'Anjou">Les Galeries d'Anjou</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto-Dominion_Centre_0f52.html" title="Toronto-Dominion Centre">Toronto-Dominion Centre</a>, yet I don't see anyone making a fuss of removing those articles because they're all part of the same chain. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadchester_c727.html" title="User:Madchester">Madchester</a> 21:02, 23 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm very dubious about how much "distinct identity" any of these malls have. Wal-Marts will cater their selection to their location as well. For example, the Wal-Marts in North Dakota have a much larger selection of winter coats than the Wal-Marts in Florida, which have a much larger selection of swimming suits. Also, none of the malls you listed there are noteworthy either, and just becuase someone hasn't gotten around to proposing them for deletion yet doesn't mean they're deserving of inclusion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 21:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> If nothing else, one way to determine notability is by having people who live near the malls vote on it, based on their perception of how significant the mall is to their region. Only the vote can determine that. Also, I don't think that articles about corporations should go out of their way to tout how notable they are (square feet of space, number of visitors, tax revenue, percentile rankings, etc), as that makes the article start to read like a corporate advertisement. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 23:32, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Qirex makes some important points. Too much attention was paid to the Walmart analogy, which though useful was not the best one. A more apt comparison would be to other chains that usually just have one store per metropolitain area and can draw customers from the surrounding region - stores like <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabela%27s.html" title="Cabela's">Cabela's</a> or tourist hangouts like the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Cafe_d94d.html" title="Hard Rock Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a>. While these chains are both notable, none of their individual stores are, in spite of some regional variation between them. As Qirex also noted, in order for a mall to be considered a bonified tourist draw, it has to be a <i>primary motivating factor</i> that induces people to travel to the area, not just a place they might happen to stop at while they're there or on the way there. Additionally, if the claim of siginficant uniqueness of any of the stores is to hold water, they have to also be a primary motivating factor for significant numbers of people who live in close proximity to one Mills Mall to travel significant distance to visit another. Many thousands of people who live in the Boston area travel to San Fransisco each year to experience its unique culture and attractions (and vice versa), but I highly doubt that hardly anyone who lives in Cincinnati Ohio (near the Cincinnati Mills) would travel to Toronto or Charlotte areas (with a primary motivation being) to visit the Vaughan Mills or the Concord Mills. So therefore there's no unique notability. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 01:13, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a ridiculous comparison. Libraries don't need to qualify as tourist attractions to be included (though Chicago's, with its unique history, probably would qualify). Chicago is famous for it's "L" system. Also, commercial businesses are held to higher standards of notability than public landmarks in order to avoid advertising. And individual stores within a chain must be held to especially high standards. Metro-Chicago may be known to some people in Rockford or Bloomington as a big city where they can go to shop at big malls, but someone from St. Louis or Cincinati (with their own Mills stores) isn't likely to travel to the Chicago area to shop at the Gurnee Mills. If it were a unique tourist attraction then they would. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 02:11, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> That's the point of a Mills store. It isn't suppose to draw in everyone across the continent. It's suppose to be a <i>regional</i> shopping destination.

<li><b>Comment.</b> The problem with that analogy is that Hard Rock Cafes are still more commonplace than Mills locations. There's only 25 or so Mills locations globally; there's 143 Hard Rock Cafes worldwide.

<li><b>Delete all</b> (though I also would be okay with redirecting them all to the main article). Individual malls do not pass any of the traditional senses of "encyclopedic". As economic entities, none of them meet our generally accepted criteria for inclusion. These articles are more like advertising copy than real articles. They include directory listings of stores, directions to the mall, etc. These are the contents of the marketing brochure, not an encyclopedia. We make exceptions for truly notable malls - entities which have an impact well outside their immediate area. I could find no evidence supporting such an exception in any of these cases. Drawing in customers from a multi-state area does not, in my mind, meet the necessary level. Furthermore, I find the arguments about "consistency" and "precedent" unpersuasive. Just because we haven't yet deleted other equally non-encyclopedic articles does not mean that we should perpetuate the mistake here. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:12, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> Each of these malls also has its own unique history. For instance, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Mills_041b.html" title="Cincinnati Mills">Cincinnati Mills</a> started its days as Forest Fair Mall, which struggled for a long time and underwent numerous alterations and such, and also weathered a fire at some point in its history <a href="http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/forest_fair_mall.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deadmalls.com/malls/forest_fair_mall.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. So the way I see it, we're not only thinking about these mall pages as far as describing present offerings, but also thinking about retail history buffs, for instance, whose interest is on how these malls came to be in their current situations. So I think there's definitely reason for all of the individual pages to exist, and also plenty of room to expand these articles, too. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 01:00, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep All</b> Mills is on the leading edge of retail and the projects associated with them have a huge impact on communities, economics, and trends in retail. The articles need to be developed further and it looks like there are many people here who have information about the articles that can be used to strengthen them. An article should not be deleted because it appears weak and someone therefore thinks it is not notable. Most articles start off small and need time to grow. These articles have been growing due to the contributions of many users. They need more time to develop. Information should be added to them about when they were first opened, the retail concepts used, and what makes them unique. For those that want to delete these, please instead focus your energy on making articles in Wikipedia better, rather than trying to rip away the work of others. 24.240.204.226 19:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As someone who has lived by two of the Mills malls as well in a small town where WalMart was <i>the</i> economic powerhouse for the area, the comparison is a severely mistaken one. However, I feel that many of you miss the point here. I don't see any point in deleting them. Are we running out of space? I mean, I frankly don't care whether they're one page or many, as long as the search gets the information. But since they're already there, is there a point in merging them? I mean, it is very mistaken to say that Potomac Mills, for example, isn't a notable landmark for Virginia, Maryland, DC, and West Virginia. Lakeforest Mall isn't nearly as important, but it's a fairly major landmark for the DC Metro Area. From what I've read, a number of the other malls serve as economic and social epicenters throughout multiple states, as well. And while I've lived near the largest WalMart on the east coast, and I've known people to cross state lines to come to said WalMart, they come because they don't have a WalMart. And the state line is mere miles away. It's hardly analogous, unless you're ignoring scale entirely. Moreover, I hardly think the information on the articles is advertising. It served as merely informative, for me. I hope I'm not giving other people too much credit when I say I think that they'll see it the same way. So as long as there are no plans to delete relevant information about the individual malls (location, notable features, etc), I don't care whether it's one article or twenty, though I don't really see the point of consolidation. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchrodingersRoot_1024.html" title="User:SchrodingersRoot">SchrodingersRoot</a> 15:49, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I strongly disagree with the broad statement that individual malls do not merit their own articles unless they are "famous". First, I have real problems with someone outside of Canada determining what is "famous" or "distinct" in Canada. Case in point: someone above mentioned that (s)he didn't think that the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Eaton_Centre_bc0f.html" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">Toronto Eaton Centre</a> has a "distinct identity" worthy of an article, which is downright wrong given the centre's history and status in both Toronto and Canada.

<dd>Vaughan Mills, as the first Canadian Mills mall, has had significant land use and retail implications for this country, and although these impacts have not yet been fully explored in the Vaughan Mills article (the mall just opened recently), I think it's just plain incorrect to suggest that these issues could be properly addressed in a general Mills article that deals primarily with U.S. issues.</dd>
<dd>In this day and age, malls and retail centres often function as community and local landmarks. While such malls might not, upon a quick glance, seem "distinct" to someone who is not from that area, those centres are often of great importance to that local and broader areas. For that reason, I can't say whether some of the other Mills malls are worthy of individual articles or not, because I'm from Ontario, and frankly I can't speak to the importance of say, a Mills mall in Florida, to the people in that state. I think these determinations should be left to the people who actually know these places. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just to add - I <b>do</b> agree with some of the comments made about these articles being "advertising" for the malls and or mall owners.

<p>KEEP! Southdale Mall was the first fully enclosed shopping center in the United States. It set the standard for the common malls that we see all over the world today.

<p>KEEP! Maybe a single entry for the rest of the Mills malls would be appropriate, but the Southdale shopping center is a landmark event for the social and cultural study of mall history (and people really do study this--see James Farrell's book <i>One Nation Under Goods: Malls and the Seductions of American Shopping</i>, Smithsonian, 2003). Subsuming this entry into an article about the Mills mall chain or whatever it is would be a patently bad idea.--TheChickens 08:13, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Supposedly about a parody magazine, but I can't confirm that it even exists. Even if it does, it almost certainly doesn't qualify as notable--it was originally created for a Current Events class. Googling on the phrase "Vosh magazine" gets 2 hits, both WP mirrors. Even a search for +Vosh +magazine gets only 1500 hits, and those appear not to be relevant--this magazine was not mentioned within the top 30. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 05:36, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Google returns nothing. I think they're bringing the parody here: "VOSH came to an end when the syndication deal terminated. Despite the short run, VOSH has had a tremendous cult following and several magazines have tried to capture the feel and design." <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:38, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I have heard of this magazine. I am not affiliated with the creators at all. I believe this article is about a magazine that has reached cult status in a particular state that neither of you live, which is understandable. However, to the people living in this state this article has perdenance and should be kept to please everyone. -BK</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't delete</b> For those who don't believe in the magazine's existance, I can fully backup its unbreathed animitity. Although the result of a google search shows less reassuring evidence, it is probably because of the lesser amount of publication about the magazine. The comeback startled my friends and me. We all got out out wallets to purchase the hilarity known as Vosh. Beleive what you want, but the truth is known by myself. I don't personally know the creators, but it's apparen that they enjoy any form of public attention, and deleting this would sadden the creators and might affect the content of the magazine----Ej Streib</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I have never heard of this magazine, but I think that the fact that google shows limited results does not permit deletion. There are other mediums that this magazine might be well known as. As for saying "they're bringing the parody here", if you can't prove it's wrong, you're at no position to say that. I've seen worse articles on this site. It's only fair to leave this one here. -I don't have a screen name but I browse Wiki frequently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is Mazeman, creator of the article. The magazine started, as the article states, in a Current Events class that I attended as well. Big things can start in small places. I knew the creators, Johnson and Soldiers, quite well and I was behind them when they sent in VOSH to a small syndication company in New York. The first seven issues sold nearly 200 each, which, for a magazine that started in a Current Events class, was huge. Their was a critic working at the syndication that did look over the issues. I assure you this magazine is real and, just because its not huge, or on Google, it does not deserve to be deleted from this site.-[[User:Mazeman|User:Mazeman/Sig]] ]</li>

<b>Don't Delete</b> I can see why you'd want to remove this article, but I want you to tell me why it should stay. Point out some positives. Just because the magazine doesn't affect you (nor does it affect me) I'm sure it is a form of formal reference for the curious few that want to find something out.</p>
