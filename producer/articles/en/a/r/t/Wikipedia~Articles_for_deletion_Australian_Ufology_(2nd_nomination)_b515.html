<p><b>Delete</b> (There are many omissions, so much so that it is difficult to argue that it is an accurate history, rather a skewed history that seems to spend a lot of space offering a history that approximates what many Australian UFO researchers know but with some aspects few of us are familar with. The owner of the Wikipedia "Australian Ufology" entry is censoring efforts to correct and edit this skewed and incomplete history so it would be appropriate to highlight the questionable nature of the document and its owner attempt to white out a lot of history and contributions, seemingly in an effort to create a <b>biased and some what flawed history of Australian Ufology</b>.)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> (Over the years there has been a concerted effort by some UFO researchers to present the real History of Australian Ufology. Independent researchers like Bill Chalker spent years sifting through military files collating Australias UFO History but is continually Deleted from this page. This site is a misrepresentation of the true History of Australian Ufology and should be deleted. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u continually disrupt &amp; delete all and every additional information posted to this page. They omit and disregarded the efforts of many Australian ufologists and have kept reverting and posting their own version of Australian Ufology History. User: VUFORS and User: Auforn4u are trying to create a biased and distorted version of Australian UFO History and do so with the blessing of you Wiki voters. If this is what Wiki is all about then one has to wonder if the information on the rest of the Wiki server is verifiable and truly helpful information. AUFORN

<li><b>Delete</b> AUFORN researchers have apparently given up on Wikipedia and trying to add content on this disputed page as well as on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Ufology_fa9a.html" title="Australian Ufology">Australian Ufology</a> due to constant deletion, harrassment and disruption by <a href="../../../v/u/f/User%7EVufors_708e.html" title="User:Vufors">Vufors</a> and Auforn4u who are both related to IP <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.83.73.188_dd22.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.83.73.188">202.83.73.188</a>. Both of these usernames misrepresent the two organisations concerned (VUFORS and AUFORN) and the information provided on either article at the moment is not vouched for by them.

<li><b>Comment</b> This might be one for <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>. The talk page on Australian Ufology redirects to the main contributor's talk page. It is a fairly poor quality article though I could see scope for an article of this sort. On the other hand, there are no other examples of localised <a href="../../../u/f/o/Ufology.html" title="Ufology">Ufology</a>. I know very little about the subject but could be tempted with a <b>Merge</b> vote. Also nominator should sign in. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 14:25, 14 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> hmmm, it seems that this AfD has not been set up right. I looked into how to fix it and found that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Ufology_fa9a.html" title="Australian Ufology">Australian Ufology</a> has an AfD tag on the article but that the tag refers to an AfD that was concluded with No Consensus on 26 Jan 2006. Also the title is capitalised for Ufology which isn't in line with manual of style. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 14:29, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: An anonymous user seems to have a personal vendetta against VUFORS and wants to wipe it off Wikipedia. However he doesn't seem to understand the difference between user pages (<a href="../../../v/u/f/User_talk%7EVufors_3d65.html" title="User talk:Vufors">User talk:Vufors</a>) and Wikipedia articles (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Ufology_fa9a.html" title="Australian Ufology">Australian Ufology</a>). He also doesn't understand how the AfD listing page works.

<li><b>JIP</b>, <b>Delete</b>. The anonymous user is me Diane Harrrison and I <b>do not</b> hold a biasted vendette against VUFORS it is actually the other way around and I had no idea you couldn't nominate a talk page for deletion, but he should be deleted as VUFORS continually breaks Wiki policy. These guys VUFORS &amp; AUFO4u continually delete anything and everything I've posted and other AUFORN UFO researchers have posted to this page. I've been continually deleted from the Australian Administration segment along with Bill Chalker &amp; Robert Frola who have been contributing since the 70s &amp; 80s and the excuse VUFORS gives, <i>we are not pre 1981</i>. If this is the case ACERN and many others listed are neither pre 1981. Do you see any reference which states you have to be pre 81 <i>no</i> does it stat this on this on the page no. So ask yourself who really is trying to post a biased side of history. Go back to the history of this page and you find I am correct. VUFORS like you is an additionalists, but VUFORS continually breaks Wiki policy with the blessing of you guys. You have people posting comments about our Australian UFO history that have no idea of our UFO History, yet some of you vote to keep a biased version of it. <i>Diane Harrison</i>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> some but not all of that is true. The talk page at Australian Ufology has been redirected to User:VUFORS talk page.

<ul>
<li>I disagree with Vufors's redirection of the talk page to his own user talk page, but while the redirect is in place, the user talk page can't be nominated for deletion, as user talk pages in general can't. Regardless of Vufors's conduct, the anonymous user acted wrong in inserting his "delete VUFORS" comment to entirely unrelated AfD discussions, even after I warned him. Nominating <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Ufology_fa9a.html" title="Australian Ufology">Australian Ufology</a> for deletion is all OK. Nominating people's user or user talk pages is not. Vufors should be contacted about the redirection, and if he continues to ignore any discussion, there probably should be an RfC discussion. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 16:03, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
