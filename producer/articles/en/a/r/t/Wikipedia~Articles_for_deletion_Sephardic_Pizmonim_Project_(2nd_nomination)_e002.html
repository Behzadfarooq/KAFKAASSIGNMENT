</dl>
<p>The first AfD (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sephardic_Pizmonim_Project_e4c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sephardic Pizmonim Project">here</a> ended with no consensus, so I'm renominating it. Many of the voters voted keep simply because the article was new and were waiting for the article to grow and accrue more references. Sufficient time has passed and not much improvement has been achieved. I am cross-posting from <a href="../../../s/e/p/Talk%7ESephardic_Pizmonim_Project_68d7.html" title="Talk:Sephardic Pizmonim Project">Talk:Sephardic Pizmonim Project</a> my analysis of the two sources that <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Betesh_0168.html" title="User:David Betesh">User:David Betesh</a> has provided:</p>
<p>The organization is not notable, period. With all due respect to the wonderful cause that it represents, it is entirely unheard of outside of the Syrian community, and even inside the community its mention would barely raise an eyebrow. The two sources consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A paragraph from <i>Aleppo - City of Scholars</i> that reads (in its entirety):</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Mr. David Betesh, a great-grandson of Gabriel Shrem, received these tapes [of pizmonim] as a Bar Mitzvah gift from his grandmother, Florence Zeitouni, the daughter of Gabriel Shrem, and resolved to pass on this treasured gift to the entire community. He re-released and upgraded both the published and the unpublished works of his great-grandfather to create an inclusive and wide-ranging recording of pizmonim. The CD set, which is distributed by the Bnai Yosef Synagogue, also includes an explanation of the origin of each maqam, as well as the perashah or occasion during which it should be used and why."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>...which is honestly very nice, but it amounts to virtually nothing within an encyclopedic work about the Syrian Jewish community.</p>
<ul>
<li>An article in <i>Community Magazine</i>. Community Magazine is a publication geared to a small subset of the Syrian community, and it will routinely report on even the most insignificant happenings in the community [things like a high school's trip to Israel on a "chesed mission", or a small-time Orthodox Jewish magician who has to struggle to keep kosher on the road, etc.].</li>
</ul>
<p>The paucity of substance in the nature of each of these sources is reason enough to discount the notability of the SPP. In short, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 16:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, hmmm, it may be a small organization/project but this is where I believe <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a> comes into play. The project involves preserving Sephardic cultural elements that might otherwise soon be lost, and therefore carries historic, scholarly, cultural importance.

<li><b>Comment</b>, If it were on the same order as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Yiddish_Book_Center_b8c6.html" title="National Yiddish Book Center">National Yiddish Book Center</a> then I would agree to keep, but it's not. The example you gave is of an actual institution with personnel and a physical location to boot. The Sephardic Pizmonim Project is essentially one person (David Betesh) who decided to sell some CDs. Don't let the professional-looking web design of the website fool you. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 18:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that it is at least borderline. I can't find much in the way of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> referring to SPP on the internet, though I also don't see much of anything on the Syrian Sephardic community or pizmonim in general, which is probably due more to the fact that most of anything out there would not be in English. Btw, Aaron Lansky didn't always have personnel and a location for his Yiddish project (NYBC), he spent years as just a one-man student operation. I think projects dedicated to preserving ancient culture are of significant historical value that deserve an encyclopedia article. You'll definitely find more pop culture on the web, and are less likely to find info on nearly lost cultures. We want to keep "fluff" out of the encyclopedia, but I don't think this is fluff. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 18:35, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that would be an appropriate solution. I admire what Mr. Betesh has accomplished tremendously, and I do think his project deserves some kind of niche - just not its own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is just too close to the last AfD for such a low-traffic article and one in which I'm still trying to think of how we can judge these cultural artifacts verses how we would judge "fan cruft".

I just think that <a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">User:DLand</a> is being too tough on this one. Wikipedia has lots of time on its hands... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In logical analysis, it can be very easy to prove that something exists, while it can be treacherously difficult to prove that something <i>doesn't</i> exist (see <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_f4b0.html" title="Fermat's Last Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> for math buffs). This AfD demonstrates that the same applies to Wikipedia: It's extremely easy (and often disingenuous as a result) to "prove" that a topic is notable, while it is well nigh impossible to prove that it is not notable. Indeed, if actual <i>evidence</i> existed showing non-notability, it would not be non-notable in the first place! To the issue at hand - I, through my personal connection and exposure to the Syrian Jewish community in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatbush%2C_Brooklyn_97c0.html" title="Flatbush, Brooklyn">Flatbush, Brooklyn</a>, KNOW that the SPP is not notable. I can't <i>prove</i> that it's not notable, because that would be a logical fallacy. No other user (besides <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Betesh_0168.html" title="User:David Betesh">User:David Betesh</a>, obviously) can claim to have personal knowledge of this project. Of course I realize that this testimony doesn't hold much water in an AfD vote, but I feel that I should air my thoughts anyway. And to IZAK, I never said that the article is "villainous" - I just don't think it belongs in an encyclopedia, even one that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">not made of paper</a>. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 13:27, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong delete</b> There are much more important projects out there doing the same thing and ten times better. And more important websites on the topic. This is a unknown single person with only 5500 of CD- almost unknown. This is an unfunded project by an unknown. Here is a more important project funded by Avi Chai <a href="http://www.piyut.org.il/english/" class="external free" title="http://www.piyut.org.il/english/" rel="nofollow">http://www.piyut.org.il/english/</a> Hebrew University has a project of Pizmonim as do others.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayrav_83fd.html" title="User:Jayrav">Jayrav</a> 14:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>KEEP</b> I use this web site for the knowledge it has to offer. This is a very helpful, educational and useful website. I agree there are many other projects to look up to and to move forward but i dont think it means we should push others down. Stop critisizing and start working on the important things, while others work on the less important think, at least in your eyes.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> In the first AFD, I wrote, "<b>Delete.</b> I really don't have a reason to delete, but I feel like sticking up for DLand for nominating a potentially nonnotable musical entity." I'm glad I have a chance to speak more wisely this time. DLand has established a clear case. It is incorrect to say that an article needs sources and the subject needs to be notable. An article needs sources, and those sources should affirm its notability. Everything depends on the sources. Since the sources are demonstrably trivial, notability has not been established. The SPP is a one-man, non-commercial project that has not received serious press coverage. If you take away the "Jewish culture" aspect, and evaluate solely based on <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it falls short of the criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 05:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
