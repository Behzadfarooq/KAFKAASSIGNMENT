<dd>Clarification: This nomination was closed early because there was already an on-going discussion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. The renomination should not have been created until that discussion had a chance to conclude. This prevents confusing and circular discussions.

<dd>As nominator I want to record the fact that I strongly dissent from any implication that an AfD discussion, which is based on consensus, can be prevented from proceeding because there is a prior discussion on DRV, which is not consensus-based. I see no reason why this nomination should not be re-opened by anyone wishing to record their opinion of whether this article should be deleted, but I will not edit war. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 09:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result was no consensus, and as is normal for such a result the article was kept. Someone has queried this result on the basis that he thinks the discussion favored deletion, and he has taken the unusual step of going to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> to try to get it deleted. Since Deletion Review is one of our few forums that are not consensus-based, I think it's probably fairer if the article is relisted for discussion in this consensus-based forum. I recommend, I admit rather lukewarmly, a keep, and present my arguments below. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looks like a perfectly good article to me. The existence, in the one full part of the United States that does not have statehood, and moreover the one devoted wholly to government of the United States, of streets (mostly avenues) named after all fifty states of the Union, is no coincidence, and a list of those streets is of encyclopedic value. It is of perhaps as much encyclopedic value as the list of streets of Atlentic City that appear in the US monopoly board, or lists of streets in London that appear in the British version. That is to say: not much, but the net value is positive and the article is unlikely to pose any great maintenance problems. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 02:57, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Tony Sidaway. The article has encyclopedic value, is completely verifable, and is more expandable than a category is. The content is certainly more encyclopedic than other lists we've deemed notable enough for inclusion. â€”<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 03:06, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Provides more than a category can, as it includes redlinks, and can include redirects (like if Ohio Drive were to redirect to the park it's contained in). Provides more than a redirect to <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> can, as it links to the roads. Provides more than <a href="../../../s/t/r/Category%7EStreets_in_Washington%2C_D.C._fceb.html" title="Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.">Category:Streets in Washington, D.C.</a> can, as it pulls out the ones specifically named after states - because, you know, not everyone lives in the U.S. or has the names of the states memorized. (I have split them off into a subcategory, but I don't have high hopes for its survival.) Common sense, dudes. This does more good than the zero harm in keeping it. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a> - <small><a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_SFD_e111.html" title="User:SPUI/SFD">don't use sorted stub templates!</a></small>) 03:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but maybe rename it to List of state-named Roads (or Streets) in Washington, D.C., so as to include Ohio and California, instead of just having them seem oddly out of place. <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 03:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>Keep, and enhance</b></i> While it is mildly problematic that there are <i>so</i> many redlinks currently, this only means that this worthwhile list regarding state-named roadways in the U.S. capital (and ancillary topics of DC being a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_town.html" title="New town">planned city</a>) should be enhanced. For instance, it'd be great if a map was devised to highlight all of these roadways. Furthermore, each entry should be accompanied by approximate locations in DC and/or all of them should be categorised/sectioned according to location (e.g., NE, Foggy Bottom, etc.) As well, I'd actually suggest <i><b>renaming</b></i> it to <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_state-named_roadways_in_Washington%2C_D.C._d710.html" title="List of state-named roadways in Washington, D.C.">List of state-named roadways in Washington, D.C.</a></i> (lower case <a href="../../../r/_/_/R.html" title="R">r</a>, since many roadways are named Avenue, Road, Street, et al.).

<li><b>Delete</b> per WP:NOT, etc. Hardly encyclopedic, atomic level detail on streets doesn't even qualify as "almanac style entry". Simple verifiablility isn't the hurdle for inclusion, we're an encyclopedia, not Everything 2. While we're at it, censure Tony Sidaway for bad-faith venue shopping. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 05:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This has been a strange debate. I have no strong feelings about the article (other than my original vote of <b>delete</b> as non-notable listcruft) but I note tensions run high in others (both supporting and not). I don't know why this AfD was closed early as there was no consensus for speedy keep.
