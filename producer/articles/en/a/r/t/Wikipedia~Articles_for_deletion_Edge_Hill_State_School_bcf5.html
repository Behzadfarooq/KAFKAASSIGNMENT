<li>Oh, I think you're on shaky ground there. There are lots of ways to verify a house. If Cmadler's real world name happens to be what you'd think, and if he or she cares to disclose the city in which they live—for a slightly rarer name the state would be enough—and if it's in the U.S.,you could use an online white pages like <a href="http://www.anywho.com" class="external text" title="http://www.anywho.com" rel="nofollow">anywho</a> or <a href="http://www.switchboard.com" class="external text" title="http://www.switchboard.com" rel="nofollow">switchboard</a> to find their street address. Depending on exactly where they live there's a good chance you could get enough of an image through Terraserver or other online aerial photography sources to verify the existence of the house. In certain downtown areas of major cities, www.a9.com has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0005YAE8E/amzna9-4-20/ref=yp_a9_3/002-8401604-3094447" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0005YAE8E/amzna9-4-20/ref=yp_a9_3/002-8401604-3094447" rel="nofollow">streetlevel imagery</a> of entire streets, Pinckney Street in this case, and you can "walk" up and down and see some of the nice private residences on Pinckney Street. Are they all worthy of individual articles? You could use one of the online real estate databases to find out whether that house had been bought or sold in the last twenty years or so, and for how much. And that's just for starters. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A sign of things to come, I think. Even primary schools are regularly surviving the AfD process, which will likely cause a moderate increase in the nominations of primary schools in response as attempts to peel off a few articles through attrition against the most vulernable. Obviously, poorly written articles about primary schools are the most vulernable of all, because some votes will be cast against the school before it can be re-written and cleaned up - some of those voters will never come back to change votes, even if they might otherwise have voted to <b>keep</b> in the first place. Nonetheless, YTD school articles AfD statistics: 277 nominated, 228 kept, 37 deleted.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:07, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Take this, and all the other substub articles created via links from the education section of the <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairns%2C_Queensland_be34.html" title="Cairns, Queensland">Cairns, Queensland</a> and merge them into one article on education in the area. Which might actually be useful for something other than a child saying "oh look, our school has an article" and obsessives counting the number of stubs they can create. I am assuming here that we're actually trying to create a useful encyclopedia here rather than tiny, pathetic, feeble stubs about everything in the off-chance that something might happen to enable us to write a decent article. I mean, what do we have on this - it's a school, it's in Cairns, it has a headteacher. You could put the useful info on these schools in a table - name, age range, size. Which might actually be useful for people wanting to look up education in Cairns. But I suppose that takes more effort than just creating a bunch of sub-stubs which take far, far longer to look at than information on one page, and in all probability won't get maintained. After all, the time of people reading Wikipedia is NOT valueless. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:05, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The current article is not a sub-stub and is more useful for anyone who needs to know about the school itself than a merged page would be, so in fact it is saving them time. Note that it was created by an anon from a red link, so presumably it was a helpful outsider rather than an obsessive wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The claim that this is a sub-stub is currently false. Google counting seems to me like a somewhat bizarre method to determine the encyclopedic nature of a school.

<li>I would still classify it as a substub. There is no more information that is of relevance that has been added since the VFD was tagged. However I will note that the only development on this article (however miniscule and irrelevant) has come as a result OF the VfD.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 01:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We only delete articles that are <i>incapable</i> of improvement. An article that shows visible improvement during a deletion discussion, well... You also claim that there is "no more information of relevance that has been added" since you listed it for deletion. This is blatantly false. Since being listed, the article has acquired a reference, the date it was founded, the coalition of which it is a member, and the name of the headmistress. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:11, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The addition of information to an article, caused because of an AfD listing, is obviously not a criteria for deletion. The argument being constructed here is: "the only development on this article has come as a result OF the AfD - therefore the article should be deleted". This inherently fellacious argument does not even merit a response.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 22:57, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Of course it is. All articles on Wikipedia have to have some notability attached to them. Schools are no exception. But that was not the basis of this AfD, but rather the fact this article can never grow into anything but a glorified stub as there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:59, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is false. As per Wikipedia <b>Policy</b> at <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, Lack of Notability is not a listed criteria for deletion, nor is being obscure, nor is being "unimportant". It is misleading to make the claim that "All articles on Wikipedia have to have some notability attached to them. Schools are no exception" in large measure because you are simply applying your own standard of "notability" to an article you feel should be deleted. In any event, my response was not made on the basis of your nomination, but rather to several votes on this page, including the one to which I responded directly prior to your reply. Further, the article has already "grown" beyond what it was when nominated. Assertions that it will only be a "glorified stub", and "there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature" are not objective facts - only subjective statements. Please prove your assertion that "there is little information relating to this school of an encyclopedic nature" with something a little more convincing than a "Google search".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:17, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
