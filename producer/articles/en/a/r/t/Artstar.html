<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artstar.html" title="Edit section: The Exhibition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Exhibition</span></h2>
<p>In the second episode of the series, the Artstars were asked to participate in The Art Parade, a Deitch Projects event where artists, performers and designers were invited to create floats, placards, spectacles and street performances. The Artstars were less than enthusiastic about the prospect (Abigail Deville is quoted in <i>The New York Times</i> on May 28, 2006 as saying, "I mean, come on, a parade?"). Christian Dietkus, one of the other artists, confronted Jeffrey Deitch about whether or not an actual ARTSTAR exhibition would also be part of the television program, as originally promised. Deitch was vague about specifics at the time but promised that there would be a gallery show at some point.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2006, Deitch Projects opened the ARTSTAR exhibition to the public, showcasing the culminating product of the Artstars' individual efforts during the program. Anney Fresh created a giant polar bear with its head stuck in a crate. Visitors could comb the bear's hair and look into the crate to see the bear's dreams. Virgil Wong exhibited a <a href="http://www.virgilwong.com/installations/corporealgarden/index.shtml?name1=Corporeal+Garden&amp;type1=2Active/" class="external text" title="http://www.virgilwong.com/installations/corporealgarden/index.shtml?name1=Corporeal+Garden&amp;type1=2Active/" rel="nofollow">twenty foot tall mural</a> depicting a walking figure composed of both paint and digital 3-D video projections (see right). Visitors to the gallery could inject medical nanotechnology into the body using a video game controller, and a pool of moving MRI brain images reflected in a Zen-like garden.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artstar.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Early episodes of ARTSTAR have been criticized for being extended infomercials for Deitch Projects. Like <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Trump_e51a.html" title="Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_e490.html" title="The Apprentice">The Apprentice</a>, Jeffrey Deitch is described in glowingly positive terms, by other dealers and artists in this case, and there are constant references to the "exciting" work that happens in his gallery. Also, Deitch was quoted as saying, "In the 1970s … no self-respecting artist would have stood in line to try to get on a television show," and critics have claimed that self-respecting artists were still declining Deitch's invitation today (<i>Slate</i>, June 16, 2006). While some observers have appreciated the show's avoidance of reality television cliches like eliminating contestants each week and salacious personal dramas, others contend that ARTSTAR should have been billed instead (and produced) as an art documentary.</p>
