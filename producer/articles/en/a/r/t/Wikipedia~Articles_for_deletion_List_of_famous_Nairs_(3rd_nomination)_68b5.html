The reason given by Sbei78 is that there are lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a>, so this list should be kept as well. I would like to point out that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a> is a fully-cited list.

<p><br />
The argument that "lists can be verified later" doesn't go down, because the list has been existing since over a year now, and nobody has bothered to provide a single citation or source. There is no way of verifying these entries except relying on information from personal users, most of whom are hell-bent on adding every other famous person to list of their caste, which essentially means POV. Please don't blindly vote keep/merge. None of the users who voted Keep last for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Nairs_fa2a.html" title="List of famous Nairs">List of famous Nairs</a> time have bothered to cleanup or verify the list.

<li>The surnames don't always indicate caste (for eg. Mira Nair is Punjabi)<small>(1)</small>. Except OBCs, SC/STs, castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources. The only sources are the personal sources or magazines/websites run by caste-based organizations. Also, please note that many people (esp. nationalists) that editors have categorized as "Famous Bhumihars" or "Nairs" do not believe in caste system and don't consider themselves as Bhumihars or Nairs. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, I think this is an unacceptable racist comment and I wonder whether it is not really put up by those who are obsessed with "delete" to discredit the supporters of this list. Frankly if all kinds of people, including the Jews, who like the Nairs are scattered all over the world (the word <i>diaspora</i> was first coined for the jewish people) are allowed to have their list in peace (which is also not perfectly verifiable by the above standards), I don't see why the Nairs can't!<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustice4us_050b.html" title="User:Justice4us">Justice4us</a> 21:31, 29 October 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom or <b>Rename</b> per Bakaman. The word "famous" is inherently POV, as has been discussed many times before. There is <i>no way</i> this list should be allowed to remain with its current name. And there are far too many indiscriminate, unverifiable lists on WP already. The argument that we should have more bad lists because of existing bad lists is futile per GRBerry. We don't keep spam just because there are other spam articles that have yet to be deleted. I find the precedents cited by nom compelling, and think deletion is the best option. Conversion to category is possible too (maybe even preferable to renaming), but the word "famous", in any case, <i>absolutely</i> must go! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 20:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> step in the right direction, but for me, the real deciding factor is, "castes don't exist officially -- so, there are few official sources." To me, that puts it right in the same category as List of middle-class people or List of rednecks, and not in the same category as verifiable lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scientologists_e09a.html" title="List of Scientologists">List of Scientologists</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Welsh_people_69a4.html" title="List of Welsh people">List of Welsh people</a>. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 22:31, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong, Strong keep</b> I think this is really an obsession with some people on the <i>delete</i> side and I don't think "obsessions" are to be encouraged on a free site like Wikipedia.

If other lists of people exist, I don't see why the list of Nairs (renamed) should not exist. BTW the Nairs are not neccessary a caste and are really quite famous as a people for they are featured in <i>The Lusiad</i> the National Epic of Portugal published in 1523 and also you can find a write-up of them in the Encyclopedia Britannica.<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustice4us_050b.html" title="User:Justice4us">Justice4us</a> 20:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustice4us_050b.html" title="User:Justice4us">Justice4us</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustice4us_2161.html" title="User talk:Justice4us">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justice4us_ab7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justice4us">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>I volunteer to attempt to clean up the page if this survives the AfD process. In fact I will print down a copy of the present list to have on record all the red links, and after I finish editing and creating for notables in Singapore Literature (in a short period of less than a month, I have created several profiles of notable Singaporean poets, playwrights, novelists etc), I will make this my next project. A simple google search will show whether the red links should be even considered for notability. But with so many names I will certainly need a lot of assistance, and I can't promise to be able to check everyone.<small>(btw I just cleaned and rearranged this page. I hope it's more user friendly now:-)</small> <a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvygohnair_89c5.html" title="User:Ivygohnair">Ivygohnair</a> 08:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My opposition is based almost entirely on the unmaintainability and non-verifiablity of the list. If someone takes the responsiblity and actually weeds out the random entries, it may yet turn out to be of some worth. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 07:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
