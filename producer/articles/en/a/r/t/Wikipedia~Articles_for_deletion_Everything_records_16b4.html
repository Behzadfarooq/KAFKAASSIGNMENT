I can understand it more as a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity.html" title="Vanity">vanity</a> issue, but i keep getting the feeling that users here think that if they can't find music on google, it doesn't exist.

<dd>No, I'm happy to accept that things I can't find on Google exist. In fact, I'm busy trying to track down stuff based only on titles and a poorly-arranged cover track.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wiki should not be a platform for infastructure. The absence of a seperate website from wiki suggests aghost is using this page as a means to avoid webhosting costs.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Being a Baltimore resident, I am familiar with the label Everything records. I also attest that this label was present before it was "founded" on Wikipedia, as I am an acquaintance with the founder. Must there be a fancy website to show proof? Yes, the label is small and open-source, but the persons that have voted for deletion are simply not informed. As the internet is the only frame of reference for many people to conduct research on an article within Wikipedia, I understand how administrators might feel if a primarily electronic and computer-music record label does not have a notable website to display capitalist ideals. I stress that deletion of this article would symbolize the non-observation of a documented fact. I have walked into a store, albeit only in Baltimore at the time, and purchased music produced by this label. I have seen their studio, I have handed out flyers for performances. They exist, and not because of Wikipedia. The founder is merely attempting to provide this site with factual information. I comprehend WHY some would wish to delete this article, but again, I stress that decision comes from the inability to locate convenient urls for Everything Records and endless caches of online-music purchases from the label. <i>....posted at 02:02, 2005 May 25 by Pyramidman a new username whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Pyramidman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Pyramidman" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> have been extraordinarily limited.</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no evidence of notability, aside from issues of vanity articles and using wikipedia as a hosting service.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Per earlier comments above, yes I agree Everything Records exists. But, there are several people/groups who think they are the one, true Everything Records. See <a href="http://www.absolutely.net/music/uk_new_releases_in_pop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.absolutely.net/music/uk_new_releases_in_pop.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (see album Something Borrowed) and <a href="http://www.motherbuster.com/mullismixes/evrthing.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.motherbuster.com/mullismixes/evrthing.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Aghost found his version of Everything Records here on Wikipedia, which is not a hosting service, and something that was founded on 20 May of this year has hardly been in existence long enough to be considered notable. Aghost similarly founded Free Online University on Wikipedia. That article was put up for deletion, and it lost. See [Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Free_Online_University]. This project is little different. I don't think we should be taking the stance that anything made/edited by Aghost should be ruthlessly hunted down and deleted. I do think we should fairly and judiciously apply Wikipedia's policies. In this case, it seems very clear this article should be deleted based on Wikipedia policies. If, however, the article were re-written to be about a considerably more notable Everything Records, then we perhaps consider keeping it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 02:38, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
