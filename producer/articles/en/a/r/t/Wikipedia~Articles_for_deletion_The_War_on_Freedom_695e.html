<li>Fughettaboutit makes a good effort but he really hasn't established notability. Please note that <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> is a proposed guideline, not policy, and in the opinion of many it is way too inclusionist. 221 libraries out of 10,000 is still next to nothing, probably millions of books fit that criteria. I noticed the editorial reviews at Amazon, they all seem to be from within the 9/11 conspiracy community. Same with many of the google scholar hits. I see 99 books listed as those made available to the 9/11 commission - I'm guessing the national archives included every book on the subject of 9/11 in this list regardless of notability or quality. The Vanity Fair article is a one-line mention. That leaves what, the Missoula Independent? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 01:13, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fughettaboutit makes a strong case <b>and</b> demonstrates the weakness -- indeed, the outright falsity -- of the case you made for deletion. Nitpicking about the number of libraries is a bit absurd at this point. I have seen this book cited in numerous other works; it is certainly notable enough to meet the criteria we have at wikipedia. I sense this was nominated for POV reasons (and there seems to be a pretty organized movement of the same group of editors to delete books on this specific topic, something very problematic in Wikipedia terms, I think).--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:43, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. And many label me a deletionist! If any of you think <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> is too inclusionist, please drop by the talk page and make some suggestions. We have been struggling against a tide of inclusionists railing that the criteria are <i>too stringent</i> and suffer from a lack of feedback. Okay, back to the matter at hand. Discounting everything else I posted, the Vanity Fair article, while it is not a detailed treatment of the book itself, is a very reliable source indicating that the book won Italy's highest literary prize. Do you dispute the reliability of that fact? If not, isn't a book which wins a country's most prestigious literary prize notable on that basis alone? In any case, as for more reliable sources, how does England's <a href="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=%22Nafeez%20Mosaddeq%20Ahmed%22" class="external text" title="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=%22Nafeez%20Mosaddeq%20Ahmed%22" rel="nofollow">Guardian Unlimited</a> strike you.

<dd>Ok let's get this one straight. Gore Vidal wrote an article for The Observer, London, Sunday 27th October 2002 and available <a href="http://www.analitica.com/bitblio/gore_vidal/enemy.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.analitica.com/bitblio/gore_vidal/enemy.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.isebrand.com/Gore_Vidal_Enemy_2002.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.isebrand.com/Gore_Vidal_Enemy_2002.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://9-11congress.netfirms.com/Vidal.html" class="external text" title="http://9-11congress.netfirms.com/Vidal.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and<a href="http://www.house.gov/mcdermott/pr_gore_vidal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.house.gov/mcdermott/pr_gore_vidal.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>It's a good idea to review the article up for deletion before commenting, as one of your above statements is easily provably false. Regarding the Naples Prize, if you search for <i>"Premio Napoli" -ahmed</i> (to get hits not including this author), you get 28K hits, approx 700 unique. Searching on <i>"Fondazione Premio Napoli"</i> (a more precise name) gives 133 unique hits. Even <i>"Naples Prize" -ahmed</i>, a more restrictive search than what you state above, gives hits beyond just the Institute's Chicago website. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 12:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Sparkhead, it's a good idea to read comments before replying, to avoid making yourself look foolish. My point is not about the (non)notability of the Naples Prize. Do you deny that there are a lot of English-language pages which mention that prize and are apparently intended to promote this conspiracy theorist and his book? This is called <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_optimization.html" title="Search engine optimization">Search engine optimization</a>. There are professional <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">search engine marketers</a> who can make money by getting their client's stuff into Wikipedia. There are also amateur Search Engine Optimizers who desperately want to promote various conspiracy theories and will happily abuse Wikipedia to do so. Our rules about notability etc are (among other things) designed to ensure articles don't get created just for SEO. My point is that someone has put a lot of effort into SEO for this book, and that people should take that effort into account when assessing its (lack of) notability. I assumed that everyone reading my earlier comment would understand this; clearly I was wrong. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">CWC</a><small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_Chittleborough_55c1.html" title="User talk:Chris Chittleborough">(talk)</a></small> 18:32, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the tip, you might want to review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, as well as take your own advice. As you state, clearly you were wrong. Your demonstrably false statement: "That the only newspaper to review this book was the <i>Missoula Independent</i> is significant." Read the article. Note the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Beach_Post_410a.html" title="Palm Beach Post">Palm Beach Post</a> review, easily verifiable, and the Playboy one, which is less so. Regarding search engine optimization, I ran a more restrictive search than you, and came up with hits from the Italian Cultural Institute's websites for Chicago and Los Angeles, hosted at the <b>Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</b> web domain. Not talking about fringe websites, these are institutions created by the Italian government. If you took the time to run the searches I detailed, you would have seen these results on the first page. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 19:05, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The only copy of that column we who do not subscribe to the <b>Palm Beach Post</b> have comes via <a href="http://www.waronfreedom.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.waronfreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.waronfreedom.org/</a>, run by people who <i>just might</i> have an agenda.</li>
<li>That <i>Palm Beach Post</i> column is an op-ed, <b>not a book review.</b> Real book reviews list the publisher's name and usually the ISBN. They do not spend several paragraphs describing the publisher, nor do they give helpful hints on how to purchase the book.</li>
<li>The <i>PBP</i> op-ed itself says explicitly that the book got only one review.</li>
<li>The Playboy article (again, not a review) was titled "A Roundup of Ridiculous Theories". 'nuff said.</li>
<li>I did ask Sparkhead a question; he did not even try to answer it.</li>
<li>Nor has Sparkhead addressed my point about SEO. Whether some Italian bureaucrats have set up some websites about the <i>Premio Napoli</i> is <b>completely irrelevant</b> to my point: someone has done a lot of SEO for this book. Implication #1: Google searches etc will inflate the book's significance, and we need to take that into account when assessing the results of such searches. Implication #2: whoever did (or is doing that SEO) will greatly desire Wikipedia to retain this article, and may well participate in this debate.</li>

<li>Again, check the article. There was a link put in there to the PBP archives before you posted that contains the opening paragraphs, which validates the article exists at PBP. Semantics aside it's an article that talks about a book - i.e. a book review in a mainstream paper. A reference from a reliable mainstream source, regardless of how you wish to label it. I addressed your point about SEO by noting it's irrelevant. Note in some of my searches I took out the author's name to reduce hits. It's also irrelevant that the Playboy article called it ridiculous. What's relevant is the mention. I see nothing new from you here, so I'll bow out of this exchange. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead"><b><font color="green">*Sparkhead</font></b></a> 14:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think some of the stuff they have been successful in removing needed to be removed, but a lot of it appears notable, and was nominated for AfD only because of the topic. I think this is especially problematic, as the reasons given for deletion are usually items that should be addressed in editing -- things like POV and WP:RS, better addressed through tags and discussions than deletion votes. I think an organized attack on articles about a particular topic like this is totally inappropriate in Wikipedia, even though I tend to agree with the group about these conspiracy theories being false.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 21:30, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It;s not an issue of big brother - it's an issue of an organized campaign against articles about these theories (which, I agree, are bogus). Look at the AfD on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_William_Christison_%28CIA%29_853c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/William Christison (CIA)">Bill Christison</a> - it's likely to be deleted because of a horribly misleading "google" count thanks to an organized crowd of deletionists engaged in what appears to be a form of groupthink. While there are plenty of articles on this topic that should be deleted, there should not be a group of editors systematically targeting specific pages just because of their POV on the topic. It is especially troubling that several of the pages have been deleted for reasons that are better addressed as content issues -- citations, POV, etc. Personally I agree that any claim that the Bush Administration was behind 9/11 is totally false and probably easily disproved. But the 9/11 conspiracy theorists are a notable and growing phenomena, and for Wikipedia to pretend they don't exist because of a handful of editors is ridiculous.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 23:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well now, isn't it interesting that I went to bat for this article becaue I found what I thought were enough sources but voted to delete the one you're citing because I didn't?

<dd>I said groupthink, not bad faith. I don't think there is a cabal operating in bad faith. I think there is an organized effort to target certain articles. It's not a cabal; it's operating pretty openly - look at Morton's and GabeF's talk pages. And I support some of the goals of it - I too think there are a lot of dumb things on Wikipedia (why does <a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_time_you_masturbate%E2%80%A6_God_kills_a_kitten_3af5.html" title="Every time you masturbate… God kills a kitten">this article</a> keep surviving AfD, for example?) and I don't have a problem with public attempts to delete such pages. But I do think it is problematic if it is being done solely based on POV issues. I also think the bandwagon approach that some people take supports my point about groupthink.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 06:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of the first and best researched books on the subject of 9/11 as inside job. This AfD is more POV campaigning by editors targetting anything that claims 9/11 was an inside job.

There are subjects much less notable than this book that exist on wikipedia. If you want to be part of a civil online community, why don't you stick to improving content rather than policing (or repressing) it. For example, I only had to click on <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random article</a> twice to get <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guano_Islands_Act_6aa2.html" title="Guano Islands Act">Guano Islands Act</a> with this highly notable piece of text: "The Guano Islands Act was federal legislation passed by the U.S. Congress on August 18, 1856 enabling citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing guano deposits.
