<p>This webcomic is long finished so it's not exactly link spam like many others on Wikipedia, but it's still entirely non notable.

<p>This article regards a professional wrestler who's had a career in the lower-level ranks of the sport, had some success there, but hasn't appeared to make the jump into the big leagues - he's never had a notable run in the <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_eb93.html" title="WWE">WWE</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling_e010.html" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Championship_Wrestling_ced8.html" title="Extreme Championship Wrestling">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a> or <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_bd9f.html" title="WCW">WCW</a> in his career. Now, I had a bit of an issue when I first saw this, but he does seem to not really be notable outside of the "indy" federations; I tagged with a PROD that was removed by the author - whose username is, by the way, the same as the wrestler in question, which suggests <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> issues. Anyhow, I noticed that this had been tagged for speedy deletion before I got to it, then was userfied by another editor - and recreated. So, when the prod was removed, I decided to get a second opinion and wandered over to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Professional_wrestling_ab8a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling">Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling</a> and asked for further opinions. One of the editors there prodded the article again - and it was removed again without comment. The viewpoint of folks who have weighed in on the Wikiproject suggest that any wrestler who hasn't been in the "big leagues" is not notable - so, here we are. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 01:14, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are litterally thousands of "professional" wrestlers in the world, but none of them wrestle as a full-time job. Notability truly relies on their popularity, history, and inward links. In the case of Sam Hayne, he is extremely notable to the Wisconsin, and Minnesota wrestling community, seeing as how he is one of the few locals to work in Japan. On a global or national scale, however, Sam Hayne is just one of the thousands of small-town guys hoping for a break. - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickSentowski_243d.html" title="User:NickSentowski">NickSentowski</a> 19:20, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Fine delete, but also look at the ACW &amp; NWA Wisconsin pages. To begin, they are the same thing, so why have a page for each? Second, ACW &amp; NWA Wisconsin run mostly Notheast Wisconsin. That would make them very un- notable as they are a very small player struggling to stay afloat. Also, the pages were created by people who admitted to working with &amp; for the company. That brings up a vanity issue. So, when you delete this page, make sure you do the same to the pages of the company Sam Hayne played a very large role in making.</p>

<li>Page was recently moved from its original location (Marketing 2.0) with no arguments given on talk page. I think it should be restored to its original location. Term is valid, several blogs and websites already use the Wikipedia definition as reference. Web 2.0 is mainly a technical term while this term refers to new concepts in advertising and mass marketing.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthieupinard_7830.html" title="User:Matthieupinard">Matthieupinard</a> 09:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>no arguments given on talk page</i> — A reason was given in the edit summary for the move.
<p><i>several blogs and websites already use the Wikipedia definition as reference</i> — They are wrong to do so. An encyclopaedia is not a primary source. See <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResearching_with_Wikipedia_4886.html" title="Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia</a>.

With better sourcing though, I suppose this could very well be a keep... I can't find any such sourcing though. If the consensus is keep, this content should be moved back to Marketing 2.0 and this namespace should still be deleted (i.e. no redirect). Equating "Marketing 2.0" with "Web 2.0 memes" is unsupported original research and a bit daft in my opinion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would suggest that it is inappropriate to AfD this article in its current state.

Apparently Sj left this unfinished, thus leaving this article in an inappropriate title with some references removed in subsequent edits. Whether the original article is appropriate for Wikipedia is another question for another day (in another AfD), but in the meantime this AfD would only be looking into the wrong content in the wrong title. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 16:57, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree. Most references were removed recently and not replaced with newer ones. My point is, the term is widely used among marketing professionals (I am one) and there should be a clear definition of the term which we were getting close to before the recent edits to the page. Here are some examples of articles, pages and blogs using the term. Some of these references could be added to the page. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthieupinard_7830.html" title="User:Matthieupinard">Matthieupinard</a> 17:28, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

I note that <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandwich_Eater_5626.html" title="User:Sandwich Eater">Sandwich Eater</a> has already duplicated one section there.

<li>I'm not clear how Ultimis can agree it is not original work but still an essay. I think a more focused article on ethics of clinical trials in developing countries is what I would really think would be intetresting and that there is plenty of secondary material out there to gather into a good encyclopedic article. I don't think it is sucha pro-industry opinion piece, and even if you disagree it won't stay imbalanced for long on wikipedia!! I did go ahead an move some of those bullets to the Pharm company page and could temporarily move merge this article with that page. But the encyclopedic entry for a pharmaceutical company is already contaminated with this topic, as are several other pages, like the Constant Gardner pages. A separate page referencing and summarizing the secondary sources on the background of this issue would be extremely valuable and that is what I have tried to start here. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandwich_Eater_5626.html" title="User:Sandwich Eater">Sandwich Eater</a> 15:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This may surprise a few Wikipedians, but this article has to be deleted for a number of reasons. Try as I might, the main problem here is a complete lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. On top of that, this club is not even a part of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> (correct me if I am wrong about this). The only reliable information I have about this club is that it will be competing in the Sussex Sunday Challenge Cup on Oct 1 2006! The webpage of this information is here: <a href="http://www.sussexfa.com/countyCups/SussexSundayChallengeCup/" class="external text" title="http://www.sussexfa.com/countyCups/SussexSundayChallengeCup/" rel="nofollow">Sussex Website</a> Because of these reasons, I cannot even verify if the club was established in 2005 or part of <i>Rimla Cola League</i>. If one can give me verifiable sources of this club, I will gladly change my stand. But for the present, this article should be deleted. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 02:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I found this slightly different definition of "Shucking and jiving" in a an article available on JSTOR. It might be helpful in determining whether this page can be expanded beyond a dicdef.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It reads as follows: "Shucking, shucking it, shucking and jiving, S-ing, and J-ing are all terms that refer to the verbal performances of blacks when they interact with the Man, the establishment, or any authority figure. These terms describe the forms of speech and physical movements that are necessary to maintain a particular guise in a confrontation with an authority figure." ("Black Rhetorical Patterns and the Teaching of Composition", by Michael D. Linn. <i>College Composition and Communication</i> Vol. 26, No. 2. (May 1975), p 150).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Linn then gives an example, which is quoted from another source: "One black gang member was coming down the stairway from the club room with seven guns on him and encountered some policemen coming up the same stairs. If they stopped and frisked him, he and others would have been arrested. A paraphrase of his shuck follows: 'Man, I gotta get away from up there. There's gonna be some trouble and I don't want no part of it.' The shuck worked on the minds of the policemen. It anticipated their questions as to why he was leaving the clubroom and why he would be in such a hurry. He also gave them a reason for wanting to go up fast." (from Thomas Kochman, "Black American Speech Events and a Language Program for the Classroom". <i>Functions of Language in the Classroom</i>. ed. Courtney B. Cazden, et al. (New York: Teacher's College Press, 1972). p. 250.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think this subject has a lot of potential for expansion, as it seems to have sociological importance. There were at least 18 other references at JSTOR (excluding reviews of the book), and I would suspect that there are more sources available offline. So, what does everyone think? <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 21:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Without the articles to indicate notability, there's no telling whether entries in the list are worthy or just cruft, so you're back to categorising existing articles which can indicate their own merit. Proper sub-categorisation negates the need for sub-sorted lists. I actually held your position myself over the lists of male/female singers. Since then I've come to see the other view. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 12:01, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with your statement that there is no telling which entries would warrant separate articles and which are cruft. If you Google a random redlink, you can usually determine pretty quickly if the composer is someone who ought to or could have an article. I made a random check with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Vilko+Avsenik&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Vilko+Avsenik&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Vilko Avsenik</a> and found for instance that while we don't have an article on this composer, the Slovenian has it. This could be done for most, if not all, of the listed composers. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> gives three purposes for lists 1)Information. In this case, the list gives birth and death dates for composers that the category doesn't, for instance. 2)Navigation. Should be self explanitory, but lists are more useful for navigation than categories are. 3)Development - this list doesn't appear to be being used for development, so we'll nix that. Overall this is still a "stub" list even though it has lots of entries, they're not developed. Good lists or featured lists have to develop each entry, but just <i>being a stub</i> is not a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:37, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, much of this list already seems to be split up into separate lists by genre/era.

<li>Well, it provides a navigation service nothing else does - it provides an overview of composers - it also (at least claims) to list composers not on the seperate pages because they don't compose a specific style of music - there's a lot if you dig a little. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You claim there are two things that this list serves: to create articles out of redlinks and to make redlinks, and to alphabetize the information that's in this list. The first is redundant with the requested articles project, and the second is redundant with a category. This current list is not under any Wikiproject right now, which means it doesn't get specialized attention, and on top of this it has severe <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a>.

<li>No, the list also provides an overview of when all these composers lived.

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. Make it a valuable research tool. Categories cannot include dates, countries, genres but lists can.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Without a breakdown by genre, era, etc., the usefulness of this list would be quite limited.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It's easily verifiable -- just watch the episodes, they're all available on DVD and/or shown constantly on TV. However, while I've been curious about where all the aliens are (it's well-known that there are hidden aliens in most episodes), I'm not sure it warrants its own entry. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalJor_7a59.html" title="User:HalJor">HalJor</a> 16:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, watching the episodes, copying down when/where an alien appears, and writing an article about it would constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: What!? How is watching a source and taking note of what you see original research? That's like saying that reading a novel and compiling a list of characters from it is original research. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 17:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, In my opinion that too would constitute original research because you would essentially be creating a primary source (i.e. a list of characters when one previously did not exist). Depending on your view on sources, this is at the very least research that draws on primary sources (if you take the view of a South Park episode as a primary source) and that is generally discouraged.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:39, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: we have a more or less long-standing practice of keeping articles on better-known diploma mills, or at least make them redirect to some other article, because they have a tendency to fly in under the radar anyway. It is very difficult to tell a stub on one of these mills apart from a stub on one of the thousands of obscure but legitimate colleges in the English-speaking world (and the U.S. in particular). Not spotting and editing it will risk legitimizing the school, as we often get Google hits for our Wikipedia articles on diploma mills on the first page, along with the "official" pages. For that same reason, it can be valuable consumer information if we have an article clearly stating that the school is unaccredited and linking to press coverage or official pages documenting this. As many of these individual online "universities" are just fronts for one and the same business, we should, whenever possible, try to consolidate these articles. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">User:Arbustoo</a> did a lot of good work on doing that a few months back, see <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Regis_University_2650.html" title="Saint Regis University">Saint Regis University</a> for an article that treats several infamous diploma mills on one page, based on secondary sources showing a connection. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 08:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>merge and redirect</b>, not because I think any of this can be kept, but I find it conceivable that <i>something</i> in this list isn't OR and can be sourced. I didn't go through every single thing, but as it stands almost everything on this list is OR ("Oh, yeah, remeber that time in the episode about the cats when they went to get bottled water out of the refrigerator, there was a tulip on the windowsill and when they came back it was a rose! Oh, wait, you don't remember that? I do!" See the problem?). Unless there is a <i>third-party source</i> spelling these things out, it shouldn't be in WP at all. Like I said, though, instead of deleting it outright, I'll put it back into <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a> so the history won't be lost, and anything recoverable can be recovered. --- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 01:31, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Most of this constitutes things like "the prop moved between shots" or "the wardrope department made a slight mistake". There are some notable major points - e.g. Ben seems to completely disappear in the last two series or Phoebe's various family members seem to get forgotten (e.g. she doesn't seem to tell her father that she knows Frank Jr.) which does make a difference given how much is often made of her unconventional upbringing but this is of a different order to what's listed here. And a list like this tends to fill up with individual observations from the shows. Furthermore there are too many "this may not be an error" type entries - e.g. the repeated claims that the first episode may not be canon. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 21:40, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> All statistics point out how it wasn't the most followed sitcom or its finale had x-million less viewers than "this other event". But they forget that these statistics were for US only. In the international arena Friends are a fenomenon that shaped the 90' and 00'. WP should not delete easily material related to it.</li>

<p>If this page is to stay I think it needs some serious overhauling. Things like a prop moving between shots, a stagehand coming into view or even an actor's hair getting longer/shorter due to consecutive episodes being filmed apart really should go on the individual episode pages if anywhere and this page should be kept for major inconsistencies across the series (e.g. the way their ages and birthdays jump all over, the way some of Phoebe's family appear and disappear or that we see Chandler seemingly introduced to Rachel for the first time on three separate occasions). I'm also not sure the "this one-liner contradicts that one-liner" type errors are terribly noticable, or for that matter "this actor gets mentioned in one episode but plays a character later on" when the show itself shows there are people who are dead ringers for each other around (i.e. Ross and Russ). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 03:28, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't know what the point of this discussion is. My arguments for merging or deleting the page are there. Regarding your comment: You haven't followed our discussion there. I never wanted to have that book censored. There is an article on it. There are academic scholars such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaleel_Mohammed_64e7.html" title="Khaleel Mohammed">Khaleel Mohammed</a> who seriously question Spencer's scholarship (<a href="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2004spring/reli/026/001/spencer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2004spring/reli/026/001/spencer.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).

I contacted Prof. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a> about his opinion on the works of Spencer. He replied back to me: "I have not read any of Mr. Spencer's works and, therefore, am unable to make any fair judgments. Since he does not publish with academic presses and the titles do sound rather polemical, I have never felt a need to examine them." See, a respected academic scholar of Islam finds the titles of his book polemical. Spencer argues that my books don’t have any flaws. Really? Then why doesn’t he publish them in university presses? --<a href="../../../r/e/z/User%7EReza1_9735.html" title="User:Reza1">Reza1</a> 18:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be reasonable to assume that Spencer doesn't publish his books via university presses because he wants people other than college students to read his works, suspects the university presses would be lax in promoting the works, and/or because he doesn't want the particular universities owning said presses any share of the proceeds.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 18:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, As an author stated in the discussion page, <b>currently</b> there is one single point of view, to a very suspicious blog which indicates that it is unquestionable and true. This idea will not be tolerated for other websites, e.g. JewWatch wiki entry i.e. stripping out the critisms and stating it is factual. Thus far, this article seems to be a mere attempt to gain extra hits to a Web Blog! Furthermore, The JewWatch website is <b>NOT</b> a blog, yet this is. I strongly feel this entry should be deleted. It hold zero significance other than stating there is a Blog out there, linking it, and once entering the unquestionable, uncritizable "Blog" being bombarded with blog enteries stating repulsive things about our fellow-man!

<li><b>Comment</b> - Having a Wikipedia entry for a blog is not an endorsement of the material on that blog by Wikipedia; it is merely an acknowledgement that the blog is notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Kindly spare me of stating that it is notable. It is arguably in the top 50,000 websites (not using Alexa), shall all 50,000 websites be placed into Wikipedia encyclopedia? It would be a mockery if that happens. Someone has yet to state one benefit of this wiki blog entry. I have been racking my brains to think of any benefit to any researcher, academic etc. which resulted in me having to eat some painkillers as there was no feasible benefit of a relatively unknown blog being placed into an encyclopedia. Oh, and "googling" gives no information about notability, I have googled the word "The" and got 14.1 billion hits, but I will not be writing an article about "The" and linking it to my personal blog (which is in the top 100,000 but is of no use in an encyclopedia).

<li><b>Comment</b> Brianyoumans et. al. the essence of your “compelling” arguments thus far encompasses; (1) ‘The blog is in the top 50,000 therefore should be advertised on Wikipedia.’ (2). ‘People have discerning views about an encyclopedia entry that simply points to a blog and according to Alexa feeds off the wikipedia link so it should be left as an entry.’ Anything further to add to this overwhelming barrage of points?

<li><b>Comment</b> Brianyoumans, if you review the Wiki history on this article, users, such as Mike18xx and others will not 'allow' any discussion in the article about the blog giving out contentious information. Anything which has a neutral point of view, or more than single point of view will be reverted in haste. This leads to the question, why is this blog present in Wiki.(LewisRyder 09:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC))

Your "trick" of accusations of vandalism directed toward those who've largely written the topics you're accusing them of vandalizing is becoming tedious.)&#160;; <b>08:15, 24 July 2006 Mike18xx (Talk | contribs) (Wikipedia is not a link-repository for ever bitch-moan-whine site that is unsatisfied with the traffic Google is sending it.)</b> etc. Not being able to add any other point of view, or add neutrality leads to abusive comments and a swift revert.

<ul>
<li>Citing selected past edit commentary instances of my reversions of your vandalism (and calling you for the counter-propaganda tactic of accusing <i>original article writers</i> of vandalism while engaging in it yourself) does not constitute defending your claim of <i>"Anything which has a neutral point of view, or more than single point of view will be reverted in haste,"</i> since the article is already neutral-view in that it accurately described the ideological stance of its topic. <b>Your argument, now, is essentially that the article should be deleted <i>because other editors won't entertain the changes to it that you desire,</i></b> and that's bad faith.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 18:22, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Anyone may examine my edits and edits from others that have been reverted and judge for themselves!! My argument is clear, the entry should be deleted because; 1. It is a single point of view. 2. It is not a neutral point of view. 3. It is a mere blog. 4. The entry appears to just be an advertisment link to the blog (check Alexa link-ins). Anyone care to add on to this endless list.

<dd>My apologies, although I never did state it was a "personal website", but thanks for the fabrication. So the reason for a "Keep" from you is because it is not a "personal website"?

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The reason we cite Google hits is because the number is indicative often of notability, IF the hits show notability. In this case, there are 2.4 million Ghits, BUT the hits are mostly the site's membership dutifully recited by Google's spiders (i.e., "smith@Zaadz"). I see a couple of articles cited above - I will note What Is Enlightenment magazine is a quarterly webzine, hum, maybe. But VegNews magazine's honor is not what I'd call a nationally-recognized one. There is a link to what appears to be a Wall Street Journal article, but the story only mentions Zaadz in passing (their CEO was at some meeting that was covered by WSJ, and the website gets no other mention). The website therefore fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for lacking multiple <i>non-trivial</i> third-party articles, nor shows nationally-known awards, nor is the content distributed by a site well-known and independent of the creators. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 04:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The VfD nomination and some comments missed the fact that "What is Enlightenment" is a print publication celebrating a 15-year anniversary, and they highlighted the Zaadz article on their cover - hardly trivial. There are thousands of passionate people contributing to the Zaadz community, which I think means it merits serious attention. The Alexa score demonstrates much more interest than the vast majority of Internet sites, impressive after such a short existance. You can expect places like this to be underrepresented in the mainstream media, who see them as competitors on various levels. --<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENealmcb_9c01.html" title="User:Nealmcb">NealMcB</a> 19:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It also fails to note other documented motivations for thinking that "Ethiopians" were Caucasoid -- the best example being the Italian defeat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Adowa_5f80.html" title="Battle of Adowa">Battle of Adowa</a>. (Many European &amp; American journalists could not believe that a bunch of, er, foreigners could defeat a European army.)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I find it ironic that Yom is the one who nominated this article to be deleted because it was his constant ranting and raving about a the controversy over Ethiopians on his talk page and elewhere that got me interested in the subject in the first place. A simple google search of Ethiopians and Caucasoid reveals a wealth of information on the topic. I created this article because I'm genuinely curious about whether Ethiopians are Caucasoid or not and was hoping to attract people who know more about the subject than I do to make contributions. Genetic journals in every major universities reveals dozens of major professors doing research on the race of Ethiopians, so if you do delete this article, you're doing so for personal reasons that have nothing to do with wikipedia's standards. There's also been marjor anthropological discoveries in Ethiopia that have revolutionized the field and have been covered very recently by CNN and major science magazines. Perhaps you could change the title to something more politically correct like "anthropology of Ethiopians" but racial issues concerning this one population are important enough to deserve their own article.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 19:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I neither ranted nor raved on my talk age and elsewhere about a "controversy over the race of Ethiopians." My only discussions on the subject were when <a href="../../../c/l/u/User%7ECluckbang_a4e2.html" title="User:Cluckbang">Cluckbang</a>, who was relatively uninformed (thinking Ethiopians were the descendents of Sabaeans, which archaeology and genetics do not bear out), asked me about the matter on my talk page, whom I calmly answered. The studies on Ethiopians' genetic histories is not evidence of a controversy; you'll find many such studies on Greeks, Egyptians, Indians, etc. The reason why more studies exist on the population of Ethiopia than of some other Sub-Saharan African countries is because it was probably where modern human populations developed, and is therefore crucial in the study of genetics. Research into a topic does not a controversy make. "Anthropology of Ethiopians" would be a more appropriate title, but there are multiple diverse groups in Ethiopia, many of whom have yet to be studied; until the article becomes huge, there's no reason to split a genetic discussion from the already existing sections at <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_Ethiopia_a6eb.html" title="People of Ethiopia">People of Ethiopia</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Ethiopia_0b8c.html" title="Demographics of Ethiopia">Demographics of Ethiopia</a>. Note that this article is very clearly to support your own POV about Ethiopians, using dubious terms like "<a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasoid.html" title="Caucasoid">Caucasoid</a>" and "<a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroid.html" title="Negroid">Negroid</a>" instead of actual lineages (note that such balances are used by defining some lineages that <b>arose</b> in Ethiopia as "Caucasoid," so as to deny genetic influene from Sub-Saharan Africa in places like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Europe_127f.html" title="Southeastern Europe">Southeastern Europe</a>). — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 19:44, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I just added a genetic tree by Cavalli-Sforza which shows quite clearly that Ethiopians are Black/Negroid/sub-Saharan (whatever term you prefer) though obviously others differ. I don't create articles to support any POV. I create articles because I have genuine interest in subjects and want to have a convenient resource that summarizes all the relevant data and is constantly being updated by those in the know. The reason why I feel this article is needed is because there's just too much genetic, craniofacial, and anthroplogical data to fit into articles like People/demographics of Ethiopia, since these articles are focused on broader issues than just race (i.e. culture, religion, etc). And I didn't create this article to create a controversy. The controversy title was simply modeled after the controversy over race of ancient Egyptians article. I found that title to be quite funny, and thought it would be even funnier if it was turned into a series. Change the title if you want, but is not possible to preserve an article entirely dedicated to the complex and massive body of literature concerning the race of Ethiopians? This dispute comes up over and over again in many articles and creates many edit wars which is why a comprehensive reference to the subject is needed--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 20:10, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

It should be an adjunct link to a main article on the history of racial thought, which is bound to be or to get large &amp; result in spin-offs. The text would need to be junked and totally rewritten. Ideally the title should indicate that the controversy was historical. The introduction <i>must</i> state clearly that it is not a matter of serious contemporary controversy and that the racial ideas with which it was argued are now rejected by most scholars as incoherent and methodologically flawed. Otherwise teachers of African history &amp; anthropology will have to waste additional hours undoing Wikipedia-derived misinformation (already a serious problem for African studies). New text should reflect not only historical context, as FairHair, says but restricted to explicating the <i>historical ideas</i> in context. The current article weirdly combines utterly outmoded racialist concepts with ideas that are treated seriously today by some human population biologists and physical anthropologists (though rejected or doubted by many others). This combination amounts to original if idiosyncratic research.<a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 18:12, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whatever there is to say about this supposed controversy can be mentioned in the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_Ethiopia_a6eb.html" title="People of Ethiopia">People of Ethiopia</a> article. A separate article is not warranted. The main problem with this article is that it is a fork created specifically to forward an agenda based on obsolete racialist POV. The title and the content alludes a dispute that does not exist, and is inherently missleading. It is easy to argue for an article to be kept, while suggesting that it be radically edited. The end result is often that no one actually radically edits the article, and when they try to, they meet strenuous opposition from the creators of the artice (who often fight hard to maintain the POV), with the result that the "original if idiosyncratic research" stays more or less as it is, and continues to spread disinformation. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 19:47, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am persuaded by Ezeu's &amp; Mark's comments on what will actually happen. The search engine point had not occurred to me. Ezeu, when I first tried to respond but ended up closing the edit window without saving, apparently, I called the article a self-parody, esp. the idea that one could define race by skin color as "black", or "negroid" (from Spanish for black) and then by use of other putative racial distinction criteria, end up in effect with the proposition that Ethiopians are black whites -- whoa dude! I do not think there is any current controversy. However, the historic intellectual contortions of racialists in the colonial era to try to deny or minimize the "blackness" of Africans whose achievements they counted admirable by their own ethnocentric standards ("Hamitic hypothesis" etc.) is a significant historical phenomenon that needs to be in Wikipedia. I suspect you are right about the forking of this article as it stands in suggesting spuriously that a controversy exists today, &amp; agree that Wikipedia should not be in the business of promoting such dicredited views in the present. Being new to Wikipedia, the distinction between such forking and the principle of creating new pages on sub-topics if a big topic gets too big is not always clear to me. So I accept what Mark says below about the way to approach a redefined historical topic. But I do think FairHair is right to point out that the historical phenomenon is a legitimate potential Wikipedia topic, provided the sources to which he/she refers are not all primary documents, though FairHair does not deal with the presentism of the current article. <a href="../../../c/c/l/User%7ECclowe_b59b.html" title="User:Cclowe">Ngwe</a> 04:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A great deal of hard work that has gone into this page; however, the page is useless. This information is readily available on any number of web sites and in any number of books. It does not add to the experience of wikipedia and it is annoying that it is has been placed on the see also section for so many baseball related pages. It is more the work of one or two people, rather than a true community page. Wolverinegod 10:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>At the risk of sounding counter-intuitive, <b>keep</b> per nom. The information is verifiable (per nom), and appears to be encyclopedic to a baseball ignoramus such as me. I'd be tempted to say that 500 is an astonishingly large number to have, but baseball fans seem to be pretty statistically-minded. The fact that the information is readily available elsewhere has nothing to do with anything, since that simply means that it's verifiable (if the info <i>weren't</i> readily available, I'd be thinking about nominating this). The fact that it's been placed all over the baseball pages is entirely beside the point too, as the nominator or anyone else is more than capable of removing it from places where it's not useful. The fact that it's "the work of one or two people" is also irrelevant, as not all articles here will ever be "true community pages". Additionally, if the information is readily available, it doesn't take more than one person to port it here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well to further my point: just because an article "can" exist doesn't mean it "should". This article reports on something where there is no "criteria". What exactly is "useful" about this listing. Anyone who hits a home run can be added to the list, and therefor, there is no realistic control. Where as, in order to be listed in order to be named as a member of the 500 home run club or people to climb mt. everest, you have to meet a standard. Further to the point, this article would need to be referenced so often that it becomes pointless to attempt. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. Just because something is verifiable and "encyclopedic" (which i don't think this article is), does not mean it needs to be included. Putting a link to the see also section is technically admissable because it is often placed on a players page. Wolverinegod 12:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>This article reports on something where there is no "criteria".</i> — On the contrary, the criteria, per the article, seem pretty clear: Being one of the top 500 baseball players of all time, ranked by the number of home runs achieved.

<li>I am the author and I have deleted my page on my own. You people are morons if you think being related to Napoleon is "common". There are only three families in the world who have that relation. I published this article to make knowlage avalible on an influental family that is not widely known. It holds a place in world history. Anyway you can stop voting of whatever your doing here because I have removed this article so go ahead and further delete it if you want I'll take my information somewere were people care about history.<a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaio12_f382.html" title="User:Vaio12">Vaio12</a> 22:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do not take offense. We just have rules as to what's notable or includable. We are not a collection of indiscriminate information. The problem with including a family like this is, as it has been said already, many are related to famous people. Almost everyone is related to someone famous. We can't include all of them. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 01:28, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You have misinterprited the focus of my article. I didnt right about this family because they are related to someone " famous". I wrote about them becaues they are one of the wealthiest families in the world and one of the most powerful in this nation. Just recently they have been emerging into the society world and I thought it was a point of interest in who they are and were they come from. Yes they have relation to a historical figure but they also weald great influence in new england and around the country despite being relitivly unheard of on a large scale. That was the focus of my article. Just as you have pages here about the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Kennedys and other less wealthy but more well known families. I was tring to ad to the knowlage of these " Dynasty " families that are so secretive and isolated in this country. <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaio12_f382.html" title="User:Vaio12">Vaio12</a> 01:41, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless the event’s identity is seared into the public memory in a way that ties the event directly to the name of the institution (such as the 1970 national guard shootings at Kent State), then a transient current event that happened in the rural countryside outside of a college town has no business being mentioned in the nearby-university’s article. The plane did not crash on campus nor have any other direct link to the institution other than killing five students. I wouldn't be surprised if there is at least one other accident (e.g., horse-and-wagon mishap, car crash, construction accident) that also killed 5 IU students/employees within a certain radius of Bloomington at some point over the years since IU's founding in the 1820s and that other accident doesn't warrant its own article nor appear in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_University_Bloomington_7806.html" title="Indiana University Bloomington">Indiana University Bloomington</a> article. Recentism. Perhaps someone’s blog or personal website would be a better place to memorialize the 2006 Indiana Plane Crash tragedy outside of Wikipedia.

There is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_URJ_Camp_George_aa58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/URJ Camp George">recent precedent</a> to avoid pages for specific camps, but that pages for groupings of camps (sponsored by a certain organization or having a certain affiliation) are reasonable if that information cannot comfortably fit in the pages of those sponsors/affiliations. That decision was for the regional and national overnight camps sponsored by the parent organization of the one for the page at hand here. Those camps have much broader geographic appeal, are of comparable size, and some have several thousand ghits. "Best Jewish Day Camp in the East Bay" feels like pretty slim notability. The page has very little that sounds specific/unique and interesting to <i>this</i> camp for anyone but those directly involved. It's heavy on the details to the point that it sounds like an ad or the camp's own website.

<li><b>keep but rewrite and move</b>. We should have an article about the "reset button" type of plots, but it shouldn't contain sentences like "Effective use of this device depends on the audience being unaware of the continuity status, or successful suspension of disbelief that continuity is or will be interrupted, and the eventual communication of the status of continuity to the audience." Chunks of this article are blatant essay/OR. I say keep for the topic, but don't keep the article as is. Also, it should probably be titled Reset button (plot) because it's not really a technique so much as a plot device. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A certain <b>Keep</b>. This is a common enough term; used on 'TV Tropes' as standard, uncontested term, referred to in bestselling 'Planet Simpson', and while there are few hits for the string 'reset button technique', a significant proportion of the hits for 'reset button' refer to this phenomenon - it is simply that the word 'technique' is not normally applied. As an example, there are 43,600 google hits for ""reset button" trek", virtually all of which refer to the technique in the context of star trek, a regular offender. As for 'dumbed-down', such a label speaks of an artificial barrier between high culture and pop culture, which is quite against the principles of Wikipedia. I would counsel moving to reset button (narratology) or reset button (plot device). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 00:19, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Replace</b> There is a British sports magazine by this name, which may deserve an article. Also, I found a number of hits on prominent English newspapers using the term to refer to a professional photographer's portfolio of photos of athletes. A page mentioning those things would be fine.

<li>bottle knife is a southern and south western united states term for glassing. a redirect or merge or some combination would be a good idea.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. While interviews are up, one is from what is essentially a blog and the Nintendo Power mention is most likely a passing mention, not a full article with the band as the subject. So in essence there's no notability asserted. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 14:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I am a member of this band. When I put this page up, I had yet to read the band policies. I would like to note that the Nintendo Power article was, in fact, a full article with the band as the subject. It was accompanied by a full interview which was posted on NintendoPower.com. The band has also been the subject of other interviews, which I can post. We have an upcoming full-lenght album, which has yet to be recorded. However, I would be wrong not to admit that we still would not completely meet one of the criteria for addition. That being said, if this entry is deleted, I would wait until we did match a criterium before re-listing. MindPollution 7:39, 1 September 2006</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please specify violation of Wikipedia terms of use, ideally with a link to the specific guideline. (I am the article originator; as I'm just getting started on Wikipedia, I'd like to avoid starting articles that are in any way inappropriate, so that's not a rhetorical request; your help and advice very much appreciated.) It's not clear from the deletion policy that either broad influence or Alexa rank of the subject is a criterion for maintenance of such an article. Subject is a website similar to &amp; descended from a now-defunct website (<a href="../../../s/a/g/SAGE_KE_7437.html" title="SAGE KE">SAGE KE</a>) that had major influence within a specialized field and continues to have a Wikipedia entry.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the facts are as you describe them here, Mycophage (that the weblog is a continuation of a notable website) then I'd suggest that the appropriate thing to do would be to <i>merge</i> the information from <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ouroboros_%28weblog%29.html" title="Ouroboros (weblog)">Ouroboros (weblog)</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/g/SAGE_KE_7437.html" title="SAGE KE">SAGE KE</a> under an appropriate new section header, and then <i>redirect</i> the Ouroboros article to point to the SAGE KE article. Right now, assuming that the Ouroboros weblog is notable just because it's the successor to an existing notable website is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">crystal-balling</a>, but it's certainly part of the history of that website. And if at some future point, the weblog can be said without hesitation to be notable in its own right, the information can be spun out from the website's article again. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, having had a chance to look at the weblog in question, it seems to me that it's stretching the truth to say that it's "descended from" SAGE KE.

<p>This article was prodded, but User:Dutchkop wrote a reason for keeping on the article (much like is sometimes seen with hangon). I'm interpreting this as a deprod attempt and listing it here.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The association between Lampard and scoring via deflections is well known throughout English football, it was only a matter of time before a term such as 'Lamparding' would come into common 'footie' parlance.

<li>I suppose I should have mentioned that it was never published in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> and probably will not be.

The writer's name in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> is <i>Николай Гуданец</i>.

<li>Still <b>Delete</b>: Well, it might be something for the Russian Wikipedia, but not this one. We can't read Russian (well, at least <i>I</i> can't) and until we can verify it, I say it should go. Just my opinion, of course. But if the book was successful enough, it'd make a splash in the media (and be translated into other languages), which it hasn't. I can't think that this is but a small, self-published book by a fan of the game. If it does survive this voting, the information that it is only in Russian should be added to the article (you can still edit the article while it's being voted on, just don't remove the deletion notice). — <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 15:09, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Aliens appeared on the Earth suddenly.

<li>The book sold 13000 copies (<a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> 5-04-088141-X). While this is by far not a bestseller, I seriously doubt the writer simply wanted to write fan fiction. As mentioned previously, the novel is <i>loosely</i> based on the game. He simply decided to borrow a few elements from the game (e.g. Elerium, hovertanks, plasma vs. lasers). Besides that, the story is quite original. The reason it is probably not translated into English is because they may have wanted to avoid any possible lawsuits from whoever owns the <i>X-Com</i> brand. User:ChronoLegion 31 August 2006</li>

<p>I prodded this article as short, non-notable and not likely to be expanded. But then it got deprodded with the <s>claim we need</s> note that we normally keep all colleges and universities recorded. Im not going to get into that argument but if thats the basis for keeping this article then there should be twice as many articles here on WP then there actually is! Basically the article is tiny and fairly useless as it simply lists the name of the college and location - something that is easily taken care of in a list of such colleges (someything I personally would approve); here it is just taking up space. As to expanding it? Well the college website and various google results give no info on it's history, scale or size, rather it is a lot of POV advertising for next years courses - good for the college site but no good for us. I am all in favour of recording the existence of colleges like this but in this form - as loads of short useless articles - it is very clunky, I doubt many people will find this. Instead there should be a list of all these colleges (with the notable ones getting their own articles) and if someone does that great! For now I really feel this is article is uneeded and should be deleted <b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 15:12, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The above does not accurately represent my stated deprod. I said that "we normally keep all colleges", not that we need them. PROD is for non-controversial deletions, and since we normally keep all colleges, deleting one is controversial and unsuitable for prod. I did this as part of my daily PROD patrol.

<li><b>Comment</b> out of interest (and in no way a dig at all your opinions) but how is listing the name and address (essentially) of a college like this in a seperate article is to me pretty pointless. I am not against stubs they are highly useful but to expand this requires someone with first hand local knowledge and sources - I cant do it over the net (or I would have instead of proding it in the first place). SO how is this article useful to the encylopedia. The only use it has is for someone looking for colleges in that region of India and even then they would have to look through the categories to find it - how many people do that! It wont appear in a search for something like <i>colleges in india</i>. Instead for now whay cant its name and location just reside in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_universities_in_India_dcb4.html" title="List of universities in India">List of universities in India</a> until the article can be created with some meaningful content. At the moment it is simply a dead end... --<b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 18:18, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Merging is not the solution. You must be aware that an article of this nature would attract contributors are causal anon contributors. By deleting the page (based on lack of information), you are actually preventing them from recreating an article. By leaving it in a 'cleanup' state, you're inviting them to improve the page. I also smell a systemic bias here. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 16:04, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bias? Come again? You mean negatively against the article? hmmm. I do sort of see where your coming from now&#160;:D Although I still dont see what meaningful content can be got from this article even if it is added to. I see your point about casual contribuotrs and I also agree (hving looked again at that list page) that merging is a worse option&#160;:D. I still think that this would be better under a general article about the dehli colleges. There are a few good articles there, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi_College_of_Engineering_e7b7.html" title="Delhi College of Engineering">Delhi College of Engineering</a> foir instance, but that is a much larger (from what I can gather from vaious sites - mostly the colleges sites) and has been running longer. I cannot find any info about the history or makeup of the commerce college at all! IMO the they should all get a section on a page called Colleges under the university of Dehli with the smaller colleges (such as this) just getting a section of those few paragraphs and the larger ones getting a short section and a link to a main article about it. In that case leaving this current page as a redirect so people know it is there would be a good option!!!!
<dl>
<dd>Yes, a little negatively biased against the article. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a> has some additional information on how to prevent this. At this moment, extra meaningful content may not be present, but does it mean that it can't exist as a standalone article? There could be many reasons why GSCoC attracts less attention here than Delhi College of Engineering. Some possible answers to this are: 1. What are the number of contributors from Delhi who can expand on this? 2. What about the nature of contributions coming from these users? There may be a few thousands, but they need not contribute to the educational domain or their alma maters. (I have never contributed to mine) They may perhaps focus on topics as diverse as chess, cryptography, Islamic architecture, or oceans. 2. Assuming that a former or present student/staff of the college has contributed to the article, the question to be asked is: What is the level of tech savyness from the college? Most contributions in wikipedia come from people who have 24x7 access to the internet. Thus, in many places across the world, engineering colleges are likely to produce more wikieditors than a humanities-oriented college (something like this is mentioned in <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>). Lastly, I'm not sure why it is called for merging the article into the university article. Many universities in metropolitan cities in India have several hundred colleges affiliated to them which actually take care of enrollment. The function of the university in this case is to set the syllabus, exam paper, and award the degree. The college does the rest of the work: enrollment, lower level paper correction, teaching, fees etc. This may not be the case in many parts of the world, so that's why I have raised the suspicion of being a little systemic biased. And <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a>, it's ok to vacillate, that is a natural process during a discussion.&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 17:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I was the first to suggest merge, I feel I should chime in. I hope realizing that I also removed the prod will address some of the concern about bias. I do think that the <i>article</i> is currently of poor quality; here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sri_Guru_Gobind_Singh_College_of_Commerce&amp;oldid=72813357" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sri_Guru_Gobind_Singh_College_of_Commerce&amp;oldid=72813357" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> is the form it was in when I deprodded - it was a sub-stub then. As now slightly expanded, it might rise to the stub level. But there isn't anything there that couldn't work in a table with columns like degrees, founded, student size, staff size, etc... That the college is <i>currently</i> adding a building isn't really encyclopedic content; given the way India's economy has been going I expect most business and technology schools are expanding. To contrast the article the business school at my alma-mater, and one that I can see part of the campus of if I walk to the window, look at <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_Sloan_School_of_Management_e2c6.html" title="MIT Sloan School of Management">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>. That is a very good college article, which I'd never bothered to look at before writing this comment. If you go to the university article <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_dd6d.html#MIT_schools" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology#MIT schools</a>, you'll see that only 2 of 6 schools have an article, as well as 3 of 30 departments. (I don't know which is the better comparison.) The merge I proposed, if the merged target carried out, would leave the various colleges of the University of Delhi with more comprehensive coverage than the schools of the university that is both closest to me and my alma-mater. Systemic bias isn't the issue, an article that isn't worth keeping is the issue. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 21:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it doesnt hapen like that in the UK, but I did get the gist of that from the article. I would refute that I have systematic bias. I regularly write for Wikinews (as an IP for several months and as a username for the last week) averaging around 2 articles a day on topics across the world- systematic bias is something I have learned to avoid from that&#160;:D&#160;:D I still dont feel this college can have alot of notable content for the moment. Perhaps deleting it is a tad strong but I do like the idea of a page (seperate from the university page itself) with all the colleges getting a short subsection. Then the college names redirectin to that. Of course the colleges with already larger article could get their own page and just short 'intro' on the lists page. The name Colleges under the university of Dehli is really just an identifier and a way to group them all together. That way we get more meaningful content in one place (what oif someone wants to compare colleges for example) with the ability to fork any information away from the 'main article' if it becomes of meaningful length. I realise this isn't technically normal policy but I think it would make it all look cleaner and friendlier to someone who is here to read WP as an Encyclopedia (something i thin k us regualtr editors dont consider often enough!) --<b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 15:01, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I once sent a Sweetest Day card. It's a "Hallmark holiday" but in midwestern states it does bring in a lot of revenue in for flower, candy and card shops.

<li>I added the hoax tag to the article because the <i>Herbert Birch Kingston</i> story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a hoax in my opinion. <i>Primary source</i> information from The Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper published October 8th, 1921 and October 8th, 1922 shows a very different beginning to the holiday. Here is a more factual account of how Sweetest Day began: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612</a> . (I realize that this version needs further editing/removal of caps/formatting) I do not believe the category of Sweetest Day should be deleted; it should just be reported for what it is: an 85-year-old hoax. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 16:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure I agree with your hoax tag. There is a difference between "hoax" and "popular mythology". The popular mythology of the day is that Kingston created it as day to honor orphans and shut-ins... and that version of events has been widely reported. This should be in the article (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <b>verifiability not truth</b>). If there is an alternate version of events that can be sourced (i.e. the Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper article, this could be included as well as an alternate, sourced, version of events. The article space is big enough for both versions without making any judgements as to which is true.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, show me some wiki guidelines on holidays which say that a non-religious, non-official, non-notable holiday, and I mean this strictly--not just what has been mentioned--should be included. I wouldn't even have problems including fictional holidays, like "<a href="../../../f/e/s/Festivus.html" title="Festivus">Festivus</a>", from <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> which I'm sure is on wikipedia, because that's notable, but its notability stems from the fact it was on <i>Seinfeld</i>, not from the fact it's a real holiday. I take the position that holidays, real holidays, not just those invented, as this one is, by corporations and without involvement from the people, at a religious or state level, must include celebration or commemoration--I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this. If it were fictional, it'd be notable as a joke. But as real, it's about as notable as "Win a Hawaiian getaway week". A few pop culture references do not a holiday make--they may make something else. But as long as it's an entry whose purpose is presenting a holiday, <b>delete</b>. If they want to call it other than a holiday, they can add it back.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I take the position that holidays [...] must include celebration or commemoration — I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this.</i> — Then please read the article. It actually tells you how this holiday is celebrated or commemorated.
<p><i>A few pop culture references [...]</i> — There are no pop culture references in the article.</p>
<p><i>real holidays, not just those invented</i> — Most of the holidays that you categorize as "real" were in fact invented. Many religious holidays, which you accept, were invented, for examples. They were just invented longer ago than 1921. All secular holidays, such as <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbor_Day_7e6a.html" title="Arbor Day">Arbor Day</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_%28United_States%29_60e9.html" title="Labor Day (United States)">Labor Day</a>, are invented. Your espoused criterion that holidays must be "real" and not "invented" is an entirely faulty one. Your <i>actual</i> criterion appears to be who the inventor of the holiday is. You're happy to accept holidays invented by churches, legislatures, unions, and television programme scriptwriters, but not holidays invented by greetings cards and gift companies. That's a highly subjective judgement, and not a particularly consistent one (given the inclusions of scriptwriters and unions). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am neither the creator nor a contributor to this article, but I am a fan of this website. One reason why the Alexa ranking may be so low is because more often than the goaste.cx link, people often link to the site using the original location (it is hosted at <a href="http://davidguy.brinkster.net/goaste/" class="external autonumber" title="http://davidguy.brinkster.net/goaste/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>), and people sometimes link there rather than to the shortened URL, due to some people misreading it as <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">goatse.cx</a> and choosing to not click it for that reason. Of course, this creates a problem, as typing davidguy.brinkster.net/goaste/ <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdavidguy.brinkster.net%2Fgoaste" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdavidguy.brinkster.net%2Fgoaste" rel="nofollow">into Alexa</a> provides traffic ranking for brinkster.net. Being such a big fan of the site I feel I would not be neutral or realistic in my vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> Actually the physicist who is proposing MDT is quite accomplished. Above an editor claims that MDT "smells a lot like bollocks." This is a highly qualitative opinion. MDT should be judged by its merits with arguments for or against based in logic and reason. I find no fault with MDT--in fact it succeeds where ST &amp; LQG have failed. It presents an underlying physical model for QM &amp; SR, based in logic and reason, verified experimentally. String theory has been shown to be a complete hoax, and yet it fills wikipedia with pages upon pages.

WP is <i>not</i> a place for advancing original research or arguments for one theory or another. The 2 main problems with this article is 1) it does not cite its sources in an academically accepted manner 2) it is not written in an encyclopedic fashion.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Who did Einstein cite in his original paper on Relativity? String Theory has thousands of citations, and yet it is "not even wrong." Mobs and group-think does not a theory make. Truth and Beauty make a theory, and that is what MDT has. Although ST is funded by billions upon billions, MDT rocks the world with its simple postulate. Having said this, I understand that MDT may yet be deleted. But understand this has nothing to do with the integrity of the theory.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.14.242.50 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.14.242.50.html" title="User talk:66.14.242.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.14.242.50_7b84.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.14.242.50">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Moving Dimensions Theory, like wikipedia, happened because of the internet. It has been read by thousands over the past ten years, and the record will show that never once has its logic nor beauty been refuted. It was born upon the internet, and unlike the cloistered, well-funded, secret-society hoax that is string theory, it stands on its own. Sure, we could delete this article on MDT because string theorists don't want to share their massive funding, but then perhaps we should delete all of wikipedia and stick with professional encyclopedias such as Britanica and Encarta. I say let logic, reason, free thought, the internet and physics triumph over cloistered, antiquated, postmodern hoaxes. Let wikipedia reach its heights in helping to disseminate truth and beauty, while deconstructing intellectual debauchery.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.159.188.139 (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.159.188.139.html" title="User talk:137.159.188.139">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.159.188.139_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.159.188.139">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>I say we offer the author a chance to link to sources--I have seens several and I will help. String Theory, although it is now shown to be a postmodern hoax, has plenty of "sources," and yet it is a hoax. String Theory is original research, and not only that, but it is a proven lie as new books this fall and articles in Time, Scientific American, and Discover are attesting. Again, ultimately we must judge a theory on its truth and beauty, not on how hip tax and tuition funded pomo hipsters think it is, or we will be forever sentencing Socrates to death. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 137.159.188.139 (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.159.188.139.html" title="User talk:137.159.188.139">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.159.188.139_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.159.188.139">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I just helped the author out by listing some references and sources. There are thousands of them.

<dd>I don't believe you quite understand what we mean by "sources". We're not looking for general websites that might mention MDT (or sell T-shirts). We're looking for reliable <i>references</i> and citations regarding the tenents of the theory. This isn't the place to propound the theory itself, it's the place to write <i>about</i> the theory, describe who developed it, the history, and a brief overview. All of these <i>must</i> reference external sources that are reliable, preferrably mainstream sources of the information that you include here. It is preferred, too, that you document these sources by useing the &lt;ref&gt;text&lt;/ref&gt; footnote format within the body of the text, so that a reader who wants to verify the legitimacy of a statement within the text can jump to that statement's source. That's what an encyclopedia entry should look like. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>KEEP</b></s> as MDT is rooted in logic, truth and bauty. The wikipedia page on string theory is filled with lies--it should be deleted first, otherwise wikipedia will come to be known as a place that values lies over truth. Just because a lot of people believe a lie, or the government has written checks to fund it, does not make the lie true. Wikipedia has a chance here to stand on the right side of time, to live up to its potential. By killing this article, you are killing the spirit of wikipedia, and the spirit of truth. String theory not only has failed, but it is now failing to fail. Once it lied, but now it doesn't even think it has to lie anymore. By killing MDT and keeping string theory, wikipedia will shout out to the universe that it prefers lies over truth. Go ahead.

Is it really a copyvio to paste one's own article from one wiki to another? <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 21:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well if that's the case, then I don't know. I was assuming that LaVoice and TheVoice were two different people. LaVoice made the edit on Wikipedia months ago, while TheVoice just did it today. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 23:12, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Answer</b>. Hello, Bload Bowl is a real sport. It's true that it is still confidential that's why you could have been "afraid" of my article. Note that this is the English version of the article I wrote on the French Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 16:55, 30 August 2006</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. A quick google search for "Bload Bowl" with my preferences temporarily set to "English language results only" returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bload+Bowl%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bload+Bowl%22" rel="nofollow">less than 10 seemingly relevant results,</a> and some of these are in French as well (apparently as a result of incomplete filtering on the part of google). I don't know that this can be verified. I don't speak French, personally. I know enough to have figured out that some of the French results seem to be relevant, but I don't know if they're reliable. The total of seemingly reliable search results (with my admittedly weak translation skills) is roughly ten. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 17:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Answer</b>. I understand your points of view. Bload Bowl website is not translated yet in English. So Wikipedia is a good way for international users to discover this sport until the translation is done. I wrote the original article on the French Wikipedia and I had no problem with the Deletion Policy. Actually I'm a bit surprised. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 17:10, 30 August 2006</li>

After I learned what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>, I had to ask for a speedy deletion. Wikipedia is not a place for describing original inventions, nor an indiscriminate collection of information, nor an instruction manual, nor a crystal ball, nor a repository for original research. Without any reputable, independent sources to document the significance of this sport, it's not notable enough to be included here. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 18:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Answer</b>. As stated in my article: "Since the universitary year 2000-2001, Bload Bowl is officialy known as an universitary sport in French Polynesia" = recognized as a legal sport. So it's not an invented sport that some idiots play in their garden. I know that it's not as popular as football for instance that's why many of you ask questions about legitimity of this sport. It's actually well developed in French Polynesia under the control of an official league and it's really considered as a traditionnal sport now. To the previous contributor: thanks for your support, it's appreciated. It's actually an emerging sport which only want to be known and practiced by many people. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 20:58, 30 August 2006

<li><b>Answer</b>. Ok I understand what you're looking for.&#160;:) Here are some newspaper articles about Bload Bowl: [<a href="http://www.bloadbowl.com/bloadbowl/presse/presse.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bloadbowl.com/bloadbowl/presse/presse.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>]. Furthermore you can find here the status of the official Bload Bowl association: [<a href="http://www.bloadbowl.com/hbbs/statuts/statuts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bloadbowl.com/hbbs/statuts/statuts.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>]. EDIT: and I forgot this link, few words about Bload Bowl on a French website talking about American Football: [<a href="http://www.usfoot.com/liens.php?site=1&amp;c=963&amp;r=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usfoot.com/liens.php?site=1&amp;c=963&amp;r=1" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>]. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 22:12, 30 August 2006

<li>The newspaper articles are apparently scans and say that the game was invented by some university students about 10 years ago and currently has a few hundred adherents. At best, it seems non-notable to me but everything is hosted on their own site, so it could possibly be an elaborate hoax (although I don't really think so).

</li>
<li><b>Answer</b>. Yes the articles are scans. One of the Wiki contributors above (<a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">User:Dlyons493</a>) speaks French according to his User Profile.

<li><b>Proof</b>. Here's the publication in the Official Journal which proves that a Bload Bowl association has been created: [<a href="http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/jahia/Jahia/associations" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/jahia/Jahia/associations" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>]. Write "Bload Bowl" in the field "Objet de l'association" and then click on the "Rechercher" button. You'll see the official report. Note that this website is "Le Journal Officiel". It's a document used by French Government to publish all the laws. It is also used to report creations of associations. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 23:40, 30 August 2006
<ul>
<li>I don't doubt that the association has been created. The question is whether it is notable enough to include in Wikipedia. We do not know the criteria for inclusion in "Le Journal Officiel," so it does not help us determine notability. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 00:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That Journal is legitimate and returns the following for the prefecture of Herault (a large admin division of continental France). It states the objectives of the HERAULT BLOAD BOWL WARRIORS: promotion of bload bowl and all parallel activities; organisation of bload bowl matches; installation and follow-up of the payment for the bload bowl; official classification of all the players past and present; attribution of the titles of <i>senseï</i> (teacher), <i>star</i>, <i>hope</i>, <i>veteran</i>, <i>blue</i> and <i>pons</i>; statistical official management of the bload bowler; organisation of activities having as their goal the reinforcement of friendly links between its members. I think we've moved on from verifiability which seems now accepted to notability. Have we any information on membership, competitions, funding etc? <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 00:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability is also my issue. "Several exhibition games have already been played all over the world (mainly in France)" - Where else in the world? Is it played all over the world in competition level? <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyr2k_5b2b.html" title="User:Zephyr2k">Zephyr2k</a> 00:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to the information from the newspaper clippings (graciously provided to me by Dlyons493), the sport had 70 members and 500 players as of 2003. Out of a population of about 250,000 in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Polynesia_9f56.html" title="French Polynesia">French Polynesia</a>, it doesn't seem like a very notable sport even within its home region. I have nothing against the sport. I just don't think it's big enough yet for an article in this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 00:40, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Answer</b>. Dlyons493 wrote&#160;:"I think we've moved on from verifiability which seems now accepted to notability". Ok so you know that Bload Bowl is a real sport now.&#160;:) Zephyr2k wrote: "Where else in the world? Is it played all over the world in competition level?".

In competition level, apart from the original association based in French Polynesia, there's also an association in Montpellier (France). Rohirok wrote: "I just don't think it's big enough yet for an article in this encyclopedia". Actually the main problem of this association is worldwide communication.

Out of a population of about 250,000 in French Polynesia, it doesn't seem like a very notable sport even within its home region." Let's take a comparison. There's an article on English Wikipedia talking about <a href="../../../p/%C3%A9/t/P%C3%A9tanque.html" title="Pétanque">Pétanque</a> which is a typical French sport practised mainly in the South. In this article, we can read that there are "about 480,000 players licenced with the Fédération Française de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal (FFPJP)". 480.000 players out of a 60.000.000 population, that's basically the same ratio as Bload Bowl in French Polynesia. It's quite surprising as Pétanque is the "4th-largest sporting federation in France" according to this article. So I don't see problems concerning legitimate existency of Bload Bowl.</li>

<dd>Hello MLA, glad to see you here&#160;!&#160;:) MLA wrote "wikipedia can't be the first place for information to be spread it has to be the collection of other information". Ok I understand now what you all don't like in my article. Actually I've collected information from newspapers (links above). Newspapers are a valuable source of information and probably more reliable that any Internet contents oftenly written by uknown users. Maybe it sounds "old-fashionned" for you nowadays with the Internet-era, but I could understand it.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I suppose that you find me particularly insistant but it's because I didn't have any problems when I wrote the original article in French Wikipedia (some Wiki users even helped me with Wiki syntax). I feel a bit upset considering the fact that I spent so many nights to translate my article into English without hoping any rewards or consideration, just with the feeling to share knowledge with other people.</dd>
<dd>However, as suggested by MLA, I wouldn't mind seeing my article linked to the Blood Bowl article rather than being a main entry if it can sort things. <a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadu-c_5171.html" title="User:Kadu-c">Kadu-c</a> 12:16, 31 August 2006

<li><b>Weak keep</b> but needs improvement. This is not actually POV, it does handle both sides, but it's a pretty rough article overall. The controversy is non-trivial and there are reasonable critics of the vehicle's concept, execution, and mission, even though there's a very noisy unreasonable claque as well. My major concern with deletion is how this would fit back into the culture, as it were, of the main Stryker article. Is the split intended to create a ghetto for criticism?

<dd>It was edit warring and various non-notable entries that causes the POV fork. For example the old wheeled vs tracked debate has nothing to do with the Stryker and has no place in the main article, but in a POV fork there are less editors to look over the content. This isn't FAS or military equipment forum about 50% of the content (of both sides) would be have to be dropped to be encylopedic. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 23:17, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't understand what the problem with a look at the pros and cons of the issue within context of the design are. This has become a matter of serious debate within the US Armed Forces and has become a prime example of similar debates that are currently being engaged in around the world. The Stryker contorversy is more formal because of congressional reports, mass media coverage, and various official responses from the military. It needs to be discussed in more depth than was allowable under an encyclopedic entry dedicated to the vehicle, which is why I created the SVC page in the first place. It was detracting from the Stryker page and had turned it into an edit war over this devisive issue. Delete the SVC article and you'll watch the Stryker article degenerate right back into this. There needs to be a dumping ground for this, and it shouldn't be on the Stryker page. -- <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatguy96_05dc.html" title="User:Thatguy96">Thatguy96</a> 20:32, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While born of the Stryker article, this page has grown to take on its own life. Since the US Army's top brass, the GAO, the US Congress, and the soldiers actually using this vehicle have all thoroughly reviewed it, liked it, and its still being bought and used, then there should not be as much controversy. However, there will always be those who disagree, but their detailed arguements should not be listed in the main article. Second, many other vehicles' performance capabilities (including the M2 Bradley, the M113, and the C130 <i>aircraft</i>) are being discussed in this article, and that should not appear in an encyclopedic article on the Stryker. Third, the Stryker is not the only military vehicle whose controversy has spun off into its own life. For example, the problems in the launching of the M2 Bradley eventually became an HBO movie.--Vstr 13:39, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would venture to say its because there is a serious debate about the benefits of a Stryker type system in the field. The V-22 represents a universally accepted capability enhancement. The major issue with the V-22 was whether it was worth dumping so much into it if they couldn't get it to work. Now that they essentially have, people are glad to see it start being deployed more or less on the whole. -- <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatguy96_05dc.html" title="User:Thatguy96">Thatguy96</a> 21:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or merge back with the original Stryker article</b> It's funny that because there was <b>so many</b> criticisms of the Stryker vehicle on the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stryker.html" title="Stryker">Stryker</a> article, the criticisms had to be moved to it's own article. Then once it gets moved to it's own artice it becomes a POV issue (something that wasn't so much of an issue when it was part of the Stryker article because both sides were represented.) So some people don't want the criticisms at the Stryker article, and don't want it on it's own article either. Could it be that there are people who just don't want these criticisms being published? They are valid criticisms nonetheless. So far I'm seeing 7-2 Keep. -- 24.118.89.238 4 Sept, 2006</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> As an Iraq war veteran, I can attest that these criticisms <b>are</b> valid. Although I was never on a Stryker, I did play OPFOR against the 172d infantry (who uses strykers) at a <a href="../../../j/r/t/JRTC_1d4c.html" title="JRTC">JRTC</a> rotation, and I know from experience that these things are a total waste of money. Can't shoot on the move, large blind spots, no RPG protection, no off road capability, and it's too heavey to be carried by a C-130 (which was its original purpose). I'm new to Wikipedia, so I'm going to leave the editing to someone more experienced. As you can tell, I'm pretty biased here. But I'm only biased here because my fellow soldiers are dying because of this piece of shit. Who even put this up for deletion? Is silencing criticism "supporting the troops"?

<dd><i>The Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchel Field, which was built to celebrate Long Island's important role in the development of air travel, has been plagued with money troubles since it was conceived in the 1970's. By the time the museum opened in 2002, Nassau County had poured $40 million in taxpayer money into it. And despite annual subsidies from the county, the museum's annual deficits have grown, while attendance has declined. The museum received more bad news Wednesday, when the Nassau County comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, issued a scathing report on the museum's finances and urged a reorganization of its board and top management. "Unless there's a radical change in direction," he said, "the museum simply cannot succeed."</i></dd>

Ninety-nine of the article's 107 words are devoted to her book, "elimination communication", and the claim that she "inspired" the formation of a non-profit organization.

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b> but with no actual material being lost, and recast as a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Practically every commentor had a different solution, so there was no consensus, exactly. During the course of the discussion material was merged, so that <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_TriStar_Motion_Picture_Group_b9e1.html" title="Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group">Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> are now identical, except for one short paragraph. During most of the discussion, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_TriStar_Motion_Picture_Group_b9e1.html" title="Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group">Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group</a> was just a stub. Anyway, it's apparant that, absent more significant editing, the material in either <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_TriStar_Motion_Picture_Group_b9e1.html" title="Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group">Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> be deleted and the page made a redirect to the other. I don't believe that at this point merging the extensive material in these twin articles into <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_148d.html" title="Sony Pictures Entertainment">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a> would be a either a good idea or a good reading of what the commentors wanted. Anyway, to sort this all out, I chose to make <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_TriStar_Motion_Picture_Group_b9e1.html" title="Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group">Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group</a> a redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Pictures_9b68.html" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> rather than vice versa because (1) a user is more likey to type "Columbia Pictures" rather than "Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group" I suppose, and (2) Columbia Pictures is much the older entity and a part of Hollywood history. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 06:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just merged them per my suggestion above. See what you think..... There wasn't that much text to be banged together. However, I've left the list of notable films separate for now, one following the other. I think it is a total nightmare -it seems to be a hotch potch collection of every editor's favourite Columbia and TriStar film. In short, far too many movies that it clutters up the page. I would suggest applying some sort of box office gross criteria (say over $100 million) and go through that list, then merging them properly (leaving only the blockbusters). <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Oriignally listed for deletion by myself and deleted...exactly one year ago (imagine that; see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Disney%27s_65_episode_policy_424c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Disney's 65 episode policy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Disney's 65 episode policy</a>). The reasons why the original page was nominated for deletion are the same as the reasons for relisting it now, so I'll just copy and paste:</p>
<p>"A combination of fan speculation, very mild fancruft, original research, and opinions. Disney cartoons aren't specially singled out; nearly all network and syndicated animated shows stop after 65 episodes (because at 65, the studio have enough episodes to broadcast for each weekday for 13 weeks--a full season). I'd say to delete this article with no redirect, and make a mention of the policy at an article for television syndication. FuriousFreddy 10:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Two minor notes: (1) This article has no sources, and, as the talk page alludes to, there are no actual verifiable sources available. <i>This is all <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and fan speculation.</i> (2) "Make a mention of the policy at an article for television syndication" should be "Make a brief mention of the 65-episode run of most syndicated animated programs at an article for television sndication", because it's not even a policy -- more like a loose rule-of-thumb. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 22:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> The 65 Episode Policy is well know in the Disney fan circle. Even if it's untrue or simply a myth, the 65 Episode Policy can be considered a significant and wide-spread urban legend. Deleting it will constitute major omission of information.

<p>Non-notable flash animation by non-notable company. The client they speak of doesn't even have its own article. Not on the level of "Jib Jab" in cultural importance. James Gordon 22:27, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><s><b>Neutral.</b></s><b>Keep</b> I had prodded this article in the past, and someone else deprodded it. When I looked more closely, I found taht this flash animation actually won a few independent-looking awards. I left a link on the page to the awards list; I was able to confirm some of those awards; others were on web pages that are expired now. B/C of that, I didn't take the article to AfD myself. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 23:41, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> on the basis of the awards the animation has won.

<li><b>Comment</b> Article is completely self referencing. The link to the awards is on the movies own site. The awards sited are equally non-notable and I doubt would make the cut as separate articles. If three uninteresting people say they know an equally uninteresting person is that notability?--James Gordon 00:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Like I said, that was laziness on my part, but the awards I tried to verify, I mostly was able to. It would be nice if the article said a little more about them, rather than just "The Meatrix has won several awards," which was fine when the article was a 3-line stub. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 11:46, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The reason I wrote this article was because they were mentioned on a few other pages here with no further info and since I was familiar with them I figured I'd give it a shot. It's fair to say that this band has never charted but the genre of music (<a href="../../../g/r/i/Grindcore.html" title="Grindcore">grindcore</a> <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tech_metal.html" title="Tech metal">tech metal</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metalcore.html" title="Metalcore">metalcore</a>) is so obscure that most of the other bands listed with pages here have never charted either but have still sold thousands of records and have tons of fans as witnessed by other people adding them here on Wikipedia. The page on <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psyopus.html" title="Psyopus">Psyopus</a> for example desperately needs to be cleaned up but I don't know enough about the band to do it. As for simply deleting the band because they named themselves after Tony Danza I don't think that's a fair reason to delete a page. This isn't some fly by night garage band that I made up. A simple google search will confirm that they are quite real and have a viable music audience. If my article gets deleted I'm not going to cry about it but it's kind of weird to list the band on other Wikipedia pages and not have an article explaining who they are.-- <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMaddhatt_6fe2.html" title="User:Maddhatt">Maddhatt</a> 13:01, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

This link refers to one that only has one credit to his name and no longer works in the film industry. The James Hughes listed on this page is far from being non notable. His website alone gets 100,000 hits every 2 weeks and is has been ten years since he was a beginner/student filmmaker as the earlier reviewer states. In fact James Hughes has been a full member of The Writers Guild and Directors Guild for ten years. He regulary is asked to teach Screenwriting at institutions both here in the UK and America. His latest film as a Director is being produced by the team behind Spiderman II, along with the crew from Terminator 3, Mission Impossible, and Oceans 11. The film in question is currently shooting in Los Angeles and the UK (<a href="http://www.thevelvetabstract.com" class="external free" title="http://www.thevelvetabstract.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thevelvetabstract.com</a>). The credits listed on here are only a handful of James Hughes's credits and all have been produced or are filming. The short films mentioned are both Award winners and one of them was hand picked by a studio in America to show to clients.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Damfino52 (<a href="../../../d/a/m/User_talk%7EDamfino52_c40a.html" title="User talk:Damfino52">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Damfino52_1ee3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Damfino52">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>But if he is this notable why is the top google links his article here and then a link to a completely different non-notable person on Rotten tomatoes?? SUre the website may be popular but that is no measure of notability - he might visit the website 100,000 times a fortnight! Can you provide sources for that info by the way (it is a start at least) and maybe some independant critical analysis of his work? That would define his notability. <b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 09:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Your argument that the Rotten Tomatoes link is for someone else doesn't help, as that says that they have nothing to say about him at all. Being a member of the guilds says he's working, not notable. As for a film currently filming, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, and there is no way to know whether it will be notable when completed, regardless of who is producing it. The basic problem is that short films are generally not distributed beyond some film festivals, get no notice from the mainstream press, and the overwhelming majority of people will never have the opportunity to see them, or even hear of them. His website doesn't register on Alexa at all, and gets a grand total of 22 google hits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=james+hughes+com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=james+hughes+com" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>), which makes its popularity unverifiable at best. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:12, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response to comment</b> - What does "verifiable proof" mean? Does a screenshot of a forum PM from WhatIsJoppa.com#Ben_M._Watts count? The articles are likely to be published within the space of a month (purely based on my estimates) as interviews either have taken place or will be on Friday/today. Also apparently they are to be "Featured Comedian" next wednesday on MySpace's Comedy department. The periodicals in question, now mentioned in the article, have websites and may post the interviews there after publishing. - <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuolnok_0123.html" title="User:Quolnok">Quolnok</a> 02:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The guidlines on a notible article are hardly as hard set as you make them seem. Quoted from the Notability guidline section itself; "The word notable is often used as a synonym of "unique" or "newsworthy." Now, I would understand if Joppa had never been in any sort of media coverage at all. But as long as it holds it's place in a newpaper with a considerable readership, that being 8,000 copies, and not only be mentioned in that paper but put on the front page, it holds its place as "newsworthy," regardless of the level of "newsworthy-ness" it claimed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.81.58.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.58.236_5a79.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.58.236">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Since Google seems to be the search engine of choice, let it also be mentioned that if you simply type "Joppa" into the search engine, you will notice that the group is the #1 hit. This says a lot, seeing as Joppa is also a "notable" city in the Bible, as well as a very "notable" nature preserve in Newburyport, as well as a very "notable" city in Maryland (not to mention the name of some other notable companies, all existing long before whatisjoppa.com). So, in a world of Joppas, if the first thing that shows up is whatisjoppa.com, then I would say it's been made somewhat notable.

<dd>The first return for an unlikely search doesn't illustrate notability.

<dd>A search for the word Joppa results in 2,280,000 hits. I beg to differ with your previous statement. (Also notice that What is Joppa still is first on THAT list.) If you are going to argue that Joppa is an uncommon word, then a Google search shouldn't even be used as a means to signify notability at all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.81.58.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.58.236_5a79.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.58.236">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>It doesn't quite work that way. <i>Saturday Night Live</i> wasn't a common phrase until the show premiered. As such, that phrase garners many hits...because it is notable. Joppa isn't. Hence it doesn't garner as many hits. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 17:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yet the words 'Saturday' 'Night' and 'Live' are common words, which could range from "I had a great Saturday" to "Last night was off the hook!" Also, "Saturday Night Live" generates many hits because it's on a notable broadcasting network. A search resulting in "NBC- Saturday Night Live" hardly qualifies as a symbol of notability. I don't quite understand your using this example in the first place, we're not even comparing What is Joppa to the notability level of Saturday Night Live. Saturday Night Live is on TV, Joppa isn't. That's like comparing The Prarie Home Companion to the X-Files. They deal in completely different fields of media.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.81.58.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.58.236_5a79.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.58.236">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep and Comment</b>. A google search isn't the appropriate test for notability in this case.

The podcast was in the top few podcasts on iTunes<a href="http://www.fmcrew.com/discuss/viewtopic.php?t=248" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fmcrew.com/discuss/viewtopic.php?t=248" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> at the time, and was featured as "New and Notable"<a href="http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/9158/jopnewnotablecopy4kn.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img83.imageshack.us/img83/9158/jopnewnotablecopy4kn.jpg" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> (haha) on the front iTunes podcast page. I'd also like to comment that I still don't feel comfortable leaving the article unstubbed. I don't think the stub tag should be removed until the press coverage section is expanded as well as the character section.

Also, as an <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusionism.html" title="Inclusionism">inclusionist</a>, I'd like to point out that the concept of "notability" is objective and is sourced from a simple essay that is not an official Wikipedia Policy or Guideline. --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> 03:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hold it, since when? "An award is something given to a person or group of people to recognize excellence in a certain field." Quoted from the Award entry on Wikipedia.

<dd>The position on the "New and Noticable" list was GIVEN to the site because they held a high rank on the top downloads list, even though they were new to the iTunes podcasts section. They ACHIEVED it by recieving a great deal of attention, aka downloads. The term "brief mention" would be iTunes creating something like a "New Posters" list where EVERYONE who was new was shown. An example of a "brief mention" is the "Cool New People" list on Myspace. That is not the case here. My posts are signed as my IP, and will continue to be.

<dd>I couldn't care less that you don't use a username. Your posts haven't been signed. I have had to go in and add an unsigned template. Please use ~~~~ at the end of your post to sign it. As for the mention, it was listed with many others for a brief period of time. It is no longer up there and nothing was given to Joppa, hence it isn't an award. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Signing your comment is just a suggestion, not a rule (the page says "On talk pages, please sign your comment by typing four tildes" and there is no mention of a signing requirement). Though I'm sure you thought it might be possible to have this page also scheduled for deletion based on disobaying the sacred "signing your post" rule.

<dd>An award does not have to be material... It was given a position. A position not everybody had. Also, the list is updated. That doesn't mean it was never there. Also, 32 people out of ALL PODCASTS on iTunes is not "many people." In essence, you're now difining an award as "An exclusive reward given to a tiny group of people after which it is never given to anyone else." So I guess the Oscars aren't an award.~~~~<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.81.58.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.58.236_5a79.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.58.236">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>comment</b> It seems that neither party is eager to yield any ground on this issue. Perhaps it would be effective to give the other party some way to prove their point, rather than shooting down the ones already made. Perhaps "Irishguy" could tell the unsigned user above what exactly what proof/evidence it would take to reach consensus on this issue, or perhaps the unsigned could do the same. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerilouspenguin_8b6f.html" title="User:Perilouspenguin"><font color="green"><b>perilouspenguin</b></font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup></li>

"<i>so many new users</i>" one is many? there are 7 persons who've edited this, 2 are IPs not users and may be the same as one of the other users, one of these has voted (from what I hear such votes don't count and only people with an edit history count) this leaves 4, including 1 (you) against the article. These people probably just looked at the article about (one of) their favourite show(s) and were upset about the pending delete. again: "<i>If this attempt to delete the article does go through, how many of those articles do you believe need to be published/posted online before it is recreated?</i>" - <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuolnok_0123.html" title="User:Quolnok">Quolnok</a> 03:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an answer to the italicized question, all it takes is one notable publication. Also, I <i>don't</i> find it very curious that there are many new users to comment. However, I'd like to point out I am not one of them. As a response to Quolnok's vote count: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_experiment_in_democracy" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia isn't a democracy</a>. The point is to come to a consensus about the fate of the article. As there is no consensus, the article will stay. It has been argued that the article in question is in fact notable, and some of those reasons (i.e. the "New and Notable award) are verifiable. The dispute on verifiability is very much based on opinion (such as the definition of "award", which objectively favors the article's survival). --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> 04:59, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to your inferrence that these accounts and comments are fake: Just because we don't live and die by the creation, editing, and management of Wikipedia, does not mean we don't use Wikipedia nor does it mean the fans of the actual article don't find the impromptu crucase to delete a worthy page extremely unsettling.

<dd>One more note on the notability section; Wikipedia: Notability (web) states that "Web specific-content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 3.The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." A podcast on iTunes, a VERY well know online broadcaster clearly qualifies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.81.58.236 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.81.58.236_5a79.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.81.58.236">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Okay, clarification because people missinterpreted my comment - I'm aware it isn't a democracy, that was to show a lack of support for the delete. (this may not be targeted at me) I don't believe the editless accounts to be fake, I believe IrishGuy believes that they are. The Italicised question was for IrishGuy, because he seems to think that only when they get printed (ie evidence exists) it would then qualify as notable, thus if the (wiki)article were to be deleted (which I doubt) it could be recreated once said articles exist. - <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuolnok_0123.html" title="User:Quolnok">Quolnok</a> 05:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I came to this discussion because I was at the Joppa Wiki and saw the notice, and for no other reason. Before I posted anything on this discussion I wasn't aware that it would merit such a large response. I also did not know that the AfD was inteded as a discussion between registered members only, so I proceeded to comment, without hesitation, my reasons to keep the Joppa Wiki alive. At the very beginning I proceeded to read all the guidelines and formalities, as that's the only way one can win an argument, when one knows all the information. Now I realize you may think I'm more than one person, and I can't create any assurance as to wether or not I am, except for my word. Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.72.81.58.236</dd>

<dd>I seem to be the new user everyone's talking about, and yes I could see how I might seem to be a sock puppet, this being really my first edit. But I would say that I've been the victim of circumstance...my comment above you may notice wasn't really vying for either side, I was simply attempting to help this issue move along; thus I don't really see how that kind of a comment would come from a sock puppet...I guess if sock puppets are helping to move discussions towards a compromise and resolution, then maybe more people should use them. But anyway, I was simply browsing articles of things I have knowledge about, looking for a good place to edit or create when I found that the joppa wiki was up for AfD, and decided to jump in. I know this gives no grounds for me either being or not being a sock puppet, I just thought the story should be told. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerilouspenguin_8b6f.html" title="User:Perilouspenguin"><font color="green"><b>perilouspenguin</b></font></a> <sup><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></sup></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>This is Ben from the group Joppa. I'm really impressed with the dedication that our fans have put in to keeping this Wiki page alive, so thanks to all who have contributed. If I may address IrishGuy, I just wanted to confirm to you that we had an interview with the Newburyport Daily News (14,000 home deliveries daily) this past Friday, and the article will run a week from tomorrow, we just need to meet with the staff photographer. It seems to me that the paper posts all of it's articles online, but if such is not the case, how would I go about getting that proof to you? Additionally, would this end the debate as to whether or not the group had acheived Noteworthy status? Of course, we see the importance of adhering to Wiki guidelines, but two newspaper articles seems to be more than what the guidelines require, regardless of their locale or subscription size. Our fans have spent a lot of time and effort putting this page together, and I'd hate to see that effort go to waste.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>IrishGuy is mistaken in regards to WP:WEB requirements. Perhaps you read the title of the page without delving into the main body. Their site clearly meets one of the single necessary guidelines required on WP:WEB: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Please re-read this if you haven't already. The guideline, while called a "notability guideline," does not actually state that the site has to be the subject of multiple NOTABLE published works. They need merely be NON-TRIVIAL published works.</p>
<p>A 'zine that someone photocopies in CVS and passes out at punk shows is arguably trivial. A weekly publication like The Wire (which has a sizeable readership in urban areas like Portsmouth, NH as well as other locations in MA)is certainly not trivial by any definition of the word. To suggest that the Newburyport News is somehow trival is actually laughable; the paper is owned by the Eagle-Tribune Newspaper Company, a major area publishing group, and has a wider circulation than the second Newburyport paper (that's right, there are two of them) which is owned by the Herald Media group, often associated with the Boston Herald. You said above: "It isn't my job to do your research for you. You are the one making claims about circulation, as such it is your job to provide a link to prove that you aren't making such statistics up." You were provided with a link that within all reasonabilty proves the circulation of the paper, and your response was to change tack and ignore the link. Is it possible that you're just trying to be difficult here?</p>
<p>Please also review the bulleted portion of the Notability requirements reading: "This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles." <i>Reliability</i> is actually the issue here, not notability in terms of readership. And according to the wording of this requirement, all a published work has to do to be reliable is to be a newspaper or magazine article! <i>It doesn't matter what the circulation is</i>, so long as the published work is a newspaper or a magazine. Again, you need to actually read these requirements. The wire has been sufficiently proven to be a reliable paper and the Newburyport News again fulfills the requirement; all they have to do to be reliable, according to WP:WEB, is to exist as magazine or newspaper publications (as opposed to zines, agitskis, or other "unreliable" published media).</p>
<p>Your objection only holds any water at all until the Newburyport News article runs next week because until that point only one non-trivial publication has covered Joppa.com. After that, there is absolutely no reason to object to the Joppa wikipedia entry, as it will clearly and without room for argument fulfill the guideline that "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself," unless YOU want to get in touch with the Newburyport News and question them as to the veracity of their claims regarding readership, or get in touch with the Wire to find out whether they're actually just a joppa front organization.</p>
<p>To conclude: once the Joppa wiki article links to the wire AND the Newburyport News, you would be well served to drop the issue. This is only one man's opinion, but the requirements guidelines don't really leave you a lot of wiggle room.</p>
<p>I am not a regular viewer of Joppa and I am not closely aquainted with the makers of the show. You can choose to make my identity a sticking point, but the validity of my argument is intact. 151.199.18.140 03:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)SomeonefromNS</p>

<dd>Non-trivial and non-notable are pretty much synonymous. When a local paper only has a local readership, it isn't grounds to illustrate notability. This is a generally encyclopedia. It is about far more than a small area of New England.

<dd>I'm sorry if you didn't mean to make it sound that way, but I've on several occassions heard you use a "judgemental tone" as well. Also, please add some basis to your statement. By saying that non-trivial and non-notable are pretty much synonymous, I would like to see some evidence of that satement, may it be previously decided cases made by other editors, (not yourself as we already know your opinion,) a dictionary definition, or a general article which makes that claim. Otherwise your argument hardly holds any water. Also, I would like to note that Wikipedia is trying to create, in essense an encyclopedia of all knowledge, regardless of its notability in certain areas. Were this a general encyclopedia, many of the articles you and others have posted would not fall under "general." Simply because a topic is more notable in one area than another does not mean it isn't notible at all. Your article about "Keith Barry" is a perfect example, as people in Europe would find it MUCH more notable than anyone in America or other parts of the world. This is simply my point of view in this matter, please consider it. 72.81.58.236 20:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If something is trivial, it cannot be notable. If something is notable, it wouldn't be trivial. Hence, non-trivial and non-notable are basically synonymous. Contrary to your statement, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not an encyclopedia of all knowledge</a>.

Or, maybe those terms are, in themselves, not notable enough for this site...don't know.

<dd>And, just to add something here: it does appear that IrishGuy has a some point to make about notability, and is not really making it. A number of people here have quoted the guidelines of this site pretty clearly, and proved in favor of keeping the article. I, personally, feel that you are much mistaken in believing this is a means to "promote" our group. Hardly. Sorry, but more folks will be hearing about us in the Newburyport News, The Wire, on iTunes, and next week as a featured comedian on MySpace, then will ever come to us through this article. So, it wouldn't hurt my feelings if this were deleted. However, I would be upset that so much of the hard work these fans have put in to make this a perfect reference for people visiting our site would be wasted--because, it DOES NOT violate any guidelines of wikipedia, as have been proved more times here than I need to prove again.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is a great place for references. And, that's what this article is all about.

Let me end by a quote from wikipedia's guidelines: "Wikipedia is not a moot court, and although rules can make things easier, they are not the purpose of the community...A perceived procedural error made in posting anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines.

<dd>Indeed, it is void. What the quote outlined was the belief that rigid blind obedience to rules hinders progress, which is true. Adding a non-notable article to Wikipedia isn't what that quote was about. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 20:44, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, are you still defying Webster by asserting that "non-notable" and "non-trivial" are synonymous? The purpose of this discussion is so that one party can respond to points of another. You responded to nothing. You just continue to cut and paste previous posts of yours that are based on opinion rather than fact. Calling the merits of a "local paper" or a number of New England publications non-notable is an opinion. This is Thom again. Wouldn't want to cross the anonymous barrier. 24.61.157.174</dd>

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. As outlined above: If something is trivial, it cannot be notable. If something is notable, it wouldn't be trivial. Hence, non-trivial and non-notable are basically synonymous. As far as the local paper goes, you are missing the point. It isn't <i>only</i> that it is a small local paper, it is that it is a small local paper writing about local people. How is that notable? You might have an argument if a small local paper from across the nation wrote about you because that might indicate the reach of your website, but that didn't happen.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 20:44, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You just said, If something is trivial, it is non-notable, right? If something is notable, it is non-trivial? Is anyone seeing what I'm getting at? Yet, you still assert that non-notable and non-trivial are "synonymous." Maybe it's me...maybe it's the word "synonymous" that you're having a problem with. And, if you're debating whether the "reach" of our website is substantial, I think you'll find that most people who come to our site are not from anywhere near New Enlgand, and I believe there's been proof of that already as well. 24.61.157.174 21:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't let the <b>un</b>anonymous editors go unnoticed.

The arguments made thus far are not void, and in the final sum of things, the article is notable, and worthy of wikipedia. I do understand how wikipedia and notability works, and I believe WhatIsJoppa.com is important enough to keep because of its verified popularity. Any rebuttals to this statement is the <b>opinion</b> of another editor asserting that their interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> falsifies the notability of the article.

You have no proof that these folks here are "sockpuppets," besides that fact that you can't believe this article you have tried to prove "un-notable" is proving to be quite notable through its national and international support. 24.61.157.174</dd>

<dd>So, if people FAMILIAR with the subject matter of a certain article want to defend and provide evidence for its notability, they have to first be members and then acquire a substantial "edit history" on this site in order for their arguments to carry any weight? That doesn't seem right for some reason. I have no intention of become a member of wikipedia, but if I knew of a certain article I liked was being deleted, I would hope that my voice would be heard, and that I would be able to help defend it. That's what these folks are doing, and I applaud them all. 24.61.157.174 22:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it most assuredly does mean they aren't simply concerned supporters. The exact wording by a member of Joppa was: <i>We here at Joppa cannot let the time and hard work of you individuals that have been keeping it alive be for nothing!</i> and then further went on to instruct your forum members to come here and sway the vote in your favor. May I bring to your attention Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html#Meatpuppets" title="WP:SOCK">policy on Meatpuppetry</a> wherein it states: <i>It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate</i>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>But, when the topic of discussion is noteriety, it is only fitting, in order to prove noteriety, and extended (no local) importance of an article, it is only fitting that the voices of people from all over the world make it known that Joppa is not a "local phenomenon" as you are fond of calling it. Just because you've been overwhelmed with Joppa "noteriety" attracting so much attention to this page, doesn't mean you can call these folks "un-concerned." And, I never asked anyone to "vote." I understand this is not an issue to vote, so please don't put words in my mouth.24.61.157.174 23:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I resent the fact that a post in a discussion forum is the catalyst for our reaction. I am not a zombie or puppet, but a thinking and logical human. I like Joppa and think the entry is useful; deleting it would be a shame. Joppa has met the criteria... and along with several real and interested parties that took time out of their day to put in their 2 cents in wikipedia, a regular editor agrees. Believe me, I would much rather be doing something else then defending a proven point to someone who ignores lines of argumentation based on an apparentv blind motivation bias. Heck, the argument of reading something, being stirred you into action, and having that motivation discredit you can be made for you reading the WP:WEP (or whatever) and then you springing into action to erase potential articles. Insane. Motivation and truth are not necessarily related. Also, attacking us with libelous slang such as "meatpuppet" is not very nice. Read your own damn attack page, you have the link but aparently are not familiar with the text. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.8.231.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.8.231.161_3368.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.8.231.161">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Quite frankly, there is no possible way you can justify breaking Wiki policy to sway an AfD. You sent forum members here. They aren't concerned users. They are puppets. And your argument doesn't even work. If your site is so notorious and popular (even though <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" rel="nofollow">Alexa shows otherwise</a>) then why were their only a small handfull of IP puppets? Your site just plain doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Bringing forth more anonymous puppets won't alter that fact. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 00:00, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't call me a puppet. Never call me a puppet. Calling me a puppet is what I consider an offensive statement and a personal attack, there is no way you know why I'm here. Simply because someone asks me to do something isn't why I do it. I don't care if what Thom did is considered innapropriate in the world of Wikipedia. But don't tell me I'm doing some else's work. Please stop your aggressive statements and make your descision. 72.81.58.236 01:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just because I care about the significance of this article and not the deletion of every article on Wikipedia means nothing in relation to calling me a meat puppet. If I later want to comment on the situation after I have been involved in the debate doesn't mean anything at all except that I am telling people what's going on. People who care have a right to know. This is a public discussion. Simply because my voice carries little wheight doesn't mean you have the right to insult me as you have. 72.81.58.236 21:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not an attack, but an honest observation You're impossible to reason with, and you seem hell bent on the truth of your opinion despite evidence to the contrary. When someone raises a valid point you always fall back on their sudden existence on wikipedia due to the crisis you have started, but do not address their valid arguments; this is the equivalent of an outstretched hand and yelling "What-evah." You can attack Joppa fans as meatheads, but their arguments are valid and more than enough evidence has been offered up to satisfy wikipdeia’s requirements for notoriety (local paper, boston globe, itunes, myspace, most popular return for <i>Joppa</i> despite other legitimate hits, et cetera, et cetera.) I’m sure you’re not a moron, but you sure come off as one. I'm sure you will label this as an attack, I assure you it is not meant as such. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.8.231.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.8.231.161_3368.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.8.231.161">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>So, if someone is bullying the Joppa article on wikipedia, you don't think we have a right to speak up for what is being considered "un-notable" in the eyes of one, yes ONE, member of wikipedia. I honestly think that if you didn't have a personal grudge against what we're doing here, you'd have not bothered to respond--rather poorly--to any of these people defending the article. You would simply have made your case and allowed it to take its due course. What is the problem here? These people have obviously gone through a great length to prove to you that the article is notable. Yes, SOME are from our message board. That's only natural for people who know what they're talking about when it comes to the notability of the article. They would naturally be a part of our community--which is rather large and notable. The point is, if Joppa is so "un-notable" then why are so many people--from all over the globe--speaking out about it. They are NOT puppets. They have their own mind, and can choose whether or not to act in this matter. The hundreds of people that subscribe to our site have enjoyed the opportunity to use wikipedia as a means of learning some of the background and history of the Joppa group. To inform them that someone was threatening to take that away still doesn't seem like a breach of regulations. It was a means of informing them, AND if they had a means of defending it's KEEPING, then they have every right to use that means. Wikipedia makes this discussion open to anyone, which implies that anyone has a right to defend what they feel is just. Nowhere does it say "Members Only." That's the beauty of wikipedia. And, I'll say this again, seeing as it was ignored last time, quoted form wikipedia itself: <b>Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines.</b> 24.61.157.174 02:56, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. Putting an article up for AfD isn't <i>bullying the Joppa article</i>. The problem is that as a member of Joppa, you shouldn't even be involved as that violates <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. Another problem is that you willfully violated policy by trying to amass sockpuppets via your message forum. Yet another problem is that nobody has been able to illustrate any level of verifiable notability. And frankly, there aren't <i>so many people</i> speaking up for Joppa. There are two editors who helped write the article, you, and about two other anonymous people. That isn't exactly an army. Contrary to what you claim about the validity of your anonymous compatriots having validity, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia states</a>: <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons).

<dd>Again, "may be discounted" does not mean they ARE discounted. You are discounting them because they don't fit in with your argument. You are trying to prove noteriety. Their reasons are not misrepresented by the mere fact that they are here to prove noteriety, being the FAN BASE that has given Joppa its noteriety--as with ANYTHING that gains noteriety--IT STARTS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ADMIRE IT. And, no, I have NOTHING to do with the creation of the wikipedia article. HOWEVER, I do have something to do with this discussion because you have been asking for proof of the group's accolades and acclaim, and myself, as well as Ben Watts, were asked to help provide this proof. And, my friend, you should count again: me and "two other anonymous people" is not accurate. You still have not responded to the quoted text from wikipedia's statement on guidelines.Please stop asking me to read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> I have yet to be "uncivil."

<dd>I am discounting them because they are puppets sent here by the subject of the article to sway the AfD. No matter how often you use CAPS and continue to claim things, the fact is google garners less that 30 unique hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22what+is+joppa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22what+is+joppa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[43]</a> and alexa puts your ranking over a million <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>. You have been quite uncivil as well as willfully breaking Wikipolicy and somehow having the audacity to continue to attempt to justify doing so. Here is some advice, the more you try to justify incorrect behavior, the less secure your footing is to defend the integrity of this article.

<dd>Please, NEVER give me advice. It's very insulting, and you may want to check out <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. Also, I would ask that you stop altering my posts. A number of people have complained about that here, and though I'm not as well-versed (or, do I care to be) in the wiki guidelines as yourself, I know that there must be something prohibiting that. A person on this board may choose or not choose to display their IP address, that's why they are given the option. If I am communicating a "link" to prove one side of the argument, it doesn't matter if I'm anonymous or a member. A fact is a fact. By forcibly changing people's posts to display their IP address, it is not only a breach of this board's guidelines, but it is also a privacy breach of internet practices--I know, I have friends in the computer crime unit out of Boston. So, if you want to spend your time here throwing guidelines (WHICH THIS ARTICLE MEETS) in our face, I will do the same to you if you publically display someone's IP address on this board without their consent. Thank you. And, stop making up facts like Google returning only 30 unique hits. You and I both know, that is false. That's NOT how to have a debate. 24.61.157.174 16:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Signing posts is part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AFD#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" rel="nofollow">Wikietiquette for AfDs</a>. If you don't want your IP shown, you can register for an account. Not signing your posts doesn't hide your IP address, it is in the edit history.

<dd>You are wrong about google. I'll say that again. Just because you keep saying something won't make it true. And, just because you personally performed a limited search for Joppa, doesn't mean a thing. But, then again, you discredited google when the point was made that whatisjoppa.com was the number one hit on a google search for "Joppa," out of thousands of "Joppa" articles. It can't work for one argument, and not another. And, no, an IP address is as private as a telephone number. If someone chooses to display it on this board, it is their choice. If someone is on here to make a claim based on outside evidence, which they provide a link to, it doesn't matter who they are, because, like I said, a fact is a fact. What do the guidelines say about someone making an entry "deletion" personal, rather than operational? You obviously have some problem with the show itself, and because of you lack of subtance or reason to remove the article, it only proves my point. I am not being uncivil, I am simply resonding to arguments. 24.61.157.174 16:55, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you actually check? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22what+is+joppa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22what+is+joppa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Look at the link</a>. It shows less that 30 <i>unique</i> hits. While it may say there are a few thousand returns for "what is joppa", it hides all the redundant hits so less than 30 are actually shown. Please don't presume to tell me what my motivation is or isn't. I put an importance tag on the article. It was up for eight days with no importance being illustrated in the article. At that point I put it up for AfD. That is standard procedure. When a tag is ignored it goes to AfD.

<dd>Again, as typical, you fail to resond to anything, but simply re-stated things which have been rebuked previously. Your search is ILL-FOUNDED on google. You searched for "what is joppa." First of all, as I mentioned, just searching for "Joppa" will get you more unique hits for us, as well as the TOP hit. Then, searching for "whatisjoppa" will get you even more. Then, searching for "fmcrew", which is our actual domain name, will get you even more. You can't search for "what is joppa." I'm amazed you even got the hits you did. "What is Joppa" is not the show. "Joppa" is the show. "Whatisjoppa" is the domain name we were forced to use beause "joppa.com" was taken--WHICH AGAIN, disproves the point that you were trying to make earlier about "Joppa" being an uncommon word, which it is not. But, I'm not exptecting you to actually respond to every argument that doesn't fit your side of the debate. You've failed to do so thus far. Proof has been supplied here over and over again as to the site notability. You continue to play with technicalities, which as I've posted from wikipedia's own literature, is NOT the way to approach deletions. ANOTHER point you have failed to respond to. You continue to bully this board with your empty points which have been discarded again and again--that tells me that you must have a personal problem with this website--which is fine--but you don't need to intrude on our, or our fans, creations. Your tag of "importance" was responded to and qualified, yet you still insisted on a deletion. That tells me you've got other motivations here. You see, I just responded to EVERY point you raised, which I've been doing all along. You should try that, and possibly make yourself more convincing. And, the MySpace feature is not trivial. It's an award, accolade, whatever you want to call it. But, it's a sign of notability. 24.61.157.174 17:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As <i>typical</i>? Again, please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. Searching for "joppa" proves nothing as you aren't the only use of that word. Searching for the name of the domain is a more accurate search, and that brings less than 30 unique hits...which is clearly not notable. You and your army of puppets have completely failed to illustrate notability. You have provided iTunes, which YOU put your own work on so it isn't independent of you and therefore doesn't count; you provided a local paper with a small local distribution which profiled local people, and that is trivial at best; you provided the claim that it is "popular" but google and alexa prove otherwise. I couldn't care less what you believe to be my motivation. I have never watched your work. Then again, I have never read War and Peace but that <i>is</i> eminently notable and therefore deserves and article.

Which, again, you have failed to do, except with falsities. The google search--which is now apparently a "noteriety gauge" again--shows almost 800 hits when you search for our domain name. Which Google are you using? We did "submit" our podcast to iTunes--LIKE EVERYONE ELSE--and it was CHOSEN as a NOTABLE podcast, and featured on the iTunes hompage. This is out of hundreds and thousands of podcasts. Not to mention we were in the Top 50 podcasts after being on there for a week out of hundreds and thousands. Your OPINION of whether MySpace or certain periodicals are NON-NOTABLE, is just that--YOUR OPINION. It doesn't have any basis in fact. Just because you feel something to be un-notable as a publication because it fits with your personal attack on this site, doesn't make it so. And, you've again, unproved yourself--searching for Joppa proves nothing, because we are not the only use of that word--EXACTLY. But, we are the NUMBER ONE hit for that word out of...3 MILLION uses. Thanks for reminding me of that! And, don't worry, this is Thom again, though my IP is different, because I'm at work. Please start responding to arguments if you want to seem credible, not just repeating alrady discarded points 24.128.101.14 18:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will stop asking you to read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> when you cease to be uncivil. Making accusations about me and my motivation is egregiously uncivil. Constantly using terms like <i>typically</i>, <i>personal attack</i>, <i>bullying</i> and accusing me of using <i>falsities</i> is an <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">attack</a>. You aren't reading what I write. While google claims a certain amount of hits, those aren't all <i>unique</i> hits, which is what is important. When you go to the last page you will find that there are a fraction of the total hits which are unique. Google hides all the redundant hits and only shows the unique hits. With that, you have less than 30 hits. It isn't my opinion about MySpace. MySpace isn't allowed as an external link under <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> because it isn't a notable reference. When you are able to provide anything notable and verifiable, please let me know. Until that time, this doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd>You just said absolutely nothing with any substance. Your readings on google are incorrect. First you searched for the wrong criteria to build your argument, and now you're splitting hairs about unique vs. non-unique, because it fits your argument--when only a couple posts ago, you claimed that google was no basis for noteriety. Please decide what the basis of your argument is. We have already supplied an ample amount of evidence as to why this article is notable. Again, your opinion of what publications are notable is just your opinion. Something you have not denied. The criteria of not allowing MySpace references, is due to the fact that you can't claim noteriety by the number of visits you get on MySpace--that would be unreliable. We are not using that. We are using an accolade we received from MySpace, which, as a company, serves thousands of members--us being one. And, if you keep citing specific guidelines, I will again refer you to my earlier post quoting wikipedia's stance on deletions--something you, again, have not responded to. I am not being uncivil, I am only properly responding to articles. I advise you to do the same. 24.128.101.14 19:03, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once more, please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. Saying things such as <i>You just said absolutely nothing with any substance</i> is a blatant insult. Unique hits are what is important, NOT overall hits. Overall hits prove nothing. If you have a blog and you put a link to the site in 300 individual entries, that would make 300 hits...but only one unique hit. That is why <i>only</i> unique hits are looked at for an AfD. Google itself isn't a basis for notoriety. As a general rule during AfD's, when web traffic is used google is used in conjunction with alexa. Neither of those show any degree of notability on your part. I have responded to all of your posts. I have already clarified that the sentence you continue to quote has no bearing on this discussion. It is an ideal that rigid adherence to rules impedes progress...which is true. It isn't about allowing in website which meet no standard of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. You continue to claim that you have provided evidence, yet every single time I rebut it, you avoid it completely. I have repeatedly pointed out that popularity isn't a criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Additionally, you have completely failed to prove that this is somehow immensely popular. The alexa rank is over a million <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.whatisjoppa.com" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> which doesn't signify overt popularity. Your site has been up for 13 month. Your hit counter shows roughly 45,000 hits. That is about 3,000 hits a month...not notable or indicative of monster popularity. The resources given are small local papers with limited distribution about local people. That doesn't fit <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MySpace isn't considered media and therefore it doesn't assist in meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Additionally, it isn't an independent website showing your work because YOU put that work on MySpace.

<dd>Who said anything about media? You were talking earlier about awards/accolades. Again, please decide what the basis of your argument it before sending a response. Again, what you fail to understand, or chose not to, is that WE did not put our work on the featured page on MySpace, it was CHOSEN. There is a difference there, if you want to hear it. But, if you've got a personal problem with out site, then I can understand the use of "blinders." 24.128.101.14 19:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is the only way you could possibly try to use it. The criteria for awards state: <i>The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation</i>. That isn't by any stretch a well-known award. Nor is it independent because it for a myspace profile which YOU added to myspace. Another criteria is: <i>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>. That doesn't work either because YOU put up the MySpace profile, so therefore it isn't independent of you. The only option left is media, which MySpace isn't. Beyond all of this, arguing for the inclusion of an article about you violates <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The site has to be run independent of the creators, not the distributed material. "a site which is both well known and independent of the creators" not content that is independent of the creators.72.81.58.236 21:45, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but as MySpace is a place for individuals (or groups) to create their own independent profiles and put forth their own material. As such, a MySpace profile doesn't count as independent of Joppa. Therefore, MySpace is <i>not</i> an independent entity distributing Joppa material. They wouldn't be distributing Joppa material had Joppa not put that material on MySpace. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 22:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes it does. I'm saying that if the Godfather wasn't on the silver screen, but was simply a movie someone made, it wouldn't qualify for an Oscar, because it didn't appear in theaters. Joppa, without being a member of Myspace couldn't win the award it was presented. I hope that if you actually think about it for a second you will understand.72.81.58.236 00:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except for the fact that your comparison doesn't work. The Joppa MySpace thing would be closer to a movie that was filmed for HBO winning an award granted by HBO. In any case, the highlight <i>isn't</i> an award and beyond that it isn't <i>a well known and independent award</i> as required by <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It isn't a well known award because..well..it isn't an award. And it isn't independent because it is only for MySpace profiles of which Joppa created one. When you join an organization and then get an award from that organization, it isn't an independent award. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 00:18, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

By the logic you've used through this discussion, a website that had millions of hits but was never mentioned on another website/publication/etc shouldn't have a page. What? If it's measured on Alexa it gets included? There are much more important articles that require attention, run off there. Oh, and MySpace has something like a hundred million users, it's not an inconsequential site. To be highlighted on such a site is quite notable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatGatsby_4c96.html" title="User:GreatGatsby">GreatGatsby</a> 23:29, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I've missed all of this, I've actually been AWAY from a computer for a couple hours. Listen, the fact of the matter is this: You asked for proof, we've supplied it, and you continue to come back with empty, opinionated arguments. Just because what proves Joppa to be notable is, in your OPINIOIN, sources that are not notable, doesn't change the fact. It shows you've taken a personal interest in getting this page deleted, and that is against the Wiki guidelines. If you don't have any substantial evidence to unprove our well-documented sources of noteriety--BESIDES your opinion that these sources are NOT NOTABLE--then, please move on. You are in way over your head here. There are a number of registered users on this page who disagree with you, and in case you hadn't noticed, you are the ONLY one on this page who is optioning for deletion. I understand this isn't a vote, but you have to step back and ask yourself, "Am I just trying to win an argument here, or do I have substantial reasons for having this page deleted?" It's okay, we'll forgive you when this is all over. And, once again, I'm not being uncivil, I'm just trying to help you out. You can keep throwing the WP:CIV in my face all you want, but it really makes no difference to me. I'm not a registered user and don't plan to be, I didn't create this article on Joppa, and I have no opinion one way or another if you think I'm being uncivil. I'm much too busy. The fact is, we've proved noteriety. All we ask is that you disprove it without your personal opinions on whether or not MySpace or iTunes or major New England publications are notable. That's all. You can't just say, "I don't think they're notable." It doesn't work that way. That's not a rebuttal. Sorry. And, your views on MySpace are completely incorrect, and the Godfather comparison is right on. We didn't get the award from MySpace because our "profile" looked nice. We got it because of our original content on the page, which is just an extension of OUR OWN website. So, NO, it's not like HBO giving an award to and HBO movie. MySpace didn't produce our content. We did. And, if you want to split hairs, I refer again to the wikipedia literature, which you seem to have misinterpreted above. 24.61.157.174 04:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. By the way, for those not completely familiar with Wikipedia deletions, IrishGuy isn't going to be the one making the one making the final decision. As a general rule, nominators don't do the actual deletion of articles. The AfD is just waiting for an independent administrator to see that the <b>discussion is over</b> to come by and finalize the outcome of the discussion. That outcome most likely being <b>no consensus</b> or some other variety of keep. --<a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndlessVince_8ffe.html" title="User:EndlessVince">EndlessVince</a> 07:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, so IrishGuy does not have any real power? Good. I'm sure an unbiased source will see through his silly arguments and let the page exist. Joppa has been written about in local news media, an article is being written by national media, featured on itunes, and last but not least it has been touted on the #1 website in the world--a website completely unaffiliated with Joppa, mind you--as a featured comic sketch group. The notoriety is undisputable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.8.231.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.8.231.161_3368.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.8.231.161">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Incorrect. You <i>claim</i> that there have been interviews with larger publications, but you have provided exactly zero verifiable evidence to back up this claim. All you have is a local newspaper with a circulation of 8,000. You haven't received any awards.

<dd>Correct I was. We've explained the MySpace AWARD to you as well as the iTunes ACCOLADE. So, please, stop regurgitating inccorect observations. A correct observation would be that you've taken a personal interest in our group's demise, and that is against wikipedia guidelines. If your deletion request was based on actual proof, then there wouldn't be an issue here. But, since you've failed to provide that, and other registered members have, then I'm sorry, you have no argument besides your own opinion. And, I can't quite figure out what this "personal attack" business is all about. Anyone that's ready my posts can see that I've yet to "attack" you. Quite the opposite actually. This whole deletion process administered by yourself is a personal attack on us. Is it because we're not magicians?24.61.157.174 02:05, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, this doesn't violate <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. That guideline states: <i>In the past, because of some now rarely used browsers, technical considerations prompted a strong recommendation that articles be limited to a maximum of precisely 32 KB in size, since editing any article longer than that would cause severe problems. With the advent of the section editing feature, and the availability of upgrades for the affected browsers, this once hard and fast rule has been softened and many articles exist which are over 32 KB of total text. However, there are still good stylistic reasons why the main body of an article should not be unreasonably long, including readability issues, so article size is usually a consideration, though no longer a binding rule as it once was.</i> As this is no longer a rule and instead quite clearly refers to the body of an article, it has nothing to do with an AfD. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you just say MySpace isn't well-known?...that's what I thought. I think that about sums up the intelligence of all your arguments. Unless you respond with something original, and stop pointing fingers with your baseless "personal attack claims"--about the only thing you've been harping on the last few posts--then, I am done here. I've got more important things to do. Like run a notable comedy site. And don't get me wrong: I have not ONCE defended my own show. That is not my intention. If this were a discussion on whether or not Joppa was a good show, then I would have no right to respond, being the creator. This is a discussion on the rights of certain fans to publish an article on wikipedia--THAT is what I'm defending. Because it has to do with my show is a moot point. I would never tell someone they had to enjoy Joppa, because everyone is entitled their own opinion of art and other media. Much like IrishGuy's opinion that MySpace and iTunes are not popular establishments, or that certain newspapers are not-notable, yet others are. I respect those opinions of yours, but unfortunately, they don't really hold any ground in this discussion. If you were king, in order to have an article on wikipedia, we'd have to have made the front page of the New York Times. It's been a blast talking to you IG! Hope you've learned something. 24.61.157.174 03:29, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you serious? Myspace and Joppa are independent from each other... Just because I can get a driver's license in California (e.g. create a myspace page) does not mean I am affiliated with the state of California. Myspace is the #1 site on the internet, and the decisions of it's editors are de facto notable. Actually, the decisions of the number 1 site on the internet have more authority than those on Wikipedia, including minor editors. You can argue until you are blue in the face, but until you actually read the WP:WEP and Attack page--and understand it--there is no point in responding to your posts until you can be reasonable... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.32.75.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.32.75.196_b3ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.32.75.196">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>HAHA, seriously? By that logic the Screen Actors Guild Awards would not meet the independence criteria. If you have a hand in picking yourself for the award or recognition, then you are not independent; the myspace, joppa situation does not violate the independence notion despite joppa having a self created page. To all readers: make note of IrishGuy making more ignorant arguments, having a high propensity for logical fallacies, and being an all around dick. Congrats, I will give you the dick award of the week, but because I am apparently a member of wikipedia along with you, do not try to claim notoriety based on this award. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.7.83.114 (<a href="../../../7/5/2E/User_talk%7E75.7.83.114.html" title="User talk:75.7.83.114">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.7.83.114_9862.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.7.83.114">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>The profile was simply on Myspace because Joppa wanted to have a myspace account. They didn't create it for the sole purpose of recieving the award. Thus, if we say that Joppa isn't independent of Myspace as you do, then the award, not the organization, is independent. The site has to recive an independent award, not recieve it from a independent organization.72.81.58.236 19:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is good that they didn't create it for the purpose of winning an award...because they didn't win an award. And yes, the award must be both well known (the award, not the group presenting it) and it must be independent as well as awarded by an independent entity. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which it is, in the opion of members and non-members on this board, except you. So, thanks again for your opinion. And, trying to double-talk around the fact that Joppa is not independant of myspace is just stupid. You sound stupid, whilst trying to sound like you're making an argument. Joppa is no more connected with myspace than any filmmaker that submits their work to a film festival. Think before you type. And, IF YOU'VE GOT NOTHING NEW TO SAY, move along please. 24.61.157.174 13:57, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>comment</b> This article has now more than tripled the suggested size of articles on Wikipedia <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a> may they be AfD or otherwise, hindering the possible responses from other users. Please wrap up this conversation. Regurgitating facts simply takes up space.

<p>I agree with the above statement. As much as it may be tempting to shoot down another faulty, much repeated, rebuttal of our Irish Magician, it's just as well that we let him fizzle out, and move onto to bigger and better deletions--God knows he's got a bunch under his belt. There is no way he can win here today, you've proved it, and if we keep responding--I KNOW it's tempting--then this will keep going on. Let him fizzle. And, yes, the "Irish Magician" thing may have been a personal attack. So, there's not need to remind me. I am well aware. And, pointedly--don't give a shit.24.61.157.174</p>

<dd>First off, I'm not a magician. Sencond, repeatedly claiming that you have made a point doesn't change the fact that your site completely fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd>Actually, as I have repeatedly pointed out and clarified, this doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.A local paper about local people with a reach of 8,000 is trivial. It is also only one mention and the criteria outlines that <i>multiple non-trivial notices in the media</i> are required. You don't have those. Nor do you have a well-known award from an independent source. Ignoring this doesn't mean the point wasn't made. It simply means you are ignoring it. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 19:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We've proved it so many times it hurts my brain, but I do cherish your opinion. Now, I promise I'm done, unless you happen to supply us with another zinger I can't afford to let stand.

<p>Seriously, everyone, don't even bother. The article is in good hands. There's too many people on here (MEMBERS and otherwise) who know what's going on. In fact, of all the people here, there is...let me see....yes, ONE, who's a bit "confused." We know he's going to claim we're all sockpuppets because he can't stand defeat--but, anyone who has the means of checking, can certainly find out the truth--like I said, there are a number of wiki MEMBERS on here that have sided with KEEPING the article. Let's end it. There's nothing more to say. We've proved our sources, and he's just trying to lure us into further debate by repeating already settled arguments. IrishGuy's terrorism has gone on long enough. Goodbye. Seriously. Do NOT respond to him anymore.24.128.101.14 20:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great. That still doesn't equal 20 minutes. Not that it REALLY matters. Right now, it looks like your reaching for something to hold onto.

You have proven no degree of notability to save your <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity article</a>, which I think you know, and that is why you have resorted to petty personal attacks.

<dd>You're welcome. Honestly, I wish you better luck on your next deletion. And, please don't take credit away from the people that wrote this article by claiming I had anything to do with it. We've covered this ground much too much. And, no, those weren't "petty" attacks. They were pretty accurate attacks. You can't bully everyone, my friend. People don't like that. Be sure to watch the show when you get a chance! See you around.24.61.157.174 22:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
