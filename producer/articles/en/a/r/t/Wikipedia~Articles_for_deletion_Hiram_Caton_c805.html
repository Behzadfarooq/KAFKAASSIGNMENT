<dd>Perhaps you didn't look quite closely enough at WP:COI, which states that "there is no list of criteria to help editors determine what counts as a conflict of interest." Just because you didn't find a box to tick doesn't exonerate you. I find it very curious that when attempting to defend yourself, you take this very literalist approach, yet when presented with the solid proof that Caton's <i>The Politics of Progress</i> has been "the subject of multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources", and that in 1982-83 he "received a notable award or honor" (two boxes to tick against WP:PROF) you somehow appeal to a manufactured notion of "independent sources demonstrating notability", when WP:PROF calls for evidence of quite a different kind. Why the double standard? WP:PROF asks to be read literally, WP:COI specifically asks <i>not</i> to be read literally. Simply put, you've got it backwards.</dd>
<dd>Just as "if you are involved in a court case...you would find it very hard to demonstrate that what you wrote about another party to the case...was entirely objective" (WP:COI), so too <i>some</i> physicians would no doubt find it difficult to demonstrate that their motivation in calling for the deletion of an article about a man who's spent a sizable chunk of his professional career attacking their trade were entirely objective either. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.45.172.124 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.45.172.124.html" title="User talk:203.45.172.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.45.172.124_871c.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.45.172.124">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's incredibly disingenous of you to make assertions that there's no evidence for Caton's notability, citing WP:PROF, and then as soon as you're presented with <i>exactly</i> the evidence that you yourself have demanded, (a) you attempt to shift the goalposts of the discussion and (b) you're now going to take home your bat and ball rather than deal with the observation that that's what you've done. You've thrown around insinuations about others' COI based on "evidence" as flimsy as geography, yet cannot stomach the suggestion that you may have COI issues of your own here. Likewise, while at the same time as you're willing to put words into others' mouths, you attempt a lame linguistic slight-of-hand to avoid addressing the accusation of double-standards.</li>

<dd>It really doesn't matter whether or not you accept my observation that you are defending youself.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I'm well aware of WP:CIVIL and have studiously avoided making any kind of personal attack on you, as tempting as it's occasionally been. You, on the other hand, apparently have no such compunctions; first insinuating, and now practically alleging a COI. You also seem to believe that no-one could disagree with you so vehemently unless they were "taking this personally". Frankly, I find that position more than a little condescending.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you spelled out your reasoning at the very top; but that reasoning was based on the article as it originally stood, with - I'll freely admit - <i>no</i> evidence presented that Caton met the WP:PROF guidelines for notability. However, that evidence has been there for a couple of days now, and you have not altered your position. Which, you'll forgive me for saying, <i>does</i> seem to indicate that you've shifted the goalposts from the time you invoked WP:PROF.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> He is a full professor at Griffith, a major university. Full professors at universities are generally N, because they have survived several rounds of faculty peer review,. But it its not a major re3search university we don't necessarily assume they have published much, but in his case he has written several academic books.The book was reviewed in more than 20 professional journals.so even if there were doubt, the books and the reviews would be enough by all possible standards of N. PROF is just a guideline, but he meets it. He is N among other fields than AIDS dissidence, such as Mead/Derrick.&#160;::As the article says, he has written over 175 articles, mostly peer reviewed, and we accept official web sites for that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>All of the above are referenced in the article, sourced much more fully and competently than academic bios usually are. I cannot help wondering if it were not his positions of issues that was affecting the discussion here. Absurd positions do not make an academic less N--it could even be argued that they make him more so. I am not an australian, and I consider his position of AIDS not merely absurd, but dangerous. Doesn't make him less N, and the documentation holds up. Article does need to be trimmed a bit--it should quote his views instead of presenting them.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:04, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> requires that only <i>one</i> of the 6 criteria for notability be met. As for "independent sources demonstrating notability", you now have no fewer than 9 reviews of <i>The Politics of Progress</i> in peer-reviewed academic journals (you can verify all but one of these in JSTOR, if you care to). So, how does this still fail to meet WP:PROF 3.1 "The work must be the subject[1] of multiple, independent, non-trivial[2] reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources. "? Secondly, you now have independent verification (from the NHC itself) that Caton was indeed the receipient of a Fellowship there. WP:PROF 6 states "The person has received a notable award or honor". If you're not familiar with these fellowships, read our own article on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Humanities_Center_9556.html" title="National Humanities Center">National Humanities Center</a> to realise that the award of one is a Big Deal in humanities scholarship... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.45.172.124 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.45.172.124.html" title="User talk:203.45.172.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.45.172.124_871c.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.45.172.124">contribs</a>) 05:52, 24 February 2007.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that being a full Professor does not in general make you notable. However I think being a full Professor in Australia or UK does as it is a more restricted position than in the US and is more like the named or distinguished Professor in the US. Being a foundation Professor in a new university in Australia adds more to notability. BTW, Griffith University has a strong research focus although perhaps less so than the larger and older University of Queensland in Queensland. An earned D Litt requires extensive publications. It is awarded entirely on the basis of publications. He is quite clearly a notable professor. Let me add that I do not agree with him on AIDS and do not know him, but I do know the Australian academic system. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:38, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the article needs work but he appears notable in terms of publications as a start. Some of the sources are not strong though. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_foord_ef46.html" title="User:Paul foord">Paul foord</a> 03:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per Bduke. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:23, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Per Bduke, clearly passes wp:prof, internationally recognized. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 15:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, revised article shows notibility, and has verifiable data from reliable sources. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 22:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
