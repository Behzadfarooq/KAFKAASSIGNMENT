<p>I disagree. It is a highly notable blog in a variety of circles. Do I need to explain why the Alexa Traffic Rank is worthless, or can the esteemed editors of Wikipedia determine that for themselves? <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.65.223.142.html" title="User:71.65.223.142">71.65.223.142</a> 20:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. The point here is that there is insufficient information provided by other parties, that is, other than the blog itself. For example, nobody appeared to care to link to this blog <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> nor to talk about it <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;q=tangst+blog&amp;qt_s=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;q=tangst+blog&amp;qt_s=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It may become more notable in the future, but for now there shouldn't be an encyclopedia article about it. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 20:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The blog itself is only a half year old and doesn't actively advertise its presence since its a student-run community. However, the blog records 300-400 hits daily, and encompasses a large quantity of visitors from different geographic regions of the United States. From what I've seen, the article is worth keeping, due the the noteability the site receives in certain high school circles. And to Liberatore: you incorrectly cited Google for showing linked page statistics. You showed only a search of cached pages within the site. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Here's the link you probably meant</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but, maybe this article should be marked as a stub, or have a request for additional information placed on it? I think its a good history and description for the community it portrays, but it seems the complaint is primarily centered on a lack of neutrality or quantity of information. If this is the case, there are less drastic means that could be used, such as a "stub" marking or "neutrality" notice. <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.65.223.142.html" title="User:71.65.223.142">71.65.223.142</a> 21:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> but, like the others have said, as a stub. The blog is 5 months old. After a rocky start with one administrator doing everything, it's experienced increased growth in the past two months. Because it's community based, the growth stops and starts depending on current events in those areas. Obviously, neutrality is an issue. I'd bet that the creator of the article is an ardent fan of the site. By the way, there are a couple of sites that link to the blog, it's just that there aren't any notable sites that link to it.

<li>Withdrawing from the discussion, and apologising for using a mildly-stardardised template, which I have also removed. I was in the wrong to do so after reading the discussion up until the time I added the template, and noted directly above in my comments that the members of the tangst community posting here had not behaved as most people whose favourite site appears here for deletion would, and attempted to compliment them on their calm behaviour and well-though out reasonings. I was wrong. I am sorry. -- Saberwyn.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Um, wow. The lines are rather clear. Per policy, it seems pretty obvious that it shouldn't be an article, it doesn't met notability standards. Stub status I'm not that sure about. As the creator of the site (not the article), I'm starting to not care about the outcome, but I'm still terribly biased so I'm going to refrain from declaring. I just ask that <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calton.html" title="Calton">Calton</a> stop taking potshots at the supporters (mentioning how many edits someone does or doesn't have isn't valid - there are numerous ways to make thousands of edits without being accredited any, like getting a new computer, not bothering to get a Wiki account, or using different computers at the library). Looking at the history of this discussion, he tried to delete something, which I think isn't allowed per Wikipedia deletion policy. Am I right about that? I'm sorry if this is causing too much trouble. -- Heather Sit 06:34, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>A QUICK NOTE</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It looks like the article is pretty well gone, but just so I have my two cents: Apparently the editor who splashed the notice at the top of this discussion <b>did not read the link that they referenced</b> . If you <a href="http://tangst.blogspot.com/2006/01/oh-no-tangst-wikipedia-entry-is-up-for.html" class="external text" title="http://tangst.blogspot.com/2006/01/oh-no-tangst-wikipedia-entry-is-up-for.html" rel="nofollow">read the post on the Tangst blog</a>, and discussion that followed, you'll notice that it was well thought out, and not a call to "stuff the ballot box," as you <i>so eloquently</i> put it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's ok. Its the same deal with the Wikipedia editor who posted the links earlier about the site's popularity. <b>They simply didn't bother check their source.</b></dd>
</dl>

<dd>But hey, its Wikipedia, nobody has to have a <b>credible source</b>, right?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I thought this wasn't a <i>vote</i> Stifle. Are you proposing to change our minds with your comment in the discussion edits history?
