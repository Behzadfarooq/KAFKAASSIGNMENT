<li><b>Keep</b>, Jeremiah Evarts is quite notable in five different ways; it was an omission that we didn't have a page on him. He:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Was a leader in a movement to stop the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Removal_Act_2459.html" title="Indian Removal Act">Indian Removal Act</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> and the subsequent removal of the Cherokees from the South in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> (ask them if he is notable) and was the author of 24 essays about it.</p>
<p>2) Was the subject of a full, published book "Jeremiah Evarts, the Cherokee Nation, and the Search for the Soul of America" (1994, John A. Andrew III). His life was notable enough that a 400 page book about his life was published 160 years after he died. (It is not a bad book either, I'm half way through it.)</p>
<p>3) Was the object of his father's concern over the lack of educational institutions in Vermont which is credited with helping start the wheels in motion in the founding of a major, current U.S. college (Middlebury College). This is a significant event in Vermont state history.</p>
<p>4) Was the father of an U.S. Secretary of State (and through William's upbringing, undoubtedly influenced U.S. foreign policy). How can you understand an important political figure like Secretary of State William M. Evarts without understanding that his father was a political figure in indigenous people's rights. The policy debate of that era resonate to this day in the U.S. foreign policy relating to issues of indigenous people's rights, given the dozens of ongoing ethnic conflicts throughout the world and the U.S.'s relationship to each of the parties in these conflicts.</p>
<p>5) Was the editor of "The Panoplist", a religious newspaper in which he published over 200 essays.</p>
<p><br />
This article has considerably more detail than the one in the Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman article, so it is not redundant to that. The somewhat clunky form of another article does not have much bearing on the value of this one. If anything, having a page like this allows his entry on that page to be trimmed in size, since there is this other page.</p>
<p>I just added some more content to the article as well as some links. There are quite a few more aspects to add. In particular, a section detailing his leadership against Andrew Jackson's Indian removal policies should be added.</p>
<p>I'm fine with marking it as a stub, but don't delete it. The U.S. policies surrounding Indian removal are a significant topic in U.S. history. Jeremiah Evarts was a significant player in that struggle. It was an omission that he didn't have a page before. (Sorry, forgot to sign - I was the initial author of Jeremiah's page) <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> around 20:00, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Good article on notable person in public affairs in the 19th century. Well done to the anonymous person above. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 04:13, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. An ill-advised nomination for deletion. Evarts is mentioned in the first three books I pulled off of my shelf about American Indian affairs in the 1830s, including <i>Trail of Tears</i> by John Ehle. He also has an entry in the <i>Dictionary of American Biography.</i> Please note that "not notable" and "I've never heard of him" are not synonymous.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 04:27, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i><b>did not</b></i> base this on "I never heard of him" and I'm sick and tired of the bleeping personal attacks on people who list articles in good faith. I nominated him because, in the first place, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin%2C_Hoar_%26_Sherman_family_fcdc.html" title="Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family">Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family</a> is an absolute mess. And in the second place, I reviewed the article and felt that none of his accomplishments warrant an article. He was with his father when idea of creating <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlebury_College_8241.html" title="Middlebury College">Middlebury College</a> was first brought up? Woo freakin' hoo. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:10, May 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When you nominated the article for deletion, it contained the following sentence: "He was one of the leading opponents of the removal of the Cherokees from the Southeast." Even that little bit sounds noteworthy to me. Since biographies of historic American Indians and related people are probably covered less on Wikipedia than, say, fictional <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon.html" title="Digimon">Digimon</a> characters, it certainly seems questionable to propose deleting "the leading opponent of the removal of the Cherokees from the Southeast." --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 02:30, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is good feedback that my initial version of the article was badly written and that the current version still wasn't clear. I just reformatted it and added more detail to focus on the main acheivement of his life - his battle against <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_removal.html" title="Indian removal">Indian removal</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 19:40, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
