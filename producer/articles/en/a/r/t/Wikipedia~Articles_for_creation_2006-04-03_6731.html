<p>Jenius(dog) is the dog of Nathan Figueroa, slightly famous she is black with a white cross on her chest (now off center with age) and bright eyes. Extremly likable and very friendly, she is well liked by all who can get past her false gruff extirior (e.g. growling and barking at people until they pet her).</p>

<p>Buehler started playing <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_the_Gathering_c994.html" title="Magic: the Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> just before the Homelands set came out. After initially playing Magic with roomates at Carnegie Mellon University , Buehler gained a fierce interest in tournament level Magic. Many Pro Tour Qualifier and Grand Prix tournaments provided valuable experience that would lead to Buehler's first Pro Tour win (Pro Tour-Chicago 1997), which was also his first Pro Tour appearance.</p>
<p>While working on his Ph.D. in History and Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, Buehler's interest in school began to fade as his financial successes in Magic: the Gathering yielded a satisfactory lifestyle. Buehler therefore decided to take a two-year leave of absence from school to pursue his passion.</p>
<p>A favorite style of play for him has always been card drawing. His famous decks include CMU Blue and Draw Go. When he won Pro Tour-Chicago '97 he used a Necropotence deck.</p>
<p>He slowly gained the attention of Wizards of the Coast with his skill on the Magic Pro Tour and was eventually offered a position at Magic Research and Development as a developer. Before he could return to college from his two year leave, Buehler decided to take the job. As a developer, his responsibilites would include testing out cards before they were printed to adjust and tweak them for power level reasons and fainess.</p>

<p>When Buehler arrived at Magic R&amp;D, development for the Invasion set was just beginning. Since then, he has been a developper in almost every set. His first assignment as a lead developer was in the Odyssey set, and in the summer of 2001 Randy Buehler was promoted to the position of lead developer of all Magic.</p>
<p>On Friday, January 4, 2002, with "Unbreaking Transcendence" Randy Buehler initiated the popular Magicthegathering.com column "Latest Developments," where he writes about the hapennings of Magic on the development side of R&amp;D. On Friday, January 30, 2004 he announced that he would leave "Latest Developments" and be succeded by Arron Foresythe. His last Column was "Defining Black," on Friday, February 6, 2004. During his tenure on the weekly roster, he has been known to stray from the theme on column theme weeks for the web site.</p>
<p>Randy Buehler is also the color-commentator for the Magic Pro Tour webcasts, koined by co-hosts like Mike Flores, and is the roaming reporter for the Pro Tour podcasts, where he walks the grounds and provides exclusive interviews with pro players for listeners. He is known to use the phrase "fair enough" quite often.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, October 26, 2005, Randy Buehler announced the set Coldsnap, which would take the place of the Homelands set as the third set of the Ice Age block. The announcement was made to depict Coldsnap as a long-lost set, but <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rosewater_54b9.html" title="Mark Rosewater">Mark Rosewater</a> later stated that the "long-lost" story was supposed to be a joke, and was not meant to be taken as solid truth.</p>

<p>The <b>Australian miniature goat</b> is a unique little breed measuring up to 53.3cm (21") for adult females and 58.5cm (23") for adult males (AMGR). This breed was created by S. Ludwig in 1995 and was based on carefully selected genetically smaller feral goats in the effort to produce animals similar in height and type to the Nigerian dwarf goats commonly kept overseas. Small Cashmere and Angora goats are often used in miniature goat production too. A club was formed in February 2000 to unite breeders interested in creating and developing the breed and over the years standards have been set for four types within the Australian miniature goat breed. The <b>Mini-mancha</b>, have elf or gopher ears that should not exceed 5cm (2") in length, the <b>Pixie</b>, with medium sized rigid, upright ears (similar to the nigerian dwarf goat), the <b>Munchkin</b> (formerly Minikin), with short flat folded ears and the <b>Nuwby</b>, with long pendulous ears. All types are recognised in any colour and coat types range from short and sleek, to cashmere, or sheltie coat (long, non-shedding, evenly distributed). A Grading system is in place for the development of the breed and animals up to 63.5cm (25") are accepted for registration in the lower grades. The height is taken with a right angle measuring devise (with a spirit level), when the animal is three years of age (or older)and measurement is taken at the highest point of the wither with the animal standing in a relaxed position with it's head up. These intelligent little animals have wonderfully gentle natures and their smaller size makes them easier for all members of the family to train and handle. Australian miniature goats are predominantly kept and promoted as pets and some owners use the long hair types for spinning while some owners milk their goats, (who are surprisingly good little milkers). Milk is often used to make cheese and some people even use it to make goat milk soaps. It doesnt stop there, owners also collect manure (which is high in nitrogen) and use it for organic fertilizer while others use their goats to help control weeds.</p>
<p>Interest in this universal little goat is growing rapidly Australia wide with many new breeders keen to join the breeding program.</p>

<p>The <b>purple-spleened maple mole</b> (<i>Acerotalpus violetisplenus</i>) is an insectivorous <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">mammal</a> indigenous to <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikkim.html" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>.</p>
<p>This curious mole dwells in the branches of <a href="../../../m/a/p/Maple.html" title="Maple">maple</a> trees, and pulls <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutworm.html" title="Cutworm">cutworms</a> and <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphid.html" title="Aphid">aphids</a> from their leaves as a light snack. Occasionally it will literally go off on a limb and snab an entire <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butterfly.html" title="Butterfly">butterfly</a>. Many of these moles have been seen falling out of trees and breaking their joints in this way.</p>
<p>It hibernates all winter in a "feather pillow" made from the down of the Munster-patterned scaly-tailed pheasant. When spring arrives it emerges from its niche in the tree and gathers nests of sassafras and rattan. In summer the purple-spleened maple mole goes into a frenzied orgy of mating, exhibiting in its <a href="../../../l/e/k/Lek.html" title="Lek">lek</a> mating behavior that resembles <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshing.html" title="Moshing">moshing</a>. 1/3 of the males are fatally injured and wiped out this way. The survivors reproduce and create an ever-stronger breed of mole. In the studies of British naturalist Sir Adrian Linlithgow, it is projected that by 2134 this perpetuation of a stronger gene pool will have created a race of super-moles, with psychotic red eyes and laser speed.</p>
<p>This species is often confused with the green-spleened maple mole (<i>Acerotalpus verdisplenus</i>), and the differences can only be determined, short of performing a laparoscopy and viewing the <a href="../../../s/p/l/Spleen.html" title="Spleen">spleen</a>, by examining intensely the minutiae of the hairs on the females' <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mons_pubis.html" title="Mons pubis">mons pubis</a> or males' <a href="../../../p/u/b/Pubes.html" title="Pubes">pubes</a>. Both the purple- and green-spleened species are becoming increasingly rare due to capturing as pets and use in the sport of molefighting.</p>

<p>[[The Winchester Model 71 was a lever action rifle introduced in 1936 and discontinued in 1958. It was chambered in the now almost-obselete .348 Winchester round. The rifle and cartridge were very effective against any North American big game in heavy timber, including the great bears, if using the .250 grain bullet. It was once very popular for hunting in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>.</p>
<p>CARTRIDGES OF THE WORLD remarks that factory ammunition was available in 150, 200 and 250 grain weights. Only the 200 grain weight is still available in factory ammunition.</p>
<p>Browning made clones of this rifle in the 1980s. The <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester.html" title="Winchester">Winchester</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browning.html" title="Browning">Browning</a> versions showed very high degrees of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ecomomics caused the rifle to be very expensive, and with less expensive lever action rifles in the <a href="../../../2E/4/4/.444_Marlin_7a6e.html" title=".444 Marlin">.444 Marlin</a> and 45-70 rounds, the .348 is destined to oblivion. Oddly enough, the .45-70 was born in 1873 and has far outlasted the .348. The .348 was also the only 34 caliber cartridge ever made by an American manufacturer, making it a little problematic for handloaders, as there was never a wide selection of 34 caliber bullets.]]</p>

<p>'Lactobacillus sporogenes' is a bacterial 'name' often encountered on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probiotic.html" title="Probiotic">probiotic</a> or health products. It is also designated as a 'sporeforming lactic acid bacterium'. By definition, lactic acid bacteria (<a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactobacillus.html" title="Lactobacillus">Lactobacillus</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/f/Bifidobacterium.html" title="Bifidobacterium">Bifidobacterium</a>) do not form spores.</p>
<p>This bacteria does not exist and thus there are no health promoting effects. The official name of this bacterium is Bacillus coagulans. The name was changed in 1937 (!).</p>
<p>There are no health effects described in scientific literature of Bacillus coagulans in humans.</p>
<p>Bacillus coagulans is a soil organism, which can not be freely added to health products, due to possible toxic/pathogenic effects. The producing company of this bacterium uses the old name to avoid all legal restrictions. Lactobacillus species are in many countries regarded as safe to be added to food (USA : <a href="../../../g/r/a/GRAS_41b8.html" title="GRAS">GRAS</a> status granted by the <a href="../../../f/d/a/FDA_274c.html" title="FDA">FDA</a>).

<p>Constructive waves are flat waves which spill onto gently sloping beaches.Each wave is low. As the wave breaks,it carries material up the beach in its swash. The gentle slope slows the wave’s forward momentum. The beach material will then be deposited as the backwash soaks into the sand or slowly drains away. These waves are most common in summer.</p>

<p>Then assigned to <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort.html" title="Escort">escort</a> duty in the area of Women's Bay and <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodiak%2C_Alaska_afe0.html" title="Kodiak, Alaska">Kodiak, Alaska</a>, she was later ordered to escort duty between <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Spencer_3a2d.html" title="Cape Spencer">Cape Spencer</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Harbor%2C_Alaska_4a73.html" title="Dutch Harbor, Alaska">Dutch Harbor, Alaska</a>, as well as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft.html" title="Anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> and escort patrol off Dutch Harbor.</p>
<p>When the Navy learned that the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> planned a thrust into <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaskan</a> waters as part of their <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midway.html" title="Midway">Midway</a> operation, <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_W._Nimitz_67aa.html" title="Chester W. Nimitz">Nimitz</a> allocated five <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruisers</a>, fourteen <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a>, six <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarines</a>, and suitable auxiliaries to deal with this menace in the North. Five years before the outbreak of war the area had been virtually undefended. But by September 1941, <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitka.html" title="Sitka">Sitka</a>, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor had been commissioned as <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Air_Station_d414.html" title="Naval Air Station">Naval Air Stations</a>, and both Kodiak and Sitka were able to service submarines. In mid-1940, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">Army</a> had established the Alaskan Defense Command, with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_General_8b0d.html" title="Brigadier General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Bolivar_Buckner_efc9.html" title="Simon Bolivar Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a> in command. The Navy created an Alaskan Sector under the 13th Naval District and appointed <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a> R. C. Parker to the command.</p>
<p>As headquarters and flagship, Captain Parker used the gunboat <i>Charleston</i> (PG-51). Additionally, three small <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing_boat.html" title="Fishing boat">fishing boats</a>, converted to patrol craft, formed the nucleus of the "Alaskan Navy." <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">Commander</a> Charles E. ("Squeaky") Anderson, <a href="../../../u/s/n/USNR_d471.html" title="USNR">USNR</a>, a "local character of infinite resource, energy, and cunning," controlled the craft.</p>
<p>By May 1942, Captain Parker commanded two old destroyers, two Coast Guard cutters, one of which was <i>Onondaga</i>, a few more converted fishing boats, and ten <a href="../../../p/b/y/PBY_7022.html" title="PBY">PBY</a>'s. <i>Char1eston</i> alone possessed sonar, or guns larger than three inch. She, together with the destroyers and cutters, saw constant use as escorts for the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freighter.html" title="Freighter">freighters</a> that brought workers and material to the new bases and airfields, none of which were complete at this time.</p>
<p>Toward the end of May, when the Japanese sent one task force towards Midway and another towards the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleutians.html" title="Aleutians">Aleutians</a>, tension quickened everywhere. <a href="../../../r/e/a/Rear_Admiral_ba9d.html" title="Rear Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Theobald_a577.html" title="Robert A. Theobald">Robert A. Theobald</a>, USN, Commander North Pacific Force, who had been headquartered at Kodiak through the early part of May, put to sea on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">1 June</a> in <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Nashville_%28CL-43%29_a4a1.html" title="USS Nashville (CL-43)"><i>Nashville</i></a> (CL-43) and rendezvoused with his augmented cruiser task force to thwart the Japanese Alaska venture. However, "Efforts to meet the enemy," writes Willoughby "were unavailing, and there was no fleet action in Alaskan waters."</p>
<p>Cutter <i>Onondaga</i>, with <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Commander_7c33.html" title="Lieutenant Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> S. P. Mehlman, USCG, in command, and the other patrol craft formed the Surface Search Group of this Northern Pacific Force. They were to be assisted by the Air Search Group, composed of twenty PBYs and one <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-17_Flying_Fortress_15c9.html" title="B-17 Flying Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>. Together these forces were to act as <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picket.html" title="Picket">pickets</a> to signal any Japanese approach.</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese sought to capture nothing east of Adak, which is nearly five hundred miles from Dutch Harbor. No Japanese plan for invading the Alaskan mainland, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, or the United States existed. The Aleutian section of the Midway operation was essentially defensive, although also diversionary. Its object was to prevent a U. S. invasion of Japan.</p>
<p>American search flights commenced about <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">28 May</a>, and twenty cutters and converted fishing craft deployed as pickets on both the Pacific and Bering Sea approaches to Dutch Harbor. In view of his expectation of an attack on Dutch Harbor, Admiral Theobald's operating area south of Kodiak was well chosen. But because he guessed incorrectly, the main body of his cruiser task force was removed from the scene of action.</p>
<p>Japanese <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">carrier</a> planes launched two attacks against Dutch Harbor on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">3 June</a>, inflicting considerable damage and killing about twenty-five American soldiers and sailors. Cutter <i>Onondaga</i> and destroyers <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_King_%28DD-242%29_310e.html" title="USS King (DD-242)">King</a> (DD-242) and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Talbot_%28APD-7%29_7851.html" title="USS Talbot (APD-7)"><i>Talbot</i></a> (APD-7), seaplane tender <i>Gillis</i> (AVD-17), army transports <i>President Fillmore</i> and <i>Morlen</i>, and submarine USS S-27 (SS-132)|<i>S-27</i>]] went to general quarters and made haste to get underway and stand out to sea, but none cleared the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbor.html" title="Harbor">harbor</a> until the attack was over. One Japanese plane was shot down.</p>
<p>The next day, another Japanese carrier-based attack was launched against Dutch Harbor. About eighteen more Americans died in this attack, but at least five Japanese aircraft were shot down. The Aleutian part of the Midway operation ended in mid-June. The Japanese occupied <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attu.html" title="Attu">Attu</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiska.html" title="Kiska">Kiska</a>, two islands of little except nuisance value. A phase began on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a> which witnessed Japanese attempts to hold what they had, while the American forces prepared to blast them out.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Aleutian battle was a contest of air power, as was Midway. <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather.html" title="Weather">Weather</a> consistently aided the offensive by shrouding ships in protective mist, while sweeping land targets clear. In May <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, Attu was in American hands, and on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a> U.S. Forces found that the Japanese had completely abandoned Kiska.</p>
<p>Cutter <i>Onondaga</i> and the other ships assigned to the Northern Pacific Force remained on patrol in northern waters through the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">the war</a>. She returned to the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasury_Department_3ae5.html" title="Treasury Department">Treasury Department</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, and resumed patrol duties out of Astoria. <i>Onondaga</i> was decommisioned on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">24 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, she was sold on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">7 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> to Foss Launch and Tug Company of Seattle, Washington.</p>

<p>Honors has a long history at UNCG. Beginning in the late 1940s, special programs for high achieving seniors and later freshmen were established. Then in 1962 with the support of a Ford Foundation grant, the Honors Program was established in the College of Arts and Sciences. With the University's growth and with the ever more global environment that its graduates were facing after graduation, it was clear that the Honors Program needed to expand and improve to continue to offer its students the best in undergraduate education. As a result, the Honors Program was transformed in 2005 into the International Honors College, a separate academic unit to better serve students throughout the Univerity. In 2006, as a result of a generous gift from Ms. Rebecca Lloyd, an alumna of UNCG, the College was renamed the Aubrey Paul &amp; Georgia Garrison Lloyd International Honors College in honor of Ms. Lloyd's parents. Lloyd International Honors College believes that all undergraduate students, regardless of their major, should have a strong liberal education foundation, and that in today's world that necessarily means the inclusion of international and global dimensions throughout the curriculum.</p>

<p>Lloyd International Honors College offers three Honors academic programs for all majors at UNCG:</p>
<ul>
<li>General-Education Honors Program - This program enhances a student's general education studies. Requirements include the replacement of regular general education courses with Honors general education courses, a second language (ancient or sign languages are possible), and an international experience. Honors courses are generally restricted to no more than 20-25 students and are often interdisciplinary. In keeping with the philosophy that all students should have a strong liberal education foundation that incorporates international and global dimensions, most Honors courses have international and global dimensions integrated into them.</li>
<li>Disciplinary Honors Program - This program enhances a student's work in their major. Students work closely with their professors to enhance course work in the major. The programm culminates in a Senior Honors Project, an independent research or creative project under the supervision of a professor.</li>
<li>Full University Honors Program - This program is for students who wish to enhance their entire undergraduate career at UNCG. To earn Full University Honors, students must complete both the General-Education Honors Program and the Disciplinary Honors Program.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-03_6731.html" title="Edit section: Wireless Speakers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wireless Speakers</span></h2>
<p>Wireless speakers are like normal loudspeakers, but instead of using a cable to transmit the electronic signals carrying the sound information, the signals are transmitted by means of radio frequency (RF) waves.</p>
<p>Wireless speakers consist of a main unit which consists of the loudspeaker and an RF receiver and a secondary unit which contains the transmitter of the RF signals. The transmitter is connected to the audio output of any audio devices like hi-fi equipment, TV’s etc. An RCA plug is normally used to achieve this. The receiver is positioned where the listener wants the sound to be, giving the listener the freedom to move the wireless speakers around without the need of using cables. The receiver unit normally contains an amplifier to amplify the audio signal to the loudspeaker and it needs to be powered by batteries or an electrical outlet.</p>
<p>The frequency range that is used by wireless speakers is normally the same range that is used by cordless telephones which is about 900 MHz. The signal can travel through walls and some manufacturers claims that the range in which the signal is transmitted can be up to 300 feet in radius. Most wireless speakers have a tuning knob to change the frequency that is transmitted by the transmitter to overcome possible interference with other wireless devices like cordless telephones or baby monitors.</p>
<p>There are several different types of wireless speakers which are designed for specific needs. There are stereo speakers that can be positioned inside the house and there are wireless speakers designed specifically for outdoor use. These wireless outdoor speakers are equipped with a robust casing and their manufacturers claimed that they are weatherproof.</p>
<p>Wireless speakers receive a lot of critique, because of RF interferences with other equipment like cordless telephones and of the poor sound quality some of the models delivers. Despite of the critique, wireless speakers are still very popular amongst consumers and the number of models available on the market is still growing.</p>

<p>stugots, stugats: the name of Tony Sopranos boat means "this dick" in English. And not only that, it's southern Italian dialect. The original term is 'STU CAZZO; 'stu means "this" as in "questo". Cazzo means prick. So taken together it's obscene. Believe it or not, it goes from QUESTO CAZZO in standard Italian to 'STUGOTS in southern Italian-American Brooklynese</p>

<p>Resource use by previous generations should not exceed a level that would prevent future generations from achieving a level of well-being at least as great. This definition of sustainability is fulfilled if the total capital stock (natural capital plus physical capital) does not decline. Think of it as a savings account. A person could live off the interest as long as the prinicple is not touched. Once the priciple starts to decline the the overall well-being of future generations is compromised leading eventually to the exhaustion of that rescource.</p>

<p>José Angel Gutierrez is a lecturer at the University of Texas who is known for his racist views against whites. He is the founder of La Raza Unida which means the United Race, race here referring to hispanic peoples and especially Mexicans. A typical quote by Gutierrez: "We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him." Although he allegedly says things typical of an emotionally and intellectually immature person, he is nevertheless ironically allowed to teach at a university.</p>
