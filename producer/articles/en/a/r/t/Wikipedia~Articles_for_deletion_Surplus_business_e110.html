<li><b>Comment</b> Hello, I am the second contributor to this article. I contributed what I thought was a lot of objective, informatiive, factual information to an article that already existed before I added to it. It was very vague, and I tried to expand on it. All of the links I added were from/to companies and articles directly related to the industrial "surplus business". I am in fact employed by Radwell International, so I want to be very honest here. I added one line mentioning Radwell, and would gladly strip it out since I now see that the spam policy is understandibly very rigid. Addionally, I can add more content about other examples -- commercial and consumer venues -- relating to the topic since I have done a lot of research on the surplus topic, work in the field and have quite a bit of knowlege that readers can learn from. If there are no votes to let the article stand, then the jury has spoken and all is fair. Thanks for reading my explanation. I am a new user, and I would be glad to elaborate further if you'd like. -<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Radwell_47eb.html" title="User:Brian Radwell">Brian Radwell</a> 2:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Possible Resolution</b> - The direction this AfD was going, my best bet on the outcome would be: 1.) Not only delete, but 2.) Further action such as a <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">noticeboard</a> report, with all the bells and whistles due for the <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>.

I want to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> here. Brian Radwell, you help us clean up the articles affected? I believe you are here in good faith as you are participating in this. Therefore, lets work together and clean this up. If you have any questions, I might be able to help, but I am no expert on editing, trust me.

<li>This article seems to present useful information, although I'd lose the links to Brian's own firm. I don't quite see the relevance of the hand held scanner image to the article but this seems a good faith effort to have an article on a topic. It needs cleanup, but <b>Keep</b>. I would ask those suggesting delete to relate where this material can be found instead, because the material is encyclopedic in my view. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "Radwell" has been stripped in the text body. I have kept the link to the Radwell URL as an article Source... I believe Wiki policy allows for a link to a Source?

<dd>Looking into the history of this page I see that the post from "Brian Radwell" 11:30, 8 Sept 2006, was added by 12.107.75.162. After looking at the edits from that ip I see that at the same time he is "thanking" us for deleting his spam he has been adding it back anonymously to some of the same articles he defaced in the first place. This person has admitted that Brian Radwell isn't his name and is actually the name of the owner of the company.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 16:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - "I added NO spam at the same time I was thanking anyone for assisting me since <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunglecat_ec45.html" title="User:Junglecat"><font color="green">JungleCat</font></a> offered assistance and guided me as to how to remedy this situation. It is an incorrect statement to say I was spamming at the same time or since Junglecat post. The entire post by Crunchy Numbers is not factual. Additionally, I have never said my name is Brian Radwell, and it is not. Brian Radwell is the President/CEO of the company, not me. I have not breeched my integrity in any post. I have to say that this is a real drag on adding anything of substance to this site. .<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 16:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC) needs to look at history more carefully. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Radwell_47eb.html" title="User:Brian Radwell">Brian Radwell</a> 3:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC).
