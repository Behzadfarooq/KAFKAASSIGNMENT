<dd>Okay, but that's not what this list <i>is</i> in its entrirety. Zappa has an extensive filmography which is scarcely referenced in his main article, for instance. I agree, it's not noteworthy every time a garage band namechecks Zappa in a song, but that's an argument for editing and sourcing the article, <i>not</i> for deleting it. <a href="../../../o/b/t/User%7EObtuseAngle_4728.html" title="User:ObtuseAngle">ObtuseAngle</a> 20:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Like any artist, his TV/film appearances would go into his filmography, which doesn't exactly belong in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_discography_2a74.html" title="Frank Zappa discography">Frank Zappa discography</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> (length issue). Note that these appearances are not mere cultural references but directly relevant to the man himself, and should be considered separately from this article. If delete, merge it somewhere. All those species and other things named after him are notable; they didn't just name those things after him so the information could be hidden. If delete, merge this last section into <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>. The song references do need explanations and sources, but each reference is important and non-trivial - how easy would it be to confuse a reference to Frank Zappa for some odd coincidence? This list is quite discriminate; it has a clear scope and will not achieve unmaintainable size. If you cut out the supposedly "trivial" references, then it becomes too discriminate in a POV way. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 19:36, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is not a filmography. If it were a properly sourced filmography I would have no issue with it. This is a collection of every reference to the man bunged together.

<li>I would say that a collection of every reference to this particular man is quite an encyclopedic subject.

People will disagree with you ... deal with it (and move on). I know you have valid reasons for not doing a bulk nomination, but when you nominate articles separately, each will be considered on its own merits.

<li><b>Keep</b> failing that a selective <b>merge</b>. Some of the information is useful enough to be worked into the main <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> article; like films he has made cameo appearances in, however, films where his music has merely been in the background do not deserve a mention. Some of the stuff in the comic strip section is notable, but it does need references. I don't find the "In songs" section notable, but the "Things named after Zappa" section is indeed very notable - there's not a lot of people that can say several animals, among other things, have been named after them, though some of what's listed needs refs. <a href="../../../h/k/5/User%7EHK51_2d75.html" title="User:HK51"><b>ĤĶ</b><i>51</i>→</a><sup><a href="../../../h/k/5/User_talk%7EHK51_1c98.html" title="User talk:HK51">Łalk</a></sup> 20:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
