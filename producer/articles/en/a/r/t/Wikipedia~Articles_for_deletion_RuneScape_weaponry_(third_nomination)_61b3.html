<li><b>Weak keep or smerge into main article</b>. This article was nominated for deletion about 2 months ago, and it appears they have worked very hard to try to make it less of a game guide since then. I was very surprised that it wasn't pure fancruft, after reading it.

<li><b>KEEP!</b> This article is extremely useful for any RuneScape user, I myself being one, and since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for everyone, you just make articles that reference to everyone - even though you may have a different oppinion on the game, leave the article here because it is not about the game, it's for the users of the game, if you don't like the game leave the article here, because it will be most likely re-written, and as you can see there was a lot of time and effort put into this guide.

<li>I didn't ask if you would support their deletion. My point is that they haven't been deleted, so you can claim no such precedent.

<li>Except that the precedence that you're citing is for game mechanics, not lists of game items. Your precedence does not directly counter the precedence that I've cited.

There have been many weapon lists deleted of late, and this is no different. <i>None</i> of these weapons scream notability at me. Having interesting names and strange powers does not make them notable outside the fanbase. As amazing as an axe with +20% damage is to a RuneScape player, to anyone else it's just a flippin' axe. If the axe played the Star Wars theme when swung or something, yes, then I could say it's notable.

<li>I say <b>Rewrite</b>, then keep on its own page or merge into <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_combat_56e7.html" title="RuneScape combat">RuneScape combat</a>, depending upon the resulting length. However, as a part of the combat article (which itself could be merged or turned into a RuneScape gameplay article), it will keep the article count down. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainVindaloo_b7ba.html" title="User:CaptainVindaloo">CaptainVindaloo</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainVindaloo_30b8.html" title="User talk:CaptainVindaloo">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaptainVindaloo_0228.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaptainVindaloo">c</a> <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CaptainVindaloo_40b4.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CaptainVindaloo">e</a></sup> 00:19, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, entire article is complete fancruft. For example the article goes into complete detail of special attack modes of something called a "Seercull bow", not encyclopedic -- <a href="../../../c/o/a/User%7ECoasttocoast_8512.html" title="User:Coasttocoast">Coasttocoast</a> 05:12, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unsalvageable, being an indiscriminate collection of information and for missing the point completely. Instead of fitting the weapons available in RS into some sort of context, this article merely lists some of them in such a way as to bore readers to tears or confuse them with impenetrable RS gabble. Most of the relevant information has already been ported to the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_armour_2013.html" title="RuneScape armour">RuneScape armour</a> article, in preperation for a renaming to RuneScape equipment or something of the like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst that article is neither perfect nor complete, at least the information therein is organized in a way which might actually mean something to someone who doesn't log into RS on a regular basis. The weaponry article gives undue space to weapons which are scarcely used in RS because of the way the combat system is geared. Entire classes of weapons such as claws, warhammers and shortswords are redundant because they are either too slow in attack rate or do not offer the same damage potential of others. Devoting paragraphs of text to items which the vast majority of the game's players wouldn't touch with a bargepole seems to be slapping information into the article for the sake of it.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of edits continue to happen because the article is not set out as a WP article and the emphasis is on indiscriminate listing instead of actually giving information to non-players. Despite protestations that the article is undergoing clean-up (and I had a darned good go myself at one point), the article is still a mess and would need rewriting from the ground up (with most text deleted) in order to go anywhere. The armour article is there for improvement, I suggest this problematic fifth wheel is removed and put back in the trunk where it belongs. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
