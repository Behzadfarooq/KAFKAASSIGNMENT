<li><b>Comment</b> It appears that since this person died in the 1930's, there aren't going to be alot of web resources on him and I'm guessing the sources of this article have come from books. But I did add one web source from Today's Outlook Magazine, a middle eastern magazine. It might not confirm everything in the article, but it does verifiy notability <a href="http://www.todaysoutlook.com/lebanese/archive/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.todaysoutlook.com/lebanese/archive/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 03:15, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In science, not everyone is going to invent the wheel or the computer. Science is <u>always</u> a collaborative effort. And innovation always uses elements of previous innovations. For instance, this inventor created components that eventually evolved into the television (you'll notice there is no definitive "inventor of the television") Putting aside all the porn stars on Wikipedia, I think these things are not only extremely notable, but important. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 19:33, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody is saying that those points of the article are currently unsourced, but I strongly disagree that this scientist biography is unsourceable and that the editors made this person and his achievements up.

Marking for cleanup, waiting to get improvement and then nominating for AfD when it has not improved.

<dd>As requested by Oakshade, I've had another look at the entry. If all that is mentioned is true (and I can't be sure from the article) then this guy definitely deserves an entry just for his shear work. If the article can substantiate that "The original solar cell was invented and tested by Mr. Al-sabbah in 1930", even with a patent number, then there's no question about keeping the entry. However, I couldn't find him in google (was the internet invented in 1930?).--<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 00:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Note to Closing Administrator</b> A couple of days after this AfD began, a user deleted a majority of the content in this article citing that it wasn't sourced. It was correct to insert a r&amp;s prod but totally inappropriate to delete during an AfD as it could unduly influence editors opinions. In case the user deletes again, here is the full version -&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hassan_Kamel_Al-Sabbah&amp;oldid=86828132" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hassan_Kamel_Al-Sabbah&amp;oldid=86828132" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 23:53, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Clearly, it will surprise Oakshade to learn that editing articles under AfD is <b>encouraged</b>. Since removing the unsourced exaggerations means the article is <i>less</i> likely to be deleted, I don't see his beef. The hyperbole about the inventions still has no sources; some of the claims therein are patently (as it were) false . <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 05:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The purpose of AfD's is not to improve articles; but to decide whether they <b>can</b> be improved.

<li><b>Major Verification Update</b> Is everyone sitting down? Well, after checking the US Patent website, I found nothing under "Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah" or even "Al-Sabbah". But I got suspicious about the highly Anglofied nature of the US in the early 20th century and did a search of just "Sabbah" and found a TON of patents in the 1920's and 1930's by "Camil Sabbah" or "C. A. Sabbah" all related to electric currents and television transmission!!
