<dd>I question the inclusion of this article. The SAB is <i>somewhat</i> known in online atheist communities (I'm a regular at alt.atheism on Usenet by the way) and you find a number Google hits but it's still something of a "local" phenomena. It's not all that well regarded and <b>certainly</b> isn't viewed as a scholarly work. The SAB is already cited at <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> and, I think, that's sufficient for a non-peer reviewed, purely web phenomena. The traffic in Alexa isn't terribly high and the discussion forum at SAB has attracted only about 480 users. If somebody wanted to take a crack at it (I'll pass), it <i>might</i> be worth merging into an article of "contemporary" online Biblical criticism works but I just can't--myself--see it having its own article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Seems like small potatos and not particulary scholarly. A mention in <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">inerrancy</a> seems more than enough. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 05:19, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Whether or not it's fantastic scholarship, this book gets over 100,000 Google hits. Looking at the talk page and history it's pretty clear that this article is the victim of more nonsense from Jason Gastrich. The proper solution is page protection. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:55, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>. I remember coming across this years and years ago and reading a fair chunk of it, but I can't remember any mention of it in the past few years (probably because I stopped reading philosophical debates on forums back in high school). The atheist in me wants to keep it as a notable atheist website based on that, though. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 06:02, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. SAB comes up regularly in online discussion of Christianity - most people with an interest in biblical errors/inerrancy arguments will have heard of it, I think. It's scholarship is shoddy, but that isn't a reason for deletion of the article about it. I don't think it is fair to describe it as a vanity page, either - there is no evidence that the site author wrote the article, and a variety of people have been editing it back and forth. SAB is 'cited' at <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> only as one of about forty links at the bottom of an already-long article. It merits it's own page<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> 07:52, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> The writer of the SAB is entitled to his point of view. We are entitled to know that the SAB exists. p.s. anyone who creates or uses such a ridiculous word as 'inerrancy'is just unable to communicate. 82.38.97.206 mikeL</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Never really thought about its notability before, but I've used it plenty of times. And &lt;<a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathon_Ross_524a.html" title="Jonathon Ross">Jonathon Ross</a> voice&gt; can we have a big welcome back to Mr Jason Gastwich?&lt;/Jonathon Ross voice&gt; --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:16, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, just in case there's confusion, I'm an atheist, a known regular of alt.atheism, the host of the alt-atheism.org website, and Gastrich thinks I'm in some "conspiracy" to wipe Christianity off the Internet or something equally silly. I'm seriously questioning whether the SAB is notable enough to have a separate article of it's own. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Comment</b> Just in case there's confusion, I wasn't suggesting that <i>you</i> were Jason Gastrich, just that (per Durova's comments) his cold hand seems to be resting on AfD's shoulders again. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 16:52, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Except it's not even that. Actually, it came out of a question by another user--who is definitely not Gastrich--of whether the SAB is notable enough to have a page and my own attempt to <b>defend</b> the SAB sounded pretty weak in my own ears. Even with my own personal bias of being an atheist I couldn't come up with much to defend the SAB having an article of its own. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K. Bilbo</a> 17:40, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me try a defense: I have voted for inclusion on articles of much lesser notability, whether or not I liked the concept embodied. 100,000 Google hits is a very large number. I don't believe we're in any danger of lowering the bar here to include all books. This one happens to be widely read and widely commented upon. Someone who has heard of it might well look to Wikipedia as a source of information. The article can list the book's strengths and weaknesses in a nonbiased manner. Given the subject, few other well known sources can be counted upon for neutrality. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 19:11, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Interesting. In six or seven years of being one of the loud mouths on alt.atheism and running generally amok in the online atheist community, I've rarely seen a reference to it. In fact, the most attention I can recall being paid to it comes from Gastrich (who seems quite obsessed with it). I just still can't see it having its own article. It's already cited in <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy.html" title="Inerrancy">Inerrancy</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alleged_inconsistencies_in_the_Bible_bc4e.html" title="Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible">Alleged_inconsistencies_in_the_Bible</a> (maybe some other places I'm not aware of). That seems about right to me. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K. Bilbo</a> 23:52, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Historical importance</i>? On what grounds? Would you care to cite some world events that have been shaped by the Skeptic's Annotated Bible?

<li><b>Weak delete</b>/<b>merge</b>. Nothing against the subject-matter as such, but I'm not sure why it deserves an article of its own.

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's possible, almost certain, that the SAB is more notable than any rebuttal of it. But if it's worth mentioning that people have written rebuttals, then it's worth mentioning the rebuttals.

It's worth mentioning rebuttals exist, but to specifically mention any rebuttal means that the rebuttal has to be notable enough. If this article is kept, we need a way to decide which rebuttals are worth specific mention and which would be covered by the sentence <i>"The website has particularly riled <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_fundamentalists.html" title="Christian fundamentalists">Christian fundamentalists</a> who believe in the <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inerrancy_of_the_Bible_6916.html" title="Inerrancy of the Bible">inerrancy of the Bible</a>, and some have responded with <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetics</a>."</i> Most of the alleged rebuttals are covered by that one sentence.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvestdancer_474b.html" title="User:Harvestdancer">Harvestdancer</a> 15:34, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
