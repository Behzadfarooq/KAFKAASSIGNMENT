<p>I see that all his works are "self-published". No claim to fame other than poetry and being an "activist". I did a google and most hits were unrelated people with the same name. Many of "What links here" appear to have been going for another person of the same name. Having self-published works does not make one notable. Thus, <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 19:30, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't have to be the same person.

<li><b>Comment</b>. According to what links here and my recollection, Matthew Charlton was the leader of the Federal <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> in the 1920's and was Federal Leader of the Opposition in Australia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have looked at the Australian Dictionary of Biography entry for Charlton the ALP politician which lists him as being Matthew Charlton. Ross McMullin's book on the history of the Labor Party refers to him as Matt Charlton. If the aspiring poet gets deleted, I would propose moving the Mathew Charlton article to Matthew Charlton. If we decide that the poet is notable, then Matthew Charlton should be a disambiguation article with entries for Matthew Charlton (politician) and Matthew Charlton (poet). <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 06:59, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although whoever wrote this article didn't have complete information and did a half-ass job, I'll vouch for Matt. He's an important part of the queer community in his writing, poetry and art here in the city of Toronto. I'm a social worker who loves poetry and I have worked with Matthew before. He has won a few awards even here in Toronto for his poetry and speeches. He was reviewed in Word too many years back to note on the web and has been quite involved in the small press community in Toronto. His collection "The Cosmology of Love" has been read and even discussed at science fiction conventions. I believe Robert Charles Wilson has openly acclaimed Matthew's work. I wouldn't presume that just because a person doesn't have an instantaneously strong online presence that he/she is not notable. <small>(Unsigned vote by Apoetical (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Apoetical_bb85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Apoetical">contribs</a>), user's first edit)</small>

<li>Can you add information to the article with verifiable sources to show his importance and that his work has been reviewed? <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 16:04, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm <i>also</i> a gay man who lives in Toronto, and I <i>can't</i> vouch for Matthew being notable enough to merit an encyclopedia entry — I've never heard of him, and queer Canadian literature is one of my <i>areas of expertise</i>. (That said, I have added categories to the article; that shouldn't be construed as a vote in favour of keeping.) <b>No vote</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:15, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

However, the poet should be deleted as for now. There is plenty of time to add him to WikipediA at a later stage. Let him win some notable prices for his poetry first.

<p><b>Keep</b>- Hi I'm Matt's ex girlfriend from grade school. I say keep because this boy has been through a lot and deserves even the most tiny recognition of his gifts and skills. I know he isn't famous, but that doesn't mean the world wouldn't benefit from knowing a little more about him- <b>Cait <small>(Unsigned vote by 64.231.202.232 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.231.202.232_c109.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.231.202.232">contribs</a>), user's first edit)</small></b></p>
