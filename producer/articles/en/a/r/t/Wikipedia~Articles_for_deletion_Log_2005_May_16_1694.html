<li>Merging does not necessitate losing information, though in this case it really needs to be re-written to better indicate that it is a movie gizmo with a backstory rather than any kind of real science.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Note: I AM the person who wrote the original version of the wiki, so I may be biased. Admittedly it isn't a forum of great note, but I don't see anything in the rules against putting in forums - it exists, has existed for a good amount of time and seems certain to exist for at least another couple of years or so. If you look elsewhere on wiki, small schools have wikipedia entries, and we don't have people demanding that those be deleted simply because they are not famous schools that have produced many famous people. The fads section is set to ONLY contain fads spawned on this forum - if you've seen another one elsewhere and it doesn't state who made it on the forum, delete that fad. The actual post count is higher than 561,000 - GD has been hacked and wiped twice, we have had croppings of old topics before and two months of posts were lost due to a technical error. And of course Google's not going to have results for it, we only changed to that name a few months ago, and also, if something came from a board and is credited, who on earth is going to bother to write out GameDAILY Community. This is the very internet that is primarily compromised of people too lazy to spell out "you" properly. --LupusCanis

<p>&gt;Hundreds? There are 50. And if you delete the Monster Rancher stubs, by that token, you need to delete all the Pokemon stubs for the same reason. And the Neopets stubs. And all the other virual pet pages. And to a lesser extent, any stubs on videogame "ripoffs". And possibly stubs on dervivative movies and franchises, too. Why have stubs on Family Guy when you could argue that it's a Simpsons look-alike? And why not delete the Star Wars pages? They're just like Star Trek. Wikipedia is supposed to be totally comprehensive. Deleting pages because YOU don't like a franchise is just immature and goes against the inherent spirit of the Wiki. Please give a reason that's better than that. The page isn't offensive, false, spam, or vandalism. Just because you don't like the franchise or have the OPINION that it's superfluous is no reason to delete pages on it. I vote to keep any wikipedia page that isn't false information or vandalism. Too much information never hurt anybody. <b>Keep</b>, obviously. - Zeta7 06:23, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - See <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokeprosal_9c70.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokeprosal">Wikipedia:Pokeprosal</a>; it's currently being discussed whether the Pokemon stubs are worth keeping or consolidating. The Monster Rancher monsters aren't terribly excyclopedic, because, to be honest, nobody but fans of Monster Rancher really care about them. Contrast this with the more important Pokemon or the Star Wars characters and concepts, which have significant cultural and pop culture impact. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 06:31, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since when has notability been a requirement for a wikipedia page? Once it's established that anything too indepth or obscure can't be included in Wikipedia, I'll give you the point, but until then - none of these arguments actually adhere to real wikipedia policy. Unless there's a notice that says "Hey, don't write TOO much or else!", I don't see how Wikipedia could BENEFIT from NOT including articles that are factual. Wikipedia is not a real book with a limited amount of pages to write in. There are a number of articles on obscure data, facts, movies, or videogames that could just as likely be deleted. But I don't see how this website could ever claim to be comprehensive if "some information is just too much". Maybe you could just get rid of ALL the fictional pages? Or split wikipedia into fiction and non-fiction? I mean, all of my friends told me how great this place is because it accepts a high volume of data. I had no idea that it would be so discriminatory based on tastes. Oh, and A Man in Black, I notice that a high volume of your edits are to Pokemon pages. I wonder if your opinion on this franchise might have been infulenced by something else. These pages don't hurt anyone, and they don't violate policies. I don't see how you could argue for their deletion unless you change the policiy of wikipedia to exclude "information nobody wants". Which is an absurd idea - Zeta</li>

<li>Quite frankly I HATE people constantly spouting "oh this isn't paper!" as a reason why others' notability/(something)cruft deletion votes are silly.

No, because it's NOT important to most of the world.

<li>Well, I personally don't think that Homer Simpson is a notable fictional character. Who cares if others think so?

<li>It would be a mistake to keep if the term has only been used in a single German language publication, even if peer reviewed.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article describes knowledge that has been published several years ago in a journal of the german <i>Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.</i> under the term <i>Information Continuum</i>. I must admit that it is very special knowledge and it is not interesting for everyone, quite as many other articles about specialized knowledge. I have added a link to the internet that allows you to download two example implementations and their source code files. This should proof evidence that the article describes working reality, not just a vague theory. Furthermore, I have replaced the image links by proper images. I know that my english is not perfect and I am willing to increase the comprehensibility. Please make your criticism about the comprehensibility more precise. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarsten88_74e3.html" title="User:Karsten88">Karsten88</a> 15:01, 21 May 2005 (CEST)</li>
<li>Article has been substantially expanded by <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarsten88_74e3.html" title="User:Karsten88">Karsten88</a> but still appears to be original research. There's little question that this was published in a journal, but my knowledge is deficient as to whether <i>Informationstechnik und Technische Informatik</i> is a peer reviewed journal (or whether the article in question was published as a peer-reviewed article or merely as an unreviewed "letter"), so I'm dropping my delete vote for now. Perhaps someone more literate in German than I can provide more information. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 14:05, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article has been updated. I appreciate the effort and it's prettier, but I still cannot change my delete vote. Although the work was published in a single journal, there's still no evidence that any other AI researchers have given this theory the slightest bit of thought. There are hundreds of thousands of journal articles published each year. This WP article is essentially a vanity article solely for that single journal article which appears to be entirely insignificant. If WP goes down this path, expect articles for each of the tens of thousands of masters and PhD theses published each year. Sorry, it's a nice looking article, but still orginal research and non-notable. The bar for scientific theory has to be higher than a single publication of an obscure theory that appears to be ignored by experts in the field. It's a mistake to keep WP articles like this because they give the reader who is not familiar with the field an entirely distorted view of what's important. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 22:08, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>RETAIN</b>I have studied medicine, including homeopathy, intensively for over 10 years in an effort to address my son's chronic ills related to Autism. This article clearly explains why the full understanding of Hahnemann's whole system of medicine, which includes Homeopathy, has the capacity to broaden our scope and imagination for true remediation and a reliable systematic cure. Hahnemann himself was also subject to the emotional plague reaction where the establishment attempted to suppress true knowledge. My son demands a better way. (AAMc)</li>

<li><b>RETAIN</b> I have read this article, and it provides useful information that shows clearly that Heilkunst is not part of homeopathy, but rather the other way around - which is fascinating. I've studied homeopathy 27 years and practiced for 18, and this is food for thought. This fulfils the mission of an encyclopedia, I think, in providing factual information and references/resources for readers to do further research. homeowiki--Homeowiki 23:49, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Retain</b>- for reasons set out in comments below - rudiverspoor</li>
<li><b>Please Do Not Delete</b> This is not the same as homeopathy. Homeopathy is a part of the greater system of Heilkunst. Not the other way around. This has nothing to do with the argument about mainstreams acceptance of homeopathy or heilkunst. I appreciate having a definition. Heilkunst includes things like regimen eating the right food and homeopathy is about remedies. I found it informative and i wonder why more people do not know about it.[ marlasw1
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Wikipedia, Marlasw1! Because your only edits are to this page, I'm guessing that you're associated with Heilkunst and you already knew a lot about it. Most readers don't have that background, though. The article might survive if it's promptly re-written to show the nonspecialist that this subject is notable and that we need a <i>separate</i> article on Heilkunst. In its current form, the article is so jargon-laden and unencyclopedic that it's practically impenetrable to those of us who aren't steeped in homeopathic teachings. Another possibility would be to re-write it as an article about the Hahnemann Center for Heilkunst, if that institution can be shown to be notable -- although the article would still be obvious vanity (our term for an article authored by the subject or someone closely connected with the subject) and would attract some deletion votes on that ground. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 01:19, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>RETAIN</b> It seems to me that Wikipedia was created for everyone to share knowledge. Heilkunst and homeopathy are both worth some reading, which I have done. And I hope to continue doing in this wonderful medium. To remove an article for the presented reasons seems to me a simplistic solution. Let it be and evolve as most other topics have grown in Wikipedia. Certainly none of the calls for deletion have impressed me exceprt with the lack of courtesy and information - and I hope it is not the criteria on which Wikipedia bases such decisions. I for one, find heilkunst fascinating and a vast theme worth examining in more detail and I hope to be able to do so on this forum.(Z.Alex) <i>(The foregoing was from User:24.114.164.108.)</i></li>

<li><b>RETAIN</b>. I have been studying and working with homeopathy for 10 years and after reading the article on Heilkunst have a better understanding of how Homeopathy fits into Hahnemann's greater system of healing.

<li><b>Bold text</b>RETAIN. There is so much more to Samual Hahnemann's complete medical system - Heilkunst - of which homeopathy is only one part of it. Embrace the complete genius of Hahnemann and take it to a place beyond that which it is being kept at by some homeopaths who resist the change! Therefore Heilkunst should stand on its own in order for it to be recognized for what it is - a complete medical system including homeopathy, not the other way around. Congrats to those who boldly go beyond where anyone else has gone. I vote for keeping the lines clear between Heilkunst and Homeopathy and retaining this page.

<li>Homeopathy and Heilkunst are not the same thing at all. There are only 2 things that I see that link them. The first being that they both claim Hahnemann as the father of their art. This is true. The second being that homeopathy uses remedies that are potentised and are chosen on the law of similars. This is true for heilkunst as well. That is where the similarities end. From what I understand, that is the extent of homeopathy, and heilkunst goes further into the lifestyle of the individual, as was detailed below. It seems to me that homeopathy and heilkunst can be compared to pharmacology and family medicine. One is a part of the other, but it is not the same. - S.

<li>An argument about mainstream medicine seems useless here. Mainstream changes constantly, so mainstream medicine is hardly mainstream. Homeopathy is a fact and it seems from what I understand that Heilkunst is also. I do not profess to be an expert, but the reasoning is sound based on my readings. -jowiley--Jowiley 00:14, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Mr. Lane has some amusing thoughts on homeopathy, which is part of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where there are homeopathic hospitals, where it is a fully recognized medical option for many countries in Europe, and in India. No form of homeopathy is accepted by mainstream medicine? Guess again. The first practitioners of homeopathy 200+ years ago were medically-trained physicians, and many MDs (and DOs, RNs, FNPs and PAs) STILL include homeopathic medicine in their practice. Check the membership directory of the National Center for Homeopathy in the US, for example (www.homeopathic.org). The first medical association in the US was homeopathic, then the AMA was formed (a few years later). The first medical association in Canada was homeopathic, then the CMA was formed. Please check your facts before you comment on things about which you obviously know nothing. --Homeowiki 23:55, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have indeed been tireless (is that a fault?), but in correcting factual errors, removing attacks that have little room in such an article, which does keep the basic idea that homeopathy is not accepted by mainstream medicine - point noted, let's move on. Everything that I have written I can document, with sources and quotes. I referred people to the website where much of this is done, but I can do it in more detail if anyone wants. As for Heilkkunst being taught in only one place, that is indeed a true, if sad commentary, which shows that Hahnemann's legacy, which goes way beyond just homeopathy, has effectively been ignored, misunderstood or maligned by his supposed followers. At the start of any new issue, there will not be widespread acceptance. If homeopathy had just come on the scene today, I'm sure it would receive the same reception, such as that "homeoapthy is not an English word." Well, many of the words in the English language were not English at some point, but from Latin, Greek, German, French, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact is that the "homeopathy page" is about homeopathy and Heilkunst is about Hahnemann's complete medical system, part of which is homeopathy. To claim that homeopathy encompasses Hahnemann's complete system and genius is patently false and demonstrably so. (Again, I would be happy to provide the evidence to any who cares to take the time to read). This is documented in the texts I have cited by Hahnemann for anyone to read, which few people do, I have found. Heilkunst is Hahnemann's term, as is "homeopathy" and is legitimate as a topic for an encylopedia. The issue should now be focussed on the content. There is much yet to add to Heilkunst and while much is already distinct from the homeopathy page (some overlap, yes), it will be very different. - Rudiverspoor</p>
<ul>
<li>This author has been tireless in attacking the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> article, to remove information (such as actual studies) that reflects badly on this quackery, and to re-insert his own idiosyncratic views. I might be amenable to having a separate article about "Heilkunst" if doing so would make it easier to preserve a genuine article on homeopathy. Of course, this separate article, if kept, would have to be suitably NPOV; it should state that no form of homeopathy is accepted by mainstream medicine, and that, even within homeopathy, "Heilkunst" is a small splinter practice (with an explanation of how it differs from other schools of homeopathic thought). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 22:31, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was a result of a move from <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_occupation_of_Norway_406c.html" title="Nazi occupation of Norway">Nazi occupation of Norway</a>, as well as apologist edits for the Nazi regime, e.g., that the invasion was a result of Allied aggression against vital supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germany.</p>
<p>The original article is correctly titled, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although there haven't been other German occupations of Norway, labeling it "Nazi" makes it precise and less ambiguous</li>
<li>It was not only a military occupation - in addition to the role of Quisling's illegal regime, Terboven ran the civilian organizations that occupied Norway but had no control over the military forces there</li>
<li>In truth, not just Germans were involved in the occupation - there were Norwegian collaborators and Austrian troops</li>
<li>There is no reason to embellish the fact that this was a Nazi act of aggression. I'm certainly not trying to diminish the fact that the Nazi leadership was German, but the responsibility should be laid at the feet of the Nazis first and foremost. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 17:55, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We might as well include the Palestinian occupation of British territory, the British occupation of Turkish territory, the Turkish occupation of Crusader territory, the Crusader occupation of Muslim territory, the Islamic occupation of Roman territory, the Roman and Greek occupation of Israeli/ Jewish territory, and the Jewish occupation of Canaanite territory.... and on and on and on, back to when Homo erectus occupied the territory of whatever animal was king or queen of the Levant before his or her coming. It's ALL relevant, but it makes quite a bit of work to do. Besides, it's easier to refer to border changes and conquests than occupations, and, even then, "occupation" should refer to takeovers that are temporary. Much of Israel's "occupied" territory is under Israel's jurisdiction in a manner intended to be permanent or long-lasting; therefore, "colonizing" or "annexation" is really a better term.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Leifern's explanation above. As he points out, the occupation was not just military, it was political. The analogy between Nazi/Germany and Bush/USA is faulty. However much a shmuck our president is, he was legitimately elected and complies iwth our constition about as well as most presidents. While the Nazi party was a political party, it was also a paramilitary organization; Hitler was legally named Chancelor, but no one seriously believes his government has any kind of legitimacy (one of the issues at the Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal). World War II was unique in many ways, because of the ideological and political dimensions of the conflict — it was not just another war, and Germany was definitly not just your typical occupying power. And, as Leifern points out, the occupation involved not just the self-interested kind of collaboration that always occurs, but politically motivated collaboration. "German military occupation" is history without politics. This is bad history, <i>especially</i> in this case. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 23:16, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Further, I suggest not to hype the supposed difference between the attributes "Nazi" and "German". The above objection that speaking of a "Nazi occupation" would necessitate to speak of <i>"'Zionist occupation' or 'Likud occupation' of Palestine"</i> or <i>"a 'neo-con occupation' or 'republican occupation' of Iraq"</i> by analogy does not hold water, neither does Halibutt's comment that it <i>"was not the Nazi party who occupied Norway</i>" - Halibutt, is it possible that you are reading too much stuff of <a href="http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=72714" class="external text" title="http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=72714" rel="nofollow">this</a> kind?&#160;;-) The Nazis were not just another party that happened to be in power at the time, but a <i>totalitarian</i> regime which established a firm grip on German society. By the time WW II broke out, the German government, state apparatus and society at large had become largely synonymous with the Nazis. It is a commonly accepted practice to prefix the name of the country with the name of the totalitarian regime which controlled it (that is why we have a "Fascist Italy", a "Nazi Germany", a "Soviet Russia", but no "Republican United States" or "Likud Israel"), and to use the ideology's name as interchangeable with the name of the country proper. Thus, "Nazi occupation" and "German occupation" are equally correct. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 09:59, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really, I neither like nor read the Wyprost weekly, they are far too rightist for me. My oppinion is equally valid as yours, BTW. As to the Nazi being synonymous to Germany - not really. There is a strong belief in many of contemporary historians that the German army was not that Nazified - and it was the German army (not Nazi military units!) that carried over both the invasion and the occupation. Also, the civilian German authorities were not always Nazi. The Nazis were indeed a totalitarian regime, but it is the governments and armies that wage wars, not the regimes as such. It is John Doe and Jane Smith who might be Nazis, but the whole army and whole state? Of course, there is a common practice to add a prefix to the country's name in order to make it clear to which historical period we are referring. However, here the case is not about adding the prefix, but about replacing the whole name of the state with a name of one of the political factions. Also, as someone pointed out, there was only one German occupation of Norway, and there was only one German state at that time, so there's really no point in disambiguation. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a>

<dd><i>"Not really, I neither like nor read the Wyprost weekly, they are far too rightist for me."</i> I am pleased to hear that, no offence intended.&#160;:-) However, it seems that their opinion-forming power in Poland, even over those who try not not swallow their polarising line, is easily underestimated. Quite irrespective of that, you are, of course, entitled to your opinion that there are people who <i>"promote the view that it was a bunch of Nazis that were responsible for WWII, and not the state and the government of Germany"</i> - even if it <i>is</i> strikingly close to certain conspiracy theories emanating from Wprost's editorial office. However, those unnamed "people" seem to receive more attention in Poland than elsewhere, including Germany - the situation is similar as with the ominous <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_death_camps.html" title="Polish death camps">Polish death camps</a>, a term actually rarely heard outside Poland. I have a vague idea that this <i>might</i> be why you are reading more into the issue of "German" vs. "Nazi occupation" than there actually is (or should be, in my opinion). Note that I was not arguing for or against either attribute; my point is simply that the difference is not really as defining as you (and the author of this article) seem to think.</dd>
<dd>As for your comment on the German army - yes, ironically the German foreign service and military, milieus shaped by traditional, aristocratic conservatives, were a stronghold of anti-Nazi opposition. However, "stronghold" is a highly relative term here. In the end, the uppish generals executed the orders of the proletarian Nazi upstarts; and it should not be overlooked that every German soldier was obliged to swear an oath to Hitler as a <i>person</i>, not just as an incumbent of a constitutional office. The few officers who actively or passively opposed the regime, and attempted to assassinate Hitler as late as 1944, did so on their private initiative, not as representatives of the military or any constitutional body. The government consisted of Nazis, the army would not have started the war without receiving an order, and would certainly not have occupied Norway. In this light, your objection that it is <i>"governments and armies that wage wars, not the regimes as such"</i> appears like a distinction without much difference. <i>"It is John Doe and Jane Smith who might be Nazis, but the whole army and whole state?"</i> No, the army and the state were obviously not Nazis, as party membership was restricted to physical persons such as John Doe or Jane Smith. However, while not every single German John or Jane D. was a party member, the army and the state as a whole were executioners of Nazi policies. As for replacing <i>"the name of the state with a name of one of the political factions</i>" - I am sorry, but this statement does not reveal much historical competence. In Nazi Germany, the Nazi party was not simply "<i>one of the political factions</i>"; Germany was a one-party state, membership in many of the party's affiliated organisations (most notably the Hitler Youth) was compulsory. The party was not just one political faction - it was the only and defining political force from 1933 to 1945, and it was not governing within an existing state structure, but reshaped the state to fit its own ideology. It controlled each and every aspect of social life, leaving a degree of autonomy only to the two major churches. A key difference between Italian Fascism and German National Socialism was that the former saw itself as a kind of deus ex machina to preserve and strengthen the state, whereas the latter considered the "party" as the supreme incarnation of the general will. Although the Nazis never bothered to formally revoke the Weimar Constitution, it became waste-paper within weeks of Hitler's appointment as chancellor, and you will certainly not find any authority to refute that the Nazi state was an entity essentially different from the Weimar Republic. In the light of all this, there is really no compelling reason to replace the existing title "Nazi occupation" with "German occupation"; although, on the other hand, there is no compelling reason to keep the original title, either. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 15:26, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is simply incorrect that "the government consisted of Nazis". The government consisted of people from different political camps. The minister of finance was not a National Socialist, but a conservative which did not belong to any party. Anyway, this has nothing to do with the discussion. It is absurd to claim it was "Nazism" and not Germany which occupied Norway, and <i>no serious Norwegian historian</i> would support this ridiculous claim. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourage_94d7.html" title="User:Courage">Courage</a> 19:46, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So you found a minister who was not a party member&#160;? Eureka, the history of Nazi Germany needs to be rewritten!&#160;;-) Not all ministers during the 12 years of Nazi rule were party members; in the very beginning, there were only three Nazis in the entire cabinet, and Hitler was hoped to be outmanoeuvered within months. As any history book will tell you, this did not help much. While the Nazis still had to be considerate of the conservative political establishment in the beginning, foreign minister von Neurath's replacement with Ribbentrop in 1938 marks the definite end of that period. The occupation of Norway occured afterwards. Apart from that, nobody claimed that <i>"it was "Nazism" and not Germany which occupied Norway"</i>. If you choose to read this <i>"ridiculous claim"</i> into the title "Nazi occupation", that is entirely your business. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 20:23, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

<p><s>The country was not called "Nazi Germany". This awkward term is only used by some Germans who claim "Germany" had nothing to do with WWII. It is an ahistorical apologist title, which is completely inappropriate in formal uses. It suggests that the German government of the time was not actually the "real" German government.

<dd><s>You are absolutely right that Nazi Germany never was the name of Germany. However, the names 'Third Reich' and 'Nazi Germany' are widely accepted names for the temporal phase of <i>Germany</i> (then officially <i>Deutsche Reich</i>) during which Hitler was its ruler. Nazi Germany is wider accepted in English, yet neither was an official name. In German the term Third Reich is more commonly used. See also the article <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its talk page. A hardly used term is the 'Thousand Year Reich'. To overcome the trap that someone may think that Nazi Germany was not Germany, I believe it is good practice to use the names interchangeably in the text of articles on this era (that is Germany for Nazi Germany; not the other way around). In the title, however, the specificity of Nazi Germany can add to a better identification of the article's content. <small>I do not see what Israel or the US have to do with this issue.</small> <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb"><font color="green">gidonb</font></a> 21:30, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</s>

<dd><s>Courage, I do not see a real point in discussing with you when you do obviously not even care to read your opponents' statements, and either ignore them or claim that they mean the opposite of what they actually say (see our exchange above).</s></dd>
<dd><s>Just for the record: The claims you are making above are totally out of line with what everyone else seems to think. Not only is Nazi Germany, as Gidonb has pointed out, a perfectly common name throughout the English-speaking world, the conventions of which we should follow here. To my knowledge, no one has ever implied that the Nazis were not "real" Germans or that the term "Nazi Germany" was apologetic. This remains your own, highly idiosyncratic interpretation.</s></dd>
<dd><s>As for "Likud Israel": Israel is a liberal democracy in which the Likud was elected to govern, based on parliamentary support and within the constraints of a coalition, for a constitutionally determined duration. Nazi Germany, on the other hand, was a totalitarian state shaped by Nazi ideology. Not only were there no functioning democratic procedures to change the governement again or to articulate dissent; dissent itself was forbidden on pain of death. Similar can be said of the U.S. I repeatedly explained the difference; your consistent refusal to consider this gives me an idea that you are not really seeking to discuss the German occupation of Norway at all: Is it possible that you are really just looking for a venue to criticise Bush and Sharon? If so, rest assured that the title of this article is not the most effective choice. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 08:12, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</s></dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> - I live in Illinois and had never heard of this school, but checked on Google and quickly found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams from Bergen County Academies took 8 of the top 12 spots in the 2003 Superbowl of High School Calculus, competing with 191 teams from around the U.S. In 2004, the school fielded 3 teams, all finishing in the top 10.</li>
<li>Nine students were listed as semi-finalists in 2005 U.S. Physics Teams (compared to 3 students from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Trier_High_School_240f.html" title="New Trier High School">New Trier High School</a> and 3 students from the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Mathematics_and_Science_Academy_6906.html" title="Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</a> which, by almost anyone's standards, are notable high schools)</li>

<p>Although I may be late to this argument since I know it has been a bone of contention in the past, I don't understand how wikipedians can find that every campaign in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, every minor character in any Star Wars episode and every ship in the U.S. Navy merits an article but that high schools are "not notable." Although the guidelines for deletion say that a person who is the subject of a biographical article should have notability, I don't think that does or should extend to a high school, particularly one that obviously participates on an equal footing with schools that I know are among the very top tier in Illinois. I agree that there needs to be more work on this article, but at least there is some information here, which is more than can be said for a lot of stubs. But I don't think it is right to keep vfd'ing every article on a high school and putting the burden on the authors to establish notability. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:53, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
