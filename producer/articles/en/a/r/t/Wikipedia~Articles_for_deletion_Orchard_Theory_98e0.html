<p>Has two links, and no cites, neither link actually calls it an Orchard theory - they just mention it metaphorically in passing once. Facts themselves seem very dubious; sources are ones widely agreed as untrustworthy.

<li><b>Comment</b> We already have an article on Baraminology and whether or not this a popular belief isn't relevant if the term is a neologism.

<dd>And how many sources would that take? I learned this through my Animal Biology professor and I going to talk to him tomorrow to get some sources. I'm going to assume that "established, well-known, and well-defined term" simply means it is the most common term for it's definition no matter how obscure it's definition might be. Is this correct? Would "creationist orchard" be a more fitting term? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22creationist+orchard%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22creationist+orchard%22" rel="nofollow">Google: Creationist Orchard</a> It is also referred to as a creationist forest. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbarnes_435a.html" title="User:Pbarnes">Pbarnes</a> 02:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I suggest moving the page to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationist_orchard.html" title="Creationist orchard">creationist orchard</a>. The google test gives roughly 68 instances where the phrase is used in the correct context. <sup><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22creationist+orchard%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22creationist+orchard%22" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> An article like this is needed in order to make easy references to this belief system much the same way as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_common_descent.html" title="Universal common descent">universal common descent</a> and fixity of the species have an article. Creationist orchard or the orchard theory are the most commonly used names I could think of but other ideas are welcomed. As far as I know, this terminology started with Kurt Wise, but I have heard it many times amongst various intelligent design supporters and also from various professors at my university specifically. The last thing that should happen is a redirect to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baraminology.html" title="Baraminology">baraminology</a>. Baraminology is the study of "created kinds" not the belief system itself.

<dd>The problem is referencing. People can reference <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_common_descent.html" title="Universal common descent">universal common descent</a> and fixity of the species why can't they reference the alternative belief system? Creationism is too broad of an article and Baraminology is to unrelated to be a good reference article. I'm going to add to this article today (while at work). Let me edit it a bit and propose the name change and then you can tell me what you think. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbarnes_435a.html" title="User:Pbarnes">Pbarnes</a> 18:05, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p>Textbooks often teach that people who do not believe in molecules-to-man evolution believe in the fixity of species. This is the idea that all modern species were created, have never changed, and are not capable of change....This view is not held today by any creationist group, and even before Darwin it was by no means universally held. Indeed, Darwin's botany tutor, John. S. Henslow (1796-1851), believed that there was considerable diversity within the kinds of organism which God created. By contrasting molecules-to-man evolution with a view of species fixity which is impossible to hold scientifically, textbooks misrepresent the choice faced by pupils in their beliefs about their own origins.</p>

<p>I edited quite a bit of the article as well as changed the name. In an attempt to prevent biases, which would come from previous opinions of the old article, I have started this section. This is a new proposal for deletion since many things are no longer the same on the article such as unreferenced material or giving undue weight to the belief by calling it a 'theory'. For those unfamiliar with the <i>creationist orchard'</i> it is commonly used is answeringenesis.com articles and also made it's appearance the in the Journal of Creation and on the truthinscience.co.uk website. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_biology.html" title="Creation biology">creation biology</a> article by someone other than myself. The point is not to define the term but to dispel the misconceptions about the belief and to point out it's many pseudoscience aspects. All though the term "creationist orchard" is relatively uncommon (about 209 ghits) the belief is very common. Rather than adding to the generality of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> article I want to get into the specifics that way creationist can really understand why there beliefs are just religious dogma and not theories. Note: I did not call for a deletion survey, but since it was already in place prior to the editing, I guess it must stay. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbarnes_435a.html" title="User:Pbarnes">Pbarnes</a> 23:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Better to make it a secton in the highly related "Created kind" - at best, they're related theories. Frankly, though, your attempts to justify the page have sent it further and further off the rails, though you've rescued it a little. But there's a lot of analysis that doesn't seem fuly justified.</dd>

<p>Something I plan on doing with the article is placing various sections on explaining the evidence of various fields of science. One will talk about the evidence the belief explains and in another the evidence that it doesn't explain but <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_common_descent.html" title="Universal common descent">universal common descent</a> does. This cannot really fit into the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Created_kind.html" title="Created kind">created kind</a> article and again <a href="../../../c/r/e/Created_kinds.html" title="Created kinds">created kinds</a> is a broader belief then this article. As pointed out in the article, many people confuse the belief in created kinds with a belief in fixity of the species. If I were to explain both fixity of the species and the creationist orchard along with sections explaining how scientific evidence fits, I'm afraid the article will be too long. Furthermore, there is a discussion that baraminology will be moved there also. In certain peoples attempt to unify these articles, they are inadvertently going to create one over sized article. <a href="../../../p/b/a/User%7EPbarnes_435a.html" title="User:Pbarnes">Pbarnes</a> 00:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For some reason the page won't load for me. Please tell me how darwin reconciled these things. By rejecting God? Because that is exactly what I have written. I'm curious to hear what you think. To be honest I got this quote from a creationist article, assuming it was reliable (I know shame on me). But from the way I was taught in my Animal Biology class in my university, Darwin rejected his belief in God because God didn't fit in the theory of evolution like he did in the majority belief of religious people in western culture: fixity of the species. - pbarnes</dd>
