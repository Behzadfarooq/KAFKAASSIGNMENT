<p>This article has been deleted several times as both a <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">non-notable company</a> and as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement</a>.

<li><b>Comments from Author</b> To be clear, it was deleted twice (in January). I was having difficulty working on the page, as a Wikipedia novice. I also didn't understand what was going on - I thought I just didn't save the changes, so I just recreated it. It took a while to figure out that it was being deleted. Once I understood what was going on I worked on it in my user space, with initial suggestions from KillerChihuahua and Steel359.</li>

<dd>I am not affiliated with Morfik in any way, and I am not gaining any benefit from working on this article. However, I believe the company is certainly notable, as they appear to have made significant strides in the realm of building Ajax applications, and as a result I feel that inclusion would be warranted.
<ul>
<li>Patent pending on compilation of high-level languages into Javascript/Ajax</li>
<li>Discussed extensively by Ajax magazine, including a couple of articles this week, also in Ajaxian, Redmonk, ZDNet, and Readwriteweb</li>
<li>Original appearance at Web 2.0 conference made the front page on Slashdot in 2005, among others</li>
<li>Other development tools are listed on Wikipedia, including some that are clearly ads, such as TIBCO, Adobe Flex, and ASP.Net Ajax, two of which aren't even officially out yet.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability for companies is defined by Wikipedia at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations_and_companies%29_2788.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)">Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies)</a>. Many companies have achievements that they can list (well, hopefully, or they're probably not a very good company), but not all of them are notable. Please read the guidelines and determine if Morfik can meet them. They are typically fulfilled by adding references to the article. The article has no references. Lastly, an article can <b>read</b> like an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement</a> even if the company is not paying you. It's a matter of reader interpretation, not personal corporate affiliation. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 13:25, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Leebo, thanks for the reply. I'll work on incorporating more of the external sources that discuss Morfik over the next couple of days. However, the "advertisement" seems a bit odd of a reason for terminating an article. The pages on TIBCO, Flex, and ASP.Net Ajax don't seem to cite any sources, and they read pretty clearly like ads to me. Maybe it's just me. I'm trying to make the Morfik article objective and neutral. MikeyTheK 14:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Regarding the other pages - they may be eligible for deletion too. I have not yet looked at them. But try not to base the standards of this article on existing articles of the same type. It may be counterintuitive, but we can only address each article individually, in the way it relates to policy. <font color="CornflowerBlue"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo">Leebo</a></b></font> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#B22222">T</font></a></sup></small>/<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#B22222">C</font></a></small> 15:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply from author</b> Hi, guys. AFAIK there is no lawsuit. There is the patent issue that has raised its ugly head again, and the "implied threats" of defending IP rights (again, I don't work for Morfik in any way, shape or form, so I don't know this for sure). I was going to add the patent stuff today, though, since I'm out of time, and haven't had three seconds to rub together on the article until today, though. MikeyTheK 23:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, note that some of the 22 references are blog entries, forum discussions, and press releases. The actual number of articles seems to be far fewer than 22, but it's hard to tell exactly. I'm not saying that the articles that are included don't assert notability, but it's dilluted a bit with sources that don't pass <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo_0662.html" title="User:Leebo"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Leebo</font></b></a> <a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo_c104.html" title="User talk:Leebo"><font color="#2A8E82"><sup><small>T</small></sup></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leebo_addb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leebo"><font color="#2A8E82"><small>C</small></font></a> 20:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
