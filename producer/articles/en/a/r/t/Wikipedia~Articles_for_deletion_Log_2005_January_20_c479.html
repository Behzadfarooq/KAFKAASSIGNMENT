The article even got the year right. My guess is some kid saw this in school and decided to write an encyclopedia article on it.

<li>Weak delete. Having an entry for every single film ever made is one thing, but every video, no matter how minor? How about those old film strips we used to watch in elementary school, where someone would have to turn to the next projected picture whenever the tape went "beep"? Is an article on "The Four Food Groups and You! Sponsored by Nutriplex Corp" next? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:22, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd like to think so. Information on "little" films like this are important to film buffs, as many of the actors and filmmakers involved with them are also involved in other, more important projects. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herk_Harvey_6e98.html" title="Herk Harvey">Herk Harvey</a>, the director of the famous classic horror film <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnival_of_Souls_737c.html" title="Carnival of Souls">Carnival of Souls</a>, directed more than 400 industrial films in his career. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>, perhaps the greatest (and almost certainly most famous) filmmaker in history, produced hundreds of educational short films... in fact, his last production credit before his death is a short safety film with Jiminey Cricket about the dangers of electricity, entitled "I'm No Fool with Electricity". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:05, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Great, but are all 400 of those industrial films encyclopedic? Are we going to have articles on them? Just because Disney made some film on "the correct procdures for using a mitre saw" doesn't mean it's anything more than a very small footnote to Walt Disney. Besides, this video, in particular, seems to have no one of any note connected with it. If IMDb can't be bothered with this one (and they are directed entirely to film buffs) then I don't see why we should be. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:29, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In a theoretical perfect Wikipedia, they would all have articles. To leave out the majority of the work of such an important filmmaker would be unencyclopedic in itself, and to try to cram them all onto the Disney page would make it huge. Plus, there's the fact that films are almost never the work of just one person, so to put films in personal bio articles is a discredit to the others who worked on them. As for our current subject, the links I posted above say that it was made by Learning Seed, a company which is still around, and its website states that they use actors whom the viewer "might recognize some from television or commercials". So there's a reasonable chance that one or more of those connected with it have gone on to other things. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:15, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I completely disagree. The fact that Disney produced 400 industrial training films is interesting and deserves mentioning in the article on him. If any of the individual films is notable, there should be an article on it. For example, perhaps it was a training film where some animation technique, or character, etc, was introduced for the first time. Apart from that, it would be a bad thing to add 400 articles to the Wikipedia for the films. If by some strange turn of events, some film scholoar is writing his Ph.D. dissertation on Disney's training films, he isn't going to be using the Wikipedia as his source, anyway, and who else, even a film buff, could possibly be interested in each individual film. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:02, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me congradulate you on having actually read the article to notice spelling errors.</dd>
<dd>Firstly spelling can be corrected. When I wrote it I was having trouble getting the Latex to process correctely. Second, you are supposed to sign your contributions otherwise there would be no accountability in the process here on Wikipedia. Third the sources for this emergent theory are given at the bottom of the page, unlike all the pov and Npov in the more popular articles on Quantum gravity. Furthermore a link to an empty page on a simmilar theory has been added as an unfilled link to the "Quantum Gravity" page. That would be the Shakarov approach to the problem a.k.a "Discrete Lorentzian Quantum gravity" Or Lorentian lattice theory. Just because you have not heard of something does not make it new.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>@Phys:
<dl>
<dd>Present a counter argeument. A easy to confront portion would be the section on Schwarzchild radius. If the article present false information, If this is just made up gobledy gook a simple matrix calculation should show falsehood if it exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If you want more education on the matter please read the sources. Dig deeper.</dd>

<li>Well written and interesting. But this is original research, and therefore is not part of Wikipedia. Still, I look forward to this author's future contributions, and hope that this does not ruin his Wikipedia experience.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Article itself categorizes simple canonical quantization as a "proto-theory." Wikipedia is a secondary reference for <i>established</i> theories that have gained a measure of acceptance, not a vehicle for the dissemination of information on up-and-coming theories. We do have articles on disputed or questionable phenomena or theories, when it can be shown that the theory has so many adherents that the belief system is a notable fact in itself, regardless of truth; but no evidence has been shown that "simple canonical quantization" falls in this category. None of the references appear to be about simple canonical quantization as such, but appear to be references for facts that the writer uses as a <i>basis</i> for the theory. Very significantly, "simple canonical quantization" gets no hits at all in Google groups, and it is hard to believe it would never have been mentioned <i>at all</i> in any of the physics newsgroups if it had any significant currency. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:42, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Information on all writers and books is useful.

<li>I don't really see the need to be wary, nor was I entirely worried about making some huge argument. I was just saying, it's a good point. And this is a piece of literature whether it's a childrens book or some picture book. I don't see why everyone is so eager to discount it.CaptainAggro

<li>Do not delete - Have done extensive research on this author and he is a brilliant up and coming writer. First hand research has shown that the man is indeed a popular sex symbol in the northwest US. Sean Morgan is now thought to have sired at least 50 children in 20 states. Furthermore, he has written under pen names many erotic short stories and occassional informational pamplets an the stimulation of a woman's g-spot.

<li><b>Do Not Delete.</b> There is no question about the truth on this page. This writer is a professional wizard whose mysticism dominates those who have little faith in sketchy details.

<p>I love how you fellows would rather delete than edit the page down to meet your standards of reliability. You'd rather remove the page and forfeit civilian knowledge of the author than provide a decent description. All that needs to be put up is, "Little is known about this author. He has written a book entitled Snapshot (provide link to amazon or whatever) and operates his official website--www.seanmorgan.net." Any glance at that website will reveal the author's influences, biographical events, ambitions, and whatever else. Good game guys, continue to vote delete, you sticky gargling stormtroopers --68.147.138.231 21:15, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC) [How's this? Like it really eff-wording matters]</p>

<li>Actually, it's another <b>Copyvio</b>. I thought that I had already caught all of these. (There were four others posted by 65.95.141.101, all of which were copyright violations, comprising simply the teaser text from the book itself — <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_of_the_Phoenix_5527.html" title="The Price of the Phoenix">The Price of the Phoenix</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock%2C_Messiah%21_ea51.html" title="Spock, Messiah!">Spock, Messiah!</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Voyages_40df.html" title="The New Voyages">The New Voyages</a>, and <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yesterday%27s_Son_c554.html" title="Yesterday's Son">Yesterday's Son</a>. <a href="../../../x/e/_/Xe_%28pronoun%29.html" title="Xe (pronoun)">Xe</a> appears to be going down the list of redlinks in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_novels_c402.html" title="List of Star Trek novels">List of Star Trek novels</a>, in order.)

<li>Comment: You're just ahead of me! My suggestion is to let this be deleted as a copyvio, which is a more elaborate process than VfD and allows the current history to be deleted even if a new article is started in the meantime.

<li>This has every right to be an article alongside all the other individual articles devoted to series novels (i.e. the James Bond series, Modesty Blaise, Sherlock Holmes etc.), so on that basis I vote <b>keep</b> but the text needs to be rewritten so that it isn't a copyvio anymore. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:08, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

You do not do science by asking what people think as a whole, you do it by setting up experiments that prove or disprove a hypothesis. Then other people repeat those experiments and show that you're methods and results were valid or not. This is not a consensus, it is experimental proof, and until a hypothesis is tested in this way, it is not thought to be valid, no matter how many people "believe" it to be true (unless you are talking about "creation science" with is an oxymoron.</li>

<li><b>Author's Rebuttal</b> I believe this subject is appropriate for inclusion in the wikipedia for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The concept of "consensus science" is well-establised; a Google search turned up "about 5,800" results for the phrase.</li>
<li>The term is in mainstrem usage and has a specific meaning.</li>
<li>The term and concept are referred to in other articles on wikipedia.</li>
<li>While the term may cause a certain amount of controverty, there are arguably more controversial topics under discussion here. For example, the term <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_birth_abortion.html" title="Partial birth abortion">partial birth abortion</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, I'll point out that WMC has failed to list the criteria he feels the article has violated according to wikipedia policies for vfd and ask they either he do so or else retract his request for deletion.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I request that WMC either quantify the following allegations or retract them.
<ul>
<li>"This page is a POV disaster area" - what does that mean exactly? It may be a controversial topic (in his opinion) but the concept of "consensus science" does exist and therefore warrants a page on wikipedia. If WMC finds the contents objectionable or troubling, he is certain free to either modify the page in an appropriate manner or, as an alternative, not visit the page.</li>
<li>"little more than an attempt to provoke an edit war" - I'd like WMC to explain exactly how he is able to divine my intent in creating this page. Is this purely his personal opinion or does he have some factual basis for this claim? If this is his personal opinion, I would dispute its relevance with regard to his request that this page be deleted.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Consensus science" is a term in theories of the philosophy of science which question and analyze the magnitude of the role consensus should play in science. Development in the philosophy of science helps keep the progress of science productive. This term is different from "scientific consensus", which simply refers to majority opinion among scientists, while "consensus science" instead refers to the usage of consensus to form assessments of truth (thus placing it at a different level of usage). The term is widely enough used that it's certainly worth addressing in a Wikipedia article.

<dd>A quote from the article reads, "Most scientific theories which are supported by a scientific consensus are supported because there is conclusive evidence supporting those theories. Such theories would not be consensus science, because a supporting argument can be easily formulated using the existing conclusive evidence." So a field which supports its tenets primarilly by evidence is not consensus science. The term "consensus science" does not refer to "fields which have a consensus", it refers to fields which "primarilly use" consensus as supporting evidence. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin"></a> — <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECortonin_4a62.html" title="User:Cortonin">Cortonin</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECortonin_dfe9.html" title="User talk:Cortonin">Talk</a> 03:09, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I gather that you take 'consensus science' to be the same kind of expression as 'cargo cult science'.

<dd>Calling for the deletion of an article because your edits were modified is not within the Wikipedia deletion policy. In fact, it's well outside of the Wikipedia deletion policy.

<dd>1. No, it isn't a neologisn. It is a widely-used term - as I established in my rebuttal to the delete claim. 2. It means something specific. As I also estblished in the "author's rebuttal". If you have questions, ask them and I, for one, will be happy to answer. Just because you don't understand the term doesn't mean it is meaningless. 3. It not only exists in certain people's heads, it is also in mainstream use. 4. Provide examples of NPOV that have been removed. Until and unless you do, your complaints carry no weight. They're like WMC's baseless complaints; a waste of bandwidth.

<dd>That's fair and you are absolutely entitled to your opinion. But with all respect, I'll ask to you consider the possibility that your opinion isn't necessarily the core of the issue here. The fact remains that the term "consensus science" exists and it is in general use to describe a specific thing. As a result, it surely warrants an article here. I'm perfectly willing to admit that my original article wasn't the best thing I ever wrote and with the much appreciated help of others, the article is now much better than it originally was. I think that's probably how this whole wikipedia deal is supposed to work. Wouldn't you agree? Leaving aside our opinions of "consensus science" as well as what may or may not be thus labelled, can we agree that there should be an article discussing it?

No other Usenet kook has boasted of this as some sort of accomplishment. He has won more Usenet Kook Awards than any other net.kook. Of course it isn't notable if you don't mention it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 126.169.83 ("Wollfan"), you've made no contribution to that article either with from that IP number or with the name "Wollfan". Now's your chance: rewrite the article to make this person sound notable. Meanwhile, he just sounds like an abnormal pain in the ass. Has he been convicted for homicide? That would be notable -- if he were already notable for something else. Or does he just pretend he's killed a kid? That's unusual, but I believe it's not rare. And I can make no sense of your comments that "Of course it isn't notable if you don't mention it". Mark Beyer, Charles Burns and Nicolas Bentley don't get their own articles on Wikipedia (or didn't the last time I looked), and this in no way makes them non-notable.

<li>So let me get this straight, we should have lists on subjects stating that the thing in question does not exist in a particular place? If you were making list of active volcanoes by country (i.e. List of active volcanoes in the United States, List of active volcanoes in Indonesia), would you make lists for countries that do not have active volcanoes that just say there are none in that country? What about baseball players? Would you make a page called List of Major League Baseball players from Rwanda? How about List of towns with Roman ruins in Mexico? Just because several countries, or even most countries, have things worth of listing, do we automatically make lists for every country vis-à-vis that thing? I am most eager to see this explained. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:56, Jan 21, 2005 (UTC)
