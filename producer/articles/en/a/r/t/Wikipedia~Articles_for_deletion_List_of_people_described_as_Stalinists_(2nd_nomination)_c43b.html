<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>] DTC makes a good point, but the problem is the way in which <i>Stalinist</i> as a label is itself a shifting, uncertain, and historically determinative one. For example, it is used disparagingly post-56 (Khrushchev Secret Speech) to justify purges (Beria was a Stalinist); for collective identification (47-53) in Eastern Europe as part of the Soviet bloc integration, as well as later on a contradistinction to Titoism; as a label for different splits within different communist movements as well as their leaders, each with their own post-56, pre-56, as well as *sigh* post-37, pre-37 significations (esp. France); as a badge of identity in the Spanish Civil War, both as a ready-made identity against anarchism and anarcho-socialism, as well as Trostkyism; as a label of attack both in 1956 and 1968 (Prague), and again in 1991 following the coup-attempt in Russia; and most recently in the last Russian elections, and I am sure I am missing a bunch of additional significances. So what, I ask, is a Stalinist? And who gets to decide which of these many options counts and which do not? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 05:06, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The former was Stalin's henchman; the latter has a complicated set of views about Stalin (he was my professor in college, I've heard him talk on great length on the topic) but does not call himself a Stalinist.

<li><b>Delete</b> As DTC says, we have other unverifiable uncited POV lists, that doesn't mean we should keep this one. By personalising it as Stalinists rather than, say, Communists or Marxixts, this is simply an attack page. Also, it contains no actual ancyclopaedic content: there is no context regarding why each of the listed has been called a Stalinist, or indeed by whom (self-identification is not, after all a terribly reliable guide here), or how often, or in what media. Most of all, when the <i>sixty</i> contentious entries were removed, what was left was 17 more-or-less statist political leaders and a couple of hangers-on, one of whom repudiated the claim in later life.
