<ol>
<li>An Asia Times (online-only newspaper) editorial mentions him/his website in two lines. Does that really make him notable?</li>
<li>He has been mentioned on Frontpage Magazine's website, a highly conservative source. The magazine itself isn't particularly notable nor is there enough material in the article to write about him. The symposium in which he participates includes several other non-notable people.</li>
<li>He has been mentioned on WorldNetDaily. This is, again, a highly conservative blog, and the article that mentions him is unattributed to any author; it is unlikely to be a reliable source considering that.</li>
<li>He is the author of a non-published book. That doesn't make him notable either.</li>
<li>He is the owner of a website that itself is non-notable. That doesn't make him notable.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>All the other sources used in his article are from his very own website or affiliates.

<dd>Being banned by a country's IPS can be ONE of the reasons why a website may be notable. Another reason is that the website ranks in the top 30,000 according to Alexa. Another reason why his website is notable is that it seems all Wikipedias who edit on the subject of Islam know about this website. If all of them know and almost all do, his website is notable enough. Everything else combined makes him and his website notable. As I said, people who want this page to be deleted belong to the group that disagrees with his opinions. And again if he has caused so much discussion on Wikipedia, he's DEFINITELY notable. In summary Ali Sina is much more popular than the average college professor and hence is notable.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 04:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Just because an article has turned into a soapbox (which is temporary anyway), does not mean the article should be nominated for deletion.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a> passes the Alternate <i>"Professor test"</i> at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which says: <i>"If the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor, they can and should be included."</i>. The following two points support this:
<ol>
<li>He passes the "Search engine" test: His name comes up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22ali+sina%22+-%22Bu+Ali+Sina%22+-%22Bou+Ali+Sina%22+-site%3Afaithfreedom.org+-site%3Ahumanists.net%2Falisina%2F+-site%3Awikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22ali+sina%22+-%22Bu+Ali+Sina%22+-%22Bou+Ali+Sina%22+-site%3Afaithfreedom.org+-site%3Ahumanists.net%2Falisina%2F+-site%3Awikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">80,000 times</a>, not counting the results on his own websites and this one. Search engine popularity is one method of the Alternate tests of Notability (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>).</li>
<li>His website is within the top 30,000 websites according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.faithfreedom.org" rel="nofollow">alexa</a>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So he is definitely more well-known than the average college professor and so according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> he is definitely notable and so should not be deleted.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 20:39, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Neutral-link to outcome on <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakir_Naik_b802.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a></b> There does seem to be an effort to censor content from some factions of this afd (especially looking at the previous afd). It is true however that the article itself stinks of being a soap box. I would mark it with clean up tags. She does appear to be a contraversial figure with much written about her in many places. Certainly seems to be one of the more notable critics of Islam although from a more firey than academic bent. Most of the english language coverage does seem to be internet based and often end up back at her web site. The extraordinary level of contraversy however lends quite a bit to the notability claim. Among the 100,000 plus ghits "roughly" a third were about her and many of them were critical to hateful. She seems to have pissed off a large portion of the world. I'd say that makes her notable.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 01:39, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> The article needs wikifying, but the subject is notable, as the amount of adverse criticism indicates. and as the amount of debate above illustrates.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - I voted a conditional keep at the first nomination. I wanted the article to follow wikipedia standards but there was no single enhancement whatsoever. There are <b>more than 100 sources</b> and all of them refer to <i>his/their</i> own site. Unbelieveable! <i>his</i> (if he's one real person indeed) notability is so highly questionable. I also have BIG doubts about the involvement of Ali Sina or Ali Sinas in the article. They are campaigning for edit warring and they come all together from a few Anti-Islam forums. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> Ω <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 10:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I considered delete in one of the first VfDs (is this really only the second?) because I didn't think he was notable. However, I think anyone realizing the trends of Wikipedia over the last year or two should realize that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">notability standards are dropping</a>. He may be less popular than most internet memes but we're even allowing pretty much any book published (even by relatively NN press) have an article. Is Ali Sina notable? Not particularly... but, look at Wikipedia standards... and compared to them I think the answer is he's notable enough. This and the Naik deletion seem like bickering to me... I don't mean the nominator. His intentions seem noble enough to me... I just think that we've gone too far down the road of inclusion to get rid of either Ali Sina or Naik. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 10:42, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> . The sheer hatred and bigotry that he engenders in others makes him notable and also make it wise of him to be somewhat untracable: his Pseudonymity is not grounds for deletion. The google hits also help his notablility. I've done a few edits to this page, some stick and other get reverted. I don't like my edits reverted on any page as I feel I research each edit reasonably well but I'm happy to admit I am wrong when I'm wrong but with the reverts done to my edits on this page I don't feel I'm wrong.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think that the issue of "notability" doesn't apply since there are tons of articles on wiki about fictional Pokemon and Star Wars characters and planets. As for the soapbox issue: If there is edit-warring or inappropriate editing going on in the article, it can be dealt with according to wiki guidelines and policy. It has been long-established that POV issues <i>in</i> the article are not the basis for an article's deletion. I agree that there is some suspicious/bad faith nom stuff going on, all the argument's put forth center on his views etc, it wouldn't surprise me if the delete votes belong to people who share an opposition to his views like Matt57 said. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>On balance, I'm going with <b>Keep</b>. I think it's important that the tone of the article be as close to NPOV as possible, and I hope interested parties will monitor this. If this means lots of rewriting, frequent edits and reverts I don't mind, so long as everyone involves assumes good faith and acts as constructively as they can. Debate is healthy, and this guy does appear notable enough. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
