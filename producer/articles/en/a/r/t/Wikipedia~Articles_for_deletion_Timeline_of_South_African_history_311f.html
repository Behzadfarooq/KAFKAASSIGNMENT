<p><s>Consider this nomination not just for this article, but also all the articles listed in it. With apologies to <a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">User:Jcw69</a>, who appears to have put a lot of work into this mess, this appears to be a colossal collection of useless information documenting every mundane event that took place in every year of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South African</a> history for the past 500 years. How could this possibly be considered encyclopedic? Who could find this useful? And, most importantly, what purpose does this serve that "<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_b4a8.html" title="History of South Africa">History of South Africa</a>" does not fulfill? If you ask me, this violates the "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>" principle. Obviously it's up to you guys to decide, but if you ask me, an admin should wipe this landfill of information clean off Wikipedia ...

<li><b>Merge</b> with each individual year (and remove the unimportant and mundane events).

<li>This whole thing is simply following an already-established precedent per <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_by_country_1b39.html" title="Category:Years by country">Category:Years by country</a> — 23 other countries already have their own dedicated "Years in country" categories filled with year-by-year articles just like these, and a "Timeline of country history" master list. I see no particularly convincing reason why South Africa should be excluded from that, especially since it's a country with a rather <i>important</i> and <i>interesting</i> history. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 09:09, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as there seems to be a solid precedent for this kind of stuff. Besides, it's interesting, informative and took a lot of work. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 18:48, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, but the article really needs big improvement. The article could be pointed to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a> in order to get ideas of how to improve it. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 02:21, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I disagree with Aplomado, timelines are important, it links the history and supports the History of South Africa. I based this article on the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_history_e2ab.html" title="Timeline of Canadian history">Canadian</a> one. The indiviual articles off it are still growing. If I make it like the Austrialian one it would be way too big. I think that the Austrialian one should be improved.--<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 19:59, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> and others here; I also believe it could be expanded slightly towards the Aussie version, although I share <a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a>'s concerns about its size. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">dewet</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/w/User_talk%7EDewet_cdb4.html" title="User talk:Dewet">✉</a> 20:20, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and continue to improve. It's a nice resource. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 21:16, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - It's useful and interesting, and a strong precedent for this sort of thing has already been set. I would not object to a move more towards the Australian version though, in which the most important even in each year is highlighted. — <i><a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi"><font color="darkblue">Imp</font></a><a href="../../../i/m/p/User_talk%7EImpi_3839.html" title="User talk:Impi"><font color="green">i</font></a></i> 21:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This vote is well on the way to Keep, but as a comment, Jcw69 has done an amazing job on detail for South Africa, and I couldn't possibly support removing all his hard work. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a>…<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwizzy_3a7f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwizzy"><big><big><b>☎</b></big></big></a> 06:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Conditional keep</b> - These articles are a great resource. However, they need to have references for some of the more obscure factoids. If the consensus is to merge, I would not oppose, but prefer to keep. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 06:46, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are lots of timelines on Wikipedia, from countries to the Muhammad cartoons controversy to years in music. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 09:50, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like many of the other people who've commented, I think a timeline of SA history is interesting and useful. A tidy up would be nice, and I also prefer the format of the Australian version, but that's no reason to delete this. <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 4 May 2006, 17:44 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a very useful timeline for South Africa, which makes historical understanding far easier. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris.lester_bab5.html" title="User:Chris.lester">Chris</a> 20:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree with comments around improving it to a similar look and feel of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a> but what a great start! Good for anyone researching SA history. Find it ironic that the strong comments come from <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado">Aplomado</a> who is creating stubs about individual players in a single team's NFL offensive lineup in the 80's!?! I think this falls much closer to <i>Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms</i> <b>or persons</b> in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>! <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPappaG_ffb9.html" title="User:PappaG">PappaG</a> 17:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You obviously know nothing about <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>. <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:yellow; background-color:maroon; font-weight:bold">Aplomado</span> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">U</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" rel="nofollow">C</a> 22:34, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per, well, everybody above. As I understand it, we vote based on the <i>potential</i> for encyclopaedicity (is that a word?) of the articles, not necessarily just on their current contents. Since it seems to be accepted that articles like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902_in_Canada_233c.html" title="1902 in Canada">1902 in Canada</a> (and so on) are encyclopaedic, I can't see why similar articles about South Africa should be any different. Although it would probably be better if it used the format of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Australian_history_17b1.html" title="Timeline of Australian history">Timeline of Australian history</a>, there is precedent for how it looks now; see <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Canadian_history_e2ab.html" title="Timeline of Canadian history">Timeline of Canadian history</a>. - <a href="../../../h/t/o/User%7EHtonl_fb13.html" title="User:Htonl">htonl</a> 22:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Obvious <b>keep</b>. It is important to have this kind of articles. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 11:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia is not running out of space. The article could do with some improving, but it would serve absolutely no purpose to just delete it. Wikipedia would be better off with MORE articles on Africa (which is severly under-represented due to <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a>), not less. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>) 11:28, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> For Aplomado's information <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">TUF-KAT</a> has a table of <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_Topics_by_country_16d9.html" title="User:TUF-KAT/Topics by country">topics</a> by country and in it he has timelines of counties history--<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 16:11, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
