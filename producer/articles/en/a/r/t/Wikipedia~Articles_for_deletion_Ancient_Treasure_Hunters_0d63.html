<dd>A deletion of this page was proposed because of only 61 hits on the Google search engine. However, the summer camp now caters to hundreds of campers and merits its own page, explaining to people what the camp is and/or does.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page is not an attempt to spam or advertise the camp. I have used Wikipedia for almost as long as it has been around, and I have seen article of far less relevance been allowed to stay. Wikipedia is after all - an Encyclopedia, and in order for an Encyclopedia to be truly complete, (especially an online type of this nature) it should be able to carry an article of relevance for the people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ancient Treasure Hunters is currently in midst of talks with television networks to create a reality series based on the camp. In fact, NBC has created a reality series called 'Treasure Hunters' and this has increased exposure of our camp becuase of people typing in the terms 'treasure hunters' into their various search engines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have received numerous emails requesting a short description or explanation fo the camp, and since I have always turned to Wikipedia as a valuable source of information, I feel that the same ability should be made available, that people can search their encyclopedia which can explain what the camp represents.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 07:17, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You posted your reply in less than 8 minutes from the time that I posted my statement claiming that you can find no other sources to back up my claims. What vast sources and resources did you try to use in those 8 minutes? Are you a 12 year veteran of the camping and summer camp industries, and as such have a vast working knowledge of the summer camp industry, including historical literature from conventions and/or industry statistics from trade publications? Because if you are not, then I am not certain what credibility your statement holds, or why exactly you should even think that you have the ability to verify it. And of course, because you are not the above, what right do you have to even make a statement or have an opinion on this article's deletion? (no harshness intended)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reply to your 1: The relevance is, that because our summer camp program bears such a similar name to the reality series, people are getting confused between the two. We want to make sure that when a person searches an encyclopedic source for the term Ancient Treasure Hunters, that they do not think that we are the NBC specific reality series.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reply to your 2: I have been involved with the camping and summer camp industries for over a decade. I have attended trade shows, subscribe to industry publications, have close ties with many travel related summer camps and travel agencies all over the planet. I know the attendance histories of over a dozen travel related summer camps, and I also know their average daily inquiries - by date. By comparison to theirs and our own historical statistics, our inquiries have increased by almost 40%. This is a tremendous surge.</dd>

<dd>Reply to your 3: Our website does explain it better, and in much more detail. You can view it yourself to see what depth we go in to.

I thought you would have a better tactic than to start off questioning all and sundry who dares to ask you this very simple question: "Is there anybody else, besides Wikipedia, who think your summer camp program is worth writing about?" - which is what our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> requires. Your long reply, despite its length, has not addressed this crucial question at all. If the answer to this question is "no", then well, it shows that no one else cares about your summer camp program, even if all the info about it is true. So why should we? Please, add to the articles during the five days in which this discussion, convince us otherwise.

<p>aeropagitica - I will add information about the summer camp program to help show what is notable about the camp. Please understand that the reason it was originally kept brief, was because I did not want anyone to think that this was spam, or some kind of self glorification. But now that I am more familiar with Wikipedia's way, I will add information that shows why the program is unique. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr Stephen - the camp and summer camping industry is not your typical industry and statistics, articles are not yet as common on the internet. Camps do not get much press, and they don't put out many press releases. Clients are usually obtained by targeted direct mail pieces, and this will explain why you will not see much in the way of 'reviews' of camps. However, you may note that we are a member of the National Camp Association (www.summercamp.org).--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kimchi - a. 'ad hominem' - I was not attacking anyone. In fact, I even put in afterwards '(no harshness intended)' to avoid anyone thinking that. I stated the facts, that only someone who is knowledgable in the camping and summer camping industries would have the ability to make the statements he was making. b. I do believe that there are those besides Wikipedia who would think that our camp is worth writing about. In January for instance, Hadley Lewis of the Boston Parents Guide wrote an article about our summer camp program. c. I was not trying to make it as multiple votes. I have never defended an article before, so I did not realize I am not supposed to be doing that - I thought it was more like a paragraph header, sorry. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Weregerbil - Google is a search engine. Unless there are public articles such as press releases, etc..., (which is common in different industries) there is not much for Google, Yahoo or any other search engine to link on to besides the website. As I mentioned earlier, the summer camping industry does not attract its clientel that way, and therefore there will not be many articles showing, if any. This is why summer camps will typically pay for advertising click-throughs on search engines. However, because people turn to the internet for definitions and explanations of things, (even summer camps), particularly Wikipedia, we wanted there to be a reliable source to explain what the organization does. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore - I would hope that as admins, there is never any 'funny stuff' going on, such as just simply asking other admins or sysops or whatevers to come in and put in a 'delete' vote as some sort of comrodery between admins. As if to say 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'. Remember that this is not the Gestapo, you are supposed to be at a high standard, and not to take advantage of your positions. For instance - Wickethewok it states on your user page that you contribute mostly to music articles, suggesting that that is where your speciality resides. Why then, are people without the necessary background and information in the summer camp industry voting on a topic that they know nothing about? Without the relevant education in the industry, isn't is much like a medical doctor walking in to a court room to act as a litigator? --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Starionwolf - This article is not an attempt to do any of what you listed. As stated earlier, we have been inundated with requests recently, and we thought that since people go to Wikipedia anyway for information (parents actually have said on the phone 'yeah, I checked Wikipedia to see what your program is, but I couldn't find anything about it there') we thought that it does merit an article. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:29, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hetar - you can refer to the National Camp Association at www.summercamp.org - I don't think they list camp info on their website, but you can get their contact information and call them up. They can provide detailed info about the camp. Also we are listed on MySummerCamps.com, Campsdirectory.com, kidscom.mysummercamps.com, guidetosummercamps.com, e-camps.com, summer-day-camps.net, overnight-summer-camps.com, guidetosummercamps.com, and several others whose names currently elude me. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 20:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - no evidence of notability. If you go on their website to "Request Info/Sign Up" and then "ATH in the press", their own press release says that this summer will be the first season of this camp.

<p>BigDT - This was the first season of the camp under the name Ancient Treasure Hunters. Previously, we have been simply called an 'Archaeology Camp'. We chose this 'new face' when the decision was made by the owners of the camp to expand and broaden the reach and goals of the company. (During the year, the company owners go on their own expeditions all over the planet and aid and assist in the recovery of 'buried treasure'. We bring students/campers with us on these expeditions as well. These same students usually end up becoming campers in our archaeology camp. Hence, we have never really needed to go 'big' on the marketing angle. Now, the company's ambitions include getting a reality series for the expedition and camp angles of the business, we are in the midst of publishing a book on the topic titled 'Ancient Treasure Hunters' - or some variation if the editors end up changing it, and more. We conglomerated everything into one name, face, image etc... called Ancient Treasure Hunters. We have also worked hard - the website is the result - on the marketing angle to attract more clientel.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 05:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

He already answered u'r thing over and over again by saying that in the summer camp industry, things just don't work the same. There are no forums, no discussion groups, and internet searching is at a minimum. U can't just keep on arguing the same point over and over again just because its easy to say! And, it's not self promotion just because it was written by an employee! And he gave u the other source secondary verifiable source - the National Camp Association! But I am sure that nobody here is going to bother to call them up on the phone, because then u'r universe of the inernet is interrupted!--rationality 20:07, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Things working different in the summer camp industry only gets you so far. It seems to amount to claiming that notable summer camps by their nature can't produce any evidence of notability beyonf unsubstantiated claims or summer camps by their nature are never notable.

<li>$$$--KeeP--$$$ Google? u keep making Google search results as a good reason to delete this entry. i think our world is about us and what we need - information, products, services etc. and Treasure Hunters is one of those things that fall in between most categories for a select group of people, that group of people is diverse enough and having the added spice of intrigue i think this is a worthy entry 100%. all the other losers which feel in need of being Mega st. Nerds you should pick your noses and let us know what you found, maybe we will even document your treasures, becasue they make as much sense as your review.

<li>KEEP* I am not familiar with the summer camp industry, and I am definitely not well versed in the policies and procedures of Wikipedia. I can say one thing with confidence though: I am rapidly losing respect and interest in Wikipedia. It seems to me that ATH is a revolutionary, refreshing, educational and yes - fun summer camp. It is a true novel concept. Why then would the powers that be wish to delete an article about this camp? Isn't that the whole point of an encyclopedia? To educate us? I am actually shocked that there has been so much fuss about this resourceful article! Please do not delete this creative article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shimmyi (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shimmyi_c74d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shimmyi">contribs</a>).</small> <small>This editor's first contribution.
