<p>Orivirran saarto is a place of 16th century fortress located in <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savonranta.html" title="Savonranta">Savonranta</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>. It's believed to be built around 1540-1550 and was used until the beginning of the 17th century. During 16th century Finland was a part of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">The Swedish Kingdom</a> which tried to push the borders eastward, and that led to wars of varying success with <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novgorod_Republic_1549.html" title="Novgorod Republic">Novgorod</a>. The expansion was halted by the unification of Russia and was eventually rolled back later. Purpose of the Orivirran saarto was to be early warning for the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Olaf%27s_Castle_fe2a.html" title="St. Olaf's Castle">St. Olaf's Castle</a> which is still located 50km to south. Four cornered layout (60*20m) build from stones and outer fortress around 65*75m, with 300-400 soldiers and 5-10 cannons. October 1592 Russians, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossack.html" title="Cossack">Cossacks</a> and Carelians destroyed fortress by doing surprise attack from north-east. Finnish defenders of fortress lost 200 soldiers as a dead or prisoners of war, and Russians won 8 cannons, light weapons and one ship. Fortress didn't survive and today there exists only very few ruins of fortress with memorial stone (1965, H. Havas).</p>

<p>At first SBN was just a forum. It grew, and grew, and grew. Now it has Forums and a website.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The site was created February 4, 2006.</p>
<p>I did a WHOLE LOT of research trying how to make a good forum, how to get more visitors, and making banners, skins, and custom thing for SpongeBob Nation©</p>
<p>It started off as a simple forum but then I added more topics and more ideas.</p>
<p>Later I added a homepage with game, SB news, and other stuff.</p>
<p>My website was getting popular by the week.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Timed Events of SpongeBob Nation</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2/06- The Forums were created Feb. 4 and I didn’t have to pay a dime. This whole month, I was working on improving the whole look of the site and I finally found it, the flower SB sky for the back ground. I also started working on a home page for SBN and worked on the look and chat rooms, games, and news. I got more than 20 members in the 1st month! Still, I didn’t pay a cent.</p>
<p>I also had a variety of banners.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
3/06- This month was BAD!</p>
<p>2 people were banned from the forums. Then the forums were shut down. They still are down and never coming back probably. But, there was one good thing about this month. I got a domain name with a better site host. The forums ended with 44 members.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>4/06- The forums made a comeback. I added a capsule and much more info. was added to the site. The best part, I made it so that you can watch episodes and the movie on the site. Games &amp; Staff information was added. Now, I’m working on getting thousands of pictures from EVERY episode.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>5/06- More content added. The new SpongeBob episodes were fun. I did the pictures but the downloads wouldn't work.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>6/06- I added an affiliate section and got some. The forums got a skin selestor and a shoutbox(but the shoutbox is being redone now) Many more capsules were added.</p>

<p>The Taung Baby was the skull and bones of a young Australopithecine found in 1924 by Dr. Raymond Dart. In that time many natives of South Africa had unexpectedly dug up ape or monkey fossils, such as baboons. Scientists of the time disregared this because apes lived in tropical forests and their had been none ever known. One person started to protest against that claim ad his evidence was a skull of an extict species of monkey. Added was the location, the fractered skull came from a lime works that he owned at Taung, then a part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. One of the young woman scientists passed this knowledge to her anatomy professor Dr. Raymong Dart. Who was then teaching at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Dart was ecstactic and asked the quarry owned that if any more probable fossils show up that they be sent to Dart. In a couple weeks two shipments of limestone arrived at his house. Their was nothing of particular interest in the first box. But, in the second he found the roundish cast of the Taung Baby. At first Dart thought it was the skull of a baboon, but as he looked closer he decided that it was too large to fit in the skull of a baboon. And the forebrain was much bigger in proportion. He took out the skull and placed it a box of sand. The next day he noticed another picularly the foramen magnum was at the bottom of the skull indicating bipedalism. Dart then wrote a paper about it to <i>Nature</i>. The project was accepted and the whole world was informed of the Taung Baby. He named the creature <i>Australopithecus Africanus</i>. Althought the thought of a bipedal ape was rather repulsive at the time Dart was right about the baby at Taung.</p>

<p>A 1988 horror/action film starring retired football lineman <a href="../../../l/y/l/Lyle_Alzado_7a13.html" title="Lyle Alzado">Lyle Alzado</a>. Alzado plays "Ivan Mozer", a 6'4", 350 lb. serial killer who has been convicted of the rape, torture &amp; murder of 23 men, women &amp; children --although, at his execution, he boasts of having killed 24. Moser is sentenced to die by electrocution but the initial conductivity fails to kill Moser, which results in a power outage at the prison. Moser is given ample time to kill several prison staff members and dissappear. A year later, a film crew sets their sites on the now closed prison for the filming of a cheap, exploitation movie titled "Death House Dollies".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>WARNING** PLOT SPOILER INFORMATION BELOW!!! --</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moser has been living within the closed prison's walls since the day of his botched execution. He has been able to do so because his father oversees the abandoned grounds as a State employed security guard. Moser kills off all members of the cast &amp; crew over the course of a couple of days, including the director played by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Perkins_35bd.html" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a>. While doing so, he becomes obsessed with one crew member; a woman named Malone, who is stunt doubling the lead actress in the production. Once everyone else working on the set has fallen victim to gruesome deaths (electrocution, burning, beheading &amp; jackhammer) at the hands of Ivan Moser, a final showdown is set between the crazed killer, Malone &amp; her boyfriend. After several attempts to kill the fiend, Malone eventually stops Moser, at least for the remainder of THIS film by setting him on fire and shoving him into an underground canal with a propane tank that explodes by him. The film concludes with Malone having a nightmare while recuperating in her hospital bed. She dreams that Moser has trapped her in the hospital by posing as an orderly. In the dream sequence, Alzado rips his burned ear off and eats it, while laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>once more i sit here helpless watching my life unfold, it's like watching a scary horror movie, you see it coming but you can't do a thing but grind your teeth, bite your nails and wait for it to end. Everything was fine but as i thought it would only get better, he manage to prove me wrong once more, i'm lost in my thoughts and my actions. I dont know how to control it. It's like someone took over my life. I have no say so in anything. I do everything without thinking it through. I know if it continues my life will unfold and unfold completely. So i ask myself and others "What exactly is life?", if it's waking up to the lonely world, that i wake up to, is it always thiking of not being in the position, that i feel that i am in. Is it wanting to feed on others to make yourself feel better, like others feed upon me, is it wanting to kill nobody but yourslef, as i do EVERY SIGNAL morning! Is it?</p>

<p>My version of tensor calculus is based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Most of mathematical physicist know these coefficients only as the coefficient for ireps (irreducible representations) of the spheriacla group SO(3). I have introduced so-called Clebsch-Gordan products in terms of typical variables [1] which enable calculation of tensor decomposition into tensorial covariants (bases of irreducible representations) as well as calculations of the extended integrity bases of polynomials. The original motivation has been the Landau theory of phase transition, but it is my belief that the method is the simplest to deal with material tensors. Just to see whether this subnject is of interest for these pages, I shall give a reference to some of my basic work which does not mean that I do not want to point out the connections with other approaches. I am accustome to write my articles in Latex, so it will be fine if you inform me how to proceed if your preliminary review will show the article will be of interest for these pages. I found pages about tensor calculus applications in the theories of gravitation and other high matters but none on the simple use in solid state physics.</p>
<p>You may inform me on e-mail <i>(contact info deleted)</i></p>
<p>By the way, I do not care about merciless reviewing, this is usually of help.</p>

<p>once more i sit here helpless watching my life unfold, it's like watching a scary horror movie, you see it coming but you can't do a thing but grind your teeth, bite your nails and wait for it to end. Everything was fine but as i thought it would only get better, he manage to prove me wrong once more, i'm lost in my thoughts and my actions. I dont know how to control it. It's like someone took over my life. I have no say so in anything. I do everything without thinking it through. I know if it continues my life will unfold and unfold completely. So i ask myself and others "What exactly is life?", if it's waking up to the lonely world, that i wake up to, is it always thiking of not being in the position, that i feel that i am in. Is it wanting to feed on others to make yourself feel better, like others feed upon me, is it wanting to kill nobody but yourslef, as i do EVERY SIGNAL morning! Is it?</p>

<p>Using fa jin one can deliver an explosive energy strike from touch contact with the opponent, we don't have to draw back our arm to hit them. So <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dim_mak.html" title="Dim mak">dim mak</a> should really be translated as death strikes not the death touch. One common myth which has crept into the <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dim_mak.html" title="Dim mak">dim mak</a> ( acupuncture point striking ) story is that people say that they were knocked out and the taiji fighter never touched them. In actuality the fa jin ( explosive energy strike ) was to fast to see and with a knock out to the person who has been hit, upon recovering consciousness has lost that second of memory just before he went into knock out.</p>

He joined the New York City Police Department in 1955 and assumed several positions during his 27 year career including a member of the TPF (Tactical Patrol Force) and as a sergeant in Emergency Service. During this time and from his experiences he wrote the novel “Blue Invective,” which was published by Bobbs-Merrill (NY, 1973). This book was the first book published by a member of the NYPD while still on active duty. While using fictional characters, it gave and accurate portrayal of the life of a cop in an American ghetto, breaking with the sterile, unrealistic depiction of day-to-day police work as shown in Adam-12 and McCloud. He launched a police genre that resulted in modern police shows focused on the NYPD such as “NYPD Blue” and “Law and Order.”</p>

To save her father from ruin and prosecution for fraud, she abandons her burgeoning career as a successful actress to indenture herself, body and soul, to her father’s business partner, the charismatic but ruthless Armand Levequ. Katrina’s world is suddenly confined to a beautiful Caribbean island. Her home there is Chateau Levequ, where she is subjected daily to relentless sexual excesses and sado-masochistic torment beyond her wildest imaginings. All this under the direction and watchful eye of Madam Christina SIN, Armand Levequ’s appointed Mistress of Chateau Levequ. Although Katrina’s indenture is to last only six months, it will change her forever…and there is a deeper purpose to her ordeal than she could possibly guess…</p>

<p>--74.139.51.203 06:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)--74.139.51.203 06:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)Tales Of Legendia is a RPG game or the Playstation 2 Entertainment System made by Namco. It is part of the "Tales Of" series. It center around the main character, Senel Coolidge and his 2 "sisters" Shirly Fennes and Stella. The game revols around the "Radiant" (People of the water) and the People Of The Land, and the Radiant's "savior" (Shirly). You will use Eres in the game as a sort of magic/skills. Iron Eres utilize physical skills while Cryistal Eres use ones like magic. The following is a list of characters you can use in the game.</p>
<p>Senel Coolidge- Iron Eres - Senel is the main character, and the physically strongest character available. He has a unique power to throw enemies, so long as they are thrown down first, they must also be in the correct weight class.</p>
<p>Will Raynard- Crystal Eres- Will's eres mix healing and attacking, thought not the best in each. He is extremely useful in the beginning due to his First Aid eres. He is also good for his Recover eres, which cures a stauts condition without the use of an item.</p>
<p>Chloe Valens- Iron Eres- Chloe is the second strongest character, however is HP is somewhat low. Her eres are able to hit many times in a row and keep the enemy busy, thus, she is good in many fights. Sword Rain, Sword Rain Alpha, and Sword Rain Omega are all examples of this.</p>
<p>Norma Beatty- Crystal Eres- Although Norma posses decent attact eres, its her healing thats useful. She may not be able to heal as much as Ray could, but she can heal everyone at once. She is also able to revive party members, which makes her extremely useful in many boss fights.</p>
<p>Moses Sandor- Iron Eres- Moses is a harder character to balance, he attacks with a spear so he can fight at a distance, this is unique to Iron Erens. Moses is powerful, but his aim varias. Against short enemy, he is pretty much useless. But against large and flying eneimes, he is great against.</p>
<p>Jay- Iron Eres- Jay is a speedester. His armor, and thus, Defence are weaker than most, but this is not too much of a setback unless you're in a hard boss fight. Some of his eres have element damage, which is unusal but useful. He is also able to lower an enemy's resitance, making them a perfect target for Crystal Erens.</p>
<p>Grune- Crystal Eres- Grune has no healing eres whatsoever, but has a deep range of attack eres. This mean she cannot heal, but can also do major damage to enemy with a weakness against a certain element, or in general since she posses the best offensive crystal eres in the game. She is good when used with Norma and/or Jay. Norma can cast her healing on the group while Grune unleashes powerful spells. Jay can decrease an enemy's resitance so Grune and blast away at their HP.</p>
<p>Shirley Fennes- Crystal Eres- Shirly has a good mix of healing and attack, but is only able in the Character Quest part of the game. She is a good member to have since she can deal damage using rare eres, elements that are hard to find in the game.</p>

<p>Grand Master Emmanuel De Rohan Polduc was the penultimate Grand Master of the Order of St John when the Order was still in possession of the principality of Malta which it had acquired from Sicily through the joint intervention of Emperor Charles the Fifth and the Pope. De Rohan,an absolute monarch like his predecessors, ruled over Malta during very difficult times for the Order of Saint John. The French Revolution had rendered the Order redundant. De Rohan sought alliances with Russia and alternately with Great Britain. These moves only exasperated the French Republic. But when General Bonaparte finally convinced the Paris Directory to take Malta, De Rohan was already dead and the take-over was affected during the grandmastership of Ferdinand von Hompesch.</p>

<p>Allah Bux Soomro’s 63rd death anniversary:</p>
<p>The Sindhi leader who was neither a Leaguer nor a Congressman</p>
<p>By Hasan Mansoor</p>
<p>On May 14, 1943, Sindh was deprived of a man who is still revered as the province’s only undisputed political leader in the eyes of all political, nationalist and religious activists. While he died at the young age of 43, Shaheed Allah Bux Soomro’s time on this earth left a lasting impression on the people and political history of Sindh.</p>
<p>“It took many centuries for Sindh to [give birth] to a great son like Shaheed Allah Bux Soomro. She (Sindh) is waiting for another Allah Bux and we hope the wait is not too long,” said Sindh intellectual Taj Baloch.</p>
<p>Sindh vanished from the world map more than once after the British conquered it in 1843. Initially, the British had made Sind a part of the Bombay Presidency in 1847 but it took 80 years for this part of the Subcontinent to find again itself on the map in 1936. The revival of Sindh’s stature as a full province of British India ushered in many seasoned politicians but Soomro stood tallest among them all.</p>
<p>During his brief six-year political career in Sindh, Soomro became the first leader of the opposition and was elected twice as the premier of Sind. It is small wonder then that for politicians, Soomro was the greatest statesman this region has ever produced and for nationalists as great as the late GM Syed, Soomro was the greatest nationalist of them all.</p>
<p>“Today he (Soomro) is sleeping in his grave in the Panjpir graveyard. We can’t say whether he would be laughing at our condition or weeping!” the late Syed had said once.</p>
<p>Born in 1900, Soomro matriculated and joined his father’s business as a zamindar (landlord) and contractor. He was just 23 when he stepped into local politics and was elected to the Jacobabad Municipality and became the president of the District Local Board. He defeated an influential feudal lord in northern Sindh in 1926 and became a member of the Bombay Council and remained one for the next ten years.</p>
<p>In 1936, Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto and Sir Abdullah Haroon founded the Sindh Ittehad Party, which won 24 out of 33 Muhammadan (Muslim) seats in a house of 60. Soomro was one of the frontline leaders of the party and became leader of the opposition in the First Assembly of Sindh as Bhutto and Haroon lost the elections.</p>
<p>Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, whose Muslim Political Party had won just five seats, was offered to form the government by Governor Sir Lancelot Graham. Sindh was not short of turncoats in those days too and there were good numbers of independent Hindu legislators who helped Sir Hidayatullah become the first premier of Sindh.</p>
<p>In 1938, Hidayatullah stepped down and Soomro was offered to form his government, which he successfully did with the Congress’s help. The Sukkur Barrage was established in 1932 for agriculture reforms and an organised irrigation system in Sindh. The British government had earlier allowed Sindh to pay the cost incurred on the barrage in easy installments but after Soomro assumed charge he was compelled to pay the money in a shorter time and in unaffordable installments. Soomro found no other option but to increase taxes, which eventually broke the ruling coalition that consisted of three parties and even the Ittehad Party broke in two.</p>
<p>Soomro abolished the old Darbar system and implemented agricultural reforms. He withdrew the magisterial powers given to the influential feudal lords and lifted the externment orders on Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi and successfully arranged for his return to became the most hated of Indians for the British rulers.</p>
<p>Soomro was a ‘misfit’ for many in the set-up, as his decisions for his fellow politicians were popular but not prudent. Yet, it was his popularity among the masses that has still kept his memory alive today. He was prudent for the welfare of his people and remained aloof from the prudence practiced by fellow politicians.</p>
<p>Soomro never bothered with official protocol. He was ‘darvesh’ for many of his rivals and one of them was Pir Ali Mohammad Rashdi who, despite differences with Soomro, called him the most honest and down-to-earth ruler of Sindh. A chapter on Soomro in Rashdi’s Sindhi book of memoirs ‘Uhay Deenhan Uhay Sheenhan’ (The days that were) is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>According to PV Tahilramani and KR Malkani’s book ‘The Sindh Story’: “The unassuming Allah Bux sat by the side of the driver, never used the official flag on the car bonnet, never accepted any invitation to receptions or parties. In the train he would use the upper berth and let others use the more convenient lower berth. On one occasion when floodwaters threatened Shikarpur, he breached the canal to flood his own lands and saved the city. But above all he was non-communal and nationalist.”</p>
<p>In 1938, Mohammad Ali Jinnah visited Karachi where he held a meeting to launch the Muslim League in Sindh. Top leaders from the Punjab and Balochistan attended along with Soomro and other Sindhi leaders. During the meeting, Premier Soomro was asked to join the League like the premiers of Bengal and Punjab who accepted after a marathon debate. In the next meeting on October 14, a number of Sindh Assembly members also joined the League. During the meeting, the new Leaguers proposed a new leader in Sindh, which Soomro opposed on the contention that when no new leaders has been elected in Bengal and the Punjab and no new premiers were introduced there, then why should this be done in Sindh.</p>
<p>The League’s leadership did not accept his argument and the association broke before even coming into being.</p>
<p>Later, the communal riots in Sukkur on Masjid Manzilgah in 1939 not only expedited the League’s efforts to dislodge Soomro but even his allies in Congress grew annoyed. Both parties jointly passed a no confidence motion against Soomro. It was only Mohammad Amin Khoso of the Congress who voted for Soomro and thus suffered party disciplinary action.</p>
<p>The Muslim League formed its government in Sindh for the first time after that. But it lasted only a year. Soomro became the premier again in 1941, but the League had made great inroads in Sindh during its one-year rule which was evident from the fact that now it had 400 branches in the province unlike a year ago when it had only 30.</p>
<p>In April 1940, soon after the League’s Lahore meeting, the Muslim League’s opponent Muslim leaders met in Delhi with Soomro in chair. This meeting contested the League’s claim of being the only party to represent the Muslims of India.</p>
<p>When Soomro assumed the top office again in 1941, World War II was at its peak and Congress had launched its “Quit India” agitation with a civil disobedience campaign. The congress governments in all the provinces resigned and with the support of Congress the Soomro government had only two options: Either save his government by joining forces he did not like and take action against anti-British elements or withdraw yet again. He opted for the latter.</p>
<p>“Convinced as I am, that India has every right to be free and that the people of India should have conditions in which they could live in peace and harmony, the declaration and actions of the British Government have made it clear that instead of giving their cooperation to the various Indian parties and communities in settling their differences and parting with power to the people of the land and allowing them to live happily in freedom and mould the destinies of their country according to their birthright, the policy of the British Government has been to continue their imperialistic hold on Indian and to persist in keeping her under subjection, to use the political and communal differences for propaganda purposes, and to crush the national forces to serve their own imperialistic aims and intentions,” Soomro said in a letter to the Viceroy of India intimating his renunciation of his title of Khanbahadur and OBE (Order of British Empire).</p>
<p>“The latest speech delivered by Mr Winston Churchill in the House of Commons has caused the greatest disappointment to all men of goodwill who wish to see rendered to India the justice which is long due to her.</p>
<p>“As that hapless pronouncement withholds such justice for India and adds to the volume of evidence that Britain has no desire to give up her imperialistic hold on India.</p>
<p>“I feel I cannot retain the honours I hold from the British Government, which in the circumstances that have arisen I cannot but regard as tokens of British imperialism,” said the letter written on September 19, 1942.</p>
<p>He renounced the honours and resigned from the Defence Council during the WW II. Later, the press asked whether he wanted to extend the hand of friendship with the Nazis and Fascists. “I believe in two things,” he had replied, “To defeat British imperialism and fight against Nazism and Fascism at the same time. It is my birthright to fight against both evils.”</p>
<p>On October 10, Governor Sir Hugh Dow sent a letter to the premier intimating him that he had lost confidence and thus was dismissed from office. The governor had such powers under the Government of India Act 1935.</p>
<p>Soomro was killed on May 14, 1943 when he was on a tonga in Shikarpur. The case was tried in a special tribunal against seven people: Qasim Mangnejo, Kamal Mangnejo, Wali Mohammad Kharal, Abdullah Noonari, Abdul Haq Bhayyo, Qambar Kasai and Ibrahim Kasai. The former three were awarded death and the latter were sentenced for life by the court on February 24, 1944. Khanbahadur Ayub Khuhro who was Soomro’s political rival was also arrested along with brother Mohammad Nawaz and tried, but the Sukkur sessions judge exonerated them for lack of evidence. Thus, the greatest murder case in the history of Sindh is still unresolved despite a lapse of 63 years.</p>
<p>Soomro was neither a Leaguer nor a Congressman and thus was conveniently forgotten by the rulers either side of the border. But, he is still popular among his people who have no other idol to remember but him whenever Sindh goes through a difficult time.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This article will discuss energy from the point of view of the world’s and India’s demand for energy for heating, transport and manufacturing industry, etc, in the light of available resources and increasing demand, and the difficulties created as oil and gas supplies run out over the next few years.</p>
<p><br />
FORMS OF ENERGY</p>
<p>The forms of energy include mechanical, electrical, chemical, heat, light and sound. Energy is usually experienced when it is converted from one form to another or when it is transferred from one body to another. E.g. a torch battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy, which is then converted by the bulb into light and heat energy.</p>
<pre>
Table 1 Energy Resources
Fuel           Quantity              Energy content(joules)
Coal           1 tonne               2.95 × 10¹º
Oil            1 barrel(0.159 m³)    5.93 × 10
               1 tonne               4.3  × 10
Petrol         1 litre               3.47 × 10
Natural Gas    1 cubic metre         4.03 × 10
Electricity    1 kilowatt hour       3.60 × 10
               1 megawatt year       3.15 × 10
Uranium-235    1 tonne               8    × 10
</pre>
<p>One of the fundamental laws of physics is that energy is always conserved; it is either converted from one form into another, or transferred from one body to another. It never disappears nor is it created from nothing. However, some forms of energy are more useful than others through being storable (e.g. petrol) or particularly versatile (e.g. electricity), and are therefore regarded as high-grade forms of energy. The conversion of heat from burning coal or oil into other forms (e.g. electricity or mechanical energy) for operating machines or motor cars is unfortunately inefficient. The laws of thermodynamics show that only a limited fraction can be converted, and that the rest must be ejected (wasted) at a lower temperature. Thus, even in the most efficient electricity power stations, only 30-40 per cent of the heat from the coal or oil or nuclear reactor is converted to electricity. The remaining 70-60 per cent is ejected uselessly into the atmosphere or into rivers, because it emerges at too low a temperature to be put economically to useful purposes.</p>
<p>The basic unit of energy is the joule. Energy must be distinguished from power, which is the rate at which energy is used, and which is measured in watts, i.e. 1 watt equals 1 joule per second. A common unit of electrical energy is the kilowatt-hour, the work done in one hour by one kilowatt, i.e. 1kWh = 3600kJ. The energy content of different fuels is (approximately) shown in table1.</p>
<p>RESOURCES AND DEMAND</p>
<p>Man used wood, peat, and coal for about 3000 years before the industrial revolution for heating, cooking and metal working. Coal fuelled the world’s industrial revolution, and only in the last fifty years has oil come into significant use and displaced coal as the principal fuel source.</p>
<p>These fossil fuel resources have taken 350 million years to accumulate. However, the continually increasing demand for fuel has in the case of oil led to the rate of consumption doubling approximately every 12 years during the 20th century. Such is the level of consumption now that there is a real possibility that 80 per cent of the known reserves will have been consumed between 1960 and 2020, even assuming a corresponding exponential decrease in consumption after around 2000.(Hubbert 1969)</p>
<p>Since oil is not only a source of heat energy, but represents a rich source of large organic molecules- the raw material of the chemical industry- exhausting this non-renewable resource in one generation is extremely wasteful, especially if 90 per cent of it is literally burnt for heat. However the decline and inadequacy of supply of a major source of fuel over the recent years is posing serious problems of how to find and switch to alternative fuels sufficiently quickly.</p>
<p>That the demand for energy will continue to grow may be seen by considering the correlation between annual energy consumption per capita and gross national product per capita of different countries. This suggests that increasing standards of living in developing countries will further increase the demand for energy for ore production, manufacture of materials and goods, electricity supply, transport, and agricultural developments.</p>
<p>Closer home, coal takes care of more than half of India’s commercial energy needs while oil and natural gas supply 40 per cent. Coal is primarily used for power generation (70 per cent) and industrial processes, whereas petroleum is the mainstay of transportation. Some quantities of petroleum derivatives such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel are also used in power generation. Natural gas is the main feedstock for fertilisers. An equal quantity of natural gas is also consumed in combined cycle gas turbines that generate electricity and this essentially displaces fuel oil and naphtha.</p>
<p>Table 2 India’s primary commercial energy supply</p>
<pre>
Indigenous production   Amounts in 1998-1999
                       (million tonnes of oil equivalent)
Coal                              125.61
Lignite                             4.88
Crude oil                          33.80
Natural gas                        20.99
Hydro power                         7.12
Nuclear power                       3.13
Total                             195.53

Net imports                        66.06
Stock changes(-)                    6.54

Total commercial energy supply    254.95
</pre>
<p>ENERGY CONVERSION EFFICIENCY</p>
<p>A variety of means of converting energy from one form into another is essential if the limited range of primary fuels is to meet the wide ranging needs of modern society. Conversion from heat (thermal energy) to mechanical or electrical energy is unfortunately intrinsically inefficient, so that even a good modern electricity-generating power station has an efficiency of only about 40 per cent. This is not due to poor design, but due to theoretical limitations arising fro the nature of heat energy. Conversion of heat into work involves conversion of disordered motion into ordered motion, and is only partially achievable.</p>
<p>The transmission and distribution of energy also involves energy loss, e.g. heat losses in electricity cables, frictional energy loss in mechanical systems, energy used up in transporting coal, oil, gas etc. the overall efficiency of the electricity supply industry is thus only 27 per cent, due primarily to the thermodynamic inefficiency of the conversion process and to transmission losses.</p>
<p><br />
MEETING FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS</p>
<p>Faced with a serious decline in oil supply from the 1990s onwards, coal and nuclear power are being widely looked to, to fill the gap. Some countries, notably Japan, France and Germany, have either very restricted coal deposits or traditionally small coal industries, or have run their coal reserves down. They and other countries are installing nuclear reactors very rapidly, despite public misgivings about disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes, possible hazards of reactor accidents releasing radioactivity etc.</p>
<p>However, uranium resources themselves are limited, and it is not clear whether the uranium-mining industry will be able to grow fast enough to keep pace with the demands of a rapidly expanding nuclear power industry. Uranium fuel costs are expected to increase rapidly in the near future, partly through demand, but also because as the richer deposits become exhausted, poorer grade ores would have to be used.</p>
<p>Energy supply based on fossil fuels and uranium suffers from two grave disadvantages: (1) the known resources are finite and non-renewable (2) because they produce their energy as heat, which can be converted only inefficiently into electricity, to achieve suitable versatility far more energy is used than is really necessary. With growing use of energy world-wide, this may produce serious climatic changes, as all this energy ultimately ends up as heat in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The intolerable heat, temperature inversions, prolonged fogs and smogs around some cities, even at today’s rate of consumption, indicates the real possibilities of this.</p>
<p>Both these disadvantages can be avoided by utilising renewable resources, i.e, hydroelectric power, solar heating, conversion of sunlight directly into electricity via photovoltaic cells ( solar cells), energy from windmills, waves at sea, hydrogen gas produced by sunlight acting on suitable electrolytic cells, or natural gas produced from the decay of animal or vegetable waste. All these sources take energy, provided by the sun, from the atmosphere, and ultimately return it there so that they do not alter the overall energy flow into the atmosphere. The capital cost per unit of power produced tends to be higher than for fossil-based systems, but because the energy itself is supplied free by the sun, they are rapidly becoming competitive with these sources as fossil fuel costs escalate.</p>
<p>Owing to the variability of solar, tidal, and wind power, energy storage is needed to compensate for periods of inadequate power. This may be by batteries, pumped hydropower, flywheels, heat storage, hydrogen gas, or access to other sources. The cost of newly emerging renewable resources is quite high. The research and development (R&amp; D) investments and activities will bring the costs down over time. The date of non-conventional backstop technologies overtaking the conventional fossil fuel based ones would depend on the price movements of fossil fuel based energy supplies which should reflect its scarcity premium. However, economy can have cheaper energy supply along conventional route over a longer horizon if the efficiency of use of energy is upgraded. In an era of renewable energy supply, too, the efficiency of energy use will determine the carrying capacity of renewable resources in terms of providing support to growing population and energy activities.</p>
<p><br />
THE QUEST FOR ENERGY SECURITY</p>
<p>The quest for energy security is an important one in the emerging global order because of the skewed regional distribution of fossil fuels resources in the biosphere in the given context of technology and resource options as of present.</p>
<p>Energy security has finally moved up front for India, after having been on the backburner for decades. The country still doesn’t have a national energy policy but for some time now, it has been pursuing a series of measures that should reduce vulnerability. The need for setting up a strategic petroleum reserve has been accepted as a policy imperative. India has also been earnestly pursuing overseas oil equity. The oil and natural gas major, ONGC Videsh has been on a shopping spree acquiring oil acreages in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, a lot of ground still needs to be covered. Home to a sixth of the global population , India has a mere 0.5 per cent of the global oil reserves. This makes import dependence ineluctable. A cardinal imperative of nations in search of energy security is diversification of supply sources, fuels and even types of energy.</p>
<p>The versatile refining capacity added by the private sector in the post reform era, has given the country a degree of flexibility that makes it possible to source a range of crudes. Acquiring overseas oil acreages can therefore actually enhance energy security through physical deliveries as long as distances over which they need to travel are not too huge. With the oil import bill amounting to staggering $25 billion a year, every extra cent spent on the transport will have to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Energy security is a daunting challenge that needs imaginative solutions. If piping gas from the neighbourhood is proving to be elusive for geo-political reasons, perhaps India could explore the possibility of setting up power plants in neighbouring countries and transporting electricity through high voltage transmission lines. Such arrangements work successfully elsewhere in the world. The national transmission utility has demonstrated its capability in laying and operating high-voltage transmission lines in difficult geographic terrain.</p>
<p>There can be no unique solutions for ensuring energy security. All options for diversification- of supply sources, fuels, types of energy- need to be pursued vigorously and purposively if India is to achieve its goals of development that would raise living standards for its billion plus population.</p>

Fatter Than Albert is a third wave ska band from New Orleans, Louisiana. The band was formed in January 2004 by several members of the defunct ska group Skycopter 4. Fatter Than Albert's full line-up consists of seven full-time members, and performances by guest-musicians are commonplace during their live sets.
<p>Fatter Than Albert gained local notoriety in New Orleans after playing alongside a long list of touring ska acts, including The Toasters, MU330, Streetlight Manifesto, Big D and the Kids Table, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. The band toured the eastern U.S. for the first time in December 2004 and again in early summer 2005.</p>
<p>Fatter Than Albert released their debut self-titled EP in September 2004.</p>
<p>A new studio track appeared on a compilation CD entitled <i>Murder City Underground</i> in the fall of 2005.</p>
<p>Fatter Than Albert's first full-length album, <i>Erin's Runaway Imagination</i>, was independently released in July 2006, followed by a third tour of the U.S. east coast and midwest with fellow New Orleans ska-rock band, Samurai Deli.</p>

<p>84.210.68.149 11:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC) Cathedral is a song by Graham Nash on the third Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash album CSN. Written after an acid trip in Winchester cathedral on his 32nd birthday, it is one of the strongest songs Nash ever wrote and is an attack on the ambigous face of Christianity. "Too many people have died in the name of Christ" is one of the lines, a strong statement, specially coming from the former member of the teenage pop group The Hollies.</p>
<p>The song is divided into two parts, the first one quiet and backed only by piano played by Nash himself, while the second one includes an orchestra and Nash's emotional vocal raging against Christianity.</p>
<p>"Cathedral" represents the highlight of Nash's songwriting and a surprise to all those who criticised him and his songwriting for being shallow and lightweight compared to Crosby, Stills and Young's.</p>

<p>As an outcome of the Treaty of Fez (1912) Spain had got the lands around Melilla and Ceuta in its possession. In 1920 the Spanish commissioner, General Dámaso Berenguer, decided to conquer the eastern territory from Jibala tribes. This, however, did not succeed and illequipped Spanish troops suffered a momentous defeat against the forces of Abd el-Krim, the leader of the Rif tribes. The Spanish were pushed back and during the following five years occasional battles were fought between the two.</p>
<p>In 1925 events took a new turn as the French joined the war on the side of Spain. Spanish army had adopted much from French foreign legion and as a result Spanish equivalent, Tercio de Extranjeros (Regiment of Foreigners), was formed in 1920. The superior man power soon resolved the course of war in favour to French and Spain. The French troops pushed through from the south while the Spanish fleet secured Alhucemas Bay and began attacking from the north. After one year of bitter resistance Abd el-Krim, the leader of both the tribes, surrendered, and in 1926 the Spanish Sahara was finally retaken.</p>

<p>Status Crow Status Crow is the alias of a popular player in the massively multiplayer online games [url=<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Of_Heroes" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Of_Heroes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Of_Heroes</a>]"City of Heroes"[/url] and [url=<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_villains" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_villains" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_villains</a>]"City of Villains"[/url]. Originally a super hero on the Infinity server, he was an Empathy Defender who founded the heralded super group [url=<a href="http://www.pcsar.net" class="external free" title="http://www.pcsar.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcsar.net</a>]"Paragon City Search and Rescue"[/url] ("PCSAR"). Comprised of of likeminded healing-class players, they began gratis healing and resurrection patrols in the "Perez Park" zone, a unique vocation that spawned a wave of benevolence amongst the game community and burgeoned to patrols in every zone within the game.</p>
<p>After a year of selfles service, PCSAR was voted the "Favorite Super Group on Infinity" the the game's first annual [url=<a href="http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_28_05_06_48PM.htm" class="external free" title="http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_28_05_06_48PM.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_28_05_06_48PM.htm</a>]"Player's Choice Awards"[/url]. Not one to remain content, Status Crow then threw hat into the ring for the fan fiction category, and his literary talents were thusly recognized with a second place finish for his entry, entitled "Epiphany".</p>
<p>Achieving the level cap of 50 in early 2005, Status Crow then embarked on a roleplaying storyline that had him framed by a corrupt mayor and subsequently imprisoned in the city's prison, "The Ziggurat". The [url=<a href="http://www.pcsad.net/manifesto.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pcsad.net/manifesto.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcsad.net/manifesto.htm</a>]"Manifesto of Status Crow"[/url] was a cleverly crafter precursor to the game's coming expansion, "City of Villains". Now cast as a reluctant but no less determined victim of circumstance, Status Crow founded the server's first villain super group, the aptly-named [url=<a href="http://www.pcsad.net" class="external free" title="http://www.pcsad.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcsad.net</a>]"Paragon City Search and Destroy"[/url] (a.k.a., "PCSAD"). In a move to coincide with this break, he also produced, directed and starred in an acclaimed [url=<a href="http://www.pcsad.net/propaganda.wmv" class="external free" title="http://www.pcsad.net/propaganda.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcsad.net/propaganda.wmv</a>]propaganda film[/url] aimed at fellow players eager to take up the fight.</p>
<p>In a shocking move embodying his unquestionable devotion to the cause (and not often seen in online gaming, no less) he then deleted his character and started completely over upon game launch in October of 2005.</p>
<p>While unique gameplay opportunities in this new arena were not as straightforward, the group carved out a niche nonetheless with their duplicitousness and daring forays. Always pushing the envelope, their leader hatched a plot to destroy the dam in the "Faultline" zone. This was a diversion, of course, as villains cannot cross over into standard hero zones. The real target was the hero base in the player-versus-player ("PVP") zone, "Bloody Bay". This didn't deter the gullible, however, and they waited as instructed for the villain group to emerge while their own base was being assailed.</p>
<p>PCSAD then upped the ante a month later by infiltrating a supposedly secure hero hospital in the "Siren's Call" PVP zone. Though details regarding their means of access haven't been verified, their presence was indeed confirmed by the heroes defeated within. This prompted a game patch with the inclusion of "drones" in these secure areas, so as to prevent further bypassing of security measures.</p>
<p>One of the most compact groups on the server and always eschewing quantity over quality, they nevertheless continue to thrive and are presently ranked 16th out of thousands of super groups on the Infinity server. This is a testament to both their leader and the allegiance of his charges.</p>
<p>Status Crow achieved the level cap yet again in July of 2006 and is very much looking forward to foisting his next plot upon an unsuspecting hero populace.</p>

<p>Peter Craven was born in Liverpool in 1934. He made eight league appearances for the Liverpool club in Division II during 1951, scoring eight points. In 1952 he divided his league appearances equally between Liverpool and Manchester’s Belle Vue. He continued racing for Belle Vue during his national service. During 1954 he made 24 league appearances and top-scored for his club. He went on to qualify for his first Wembley World Final, where he scored one point above the brilliant new Swedish rider, Ove Fundin. About this time as a young man he owned his Jowett Jupiter which still exists. In 1955 Peter sensationally took his first World Championship at Wembley. In 1958, Peter captained the English team against Sweden in Sweden, finishing top scorer in the three-test series; he also top-scored in the five-test series against Australasia. At the World final, again at Wembley, after scoring 11 points Peter was involved in a run off for third position: he fell but remounted to finish fourth overall. In 1959 he took on Ove Fundin and won the Golden Helmet Match Race Championship, the Champions of Champions Cup at Poole; the Northern Cup at Belle Vue; the Internationale Derby at Ipswich; the Pride of the East at Norwich; the Tom Farndon Memorial Trophy at New Cross; the Champagne Derby again at Belle Vue, the CTS Trophy at Norwich and the Pride of the Midlands, at Leicester. In 1960 Peter Craven came third in the World Championship final staged at Wembley when Ove Fundin beat Ronnie Moore into second place after a thrilling run off, all three riders having scored an equal number of points after their five rides. During 1961 Peter captained the Lions on a tour to Austria. He came third in the first Internationale individual championship meeting at the Haringey stadium and was second in the British Final at Wembley behind Barry Briggs. 1962 was another good year for Peter. He followed his three British Championship victories by carrying off his second World Individual Championship from Barry Briggs and third placed man Ove Fundin at Wembley in front of 62,000 fans. He topped the National League chart, won the Kings of Oxford Trophy again, was third in the Internationale; was runner-up in the Pride of the East at Norwich; and with Gerald Jackson won the Best Pairs event at Wimbledon. At the start of the 1963 season, as World Champion Peter Craven was automatically selected as challenger for the Golden Helmet Match Race title, then held by his old rival Ove Fundi. After both had won one leg each Peter defeated Fundin in the neutral decider. He successfully defended it against Barry Briggs, but lost it to Fundin in mid-season. He was top qualifier for the 1963 Wembley World Final and as such was British Champion. Peter then rode in the Gold Cup final at Wimbledon, finishing joint sixth with Ove Fundin; on the Wednesday he was at Norwich, and on the Friday night he was racing at Meadowbank , the Provincial League Champions where, after three brilliant wins, he fell in a freak crash trying to avoid a fallen rider. He succumbed to his injuries a few days later.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-11_a7d5.html" title="Edit section: Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova of Russia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Xenia_Georgievna_Romanova_of_Russia_5311.html" title="Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova of Russia">Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova of Russia</a></span></h2>
<p>Born 22 August, 1903 in Mikhailovskoe, Xenia Georgievna is the daughter of Grand Duke Georgi Mikhailovitch of Russia and Princess Maria Georgievna of Greece. Her older sister was Nina Georgievna, born in 1901. She and her sister left Russia in 1914 to spend the war years in England with their mother.</p>
<p>Xenia married twice, first to William Bateman Leeds (b. 19 September, 1902) at the age of eighteen, the son and heir of the American tin power. They wed in Paris on 9 October, 1921. Thiers was seen as a splendid match and the couple was an influential one in New York's Long Island North Shore society, where they lived in their estate, Kenwood, at Oyster Bay. Xenia and William had a daughter on 25 February, 1925, Nancy Helen Marie Leeds. The couple divorced in 1930.</p>
<p>Her second marriage was with Herman Jud (b. 14 February, 1911). The wedding took place at Glen Cove, New York on 10 August, 1946. Xenia and Herman's child was Alexandra Leeds Jud, born 30 March, 1959.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1927, Xenia involved herself in the Anna Anderson/Anastasia Tchaikovsky affair by telephoning Gleb Botkin with an invitation for Anna to live as a guest at Kenwood. Xenia explains her hospitality: "I had heard that Botkin was arranging to bring 'the invalid' to the United States through a newspaper organization. This bothered me because I had heard so many conflicting stories. It then occured to me that I should take her myself and avoid all this proposed publicity. For if she were indeed an imposter it would save much unpleasantness for my family, and if she were the real Anastasia it was ghastly to think that nothing was being done for her.... This solution would be simple, so it seemed to me."</p>
<p>As children, Xenia and her sister Nina had played frequently with the two youngest daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, Maria Nicholaievna and Anastasia Nicholaievna, as well as the youngest child and only boy, Tsarevitch Alexei. Both sisters possessed vivid memories of their second cousin Anastasia, who they described as "frightfully temperamental" and "wild and rough". According to Xenia, Anastasia "cheated at games, kicked, scratched, pulled hair, and generally knew how to make herself obnoxious."</p>
<p>Princess Nina even said, "Anastasia was madly jealous of me because I was taller than she was. As the daughter of the Emperor she thought she ought to tower over everyone."</p>
<p>Xenia was on a cruise with her husband William in the West Indies at the time of Anna's arrival in New York. She had arranged for Anna to stay with Annie Burr Jennings, a friend of Xenia's who lived in a Park Avenue townhouse. Upon her return, Xenia sneaked unannounced into Annie Jennings's crowded salon to observe Anna. After watching Anna offer her hand to Gleb Botkin, Xenia declared that she knew she was watching an equal. She stated, "It was so matter-of-course, so unforced--in no way a theatrical gesture. With it she radiated a natural grandeur and I was impressed on the spot."</p>
<p>Xenia recognized Anna Anderson as the Grand Duchess Anastasia at once, asserting that Anna was herself at all times, never giving the slightest impression of playing a part. The two remained great friends for life.</p>
<p>Xenia died in Glen Cove, New York on 17 September, 1965.</p>

<p>The head scientist of <i>The Brotherhood of Ultra Science</i> named Dr.Harvey became impatiaint at the lack of test subjects and decided to inject the seruem into himself. Dr.Harvey did not become a Zombie but instead aquired the IQ of a Turnip (or possibly a politicion) and changed his name to Lenny Oldburn. There was a positive effect , Lenny became developed a healing factor witch makes him impossible to kill by normal means (he did not , however , not reveal witch formula he had taken). Lenny was soon put in charge of the desposing of the Zombies and was a skilled trapmaker.</p>
<p>Lennys fate when the Brotherhoods mansion was destroyed is unknown but he possibly survived.</p>

<p><i>Combat</i> is a game played by jugglers. The basic rules are quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a signal everyone starts juggling.</li>
<li>The last person juggling a full set of balls wins.</li>
<li>Holding one ball while juggling the others in one had is not permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combative aspect is that players are allowed to interfere with each other, as long at there is no actual physical contact between players.</p>
<p><i>Combat</i> is most often played with three balls per player. Very experienced jugglers may play combat with four or five balls (but the games are shorter), and brave jugglers may play with clubs.</p>
<p>Basic strategies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving face-to-face with an opponent so the opponent gets confused about which balls to catch. (Only works on novice players.)</li>
<li>Throwing one ball high, and using the time to wave a hand in front of an opponent.</li>
<li>Grabbing an opponent's ball out of the air, and either dropping one out your own balls, or continuing with four balls.</li>
<li>Grabbing a ball from one opponent and throwing it at another opponent. (Not allowed when playing with clubs.)</li>
<li>If the game is played with clubs, then it is possible to hit an opponent's club out of the air with one of your own.</li>
<li>Throwing one ball high and far away, so it is possible to safely hold the two remaining balls while running away from an aggressive opponent.</li>
<li>And of course, turning away from all opponents and hoping that they will drop a ball before you do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Michael Dennis is a rare creature. They say there only one true Michael Dennis in the world today. You will be able to identify him by his good looks, always smoking a Marlboro medium cigarette, and his usual stupidity. He is usually located at a Best Buy in the video game and movie section. If you do spot him here is how to lure him in: One way is to have a 20 dollar bill on the ground next to you and/or an unscratched lottery ticket. The second way is to go right up to him and start talking about movies and video games, but make sure that you don't seem more smarter than him and make sure you ask questions about video games. These are the things I have noticed this magnificent creature enjoys: video games, boxset movies, cigarettes, Mythbusters, Discovery Channel, his best friends Eytan and Anthony, his family, fireworks, and motorcycles. I have been able to study him for much time now and have realized he dislikes: getting his picture taken, Sega, Mustard, White Castle, when people leave the seat up after going to the bathroom, and for some strange reason ketchup on hot dogs and burgers. One of his favorite things to do is mess around with his friend Eytan, because Eytan gets angry very easily. Hopefully I will be able to learn more about this beautiful creature one of these days.</p>

<p>Nitro’s History</p>
<p>Growing up in Staten Island Kyle Jones always believed superheroes were real. He was a huge comic book fan and believed that comics were a written tapestry to an unseen world that few ever spoke of. Of course no one believed him. One day when he was 10 a girl moved in next door to him with her mother. That’s when things started to get strange. During that night at dinner a mysterious man came to Kyle’s house, his parents seemed to fear the man and forced him to leave. Later that night Kyle snuck over the new girls house to talk to her. As he began to mention the man she got anxious and a huge burst of fire came out of her body burning her house down. 10 years later Kyle is going to college in New York City, everyone believes that Kyle broke into the girl’s house and for some reason started the fire. No one believes his story about her having superpowers and her causing it. One day Kyle is running to catch the bus home from his college in the city. He knows if he misses the bus that he’ll be stuck in the city for another hour. He is running so fast to catch his bus that he doesn’t notice the blind lady crossing the street during a green light. She is hit by a car and struck dead, the car drives away. Kyle seeing this is in shock he cant believe this. Out of guilt and shock he instinctively runs after the car. As he is running his adrenaline is pumping through his body faster. He beings to run faster than normal. When he catches up to the car he rips the door off. He notices his hands glowing green, startled by this he trips backwards but instead of falling he is levitating in the air. Freaked out he runs into an ally and hides. Later an older man finds him, revealing to Kyle that he is his uncle and that he knows all about his powers and he has been watching him for a long time. Kyle’s uncle Jack enlists Kyle’s help as a graphic artist for his business firm, but really he employs Kyle into secret missions for him harnessing his super powers. On one of his missions Kyle crosses paths with Solaris the girl who’s house Kyle supposedly burned down. She tells Kyle that his uncle is really evil and he sent her to kill Kyle when he was little. Kyle not believing her leaves her and totally dismisses their encounter. One day Kyle is running late for work so he calls his sister Desiree up and asks if she could bring his “uniform” to his job. When Kyle’s sister gets to the office she sees her uncle killing a man. Kyle’s uncle notices her and as Kyle walks in for work he sees his uncle snap his sisters neck right in front of his eyes. Kyle distrust doesn’t know what to do and lunges at his uncle. His uncle disappears. Later Kyle realizes that his uncle was the man who came to his house when he was little. He meets up with Solaris again who visits him at his house. She tells him how his uncle is evil and has super powers as well, as far as they know Kyle’s uncle can replicate the power of anything he touches, humans, plants, elements etc. He also found out that people are born with powers that lay dormant; it takes a traumatic experience to shock these powers to the surface. Feeling fully responsible for his sister’s death and out of guilt he decides to make himself a costume. He chooses black and green for 2 reasons. Black symbolizes the sorrow he feels for his sister’s death and reminds him why he devotes his life to save people and do good. And the green is to show his power the color of his body’s energy aura. He also wears Goggles not just because they keep the wind out of his eyes when he is flying, but because they hide his tears. Kyle dons the name Nitro and embarks on the noble quest of every superhero, to save the world. But Kyle is just a kid. His impulsive and arrogant. He gets to full of himself and always messes up, he never learns and can never do anything right. He has a lot of growing up to do. Nitro’s powers are all derived from the flow o f adrenaline in his body. The more adrenaline the more power. When his adrenaline is flowing Kyle can run at super speed, almost mach 1. He becomes super strong and can lift extremely heavy thing, close to 1 ton. He can use his electromagnetic energy in his body to stun people; he can also make the electromagnetic energy visible in a solid green light and electrocute people. He also uses the electromagnetic energy in his body to negate the electrons in his body to the opposite charge of the magnetic poles of earth and he can fly thanks to that. Also with his electromagnetic energy he can create a force field around himself rendering him virtually invincible. BUT he has to constantly concentrate on what he is doing. If he loses concentration he can slip up and his adrenaline can drop and his powers with it. Like I said he is arrogant and becomes full of himself a lot and more often then not he loses concentration. The huge downside is that all that adrenaline destroys his body, it increases his blood pressure and does a lot of damage to his heart.</p>
<p>Creating Nitro I’ve been thinking about Nitro since I was about 10 years old. I always loved comics and drawing them, I even played with action figures and acted out cool stories, or at least stories I thought were cool. Nitro’s seen a lot of changes over the years, when I first started out with Nitro I wanted him to be a normal human who was caught in the middle of a post apocalyptic future controlled by robots. He was a kid caught in the resistance and he fought to restore the earth. As the years went on and I became older I began to get into Green Lantern and Superman a lot. So I decided that Nitro would have powers, only problem was what powers to give him. I decided he would have superman’s strength, speed, invulnerability and flight. But I wanted to make them different only thing was I didn’t know how. That’s where green lantern came along, I loved the fact that Green Lantern couldn’t just use his powers when he wanted, that he had to really work hard and concentrate. But I still couldn’t decide how to adapt a hero to the real world. A few years later when I was 17 I got the idea after running track in high school, that his powers would all be controlled by his adrenaline. We all know that when our adrenaline is pumping we are faster and stronger etc. that was the missing piece that put the powers into perspective. Now I knew that Nitro could only become strong and fast and fly and do all that he did only when his adrenaline was flowing and only when he concentrated hard enough to use them. So I began working on costume designs. Being a huge fan of green lantern I went with his color scheme, green and black. The costume went through many different transformations until I settled on the one that I liked the best. All seemed to be ready for Nitro. But there was one thing missing, he had no substance no character. I didn’t want him to be in his post apocalyptic future anymore so now I decided to set him in more modern times and base his history more on mine. He would start out as a little kid who believed superheroes were real and he would grow up on Staten Island and eventually go to college in the city and make New York his base of operations or his city that he would save. But she still seemed to be missing something. That’s where the final piece of the puzzle came in, Spiderman. I loved Spiderman for the one simple reason that he is fallible. Spiderman and Peter Parker are not like Superman and Clark Kent. They’re not perfect they always mess up and Peter’s life is racked by a huge amount of tragedy especially for just being Spiderman. So that’s what I decided to do, I wanted Nitro’s life and the reasons he became a hero to be all because of tragedy that was either directly or indirectly caused by him. I wanted his whole life to be motivated by guilt. And so finally all the pieces were laid out and put together and Nitro as you know him was born. What I love about Nitro is that he uses humor to cover up for all the pain and tragedy that he has experienced and seen in his life. But also now with this new back round I gave him his costume isn’t just a tribute to green lantern the colors mean much more. And I gave him goggles for a reason. It was something Green Arrow said in the Justice League once. He wears a mask because it hides the tears.</p>

<p>TuneLand is a musical program designed for preschool and young elementary students. A character, named Little Howie, plays hide and seek as the student explores many different areas of a farm. These areas include: the barnyard, the farmhouse, the barn, the pond, grandma's house, the train station, the mountain, and the valley. During the game there are more than 40 children's songs that are played by clicking on different animals or buildings in the various scenes. Some of the songs include Old MacDonald, Turkey in the Straw, Three Blind Mice, I'm a Little Teapot, Itsy Bitsy Spider, among many others. The gameplay includes puzzles such as finding Little Howie. The animation was considered excellent for the time. This was one of the first games produced by <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_Level_1a54.html" title="7th Level">7th Level</a>, a software company that lasted from 1993 until 1997.</p>

<p>A film by Peter Greenaway, made in 1983. Also known as The Sea in Their Blood, and exhibited at National Maritime Museum, Greenwich UK, as 'Beside the Sea'. It is a mockumentary or "artificial documentary", featuring images of the British seaside and voiceovers of endless dibous statistics. For example: "Most fish is eaten in Britain fried in batter and breadcrumbs. 10 percent is boiled, 5 percent grilled, 3 percent is steamed. Very little is eaten raw except by cats and in Japanese restaurants, 29 in London and 1 in Milton Keynes."</p>

The last two novels were authored by American author Raymond Benson. However, Benson announced he is no long authoring the novels, and it is currently unknown who penned the third book.</p>
<p>This title is still unpublished, so its plot is unknown. It is slated for a November 2006 release.</p>

<p>Gary Bairos grew up in Northern California in the 80's and developed a keen physical skill and mentallity that enabled him to overcome many obstacles. Waking up on the farm every morning and even getting shot in the head by a kid who would later die in a car accident, Gary Bairos did not have it easy. With a tough fighter's mentallity, he sought to follow the footsteps of the legendary Dan Gable and came very close to making it to the Olympics and capturing the gold. Now a phenomenal wrestling coach who has already helped builed the high caliber wrestling technique of such superstars as Matthew Kenjiro Porter who is now at Colombia University, Gary sees marriage and maybe even a wrestling stud of his own in the near future. Also known as Jimmy Gamble, he starred in the hit film Somebody is Waiting, playing the incredible character Daniel. Also featured in the hit television series Spooner, Gary starred as a high school wrestling superstar and delighted all the girls on set with his powerful hips. Standing five feet five inches tall, he once wrestled at 118 pounds, but has recently added about thirty pounds of bulging muscle, much to the like of all the ladies he has encountered along the way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-11_a7d5.html" title="Edit section: John Shillito Co. (Shillito's Department Store)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">John Shillito Co. (Shillito's Department Store)</span></h2>
<p>Cincinnati's first and oldest department store was founded by John Shillito, who worked as a clerk for Cincinnati's leading dry-goods merchants, Blanchly and Simpson. In 1832, Shillito bought the business and merged it with a store owned by William McLaughlin, and known as McLaughlin &amp; Shillito. The following year, Shillito left the partnership and joined with Robert W. Burnet and James Pullen to form Shillito, Burnet and Pullen. In 1837, Shillito bought his partners' interests and started John Shillito and Co., billed as the most commodious dry-goods store west of the Alleghenies.</p>
<p>Shillito's built a new store in 1857, on Fourth Street between Vine and Race. Shillito's moved to Seventh and Race streets in August 1878 in a store designed by architect James McLaughlin, who also designed other landmark Cincinnati buildings, including the Cincinnati Art Museum. Modeled after Le Bon Marche, a famous Paris department store, the new building's steel skeleton was a new innovation that inspired the Chicago style of modern commercial architecture. The interior was spectacular, with a six-story atrium flanked with elaborate Victorian iron railings, with a grand staircase and topped with a 60-foot-diameter hexagonal glass dome, which, though covered, still tops the building.</p>
<p>The city's retail center did not gravitate to Shillito's new location as they had hoped, and competition slowed the store's growth until 1928 when the the company was absorbed by the <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarus_%28department_store%29.html" title="Lazarus (department store)">F&amp;R Lazarus &amp; Company</a> of Columbus. A year later, Lazarus (along with its Shillito's subsidiary) joined with Filene's of Boston and Abraham &amp; Strauss in Brooklyn to create Federated Department Stores, which initially had its headquarters in Columbus, but moved to Cincinnati in 1945.</p>
<p>Federated merged Shillito's with Rikes of Dayton in 1982, changing the name to Shillito-Rikes. Four years later, the chain merged with Lazarus in Columbus, and the Shillito name was dropped.</p>

<p>Following a meteoric rise to fame as <i>Miscellaneous Grifter Number 7</i> in Monash University's recital of the Dickens' classic <i>Oliver</i>, Moloney's acting career soon coalesced in a tepid pool of poor decision-making and ill-gotten dancing cats.</p>
<p>Born David Molovshomann in Queens New York in 1975, he enjoyed a carefree childhood throwing rocks at bee hives and skipping stones in shallow pools of sewage. His fascination with wind came at age 9, when, in a freak thunderstorm, Molovshomann claimed that "the wind picked me up and whispered in my ear - it said that everything was going to be alright, and that Aunt Linda didn't find out about that time I drove my trike into her car."</p>
<p>In adolescence, he changed his name to Damon Moloney, partly because it "sounded cooler" but mostly to hide his Jewish heritage from the cruel eyes of the showbiz and wind fraternities. Following graduation from St. Nancy's Boarding School For Chumps, his family moved to Melbourne Australia, where they hoped to expose their obviously prodigious son to the foreign culture and facilities of a country less ruthless than their own.</p>
<p>Accepted into a Bachelor of Engineering (Wind &amp; Acting) course in 1991, Moloney soon found himself the big man on campus. He was breaking his lecturer's thereoms as well as all the girls' hearts. But all was not well in Moloney-ville.</p>
<p>After an ad for the part of <i>Micellaneous Grifter Number 7</i> in a recital of <i>Oliver</i> caught his eye in the university newspaper - Monash Musings - he soon found himself spurning his studying commitments in favour of auditions, taxidermy and petty theft (see <i>Toilet Paper Theft</i>).</p>

<p>Sabumania is the enormous cult-like fan following of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Championship_Wrestling_ced8.html" title="Extreme Championship Wrestling">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a> professional wrestler, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabu.html" title="Sabu">Sabu</a>. He is known the world over for his willingness to put his body as well as his career on the line to give his fans their proverbial "money's worth" and put on a good show. His success in the hardcore style of wrestling and participation in dangerous match types has earned him quite an amount of fame and notoriety in the wrestling world, securing him the moniker of the Homicidal, Genocidal, Suicidal, Death-Defying Maniac among fans and wrestling promoters. Sabumania is sometimes compared to the more well-known <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulkamania.html" title="Hulkamania">Hulkamania</a> of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> fame. Although the two phrases themselves are similar-sounding, they do not share much common ground, contrary to popular belief. Realistically, the nature of Sabu's fanbase as compared to that of <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulk_Hogan_3ba4.html" title="Hulk Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> are very different. Sabumaniacs, as they are called, are much less civilized than the average Hulkamaniac, and do not follow morals and values quite as socially acceptable as Hulk Hogan's infamous "demandments" (saying prayers, taking vitamins, etc). Sabumaniacs follow such guidelines as "always have a fair amount of barbed wire handy" and "never leave home without a steel chair." Overall, it is an understatement to say Sabumania has taken the wrestling world by storm, and continues to spread among fans of the man and the sport as a whole, especially the hardcore style.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-11_a7d5.html" title="Edit section: Some car article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Some car article</span></h2>
<p>There were only 5 produced in the early 80s. This is an extremely rare vehicle which sits two people; one in the front and one in the back. The passenger actually straddles the front seat. Remember, this is a trike and possesses motorcycle plates. Unfortunately, the molds were destroyed and there will never be any others made. If you desire one of the most unusual vehicles to add to your collection, do not let this one slip through your hands. I have had a great time working and transforming this vehicle into what I use as a daily driver. However, what might appear as a quick stop to the local post office or bank always requires more time than imagined. The reason is simple, if I stop for anything, the crowds are enormous and I always take time to answer everyone’s questions. All in all, the Tryon utilizes an exceedingly stable frame and very reliable components. The eraser sized remote control operates the pneumatic top, a motorized set of front Canard wings, a rear engine hatch with two large fresh air intake scoops, and the front hood. When the front opens, a small micro switch activates a light show which will surpass any “been there, done that” individual’s wildest conceptions. A medley of circuit boards and variously colored, shaped, and operated lights leaves a person gazing over every square inch for hours. Some lights rotate, some flash in sequence, while others permit user friendly programming. The trike portrays an impressive mystique and demands a crowd at the local car shows, especially after dark! It is interesting to stand away from the vehicle at car shows and operate the front cover via the remote control and then act like you are just another spectator. When everyone asks, “what do all the lights and switches and electronic boards do”, I just explain that one is for the Cloaking device, another is for the Fulton torpedoes, and another is the Warp drive, and every other conceivable Star Wars and Star Trek word and phrase that comes to mind. This vehicle turns any grim day into great fun. When the rear engine hatch opens, blue neon lights accent the engine and the compartment. I also have Knight Rider lights installed in the front of the hood which appear to move from left to right based on the driver’s frequency specifications. From any angle, this trike has a “show stopper” appearance. Landing lights located on each side, just in front of the rear wheels, even illuminate the ground on the lower side of the body. Translucent black Plexiglas masks them until they are activated.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Engine: Volkswagen Type III, 2300cc: new crankshaft, “H” beam 4130 rods with ARP bolts, forged pistons, custom exhaust, custom high volume oil pump, custom machined center plenum chamber with Holley 650 cfm four barrel carb, purple powder painted sheet metal and cooling shroud, electronic ignition with magnetic pickup, special high strength “draw bolts”, and dual port heads with oversized valves. The engine has also been totally balanced. There is a remote oil filter, remote oil cooler with electric fan, polished aluminum remote crankcase breather, and a remote fuel pressure gauge. The electronic ignition is a Mallory Hyfire VI with a Mallory high output coil.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Transmission: professionally rebuilt 4 speed, 12 pound flywheel, 2100 pound pressure plate, new competition clutch, new throw-out bearing, larger half shafts with heady duty CV joints, and custom manufactured shift linkage. Disc brakes were installed and a custom bracket was fabricated to allow for dual calipers on each wheel. This means that there are four brake pads for each side. This compensates for no brake on the front. There is also a mechanical emergency brake. Needless to say, it has independent rear suspension.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Interior: The custom interior is done in shades of purple, pink, and white. Every switch on the dash serves a function. There is even a switch that is labeled “Hvr”. When turned on there are long florescent tubes that illuminate the bottom of the trike and make it look as if it were hovering. The light blue squares are fuses, the dark blue squares are lights, and the red squares are push button switches. All the gauges are Dakota Digital and include: speedometer, tachometer, head temperature, vacuum, fuel pressure, volt meter, fuel level, oil pressure, and oil temperature, intake manifold vacuum, and air/fuel mixture. The square on the upper left side of the dash is a color LCD screen for the color rear view camera. Very important for viewing rear Fazor attacks from Klingons or just to view people who walk behind the vehicle! There is even a vertical compass and a Clinometer with artificial horizon, to indicate rate of bank during high speed maneuvers. As you can see from the pictures of the interior there is no steering wheel, but rather a yoke from a Cessna 172.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Stereo: JVC-DVD/CD Receiver KD-AVX1 with motorized viewable color LCD screen, Bazooka Tube BTA6100 6” subwoofer, and a Jensen PS475 300 watt 4 Channel power amplifier. There is even a rear 7” LCD screen for the “Weapons Control Engineer”. For you earthbound, this is the person who sits in the back seat. There is every a sound generator that they can operate with a speaker in one of the rear scoops. The normal speakers for the stereo are Transparent Series Blaupunkt TSc540 with illuminated LED rings behind them. Once again, great for night viewing! There are two electric antennas and even a Cobra 40 channel CB radio. This is very important feature and allows two communication with base command, other spacecraft, or truck drivers.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>General; the car has new paint which is silver metal flake on top with purple bottom. Believe me when I say “the pictures do not do the vehicle justice”. The tires and custom rear aluminum wheels are new. The cockpit is heated by an ingenious method diverting engine heat through the rectangle box tube frame to the front interior. There is also a powered ventilation system. Due to the engine located in the rear, the summer heat does not warrant any problems. I want to make it perfectly clear, THIS VEHICLE IS NOT FOR THE “MILD MANERED” OR “TIMID”. It exists for someone who desires the best, does not mind extra attention, and enjoys a great time. Rest assured when you pull into the local car show, nothing will stand a chance. To my knowledge, only 2 of the 5 vehicles produced are in operational condition. This trike extends “light years” beyond the competition. And yes, the windshield wiper works flawlessly. This list could go on and on for an eternity so if you have a strong interest I will be glad to fill you in on all the other details. The Tryon must be picked up at my home and necessitates a briefing for its new owner. The vehicle is being sold as is with no warranty expressed or implied. I cannot overemphasize the rarity of this vehicle. DO NOT LET IT GET BY. As the saying goes “GET IN, SIT DOWN, SHUT UP, AND HANG ON”.</p>

Letum is latin for genral death and ruin. It is not usualy used for single or specific deaths. It is the origin of the English word "Lethal". Letum is also a figure in Roman mythology in wich Letum is described as a death-spirit or a monster of the underworld. The bord game "Tabula Letum" (litteraly "Death Bord") or "Tabult" is a 2 player bord game that originated in Northen Europe where it was commonly known as "tafl" meaning "table". Many diffrent versions of the game where played all over Europe. Refrances to the game have been found as far back as 400AD, althow the game is widely belived to be older.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> began play as the Baltimore Orioles in 1901. This team is unrelated to today's <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>, who were moved from St. Louis to Baltimore in 1954.</p>
<p>The early Baltimore Orioles were created as a strategic venture by <a href="../../../b/a/n/Ban_Johnson_4818.html" title="Ban Johnson">Ban Johnson</a> and the American League. At the time, the then-minor league was attempting to become a major league, but its agreement with the National League prevented it from placing a team in New York. When the agreement ended, the American League began reorganizing its franchises to target key markets previously controlled by the National League. In January 1903, the American and National Leagues held a "peace conference" to settle conflicts over player contract disputes and to agree on future cooperation. The NL also agreed that the American League could establish a franchise in New York. The Baltimore Orioles moved to Hilltop Park stadium at 165th St. and Broadway in Manhattan and became the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Highlanders_06c8.html" title="New York Highlanders">New York Highlanders</a>.</p>
<p>The Highlanders were later renamed the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in 1913.</p>

<p>Ocasionally done acting in short scenes for minor parts and soccer tricks to raise money for charities Scott Moulds is like a young version of Ronaldinho. Well known in the NSW area Scott dominates with his unnatural and amazing soccer skills. Some of his most memorable feats include getting the ball in his own half running around 5 or 6 players then chipping the keeper for a 1-0 lead. On another occasion he pushed the ball around the keeper the,stopped it dead on the line, got down on his hands and knees and rolled it in with his head. His most well known appearance was when he shot from half way, hit the crossbar for his teammate to header into the back of the net. They won this match 7-0. Scott is an attaking midfielder and he plays on either the left or the right. He is double footed and his personal freestyle soccer records are of high quality.</p>
<p>Most kick ups:286</p>
<p>Longest footstall (balancing on foot):1 hour 53 minutes 29 seconds</p>
<p>Longest balance on head: 2 minutes 39 seconds</p>
<p>Favourite dribbling trick:Dummy drag-back (personal trick) fakes to go forward, spins foot around the ball then stops it and runs around the back of the player</p>
<p>Height:189.5cm</p>
<p>Weight:68.5kg</p>
<p>In the movie Goal when Santiago goes past the school and the ball comes over the fence Santiago does some fancy tricks. Those are Scotts feet.</p>
<p>He currently plays for Carlingford Redbacks top division as a midfielder and Captain. He is the leading goalscorer in the league with 17. The team are coming 1st place with 43 goals.</p>

<p>I\'ve just requested this so the editors of wikipedia realise that recently the mid wales Local Authority Powys County Council has blocked wikipedia under the title \"personal pages\", popwys county councils \"smart filter\" is active in all the schools and colleges in the area. This means that students are unable to view any of the huge amount of information available on this great site. I am a student in a college that has the smart filter, other students and myself have tried contacting the administrators but have had no response, would it be possible for an editor to spend a few moments composing an email saying that this is an affront to freedom of speech? the cache admins email is: cache-manager@powys.gov.uk, sorry if I\'ve wasted your time but I think this is important.</p>

<p>Wang Ruoshui (1926-2002)</p>
<p>The preeminent voice of humanist Marxist in China, playing a pivotal role in "emancipation of the mind" in the post- Mao era. He spoke with great authority as a former true believer in the Marxist orthodoxy of the Mao era, who sought to rebuild Chinese philosophy following the calamity of the Cultural revoltuion.</p>
<p>Wang Ruoshui entered the Department of Philosophy, Beijing University, in 1946. Having joined the Communist Party prior to liberation in 1949, he was recruited on graduation to the <i>People's Daily</i> in late 1950, becoming an editor in the theory group. In the 50's he took an active part in criticism of <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Shi_dee6.html" title="Hu Shi">Hu Shi</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liang_Shuming_992c.html" title="Liang Shuming">Liang Shuming</a>, who had been intellectual authorities with large followings among youth in the Republican era. He later launched a long-term debate with Yang Xianzhen over the question of the “identity of thought and existence”. In 1963 published "The Philosophy of the Table ", which was praised by Chairman <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Cultural Revolution, Mao had called for denunciations of "revisionism" in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Prominent in those countries had been critiques of Communist orthodoxy making use of the rediscovered works of the young Marx which heavily emphasised the concept of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alienation.html" title="Alienation">alienation</a>. Mao's literary henchman Zhou Yang appointed a study group including Wang Ruoshui to write attacks on the ideas of Lukacs and others who used alienation and "Marxist humanism." Many of this group, including Wang, came to see the the humanist doctrine as fundamentally correct, and later found that alienation helped explain the cult of Mao and the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>In the wake of Mao's death and the downfall of his faction in 1976, Wang was promoted to vice editor-in-chief of the People's Daily. At the beginning of the 80's, he published “On the concept of alienation,” “About the alienation issue,” introducing the concept of alienation to Chinese readers, and raising the possibility of alienation under socialist conditions. He also published “Man is the point of departure of Marxism,” “In defense of humanism,” advocating Marxist humanism.</p>
<p>By this time, Wang's sharp critique of orthodox theories of hardliners like Mao's former secretary Hu Qiaomu led to his dismissal from the Communist Party in the campaign against "bourgeois liberalisation" in 1987.</p>
<p>Wang had been appointed a delegate to the fifth National People's Congress (1978-1982), and members of the CCP Central Committee Discipline Inspection Committee. He retired from such posts following his dismissal from the Party.</p>
<p>He also held eld concurrent positions as researcher, CASS Institute of philosophy; member of the editorial committee of Philosophy Research; member of board of National Research Association for Dialectical Materialism; Director, editorial board, Encyclopedia Sinica (volume on philosophy), and honorary professor in the Department of Philosophy, Liaoning University.</p>
<p>Wang Ruoshui was twice (1989 and 1993) a visiting scholar at the John King Fairbank Center, Harvard University. In 1994 visiting scholar at Berkeley. In 1998 second half year went to Sweden, was appointed visiting professor, East Asia and the Southeast Asia research center Lund University.</p>

The International One Metre (IOM) is one of the most popular international radio sailing classes. The class rules require a monohull of maximum length 1000 mm, with a maximum draught of 420 mm. The minimum weight of 4 kg ensures that home-building of competitive yachts is entirely possible. The IOM has three one-design rigs for sailing in different wind conditions.</p>

<p>(+RAMTV) is an international team of five young architects formed during their master studies at the Architectural Associations Design Research Laboratory (AADRL) in London. The five constant members are: Aljosa Dekleva (Slovenia), Manuela Gatto (Italy), Tina Gregoric (Slovenia), Robert Sedlak (Germany), and Vasili Stroumpakos (Greece).</p>
<p>Instead of one physical architectural office (+RAMTV) operates as a network of virtual offices, working in different environments, coming together to share knowledge and carry out research projects.</p>
<p>The book "negotiate my boundary!", London, AA-Publications 2002 and Basel, Birkhauser 2006 by (+RAMTV) documents the design and research of an architectural project undertaken at the AADRL. As part of an integrated Design Studio, Workshop and Seminar series at the AADRL that began in October 2000 and finished in January 2002, (+RAMTV) was formed by these five students to pursue research into information-based, digitally-oriented, and above all networked approaches to the forces re-shaping architectural design and urbanism today. Their final project, titled <i>negotiate my boundary!</i>, proposes a field of customised, responsive, dwelling units for an under-developed site in the King's Cross area of London.</p>

<p>[["This has been an amazing chance to get inspired by other young artists," said Dreshnik Tahirbegoli, 17, of Peje, Kosovo. "This is my first time making a documentary. It was a lot of work, and we weren't always sure what we were doing. Now I want to go back and work with my friends to produce another one."</p>
<p>Tahirbegoli shot his movie, "Postcard From Peje," with digital video cameras provided by an organization called Kosovo Youth Video Project. The students involved in the project turned the donated cameras on themselves -- each relating what it was like to return home to a city 70 percent destroyed by the war with Serbia. ]]. --&gt;</p>

<p><b>Steve Barlow</b> (real name Steven Lowe) and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Skidmore_205e.html" title="Steve Skidmore">Steve Skidmore</a> - collectively known as 'The two Steves - are collaborative writers who mostly work in the field of children's literature. Steve Barlow has recently relocated to Somerset while Steve Skidmore is based in Leicester. They began collaborating in 1987 after meeting while working at Fairham Comprehensive School in Nottingham, and have produced a large body of work (outlined below) on a freelance basis. Recent works include the Outernet series (Scholastic) - an ambitious book/web crossover project with many interactive elements - and The Dark Forest comic fantasies (Collins). Over the years they have produced the "Mad Myths" series (Puffin, reissued by Barn Owl), the "Vernon Bright" series (Puffin), and contributions to the "Lost Diaries" series (Collins). They have also written a large body of work for educational publishers, and have been series editors for Impact and High Impact (materials for struggling readers) for Heinemann, as well as series editors for Heinemann Plays and Oxford Playscripts. Their first published work was a book of three short plays, "Paper Tigers" in the Oxford Playscripts series. They have more recently branched out into parody books such as "Star Bores", written to coincide with the release of Episode 1 of the Star Wars film franchise. However, the bulk of their work still remains in the field of childen's and teenage literature. A number of their books have been translated into other languages, and The Mad Myths, Vernon Bright, The Dark Forest and Erik Bloodaxe books have been released as spoken word tapes. They continue to work together and produce new projects. For more detailed information, visit their website - www.the2steves.ne</p>

<p>(as referenced to in your own website articles on KIX-band, steve whiteman, maryland hair metal bands, etc...) hammerjacks nightclub was located at 1101 s. howard st. in baltimore, md. it closed in 1996 to make way for a parking lots forthe baseball stadium. common bands playing there were KIX, DIRTY LOOKS, WRATHCHILD AMERICA, and MANY other east coast metal/ glam metal bands. pretty much everybody played there at some point. it was a 2 story building separated into halves...concert hall on one side with open lower floor and upper balcony looking down onto the stage, the other side was basically just a bar and on any given weekend the music (metal) was so loud in the place it was hard to talk at times. during the 80s it was the "go to" place in southern/central maryland as a club for metalheads. one could always tell a regular patron as they had large bumper-stickers with HAMMERJACK'S logo that were given out on the bar side of the building. for a time in the late 80s it was almost a guarantee you would get pulled over by the police if you had the sticker on your vehicle along with long hair and a semi-dressed female passenger in the car. in the bar... leather jackets, ripped-up jeans,spandex and fishnet clothing were not abnormal for either males or females. the parking lot (under a highway overpass) was generally just as crowded with kids too young to get in or others just trying to sober up or make out in their cars. it was one of the last of the true "rock &amp; roll" specific clubs left in the USA.</p>
<p><br />
not part of the article: all of the above i can speak from personal experience....it was definitly such a part of the 80s culture it was unbelievable! after growing up and moving west myself, i was still saddened to learn of it's closing in '96. probably no place like it left open these days except maybe in L.A. for verification of any of this you need only talk to STEVE WHTEMAN, BRAD DIVENS, SHANNON LARKIN, MARYLAND MUSICIAN MAGAZINE, KIX, or any south baltmore police officer from the 80s. oh yeah....i still have a hammerjacks bumper sticker stashed in my toolbox along with a couple of the little matchbooks they gave out that had a place on the inside for names and phone numbers along with a rating scale of 1-10 of the prospective "dates" you met at the bar&#160;!</p>

Morgan, William and Cornelius Vanderbilt, and their pals arrived on the social scene in the 1890s, established society still looked askance at bankers and financiers, and its Downtown clubs were closed to Morgan and anyone else it considered less than up to snuff. Never to be slighted or outdone, Morgan commissioned Stanford White to design him his own club, bigger, better and grander than all the rest – and so the Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th St was born, an exuberant confection with a marvelously outrageous gateway. Just the thing for arriving robber barons. 151.191.175.220 17:37, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eglingham is a small hamlet in North Northumberland, in the United Kingdom, approximately 12km North West of the market town of Alnwick (Latitude: 55° 27' 0 N, Longitude: 1° 49' 0 W or OS map reference: NU106194). The village lies in the sheltered valley of the Eglingham Burn, about 120 metres above sea level, in a rural conservation area set amongst beautiful rolling countryside, within 5km of the Cheviot hills. There are about 30 houses, a pub called the Tankerville Arms and a small mansion house known as Eglingham Hall, built originally as the home of the Ogle family. Oliver Cromwell is said to have visited it. St. Maurice's church dates from the 13th Century and may originally have served as a fortified 'pele tower' where the villagers could take refuge from marauding bands of cattle thieves, or <b>border reivers</b>. It was reportedly almost totally destroyed in an attack in Tudor times, requiring significant re-building. The village is also home to Eglingham Church of England First School, a small primary school of about 40 pupils and classified by the government as a 'Beacon School' because of its excellent standing.</p>

Europe has a long tradition of <b>immigration</b>.

<p>In 2001, immigrant people number leaving legaly within the territory from 15 european union members then was estimated at 14,3 millions people, that is 3,8 % of the population.</p>

<p>Double Negative Appearance (or DNA for short) Is a four piece metal band from hampshire, england. Their style is hard define but the closest would probably a mix of Emo, Goth, and Industrial metal. The frontman, bass player and lead vocalist tells us his main influences are Muse, Rammstein, and Sergei Rachmaninoff compared to Alex's contrasting influence from green day and Linkin Park.</p>
<p>Members: Arjen 'ren' van den Berg - lead vocals, bass guitar</p>
<pre>
        Alex Duncan              - Guitar
        Josh wheeden             - Guitar
        Leigh Holly              - Drums
</pre>
<p>Influences - Rammstein, Muse, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Antonio Vivaldi, Calr Orff, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Green Day, Killswitch Engage.</p>
<p>The lyrics tend to be angry and metaphorical, they comment on specific people rather than society on a whole. There is plenty of discussion in the local scene about the quality of the vocals, in some places they can be off on occasions. People say it is on purpose other people say its not. "F*ck Knows" says vocalist Ren "I really don't care if the vocals are spot on or not, on places i am off and i do it intentionally, on most places its probably not my intention, but i really don't care. A beautiful voice is for beautiful music, and i wouldn't call our tunes beautiful."</p>
<p>The guitars are melodic from Alex Duncans Part with tendencies to use the higher ranges of the guitar often with phasers, chorus, flanger, reverb and a lot of disortion. Josh Wheeden uses much simpler sounds by using a "Digitech Death Metal" distortion pedal.</p>
<p>Again the bass guitar uses a lot of effect processes, often a Big Muff Distortion pedal, ring modulator, phaser, chorus, flange, step filters, Reverb and Wah. The large amounts of effects used result in a sound once described as "Dirtier than Granny Bondage"</p>

<p>Tokihiro Sato began as a sculptor, but is most well known for his photography, specifically for photos which he exposes for a really long time and walks around and directs light toward the camera with a mirror. In the resulting image, you do not see him, but you see many white flashes where he directed the light with the mirror.</p>

<p>In other news, an alien has been spotted residing in Alabama. It was arrested in an abandoned basement with a belt fastened around its arm. Apparently, the only good thing it found in Earth was shooting heroin. The alien, whose Galactic ID bore its name as "Asxne'op Gzzio", was taken into custody and charged with illegal entry into a planet, possession &amp; use of heroin &amp; paraphernalia, and assault for allegedly vaporizing one of the arresting officers with a newly-discovered beam ray. The cops are allegedly making the weapon to replace their own guns.</p>
<p>This just in: the alien arrested in an Alabama basement has plead not guilty to all charges. He claims his heroin is a medicine he must take or else he will die from what he calls "galactic withdrawal pains." He also said he was permitted to enter Earth, and allowed to vaporize the intruding officer that "abusingly arrested" him. Mr. Gzzio, a short, slim green-skinned life-form is speaking through his lawyer, Rodney Cochran, relative of the late Johnny Cochran. If Asxne'op Gzzio is found guilty of all charges, he will face 13 light years of imprisonment on Zrrlig Alpha-8, a prison planet of our galaxy. He also faces deportation from planet Earth for the rest of his natural life.</p>

R.K. Baliga (Ram Krishna Baliga) (born 29 Dec, 1929, died Oct 26, 1988)-Father of the Electronics City in Bangalore India.</p>
<p>According to the Indian Express (1), in the early 1970's Mr Baliga envisoned making Bangalore the "Silicon Valley of India" and it was met with skepticism. However, the then Chief Minister Devaraj Urs of Karnataka decided to support him and made him the Chairman of the Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation [Keonics] in 1976 (1). In 1978 Keonics established Electronics City on 332 acres in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur Village, near Bangalore (4). The development of the Electronic City gained substantial momentum after India liberalized its economy in early 1990's. According to the Keonics website the Electronics City today houses over 100 information technology and electronics companies who employ over 30,000 personnel (4).</p>
<p>He was also president of the Indian Institute of Plant Engineers which comprised of 4000 members according to the Deccan Herald (2), president of International Club at Westinghouse Electric Corporation (USA) (3), and president of Karnataka Productivity Council (1).</p>
