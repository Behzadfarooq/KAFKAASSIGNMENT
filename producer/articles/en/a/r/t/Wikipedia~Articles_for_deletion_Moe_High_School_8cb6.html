<li><b>Delete</b> - As of this moment, there is no verifiable information in this article. Therefore it must be deleted, pending a substantial rewrite with sources. "Notability" is an absurd thing to even discuss, when the issue should be about verifiability. To the nom, Quoted from *essay* on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> "<i>This is not a policy or guideline.</i>". Finally, please quit this rubbish about precedent of merging primaries. No such precedent exists. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is the closest thing to standard (but not standard), and its all about content, not education level. Elementaries tend to have less content, and are more likely to be merged, but not simply because they are a lower level. Actually precedent is to keep all verified schools regardless. But some of us have been willing to compromise, and accept mergers of substubs (partly in a pursuit of peace). Please don't misread the compromise of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> to be anti-primary school. Its not. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:14, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for finding that, but for now, I'm staying with delete.

<li><b>Comment</b> It is difficult to make a decision. Was the school replaced by another school? Moe is certainly a prominant place and could well have a High School.

<li>The problem with a merge is that this *was* a school. We don't know precisely what happened to it (we know the remnants of the building were dumped somewhere improperly, so that confirms its demolished). Where do we merge a closed school to? Do you list it in <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe%2C_Victoria_fb38.html" title="Moe, Victoria">Moe, Victoria</a>, possibly next to currently open school(s)? Maybe make a new article on a school district (if one is applicable), and make a closed school as its first, and initially only entry? I submit that often *more* information is needed to do a merge, than to have a stand alone article. For instance, when merging, you need to know what if any district is relevant, and any/all communities served by a school. We don't know that. Currently, we can probably be confident that <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe%2C_Victoria_fb38.html" title="Moe, Victoria">Moe, Victoria</a> is 100% correct. Why would we wish to spoil that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
