<p>Starts with "<i>The following Amiga games have especially good music:</i>". Presumably most Amiga games have music, and this is infact a list of games and not the music within them. Not only is it POV, but its more listcruft. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 23:31, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I removed the POV. Amiga games of the late 1980s, particularly the Amiga version of Lemmings, used to be streets ahead of the IBM-style PCs of the time. Danny Elfman used to use Amigas. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:13, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The list is for Amiga game music, but for the best part this is just a list of a few Amiga games. And no matter how good Lemmings was, thats nothing to do with music. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 00:27, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To clarify, I mean the music of the Amiga versions of games was better. PC sound wasn't really standardized at the time whereas Amigas came with a pretty good 8-bit wave player built-in. The music for the Amiga version of Lemmings *made* the game. Other Amiga games that were noted for their music (sometimes the music was far better than the game) were Beast, Elf and Toki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 01:33, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Have you "removed the POV"? All that's happened is you've removed the line where it says "this is the particularly good music", it's still the same selective list as before, of select music in a few select games which the author of the list viewed as good, and although it doesn't say it anymore, it still is just that. Even if you could balance it out, it would still not make it notable. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 14:08, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no consensus on a notability criterion for non-biographical articles. And check the <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. POV is a criterion for cleanup, not deletion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:55, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then a claim about POV being removed isn't relevent then, is it?&#160;;) Just because there's no consensus on notability of non-persons doesn't mean that they're inelible for VFD, it just means that not everyone is going to agree! -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 20:07, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>To clarify, I absolutely have no problem with the idea of listing this article on VfD. So I agree with you there. I'm simply making refutations for your arguments for deletion, to the best of my ability. It won't be the end of the world if this article is deleted, but I don't think it should be. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:06, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As a rule, I fail to see how such lists are notable. --<a href="../../../x/c/a/User%7EXcali_e28f.html" title="User:Xcali">Xcali</a> 05:29, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It seems interesting.. How is this verifiable, though? These games are noted for their music, by what people, were this information collected from game reviews, or by some other method? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 05:55, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Judging by the POV introduction which was there, the information wasn't collected at all. It's just a list of the authors favourite game music from the Amiga. Very much like List of PC game music, it is arguable unmaintainable, even though the Amiga is long out of production. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:36, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. A very large portion of the list's elements actually link to other Wikipedia articles, which is a rarity for lists in Wikipedia. Having a navigational guide that sits above these links is useful. Additionally, any complaints on the selectivity present in the article can be resolved by <i>adding more examples yourself</i>, which is the process for every other Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien">Dachannien</a> 16:16, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Most of the games are generally considered - by the Amiga games community, not by the Wikipedia community - to have good music. Saying that doesn't necessarily constitute POV. And please allow me to relist <a href="../../../o/r/k/Ork_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Ork (computer game)">Ork (computer game)</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:21, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can these be verified then? If they cannot, then the list is unverifiable and therefore should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">smoddy</a> 12:50, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <s>The title and whole concept is inherently NPOV, and inclusion in this list is, sadly, a matter of opinion. The only way I can see such a page can exist on Wikipedia is to document, with references, the "goodness" of each an every of these titles. (I don't know if published polls among video game fans exist in the video gaming literature or associated magazines, but such a thing would be a good enough source.)</s> <i>Later edit</i>: Ah, the POV is almost gone after the page was renamed. Now it's just a list of Amiga games with music. Pointless, so I stand by my vote. <i>Even later edit</i>: I was rambling. I came to this page via link called <b>List of Amiga games that have especially good music</b>, and mistook it for the title. Silly me. As far as I can see, the proper name for this list is <b>List of Amiga games with music</b>. I boldly assume that this list would coincide with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amiga_games_1cd7.html" title="List of Amiga games">List of Amiga games</a> and therefore should be merged into that; if not then List of Amiga games without music would be a more informative article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 12:56, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this kind of lists are very important. Why? Because if somebody is interest in game music, it may be a hard task to find new interesting songs. If you want to find new good amiga (or other format) songs, you do not find a list like this from the Internet (there are some charts for C64 and NES but not for PC or Amiga or some smaller machines). So Wikipedia can offer a list that gives good ideas for anybody interested in this kind of music. Without this list a person is quite lost since there are so many games and it is hard to know which ones might have interesting music. There is a danger of subjectivity in this list, since anybody can add his personal favorites. But with most of titles we can see, that they contain a music of relatively high quality and thus the problem cannot be so serious (the list is much better as it is now than no list at all) --User:Jarkka Saariluoma 15:24, 22 Jun 2005 (GTK+2)</li>
