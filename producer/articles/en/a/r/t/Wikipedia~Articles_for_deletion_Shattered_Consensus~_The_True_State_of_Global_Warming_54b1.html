<li><b>Keep</b> - Books shouldn't be judged according to their sales and availability. Look at Harry Potter books, does that mean all the facts in Harry Potter books are correct because it's on bestseller list for I-don't-know-how-long-already. Also, many books are not the centre of attention after many years of its publishing date. Similar "fate" of books include <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin's</a> <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Origin_of_Species_757b.html" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a> (1859) which suggests the theory of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. It was 10 years after the first publishing date (1869) that scientists really start focusing on his information. Another great example is <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Watson_4863.html" title="James Watson">James Watson</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Crick_68e2.html" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a> published their article The Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids in 1953. They didn't receive <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_prize.html" title="Nobel prize">Nobel prize</a> until 1962. Why is that article important? This article is about the discovery of DNA. There're lots and lots of scientific articles that are realized of its full potential after many years (and sometimes the author died already!)One final note, it's pointless to go to Amazon.com to look for books. It's time to learn a new type of book call E-Journal. <a href="../../../o/h/a/User%7EOhanaUnited_21f4.html" title="User:OhanaUnited"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">OhanaUnited</font></span></a>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please take a fresh look at the article. I added 2 reviews from reliable independent publications which I found with Proquest. In particular, there was a favorable review by Choice, the publication of the American Library Association, as well as a bried review by Scitech Book News. These two reviews along with the unfavorable coverage by the other side establish notability and verification. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Edison, please review criterion 2 at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>. It specifically says that a review in a publication like <i>Choice</i> that reviews thousands of books a year with little regard for notability does not indicate that the book is notable. (If you look at the table of contents for the July/Aug issue of Choice you'll see that there are 622 items, looks like mostly all book reviews - I am assuming that Scitech book news is similar). <i>Every</i> book will be reviewed somewhere, just like every book will have a page on amazon.com - neither signifies notability. I have a self-published history of a New England liberal arts college that cites two reviews on the cover. The point is not that any book that's been reviewed is notable, its that any book that is reviewed by publications that don't review just about <i>everything</i> is notable. If a significant reviewer (NYTimes, NY Review of Books, London Review of Books, etc.) thought that the book was notable enough to warrant a real review (not a paragraph) than that's evidence of notability. A couple of brief reviews are really meaningless. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (edit conflict) Wikipedia guidelines for notability explicitly exclude "reviews in periodicals that review thousands of books a year with little regard for notability"; both <i>Choice</i> (whose web page claims over 7,000 reviews per year) and <i>SciTech Book News</i> (over 20,000 reviews per year) are in this class. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 18:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> As it happens, you are wrong about Choice, which reviews 7000 bks a year from the estimated 50,000 or so academic titles published. The selection criteria are that the title must be impt to an UG curriculum. The reviews are typically favorable because they do not include lower quality books unless they're so bad that a warning is in order. Every time I've wanted to give a book a neg review there, I've needed to justify why a neg review should be published. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia's role, like that of any encyclopedia, is not so much to "promote debate" as to catalog information on notable people, places, events, etc. If the book is notable, then supporting reasoning should be provided (see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> for general guidelines). If your goal is to promote scientific debate or promote skepticism about conventional wisdom, then there are many other more appropriate venues than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 22:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
