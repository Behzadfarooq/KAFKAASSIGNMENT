<li>This VfD is not baseless. I am simply nominating an article that has no hope of becoming neutral. The premise of this article is to try to "prove" that blacks and hispanics are less intelligent.

<li>I suggest reading the article before claiming that it is racist or non-neutral. There is no attempt in the article to prove anything. On the contrary a thorough discussion of several sides of the controversial evidence is presented. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 05:02, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>What is neutral? <i>All people on earth are equal. They are as tall, as fat and as smart as each other regardless of gender, sexual orientation, class and race. If you see some people more often in a basketball court, that's untrue. You're seeing an illusion. It is undisputed known fact that East Asians, Whites, Latinos and Blacks are equally good at playing basketball. White men can jump and do jump very well. ... There are as many uneducated rocket scientists working for NASA as educated ones ...</i> The fact is we are not equal. But that doesn't mean people cannot co-exist peacefully and help each other.

<li>If human intelligence is not determined at least partially by genetic composition, gender (including hormonal influence) and any other known but disputed factors, then by what? Astrology?

<li>No, it's an encyclopedia where <b>all information</b> can be presented in a <b>neutral manner</b> -- not just "neutral information" -- NPOV means neutral presentation of POVs not no POVs.

<li>I did not nominate it just because it was POV. I nominated it because it has no hope of becoming a neutral article, since the article's title itself sets up a premise that it will try to 'prove' a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence, and such a relationship does not exist. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> 00:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>What sort of relationship do you think exists between these two <b>completely non-related things</b>?

<ul>
<li>If you define "intelligence" a certain way and define "race" a certain way, then you can find and state correlations between the two. The real question is whether it is a <b>revealing</b> relationship, and, if it is "revealing," then <b>what</b> it reveals. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:50, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"it has no hope of becoming a neutral article, since the article's title itself sets up a premise that it will try to 'prove' a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence" - This is simply not so. The article's name implies a discussion of a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence, which includes the topic of whether such a relationship exists. If you think that the article doesn't adequately discuss this possibility, that's a problem with the article that should be fixed by editing, <b>not</b> by deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaekharel_1ab6.html" title="User:Daekharel">Daekharel</a> 15:30, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I dont beleive I ever stated this article had anything to do with Right-Left politics. I was referring to something Revolucion pointed out himself: that this article begins with the premise that there is a correlation between race and intelligence and attempts to prove it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thoroughly referenced NPOV article. Far from being racist, it highlights what might be considered racial bias in intelligence testing methods. Socio-economic, cultural, and geographic factors are discussed citing a variety of scholarly sources.

<li>Keep. Even though I am <b>acutely</b> uncomfortable with the article and <b>deeply</b> question the validity of unstated assumptions that serve as the foundation of the studies upon which the article reports, disappearing the article will not make the issues that the article attempts to discuss go away. To make a satisfactory article would require that we engage in original research, or, at a very minimum, that we deeply think about and critique the fundamentals of the field. To do so, however, involves doing what I have been told over and over again is forbidden to us. If we are forbidden even to <b>think</b> about issues rather than to just report on what others have <b>written</b> about issues, then to make a more satisfactory article would require finding articles to cite that would go into the fundamental problems with this field. In brief, the article shows that if people define "intelligence" <i>a certain way</i>, and if people defines "races" <i>a certain way</i>, then certain correlations can be stated. My reaction to that report is, "So what?" But I have little hope that the anti-intellectual biases can be hedged well enough to permit a more penetrating article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ideally, the article should point out the lack of a fundamental critique that goes beyond finger pointing, and the fact that regardless of the good intent of some of those involved in the field, the assertion (true or false) of a correlation between race and intelligence very definitely serves racist purposes. I support the <b>feelings</b> of Revolución -- I just don't think that scrapping the article is the way to straighten things out. And you can blame me too, because I've been through too many partisan and mean-spirited debates in Wikipedia to barge in where I have no depth of research knowledge and where the simple act of <b>thinking</b> is met with vituperative responses.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:39, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>P0M, since you pointed that out I've done the best I can to make that POV even more prominent by quoting the abstract of a recent <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Sternberg_feb1.html" title="Robert Sternberg">Robert Sternberg</a> review paper. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 04:20, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but if the guy you cited stands as an expert in the field it only strengthens my impression that the field makes assertions that "aren't even wrong." I can see why Revolución goes ballistic, but his problem would seem actually to be with the field and not to the article (that only reflects the field since that is all good Wikipedians are permitted to do). I'm feeling extremely grumpy, but please do not take it personally. <b>You've</b> never told me to stop thinking or to stop trying to explain things to people like Revolución who have (IMHO) the right idea but the unclear way to put it. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 05:05, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Is it covered in any philosophy of science courses that you know about?

<li><b>Comment</b> this article is just ridiculous. Anyone can start an article called "--- and intelligence".

<li>I guess it's an important "issue"....<b>to racists</b>. The facts are, no connection exists between race/ethnicity and intelligence. The articles on "Boston Red Sox" and "George W.

<ul>
<li>In a way I agree with you, and in another way I disagree. First, suggesting that this person or that person is a "racist" isn't likely to get us to anything except defensiveness. Second, the conceptualization of [race] is so murky, with hardly any two identifiable people actually defining the word "race" the same way, that it is difficult to think about clearly -- especially since people are generally unwilling to dig down to brass tacks and then build back out. To make things worse, [intelligence] is not conceptualized clearly either. It has regularly been used in these discussions as though it were a <b>thing</b>, no? It is an abstract category and a moving target depending for its actions on who is pointing the gun, and yet it is discussed <b>as though</b> it is a simple entity "out there somewhere" just waiting for somebody to take a snapshot of it. It's even been given a "true name" to identify the ens realissimus behind all manifestations of [intelligence] -- the simple letter <big><b>g</b></big>. So now people are trying to correlate two "entities" hypostatized out of subjectively determined abstract categories. There's nothing particularly immoral about that approach. It's just (IMHO) stupid. But it does give racists a golden opportunity. The only good thing (from my point of view) is that white racists are beginning to have to deal with a their own reactions to a cartoon in which the white guys are second string (or maybe third rate, who knows since its dependent on how you play the game). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 05:05, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think you, Revolución, are as just as narrow-minded as those "racists." There clearly is a racial gap that exists in the United States, and whether it is due to "genetics" or "environment" is of another matter --they are both very arguable as seen with statistics. Even though this article is controversial, there is no reason to delete this page for its controversy. We do not delete articles on Adolf Hitler or Stalin or Andrew Jackson, just because of the controversy that surrounds those two figures. The "connection between race and intelligence" has not been disproven completely, nor has the connection between environment and intelligence been completely proven; and thus, there is an argument for both that exist. There are clearly very educated and intelligent --perhaps more open-minded than you-- people who argue for one or the other, and to ignore one or the other is very dilletante. I believe you, Revolución, are as narrow-minded as those "racists" whom you claim you are against. Just because this article is extremely controversial, it does not mean that it should be deleted. One should be open-minded to all view points of a matter, and this matter is very important and very visible in the United States.Bezant</li>

Regardless of whether or not you agree with something, if the debate is this major then we need to show all major sides to remain NPOV. Granted, it's harder to show NPOV on something like this, but as long as all major viewpoints are well thought out and included with the article, we've done our job in making the article unbiased. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:54, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

We in the 21st century are dismayed by the perceived implications of race/intelligence research, but we should know better than to censor the endeavor. Perhaps our assumptions about the implications are flawed.

That doesn't matter a goddamn bit. If I am stupid, then I am stupid. If I can't make money, then I can't make money. Even if ALL OTHER Chinese are smarter than Albert Einstein, if I am stupid, I am stupid and no one else can donate his/her brain cells to me.</dd>
<dd>So what's wrong with this article? We all want to be smart, rich and beatiful. We may belong to the group of top dogs, but that doesn't matter. I can still be dumb, poor and ugly. Even if I belong to the lowest of the lowest gruops, if I am smart, rich and beatiful, I am smart, rich and beatiful and that's not deniable. So who cares about the average number? I only care about me, myself and I. Race and intelligence does not make me proud. It does not make me shame of myself. I cannot rule out the fact that many blacks are smarter than I.

<dd>Aboslutely right. And I think this is briefly covered in the public policy section: <i>There is substantial overlap in the distribution of IQ scores among individuals of each race. Jensen (1998, p. 357) estimates that in a random sample of equal numbers of US Blacks and Whites, most of variance in IQ would be unrelated to race or social class.</i> From one POV, this research is a strong reason to treat people as individuals, rather than members of a group. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 20:01, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. NPOV dispute. And that's really all I need to say about it, isn't it? NPOV disputes are not VfD material.<br />
But I'm going to say some more anyway. Saying that an article has "no hope of becoming neutral", when it's established that the topic itself is notable enough to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia, is tantamount to saying Wikipedia just can't handle it. That's one opinion, but it's not something we're qualified to judge here. Surely you're not arguing that <i>all information in the article is false and/or irrelevant</i>, that is, the sources we quote don't really say what we report or none of them express notable viewpoints. That would mean the article is a complete hoax, and it would be the <i>only</i> reason you could justify outright deletion with. <i>Wikipedia does not report on what is true, only significant views on what is true</i>. Claiming that "race" and "intelligence" are unrelated concepts is just another POV, one that can and should be addressed in the article itself. It does no good to pretend that the POV that race and intelligence <i>are</i> concepts that can be meaningfully related is not significant. The article clearly establishes that it is. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:40, 2005 Jun 11 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. "Race" is an arbitrary term used to denigrate groups different from the groups in power in a given society. Once knowing that, however, one can say studies like this are not wholly irrevelent; these sorts of inquiries show how disenfranchised members are affected by prejudiced societal institutions, poverty, and other related social issues. The article should shed more light should be put on the fact that race is not an absolute construct but one based on subjective perception. RP 0:42, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I'm worried that this page will become ammunition for racists. I realize there are good arguments for not censoring, but consider this: was it right for the United States to censor or withhold information about the atomic bomb? Of course it was. In the wrong hands it could be deadly.

<li><b>Keep</b> Surprisingly well written and balanced article. I would vote to definitely keep this article. I learned a lot reading it and it would be a shame to delete a piece that is so comprehensive and well documented. You know, plugging your ears and going "neener, neener, neener...," is not a way to engage in scholarly debate. IQ is interesting but not the complete measure of man. I just took an IQ test online and it differed not a whit from my IQ converted from an SAT score from 1973, fascinating... an anecdote that is supported by evidence. So there will never be a bumper sticker that says, "Don't like your IQ, then change it." so what? But there might be one that says "People not smart enough for you? Then change the world". George Bernard Shaw said, "The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him... The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself... All progress depends on the unreasonable man." <small>Unsigned vote by 66.30.138.100</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Article makes the controvertial assumption that members of the population groups we label white, asian, black, hispanic are more genetically similar with each other than with other members of other groups. Hugely unfounded. But that's something that can be fixed within the article, which is otherwise pretty good. Don't know why this is listed under VfD instead of being discussed in the Talk page. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 02:25, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The background info starts out noting the objections to classification by race (which is a pretty good summary of the objections). However the rest of article then treats races as well defined meaningful things. At the very least there should be some acknowledgement that since most of these studies occurred within the US they don't accurately portray Hispanic intelligence or European intelligence, but rather the subpopulations of the United States that are identified as White or Hispanic. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 10:43, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I guess I still question the racial labels employed in many of the studies cited (how do they determine who's of what race? why is it treated as if there is some clear cut standard?) but I guess that falls into the domain of academic argument rather than something universally accepted. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 10:52, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Unbelievably strongly researched and many-sided article. The attackers seem incapable of commenting on the article on its own merits in accordance with the deletion policy. Even if there was absolutely nothing in intelligence that was genetical in its nature, that would clearly be implied in the research the article is based, so the disputation of the connection between race and intelligence is no basis for deletion of the article. --<a href="../../../t/m/h/User%7ETmh_7253.html" title="User:Tmh">Tmh</a> 11:27, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I think there is no such thing as a white, asian, hispanic or black race. This is an oversimplication of reality that has no scientific base. Why don't you do a "pure english" against "pure german"... Are Rusians asian&#160;? What about Filipinos&#160;? And Mongols&#160;? Where are the Arabic&#160;? What about the hispanic/Peruan&#160;? and the hispanic/Argentinian&#160;? Which date will you use to determine the purity of a German, an English or a French? Considering the black, how many mixes of black/white/asian/hispanic are enough to stop considering him black&#160;? Is a single black in the tree enough to consider all below black&#160;? Same for white&#160;? Why&#160;? I mean, you can't be serious about this.

<dd>Copied from the article: "People labeled Blacks have most of their ancestors from...". Well, "most of their ancestors" doesn't sound very scientific to me. Does it to you&#160;? Where I said "I think", you can actually remove it, because these days that's a fact. If you like the article, name it something like "What_we_think_are_American_races_and_IQ". Because you can't neither make asumptions about races on countries you haven't made studies on. And I have to remember you that people from different countries refer to the wikipedia for information, and you can't make universal asumptions on that. Have you considered distance and motive why people from different races is there&#160;? Really, you have to be joking if you want to make something like this look like serious. I mean, I would keep the article in a different place and with a different name. But this is meant to be an Encyclopedia. Refer to the meaning of that in case of doubt. BTW at least put a notice like the one in Sex_and_intelligence. --[<a href="http://www.drqueue.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.drqueue.org/" rel="nofollow">Jorge Daza</a>]

<dd>Hi Jorge, this VfD page really isn't a good place to learn about genetics. Maybe you want to take your objections to the talk page? Anyway, I found <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001321.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001321.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> to be a good overview of the basic arguments one should be familiar with; do have a look. Maybe the current article should make a better job of explaining this, even though it basically belongs to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">Race</a>. The tacit American assumptions about race that permeate the article are one of my own few concerns with the current state of the page (I'm European), and as you can see I have put that very issue on the Todo-list yesterday. I would be happy if you kept a look on this page and see if it evolves in the right direction. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 16:11, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Arbor, was the people subject of the IQ test also subject of a genetic mapping&#160;? I don't doubt about the science of genetics. I doubt about the article's based-on "science". And sure, we can move to talk. I'm European too. Copied from the link you posted: "No serious scientist, in fact, believes that genetically pure populations exist." There can't be real science on such a thing like "white/hispanic/black/asian" races. Thus, until such a study exists this article cannot be considered science or knowledge. -- [<a href="http://www.drqueue.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.drqueue.org/" rel="nofollow">Jorge Daza</a>]

<dd>Jorge, I wrote the sentence you're discussing. It is a painfully simplistic summary of a very complicated topic. But a fuller treatment can't fit in the intro of this article, which is why we prominently direct people to the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a> article. About that particular sentence: notice it is cited. Here's a summary of the paper I referenced. <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-01/sumc-rgm012705.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-01/sumc-rgm012705.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 16:44, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the conventional idea of "race" is simplistic, but this article is talking about studies and ideas relating to that concept, not asserting that the concept or any of the studies or ideas referenced are true.
