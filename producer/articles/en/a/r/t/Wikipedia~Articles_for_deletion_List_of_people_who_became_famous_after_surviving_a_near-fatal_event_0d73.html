<li><b>Keep</b>, it's an interesting list with context for each entry, and as the individuals on it appear notable, and their notability has come from being involved in the events, or they are notable people who nearly died, it appears a legitimate topic to create a list from. Frankly it's an interesting sphere of human experience, and therefore likely to get people clicking. I didn't really fancy it when I first came upon it, but did a bit of work on it and feel it was significantly improved. I hate listcruft and don't think this qualifies. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 20:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Fundamentally incompatible with NPOV. What constitutes being famous? How do we determine when someone became famous? How do we determine for what reason someone became famous? What constitutes a near-fatal event? How directly must the event and fame correlate? How much time can pass between the event and the fame (that is to say, how long is "after")? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 05:15, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> (general) I honestly don't see these as insurmountable questions, and many of the answers are self-evident. Famous can be changed to notable. Lydon and Slash were presumably famous before the cited events, and Lydon was not actually involved in the event. We can determine the reason someone became notable quite easily, as it will be evident on their article, as established by whatever facts and evidence have been submitted to comply with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The correlation of the event and fame is not an issue, as there are different sections. After means not before, ie not famous 1 second before the near-fatal event. The definition of near fatal is also pretty evident from the pages listed - either people died in the event (9/11, Titanic etc), or it was something a human could be reasonably expected to have died from (falling 33000 feet to the ground, accidentally going over Niagara Falls). I think this page is fairly easy to maintain. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 01:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
