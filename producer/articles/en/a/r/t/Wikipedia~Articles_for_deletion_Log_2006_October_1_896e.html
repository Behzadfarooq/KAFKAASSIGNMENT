<li><b>Delete</b> The books don't seem to assert anything. Law books (and articles) in the UK are often written by not so succesful lawyers and are in essence a cheap means of advertising. Same goes with getting on the BBC. If there were third party reviews of his work I'd be more impressed.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the person under discussion and was new to wikipedia until this year. I have apologised for starting the page as vanity publishing and I repeat that apology again.The page was allowed to stay on the basis that I asserted notability as a writer. I wholly accept that some of my books help advertise my practice although if you do a search of barristers' chambers you will find that very few barristers have even written one book. However, of the ten books that I have now written, I would suggest that three are important books in their own right: Email, the Internet and the Law was one of the first on this subject and Professor Richard Susskind described it in the Times newspaper as "an important new book" at the time of its publication; Sports Personal Injury is the only book on the subject and was therefore once again breaking new ground and has attracted interest internationally; finally, I contributed two chapters to The Future of the NHS which also includes chapters from all three political parties and most of the major think tanks. As for my political involvement, I did not add the story about the Conservative Collegiate Forum but it is true and was covered in both The Times and The Daily Telegraph in 1993, among other newspapers. As for my media appearances, I make no great claims save that I am the regular legal voice for the Jeremy Vine Show which is the largest daytime news and current affairs show in the country (with around 5 million listeners). Once again, I am genuinely sorry for any offence caused by vanity publishing. I shall leave well alone now other than to contribute to this discussion and will be very happy if you cut down my entry substantially. However, I will continue to contribute to wikipedia in the future and thank you all for a great site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimkevan_4318.html" title="User:Timkevan">Timkevan</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimkevan_bb62.html" title="User talk:Timkevan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Timkevan_2c3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Timkevan">contribs</a>) 16:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, so now we have a number of claims for notability of a junior barrister:
<dl>
<dd>- That two of the books he wrote solo are important in their own right, presumably they would meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>. For the moment the fact that none of these books have an uncontested Wikipedia article should be seen as a sign that this is not proven.</dd>
<dd>- That Kevan wrote for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Future_of_the_NHS_b9f7.html" title="The Future of the NHS">The Future of the NHS</a>, which does have its own article (let's pass by the main author of this book. However as the introduction for that article says it "brings together forty-four leading experts in the fields of health care, politics and policy making". So Kevan is one of forty-four. Not a claim to notability.</dd>
<dd>- The Conservative Collegiate Forum information may be a claim for notability - but it's still not cited.</dd>
<dd>- The <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremy_Vine_f1f1.html" title="Jeremy Vine">Jeremy Vine</a> show is notable, but being a contributor would only be notable if he was essentially a co-host.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have restored the two books that Kevan cites as his most significant. On balance I am happy with him having an entry. The combination of his writings and media appearances make him worthy of an entry. &lt;POV&gt;If Big Brother contestants and rappers who have released a couple of CDs get in here someone who has already done what Kevan has done (and no doubt he will do a lot more) should not be excluded. &lt;/POV&gt; <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete with gusto/userfy if not already done</b>. Where is notability asserted here? He certainly does not meet the criteria for an author, unless he can demonstrate that his books are CORE texts of general application- i.e. sales numbering in the thousands. As noted above, it is quite common for barristers in the UK to contribute papers and or books. If there are multiple external full reviews in e.g. <i>The Times</i> or similiar, then let's see links to them, and it may sway my thinking here. However, on the basis of the facts as they stand, I see no evidence that this gentleman deserves to be in here as an author or academic. So, his other two claims to notability are that he's a barrister and went to Cambridge- as far as I'm aware, neither of these are covered in the notability guidelines. Get yourself on myspace Mr. Kevan- that's the place for popinjays such as yourself, not here. Out out out. <small>I note for the record that Mr. Kevan also added a nice vicarious vanity page for one of his chums, who has even less of a claim to notability- Daniel Barnett.</small> <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:20, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I see no reason to believe that Tim Kevan started this article in bad faith. He was unaware of the rules and has since apologised for inserting his own article. He also seems to have made quite a few good edits to non-related articles. While we may disagree with him on his notability - could we please stop the name calling? Most vanity articles start out as good faith efforts by people who don't fully understand the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 09:01, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why is it name-calling to refer to someone who incorporates a biography of themselves and their workmates into an encyclopaedia for the purposes of self-advertisement as a "popinjay"? It's a simple assertion of fact. I struggle to understand how the motivation of someone (ANYone) who composes their own biography here can possibly be described as good faith, unless they are a very foolish and myopic person. It strikes me that Tim Kevan is not particularly foolish or myopic- although he obviously knows an opportunity for free self-promotion when he sees one (see his comment above, for example). The subject edited his article repeatedly over a period of 2 months. He has indeed made some good quality edits to unrelated articles- but many (if not most) of his contribs appear to pertain to himself directly, his father, or his friends and workmates. Very poor show indeed. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 01:50, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the subject of this debate, Tim Kevan, again. I very much accept the criticisms made of me and again I apologise. It seems that most of the writers are prepared to accept the entry if there are independent references etc. There have been a number of reviews of my books and references to my student politics (something which was added to my entry by someone else) in national newspapers and publications. These are only available it seems to subscribers. However, for your benefit I have done a search of just one of these newspapers, The Times, and have put the references online at: <a href="http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc" class="external free" title="http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.timkevan.com/articles/times%20articles.doc</a>. I would be very happy that others did searches of other newspapers and publications.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm sure youd didn't mean it but you shouldn't vote twice. I've added in the stuff about the CCF to give people some idea of it's notability or otherwise. (There's also an article about this <a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2006/03/donal_blaney_a_.html" class="external text" title="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2006/03/donal_blaney_a_.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> although badly written). Personally I think this person is less notable than Emily Barr, who doesn't have her own article. If the ins and outs of the Maastricht debate and Major's dog days become better covered on Wikipedia then I could change my mind. On the e-mail law book, if this is the extent of its notability I think we should forget it. It's said to be an important book in a short review in the Times. There's no indication that it's influential on other books or on cases. If you could prove this then it could be kept in. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 21:31, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Tim Kevan was notable as a proxy in a fight that is otherwise unmentioned in wikipedia. Conor Burns - the other candidate, who's achieved a lot more subsequently - does not have an article in Wikipedia. As coverage improves of Maastricht and the Tory hari-kiri that was the John Major premiership then the Conor Burns affair may be included together with some of the supporting cast. Other than his selection to the post there is no other evidence of his effect on the now defunct organisation or the wider Conservative Party. As to legal textbooks, well no one apart including Tim Kevan has started any articles for them or argued that they would meet notability standards. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 12:13, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, As rewritten by <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">User:Localzuk</a> on 1-October. I believe the article is getting close to being technically correct. He writes:</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorption isotherm is the graphical depiction of the sorption behviour of a chemical entity which depicts the link between the water content of the substance and the humidity of the air at a particular temperature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However 'sorption isotherm' is used generally for any adsorbed or absorbed material, not just water. When writing the definition one should not restrict it to sorption of water. I think Localzuk's version would need one further iteration to make this clear. I also looked at the German version. It does use general language, to include materials other than water. But, while it is informative, it has no graphs and no fully-specified references, so I don't think that a pure translation would make the best possible article.</dd>
<dd>I don't favor the idea of redirecting this to <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorption.html" title="Sorption">Sorption</a> because the latter is very short and vague. Also, one day, someone will have the patience to make a nice graph of a sorption isotherm, which will make <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorption_isotherm.html" title="Sorption isotherm">Sorption isotherm</a> worthwhile in its own right. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 23:45, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, most of the Google hits are mirrors of the Wikipedia article, their press releases, or items planted by the parent organization. One must look beyond the number at the quality. The membership is not confirmable including any of the Nobel laureates listed. Indeed, having Nobel laureates as members does NOT make an organization notable, anyway, on its own. This organization may be notable at some point in the future but it certainly is not at this time. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 02:08, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've never really looked at this article before. If it is to be kept I think it has to be almost rewritten from scratch. There are no sources other than self sources (e.g, CSMMH and CSICOP websites). The "contributions to scholarship" section also seems questionable inasmuch as it consists solely of a few articles written for CSICOP's magazine (one of which amounts to nothing more than a summary of the criminal conviction on a non-related charge of a paranormal researcher involved in something they didn't like); and then a mention of the fact that a member of CSMMH was on a TV documentary once. I've been on TV in a number of countries playing international sport but I don't see an article about me. I think delete unless something more can be found and attributed to reputable sources.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 17:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> At first glance it appears to be advertising. But more importantly, how did you come to the conclusion this podcast was non-notable. Was it a lack of listeners? Too few episodes, Too new? Your nomination doesn't explain your reasoning.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I understand that the phrasing does seem to be advertising, but this was written following several other podcast and internet radio pages that seemingly are not nominated for deletion, so I would like some clarification on this as well. I am open to making changes to the page if suggestions are provided. However, the non-notable part also makes me curious. If it is based on "too few episodes" (currently residing at 27), then I'd like to know what number is no longer "too few". If it's "not enough listeners", I'd like to know where your data was obtained, as it has never been made publicly available. If it's "too new", then please tell me what the timeframe to no longer be considered new is, since I have been podcasting over one year. - MtA

<li>I am not trying to make an argument, I am pointing out that there are articles for other podcasts and internet broadcasts that are not nominated for deletion, despite the fact that they do not meet the notability criteria either, as referenced above by you. If you feel that my article should be deleted, then I am merely making the point that there are several other non-notable articles out there similar in format to mine that are not being nominated, including but not limited to No Holds Barred Radio and The Dawn and Drew Show. Neither of these have cited any sources, neither have clearly demonstrated notability based on the requirements listed, yet they are not being questioned? I'm not making an argument, but rather questioning the fairness and making sure I am not being singled out for some reason.Mike the Apeman 18:52, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Mike, we're not here to prove a point. None of us are.

<li>To me, this looks like an accurate article, and it certainly isn't detrimental to wikipedia. People might hear about this company and want to learn more about it, and since we are not limited by space I don't see why it should be removed when it has a potential reader base. It looks like the only criteria for deletion is notability, but it doesn't seem to be in conflict with any policies. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 18:08, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's hard to say if it's accurate or not without sources. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Wikipedia's editors aren't unlimited</a>, are you volunteering to hike out to Minneapolis to find reliable sources for it, and then maintain the article? Unmaintained articles about people/organizations are a small detriment... ask any OTRS user how many slander/libel complaints we get. I just don't see this article being maintained. (eg. the company is defunct... they released a final DVD set in 2005, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=SCHKAGEG&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=SCHKAGEG&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">there's no mention of it anywhere on the internet</a>) --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:31, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hehe that would be a very short hike for me&#160;:) The problem is, even if I find a source AFAIK I can't just scan something and put it onto wikipedia as a RS. Anyway, considering the company is not out there ripping people off, slander/libel probably won't be a big problem. Things in the article like that unsourced video may deserve removal, but I don't think it warrants complete deletion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 20:53, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The slander/libel issue is that random people add sneaky vandalism, nobody notices for a while, eventually the people associated with the organization Google themselves, and then get upset when they find the falsehoods here because it's since been distributed to a bunch of different mirrors. The fact that most of the article can't be independently verified makes it even harder to deal with sneaky vandalism. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 21:04, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>you said it! It is a valid topic and to censor this would be to participate in the literal cover up of the issue. So Stubify it, put up "wikistandard"s disclaimers, whatever. The article could be better sourced. Having talked with Walter Burien and Gerald R. Klatt(USAF retired). My impression is they would like to see links to their site on here as well as government addresses for the imfamous CAFR reports for all over the country. Klatt's www.cafrman.com has these but they are from 2003.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.209.140.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.209.140.21.html" title="User talk:209.209.140.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.209.140.21_1096.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.209.140.21">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Though the report is a real report, I'm not convinced that it is notable enough for its own article. There's no reference to "CAFRs" on major news sites, and the references listed in this article appear to be personal websites with a strong bias. The Google hits don't mean much to me either, since "CAFR" as an acronym can have multiple meanings. So I recommend deleting this article, or possibly merging it into something else relating to State Government spending. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 04:50, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here is a typical example of knee jerk anti conspiracy theory bias of wikipedians, these documents are verifiable and do exist. It is not significant at all that acording to Burien's research that numerous news outlets and public officials recieve a copy of many CAFR's reports from the local water and school public corporations to the several state and general government reports and do not do reports on these government holdings? Yall's nose for cooruption potential isnt itching at all? <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessie_Ventura_1847.html" title="Jessie Ventura">Jessie Ventura</a>'s political career is punctuated by his releasing some of Minnisota's government surplusses held outside the budgetary set of books. The Potential for cronie investment shuffeling should be obvious to even a 6th grader. I.E. guide investments to support your friends politically. If you don't know the investments exist in the first place you dont know to look for the deal making and the stategic investments BTW tally up the institutional investment in big companies like Health insurance, Motorola, IBM and MICROSOFT - 60-85% government owned, that is supposedly not Musellini's Corporatism? The artical needs a NPOV, shure, but these issues HAVE to be mentioned or you end up with a bias of ommission problem. Living in the world's remaining superpower you have to demand "show me the money"! Failure to understand these issues is tantamount to crossing the steet when you see a woman getting raped or a mugging in your path and not even dialing 911. I am only left with the two possibilities either there is intentional ignorance of this topic or a lack of ability to grasp the concepts of government surpluss assets.

<dd>(Comment to anon editor) The main problem with this article is that much of it appears to be what's called <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which is against Wikipedia policy. Something cannot appear on Wikipedia unless it is has already been published in outside credible sources (personal websites and blogs don't count), which prove that this subject is notable. In other words, it's not enough to prove that the report <i>exists</i>, you have to show that outside sources believe that the report is <i>important.</i> There are thousands of different government forms out there, and the case that needs to be made (in my opinion) is that this report is individually important. If credible references can be provided, I might be willing to change my mind on this article. For more information, please review the Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 18:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is just the proverbial second set of books outside the budgetary process. If you cant see why that is the most significant report of any divison of government then we are doomed as a country. Some of you seem so averse to conspiracy "theory" that if something sounds like one, you trash it even when the proof is hidden in plain sight. I fail to see why the Gerald R. Klatt sites cannot be included, he isnt selling anything and provides links to all the CAFR's that are analysed even if they are abit old. (2003) Some of the newer State CAFR's are difficult to locate (on purpose). When government entities cry we need to raise taxes cause spending is over the budget THIS is the ammo to hit them with; we know how much is in the CAFR&#160;! Sell some stock and surplusses(far above the required assets to back pensions and bonds et c.) There are tonnes of short blurb articals on wikipedia that I have run accross and none of them have to have to be on "watchlists" that I am of aware of. So Walter Burien might end up selling a videotape or two because someone found out that there really is CAFR reports out there. Since he HISTORICALLY re-discovered this accounting trick and exposed it to the world (through AM talk radio in New Jersey) How bout someone put up a biography on the guy; I would but it would last about 2 hours and that is beiing optamystic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.209.140.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.209.140.21.html" title="User talk:209.209.140.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.209.140.21_1096.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.209.140.21">contribs</a>) 23:16, October 4, 2006.</small></li>

<dd>I don't wanna start a long discussion, but I totally do not buy into that method of argument. The number of mom 'n pop stores and corner restaurants (and high schools and high school chess clubs and ...) in Wikipedia is daunting. It would be trivially super-easy to grab three and use them in the way that you are doing, whilst completely ignoring the who-knows-how-many that have been deleted. Invalid argument. I'm gonna go hang out where the notability discussions are for a while, and see who does what. But I've already voted here; have no desire to argue. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 03:52, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>oops again, I said I was done, but the full scope of that recursive argument just struck me. One would need to delete *every* single corner Chinese restaurant in Wikipedia to counter that argument -- which is of course impossible, since new corner Chinese restauraunts are being added faster than a thousand monkeys can type. Argument is recursive. Argument relies on inertia rather than principle. I cannot accept the corner Chhinese restaurant argument. Sorry. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 04:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not some cornor chinese resturant. Those do not have 2(3) operations, are not owned by a larger franching resturant(usually) and do not get people driving 100 miles or more to eat at. And i'm sure sure the little chinese don't dress up as GI Joe or Shaggy or have an actual running 1930's car as a salad bar. Try comparing it to maybe one of Emerill's resturants(without his cooking of course). There's an atmosphere reputation people pay to be part of. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESearchme_d761.html" title="User:Searchme"><font color="#007FFF">Jo</font></a><font color="green"><a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESearchme_Esperanza_a00c.html" title="User:Searchme/Esperanza">e</a></font> <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESearchme_ca16.html" title="User talk:Searchme"><font color="#007FFF">I</font></a> 04:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again Joe.. hey .. please.. I was firmly rejecting your <i>method of argument</i> but not rejecting the restaurant by comparing it to a corner Chinese restaurant. You see, you made a far more valid type of argument just then, when you discussed why the restaurant was, in your opinion, notable. In the second argument, you appealed to <i>facts</i>, stating that people drive 100 miles to eat there etc. I personally -- and this is just me -- wouldn't agree that those facts prove notability. But I do agree that it is '<i>definitely</i> a valid means of making an argument. Your first argument -- the "corner Chinese restaurant argument" was invalid through and through, and unacceptable as such. Your second argument stands on its own merits. If people are persuaded by it, then it will win the day.</dd>
<dd>Please let me know if I am making sense. I am not attacking the restaurant you support. I was rejecting your method of framing your argument... does that make sense? Thanks --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELing.Nut_3c51.html" title="User:Ling.Nut">Ling.Nut</a> 04:43, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This guy <i>might</i> actually be a musician, but there's no proof that he's an encyclopedically notable one, though there's considerable indication of a rich fantasy life. Apparently his performance venues are usually "informal concerts" in shopping malls "particularly in places where pianos are being sold" i.e. he goes to musical instrument stores and takes over the nearest piano. Sole external reference link is a gushingly positive review article (that stops just short of total adulation and then adds the small print that the critic is supposedly the most feared by classical musicians or something so I guess a 9/10 from her is like a 15/10 from anyone else) which strangely does not cite its original source but is hosted on a spammy article database which apparently anyone can submit articles to with minimal quality checks<a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/editorial-guidelines.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.articlesbase.com/editorial-guidelines.php" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. This external source is highly unreliable. The article claims that the subject is a direct descendant of a Holy Roman Emperor without any proof (apparently this makes him "royalty" though). The subject also claims noble titles which are from fantasy organizations and countries whose honours are available to anyone- see <a href="http://rjrex2691.tripod.com/membership.html" class="external text" title="http://rjrex2691.tripod.com/membership.html" rel="nofollow">Grandmaster of the Chivalric Order of Cravant</a> and <a href="http://wheatcity.tripod.com/principalityofvikesland/id28.html" class="external text" title="http://wheatcity.tripod.com/principalityofvikesland/id28.html" rel="nofollow">Great Order of Vikesland</a>. Oh and here's the totally unconvincing website of the <a href="http://rjrex2691.tripod.com/royalsocietyofmusic/id7.html" class="external text" title="http://rjrex2691.tripod.com/royalsocietyofmusic/id7.html" rel="nofollow">Royal Society of Music</a>, which like the Royal Society of Art is part of <a href="http://wheatcity.tripod.com/principalityofvikesland/id22.html" class="external text" title="http://wheatcity.tripod.com/principalityofvikesland/id22.html" rel="nofollow">The Vikesland Ministry of Culture</a> - these societies are supposedly presided over by Carillo.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though the article does need cleanup. The website is of great historical significance <i>within</i> its niche. It's inactive now but when it first went up it was pretty much the only place to go to for transformation fiction on the Internet and it became a center of activity for the fandom. Looking over WP:WEB, it looks like it satisfies the third criterion - the webzine TSAT republishes content from there. (TSAT is independant of TSA, in case anyone asks - the name is a result of how the initialism "TSA" became shorthand for the entire genre). <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 02:51, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was trying not to sound jerky despite the annoyance I was feeling, so I apologize if it still came through like that. But I still think the Google link you posted in the AfD summary is misleading; it gives "Results 241 - 246 of about 11,000" whereas the example I posted above gives "Results 1 - 10 of about 11,000". It's not surprising that the 241st-most-relevant hit Google gives is going to be pretty sucky. Anyway, the page has had a total rewrite now and references have been added that even I didn't know about off the top of my head, hopefully that addresses some of the other aspects of WP:WEB. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 18:11, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><u>Update</u>-- I put in some research time and rebuilt the article from the ground up, doing away with a lot of the advertising-y feel and generally spamminess. I <i>think</i> at this point the article meets the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, although it is admittedly a difficult call. There are without question two confounding factors that make current documentation challenging. First, age is an issue. The TSA was most influential in the 1996-1998 period and has been inactive (although extant) since 2003. And second, the communities represented by the TSA (furry fandom, transgender, and transformation fetish) are poorly represented in print sources <i>now</i>, much less in 1996 or 1997. That the site maintains an Alexa rating of ~220k three years after the last update whatsoever is frankly a strong indication that it was a significant site in its prime. I do recognize, however, that the references are still shaky(eSCENE is itself defunct, but legitimately published in 1995-1997/8, with ISSNs for its annual publication). <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> recognizes that popular culture and fiction topics "may not be discussed in the same academic contexts" as other material; ezines and their ilk, especially with years of (web-)publication history are at least a reasonable step above "[p]ersonal websites, wikis, and posts on bulletin boards, Usenet and blogs".

Likewise, both of the ezines referenced herein (Anthro and TSAT) have editorial control; these are not self-published sources, nor do they equate to content like personal websites (<i>e.g.</i> Geocities) or blogs. The FPÖ allegations can also probably be better documented by someone who speaks German (as an internal Austrian political issue ibn 1997-8, English-language coverage is essentially nonexistent). Not all articles can or should have citations from conventional news agencies because not all verifiable encyclopedic content is newsworthy and print-appropriate.

<li>Ed, I'm not entirely sure what you're saying here, could you clarify? I'm taking your opinion to be that the subject doesn't warrant an article because the archive is <i>currently</i> defunct and has been superceded by other sources, which I don't think is relevant because the site has <i>historical</i> significance within the genre. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 05:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Grandfather?), so posting it on Wikipedia serves to indirectly raise your profile. That isn't fatal to an article by any means, but... it immediately raises the spectre of objectivity issues. There are a LOT of pieces from a perstonal collection in the article. Are the pieces notable? How do we know the captions are correct. I know YOU know, but I don't know myself. Which brings us to the biggest issue of all. The article is named "Korean Pottery: A Compendium of the Colaianni Collection". Is the Colaianni Collection a notable collection? Is it better than, say, a collection I would find in a museum in Seoul or New York? My instinct is no, but if I'm wrong, we'll need to see some backup.

<li><b><s>Don't Delete</s>(one vote to a customer)...a Final Rebuttal</b> in response to the above comments...The article does have value. FIRST: If the title is of concern then it can be changed...the change would be <b>Korean Pottery: Categorized by Periods</b>. This is an important lesson in the study of Korean pottery because each period in Korean history had very distinctive style of pottery. This page clearly demonstrates the differences. SECOND: Is this collection verifiable? Yes. All pieces have been evaluated and appraised by JOHN GILMORE FORD, ASA, Senior Member,American Society of Appraisers, Baltimore Maryland. All captions that are associated with the photographs are excerpts from his evaluation. Sotheby's of New York is aware of this collection. Two pieces from this collection were published in its catalog, KOREAN WORKS OF ART, JUNE 5, 1992. The Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is reviewing this collection for display. THIRD: There is enough text to cover two pages if you look at the information contained in the captions under the photographs. I can move those captions to the main page if necessary. FOURTH: The question about "better" collections being in Seoul or New York; with the title change, they would be welcome to edit the page and contribute to the wealth of Wikipedia as well. Please note, I have already added to the References at the bottom of the page in question.
<ul>
<li>The appraisal is unpublished, therefore unverifiable. The two pieces published in Sotheby's catalog are a different matter, but you don't identify which two they are. I think this article needs serious rework, possibly into a set of articles by period, including commentary only from published sources. Since deletion prevents rework, I will change my non-vote, with the understanding that I may support a renomination if the article remains a collage. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Either <b>merge</b> with the main <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_pottery.html" title="Korean pottery">Korean pottery</a> article or <b>rename</b> to something like Gallery of Korean pottery and <b>keep</b>; or failing that <b>transwiki</b> the images and text to the Commons. Frankly, articles about the arts invite a gallery style treatment. These examples are a valuable contribution, and a way should be found to keep them somehow. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_pottery.html" title="Korean pottery">Korean pottery</a>. What is the bar for verifying that photos in Wikipedia are what they say they are? I expect that many (most) of our photos (and other images) would fail verifiability. If these are what they say they are, they should be merged into the main <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_pottery.html" title="Korean pottery">Korean pottery</a> article. If we want to demand verifiability of images, we'll need to dump 90% at least of the images in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Photon_5b8f.html" title="User:The Photon">The Photon</a> 01:52, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would say that there are three distinct issues for verifiability an image of an artifact: does the image fairly represent the type of artifact described? Is it of an actual artifact as opposed to a reproduction, mockup or a manipulated image? Is the described provenance correct? Readers can perform the first by comparing to copyrighted pictures from reliable sources, which should be cited for the supporting text. The second we really can't verify, unless a major publication takes an interest in the authenticity of Wikipedia images, so we have to take on trust. The last issue was raised by the title: absent a published catalog, how do we know there is such a collection or what it contains? Renaming the article reduces the vanity aspect of the provenance, and so makes it more of a legal issue (is uploader entitled to grant a GDFL license for that image?) than a policy one, and we pretty much act on faith there too. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 21:02, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My plan is to rename the article as mentioned before to <b>Korean Pottery: Categorized by Periods</b>. That should correct the vanity issue in the title. I also plan to expand the text as recommended by Robert West. My concern about merging with Korean Pottery is that I would not like to make such a drastic change to an existing article that is already so well presented. The interest taken by all, in the effort to make Wikipedia an endeavor of value is appreciated. I do have a full time job and therefore need a little time to update this page.

<li>Hmmm... I have no doubt that we could, under the GDFL, add a clown cap to any of the images. On the other hand, Wikipedia is clear that it views history as something that we should preserve under the GDFL. I was viewing the on-image credit as akin to that. I suppose that, so long as we have the original version in history, and retain the description of the source of the image, we are fine in that respect. That said, you or any editor can <b>boldly</b> modify the image, so I don't see that as a reason to delete the images. As for the OR issue, and whether the article can be made non-OR, that requires comparing the sources to the content at a level that is beyond my expertise. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Apropos whether credits on the image are encyclopedic, my print copy of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> 14th edition includes images with just such an embedded credit, and I think that publication qualifies as an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:14, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>While The Colbert Report is a popular show in the cable universe (take note) it (or just about any other regular talk show) does not warrant its own episode guide. There have been 150 episodes done in the last year, and this page is now 99K. We don't have episode guides for nearly all game shows (like <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_of_Fortune_a6df.html" title="Wheel of Fortune">Wheel of Fortune</a>), the tonight show, letterman, the today show, maury, nightline and so forth, so why should a somewhat popular cable talk show get a guide?

Saying Similar articles don't exist is a lie. Saying this article is not useful is also a lie. This page is similar to many of these, most notably the "list of the simpsons" episodes. From which each episode has its own page, which in my opinion is less navigateable. This leaves us judging the article on "it takes up too much space". I'm not on WIKI an exceptional amount, but I didn't see any policy on "lists with many items not allowed" and if there is one, it should be respected. The simpsons list for instance; however, is twice the size of this one. Where is the threshold for too many items? Is it at exactly 154 episodes that a show has been on the air too often to have a wikipedia article? It's also <b>my opinion</b> that the submitter for deletion didn't do so in good faith and seems offended by the show itself being an "indiscriminate collection of facts" not the article.

<li>Normally I don't feed the socks, but I will give you one specific example simply to illustrate my point: In the comments for Episode 131, it states <i>"This is the first episode that has neither a Wørd nor an introductory phrase."</i> Has this fact every been previously published by credible, third-party sources? Obviously not. The only way for a Wikipedia editor to verify this fact is to sit down and watch all 131 episodes up to that point, which is not only completely impractical, but the very definition of "original research". That being said, however, if this article is kept, as now seems likely, I have the faith that editors with an interest in the subject will get the article up to standards.

<ul>
<li>Is it the definition of original research? I'm pretty sure that's not the spirit of the policy. The spirit is to have verifiable information.(although clearly one need merely scroll through the table to see that both boxes are empty there for the first time). As you said also anyone can sit down and watch the previous 130 episodes of the show (the show being a source). Won't every person that does sit down and watch it come to the same conclusion? You probably can't verify the colors of all the butterfly families without reading a portion of a probably large book. It is merely organized for use? P.S. not a sock just don't like registering for things when it's optional and wasn't aware it was unreasonable to post that way (69.76.206.124 06:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC))</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have a really hard time understanding some of this reasoning. There is a big difference between an episode guide for this and a network show like The Dukes of Hazzard. Dukes of Hazzard had like 25 episodes or so a season, and has much more established notability and ran on a network, meaning that more watched the show and recall it years later. This show has been on a year, is on cable, gets above average ratings, and with it's format, airs around 150-200 episodes a year, if it stays on the air. And that's just your opinion if the show is extremely popular, it averages around 1.5 million viewers, good for cable, but would be cancelled in days if on a network with those ratings. Just because you like the show or a few critics praise it doesn't assure that the show is massively popular. I'll stop, but there is just no reason for this page to be on here. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 18:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Firstly, I can't say if I like the show because it's not broadcast in the country where I live. Even if I did like it, that would be irrelevant. Just like your apparent dislike of the show does not matter either. There is no limitation at wikipedia to network shows. That sort of network/cable distinction is increasingly meaningless today. Secondly, the number of episodes broadcast is not a determining factor. We can not unfairly stigmatize the show for broadcasting a lot of episodes. However, given how often Colbert is in the news for one reason or another - certainly far more often than Barney or the stars of Dukes of Hazzard - I think we should be detailing his show's episodes. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:50, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> if only because I don't think individual episodes should get an article, yet it wouldn't be a good idea to not have the information.

Oh, and what they spend. And I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind a collection of who has been on the Tonight Show or the like.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't see how any of those lists you mentioned can be comparable to this one. Futurama is/was a weekly network series and had around 80 episodes. Even a low-rated episode of Futurama had its ratings several times more higher than the average episode of this show. I've said this before, if you want to keep using this guide and put it somewhere, why not make your own webpage for it? WP is not a webhost or a soapbox. I knew there were going to be a few hardcore fans of this show trying to clutter the vote just to get their show more attention, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.

An episode of a network cartoon series like Futurama is far more notable than 99% of episodes of this show.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: notable show with recurring elements and characters, much like a drama or comedy, for which we have tons of episode guides there. The argument against this article could have worked if the show was three or four weeks in and not likely to be successful, but as it is an extremely successful show and not a flash in the pan, the article must be kept. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - No one is soapboxing here, and the show varies significantly on a day-to-day basis.

<li><b>Comment</b> . If there are a lot of raw ghits for colbert-report, there are five (one, two, three, four, five) gbooks hits.

<li>The difference being that this king of Wessex has had 1300 years in which to have books written about him yet only has five hundred, whereas the Colbert Report has been on the air for roughly a year and already has five?&#160;:) Personally, I don't think benchmarks like Google hits or book numbers are very good means of comparing relative "prominence" of subjects, beyond a basic "yeah, other people have heard of this too" threshold.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The reason of suggesting deletion has no ground. you claimed the guide violated various parts of WP:NOT and yet you failed to come up any evidence at all. 1)Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought - This article is not. 2) Wikipedia is not a soapbox - This articale's not. 3) Wikipedia is not a directory and Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information - This article's not, plus with at least 10 editors contribution this is hardly "indiscriminate collection of information". If any of the above claims is true, then by your definition every TV episode guide on WP should be deleted. The most pointless arguement of all, which is the number of episode, is simply irrelevant. Since when WP has a guideline states how "few" episodes of a program should be eligible for a guide of its own?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is clear that the Colbert Report Episode Lst is being singled out due to the episode frequency. Just because something happens often should not disqualify it from wikipedia. The episode blurbs are short and to the point. This has NOT become a fanpage. A lot of notable people appear on the Report and it covers many current events. This guide provides an efficient way to quickly reference who/what has been covered and when. This information is not only useful for fans, but also for those researching the relationship between the Report and the news media, current events, notable individuals, political events, etc. If such a guide were available for the O'Reilley Report it would be useful in the same way.Sturmovik 04:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But the scope/audience/popularity of Pokemon is much larger than this show. Yeah, maybe you can't really do 100 articles with Einstein as the main focus, but those articles on their own will always carry more weight and be more viewed than a pokemon character. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 08:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

Notability isn't an issue as at least one of these segments has been aired/reported on by more legitimate news programs, not to mention the notability of the guests themselves.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As Daniel.Bryant points out, I originally listed this for speedy. I felt that saying "He is known to the YouTube community" did not count as asserting notability. Apparently not all agree with this, so I'll be a little more conservative in applying this criterion in the future. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_L%C3%A4ufer_4730.html" title="User:Heimstern Läufer">Heimstern Läufer</a> 17:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>To be fair, I think <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> A7 was a fine rationale the first time. However, in this case the author reposted the page twice after deletion. I tend to believe a repost following a speedy should automatically force an AfD because it counts as a contested speedy. Per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a>, it is improper to characterise these recreations as "vandalism" because they are violating guidelines, not policy. I therefore also contest the blocking of User:Stranger101.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Not a child, although it is a bit childish to start shouting or bolding your comments. I think if we are going to do lists of non-notable diploma mills - and let's admit it, they are all non-notable, meaningless and obscure - we should have articles on those diploma mills so we know what we are talking about. Doing lists of non-notable subjects is a waste of wikipedia time and space. The non-notable diploma mill list needs articles on all its underlying components, per the list guidelines, or it should not exist. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't waste my time nominating articles for deletion. I'm interested in expanding the extent of coverage at wikipedia, based on existing guidelines. However, copying diploma mill names from government websites in order to construct a pseudo-official diploma mill list at wikipedia that goes no further than the name of the school, and then deleting articles on the underlying diploma mills, does a disservice to the users of this reference work. It provides no better information than can already be found in outside databases. It violates both the meaning and spirit of the list guidelines. In my view, it is a sad waste of resources and editors' time. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:57, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

To respond to <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a>; the arbitrary inclusion of an institution on a list is not an argument for keeping an article about it, since anyone can write an article about a non-notable institution, add the institution to the list, and then argue to keep the article based on it being on the list.

<dd>The songs in Polkarama! are all singles that were released as singles, got a lot of radio play, and did well on the charts; otherwise, they wouldn't have been selected for the polka.

<li><b>Keep</b> this is a notable modification(If you talk Deathmatch, and the subject of Rocket Arena doesn't come up, the conversation is incomplete) of a game series that is itself notable, not a game guide or advertisement. It'd be one thing if the mod was only made for one game in the series, then I'd say pack it into that article. But Rocket arena is available for all of the Quake series, and there are equivalents in other games, like HL and UT. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:13, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although the article could use some cleanup to make it more encyclopedic. This mod certainly is a long-standing modification for many FPS games. With regard to the issues raised: 1) if it lacks sources, source it; 2) verfiability is hardly an issue since there is only one source (so see number 1 again) and 3) the software criteria are only guidelines (which I believe are met for this mod). I see no case for deletion here other than the highly arbitrary call to <i>gamecruft</i>.

<li><b>Response</b> My company is real and has been official for 9 years. The YouTube thing is only a recent addition to Whac Off! as it has only existed since the start of the year and the only thing that was specifically made for YouTube was the Matty And Deveski YouTube Show, and was created for non-profit purposes only and was made for fun nothing else, which is why I haven't advertised it offically on Google etc. The person who vandalised my page was a lonely loser who used my reputation for his own reasons, as he has no talent or motivation to suceed other than being a telemarketer loser, and being highly competitive and envious of anyone who isn't 27 and still living with their parents. Anyone who wants copies of the Whac Off! series which is free can email me on edrnet@hotmail.com, and I'll send it. With the world is disarray, comedy is our only thing which makes it livable.

<li>Why not? Wikipedia is not paper.

<dd>Not that I know of. If I had to make a general statement, though, I'd say that cases which make national or international news would usually be kept, while ones with only local attention usually wouldn't. Of course, if any of the participants are notable, it could be mentioned in their article. For example, the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Nolte_49d8.html" title="Nick Nolte">Nick Nolte</a> article mentions his drunk-driving arrest even though it was by no means a major or important crime. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's true, the relationship of the pub to the local area and especially to the Carlton and United Brewery would make it reasonably notable I should think, at the very least at a local level. I don't get why this article has been nominated for deletion again after already surviving one vote - that's not on if there is no additional reason why deletion is warranted (unless supporting sources can be shown to say that the article's contents are bogus... in which case deletion is more than warranted). So please tell us - why delete it? I don't think people here value local history very highly. Yes, the article needs a cleanup, but deletion, no. I'm sick of people nominating articles again just because they don't like something on here. Can you please outline why this should be deleted now when the first AfD debate held an overwhelming consensus?

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I've told you once in the nomination, but I'll tell you again as you've obviously missed it. <i>"I don't see any encyclopedic significance in this hotel"</i>. The wording in the article makes a claim that isn't supported, like "probably aided in the consolidation of the brewery". Probably could mean it's probably true, or probably not. We're not here to decide. Ignoring those claims in the article and judging the rest, to me it reads like a pub with no claim to notability whatsoever, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a pub guide</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 10:32, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not arguing against "Wikipedia is not a pub guide". It's not worth it if it were just an article about a pub. It well may be, but you have not established that. I am asking you about those claims, as it is these that establishes notability of the pub, not the rest of the article. I have said that there MAY be merit in examining the claims about the connection with the CUB Brewery. What you have given on this AfD is merely your own opinion that "I don't think it's encyclopedic." However that is not a reason for deletion on WP if it is your opinion that it is encyclopedic. Did you do any research on the pub besides running a Google search and check whether it was worth deleting or whether the historical claims had any notability at all? I gather you haven't. All I am asking is that you establish a definite claim to non-notability before you nominate an article for deletion that has already survived one debate. If there is no evidence that it is not notable it shouldn't be renominated. I think there are a lot of worthy articles with local history that are deleted just because people in another state or country have never heard of them. International interest is not the only thing served on this site, you know. (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:36, 5 October 2006 (UTC))

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Why do I need to do the research? Evidence of any notability should <i>already be included in the article</i>. If there's anything notable about this hotel that surfaces, then recreate the article, including evidence of that notability. It's that simple. For now, it has no notability whatsoever IMHO, just unsupported claims. I'm all for local history - but not when it's just a random collection of unproven facts. As someone else has already said below, <i>"not a lot of thought went on in the last AfD"</i>, and I agree. At least this time around we're giving the article some scrutiny - and still, no evidence whatsoever of notability has surfaced. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a>\<sup><a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">talk</a></sup> 05:58, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

I think we are treading on dangerous ground if articles can be re-nominated AfD (when there has been no material change to content and the information has not been disproven) just because we don't agree with the previous outcome. This seems like double jeopardy. If, as the article suggests, this is an Australian establishment with 150 years of heritage then it has local history value even if it doesn't get the right Google hits or it isn't listed on the VHR. I do agree however that some further work may be neede to uncover notability and a rename is required for it to come up to standard. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmitch_cbf2.html" title="User:Amitch">amitch</a> 14:08, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as per nom. Very limited discussion in the previous afd - arguments in favour were that the pub has a website and gets some google hits; it's quite old; and let's believe what the article says at inflated face value. I don't see any evidence of encyclopedic notability or even claim to encyclopedic notablility. The claims to fame boil down to 1) it was <i>one</i> of the first pubs existing <u>outside the city centre</u> in Melbourne. No claim here even that it might be one of the very first pubs in Melbourne. No verifiable evidence given that this building is historically notable for its architecture. 2) a theory about the connection with Carlton beer and the suburb Carlton which the article states has been disproved 3) Speculation ("probably") introduced as historical fact that the pub "aided" the early business of a local brewery (I doubt that one brewery can survive just depending on one pub, and even if the relationship was that crucial, this is hardly encyclopedic). 4) the first pub owner was a postman at the university (not notable) 5) a local football club held their reunion in the pub in 1995 (not notable) 6) students and staff at the local university <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html#I_like_it" title="WP:ILIKEIT">like it</a> (not notable) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:15, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with those above who believe that some of the negative information in the article was well sourced or fairly well sourced. Most important, the quote was attributed to an unnamed officer. That is pretty hard to falsify, especially given David Asimov's low notability. A newspaper (or possibly reckless mouthed officer) is on safe ground. I mean, if he had been the son of a famous active politician with supporters and rivals, various parts of the press would cared enough to do further digging, which would give partial braking action on the unattributed quote. By the way, I think that "average" offspring of famous people rarely get press coverage, hence notability, unless the famous person is an active politician. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_L._Peterson_830c.html" title="User:Richard L.

<li>Since this is the sort of thing that comes up in interpreting <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, it's worth a little bit of analysis. I don't know if it's my post you're referring to above, but basically there were three negative items in the previous version(s) of the article: (1) that the subject was charged with a crime; (2) that a police officer commented on the nature and quantity of the evidence against him; and (3) that he was convicted of a crime, possibly as a result of a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a>. Item (1) was uncontestedly well sourced, via a reputable newspaper reporting on verifiable matters of record. Item (2) is well sourced <i>as to the fact of the officer's allegation</i>, but not necessarily as to the fact of the matter referred to. Under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> we probably should not use it even as to the allegation, unless corroborated. Item (3) appeared only in tertiary sources, that is, quotes from news reports that were not sufficiently identified to permit verification, and at least one was from an attack/advocacy site which is manifestly not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<p>This appears to be a simple company advertisement (spam).

<p>Hmmm. I beg to differ, because any business that isn't of Microsoft proportions that has a page here then is arguably spam. This company is very well known internationally among racing sailors, and I was surprised to see it didn't have an article. Anyway, I can see removing the "dominant" part (even though that is factual...definitely for AC boats, and I'm 99% sure for Olympic non-1D classes), or taking out the logo's slogan (not sure if part of original logo--from site), but outright deletion seems...odd. Anyway, if there's any specific promotional bent to it, definitely feel free to correct it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntije_5a67.html" title="User:Antije">Antije</a> 11:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Thanks for taking the time to point that out to me, I was actually just trying to find more on the policy. Anyway, I am fairly certain it meets the first of the criteria. I remember seeing at least product reviews in Sailing World magazine or something of that ilk, and I've heard or read the story before (got most of the included details from the web though). Just looking at their site though briefly, looks like they've won the WI Governor's business awards a couple times, as well as the "Company of the Decade" award 01 for the marine industry. Either way, as I said, it's a highly recognizable name in racing sailors and probably the majority of crusiers as well. Of course I'm biased since I just spent a bunch of time putting together the article, but it seems pretty clear-cut all the same. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntije_5a67.html" title="User:Antije">Antije</a> 12:06, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Harken may not be a household name, but it is globally recognized in the sailing community. Young sailors just starting out will notice their boats are most likely Harken equipped and for older, more experienced racers it is often the brand of choice when they seek to equip their boats. That being said, please note that I am not employed in any way by Harken or the maritime industry. Although I'm not 100% sure I also strongly suspect that Harken sponsors regattas and other sailing events in communities around the world. I think it deserves an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintana_7e81.html" title="User:Quintana">Quintana</a> 11:00, 1 October 2006 (Eastern Time)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>:Taking cues from above--I should note that I have been employed in the marine industry, but it was the retail end and over 10 years ago. I am not an employee of this company. Anyway, I will leave the rest of the discussion to you guys, unless clarification is needed. I will however, include some links of "multiple [published] independent sources." Some mentions could probably be classified as trivial, some not. (For example, it is consistently listed in boat reviews as the selected hardware. Individual articles are probably trivial, but it's clear they are a major player and noteworthy brand.)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: After reviewing Brad's memo on Corporate Vanity I feel that the argument for keeping the Harken article is strengthened. The article does not seek to deface, insult or slander Harken, and at the same time it is not a marketing ploy to promote any of Harken's products. I feel that the article is more informative and educational on how Harken was founded, company history, and where Harken products are used. If the article needs to be edited further to remove any apparent marketing pitches please proceed, but I do not think it should be deleted if we are to follow Brad's guidelines and the Wikipedian spirit. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintana_7e81.html" title="User:Quintana">User:Quintana</a> 11:44, 1 October 2006 (Eastern Time)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I certainly disagree that all video games should be notable, but I think Billy more likely means ones released officially on consoles and arcade games. While I agree to a point, I think in certain cases many games might be best done up as single pages. Certainly there's no reason the two games in this series can't be combined into one, and I agree that being by Namco helps its case. As for anything beyond a stub? Well, no, it could theoretically be expanded, with screenshots and all. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 16:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>What does that DumbBOT "imcomplete/listed" post mean? (Yes, I'm a newbie, I'm sorry.) Does that mean the article is still marked for deletion? I've added further facts and citations. Is there anything else I can/should do, or will the article be deleted in X number of days regardless?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a Swede, she's notable enough for the original article in Swedish Wikipedia <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aina_Erlander" class="external autonumber" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aina_Erlander" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 10:46, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fair comment. But there are reliable sources to verify her existence as a PM's spouse, including a photo at <a href="http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/ceremony_sthlm/eyewitness/hench/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/ceremony_sthlm/eyewitness/hench/index.html" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, so there are two questions. Is being a famous spouse sufficient? In this case, I think so (per Uppland's comment and the indicative fact that the Swedes haven't nominated the article for deletion) - let's see if there's a consensus view on that. Separately, does her chairmanship of a national organisation <a href="http://www.ungaornar.se/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ungaornar.se/" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>?

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per Uppland. In addition she seems to have been active in a number of relatively high-profile posts. There isn't that much about her on the internet, but that is true of many notable persons who lived before the WWW became popular. The article does need sources, but many articles need sources; there is no special reason to think the information in this one is false, and so a "references needed" tag is more appropriate than an "afd" tag. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 08:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, agree with Uppland. Mereda, I can't find Aina E at your "Unga Örnar" link, but I would hardly expect to, as Unga Örnar is a youth organisation and the site is aimed at young people and children. The 1957–1966 chair wouldn't be a hot topic in that context.

<li><b>Delete</b> - the article admits it is an 'obscure reference', 'briefly flashed onscreen'. The website itself (in reality - not sure if it's meant to be connected) is a grey background, with the words 'mebious.co.uk'. In neither the article nor the site is notability affirmed. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 15:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Although I do concur in that Wikipedia's entry on mebious.co.uk does not warrant its own article, the argument that the notability of the page (grey background, etc) is not valid because the the notability of the site doesn't lie in its straightforward content. As the arcticle's author (if that means anything), I've no problem in the arcticle being deleted. However, I do feel the infortmation is useful enough to be reworded into a sentence about Lain's equiment in the Serial Experiments article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sandwich-pirate (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sandwich-pirate_562e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sandwich-pirate">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>How can you label something as spam that fast, did you bother to go to the web site? That directory is most inelegant way on the internet to find a design company, and Hundreds of people use it daily and find it useful. You list other niche directories on the List of web directories, why this one is not good enough? There are years of work and selection behind that directory, and you can make a decision in a few seconds that nobody needs it? --Falkond</p>

<p>As a new member, I am inspired by feedback to make productive changes to the article in order to follow the guidelines and to help in my learning experience. I have made changes to the article to keep it within the rules for <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographies_of_living_persons.html" title="Biographies of living persons">biographies of living persons</a>. • <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a> • <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> • <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">No original research</a> I would be happy to take on other feedback; I am doing this as a learning experience for future projects for my position. I have direct contact with the individuals the page is about, and I have their permission to publish the page. I have checked the facts in the page with what they have published about themselves, and with what is common knowledge. I found their biographies intriguing because of their large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following. I am still learning about how to set up the cite sources and should have more to add in the future. Please review the changes I have made prior to deleting and let me know what further links I need to read to make the corrections needed. Thanks Enamoredgirl</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <s>If you find any other unencyclopedic articles about non-notable shopping malls, you are free to post them under articles for deletion too. I have no idea why you think you need to "fight for Letterkenny", or why this process seems to involve creating pages about shopping venues in the town. I am sure that Letterkenny will survive without your help in this particular area. You should also consider using a single account in order to edit the Letterkenny-based articles, assuming that these are also you: <a href="../../../t/o/g/User%7ETogether%26forever_d8ab.html" title="User:Together&amp;forever">Together&amp;forever</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Big_Brain_6fd9.html" title="User:The Big Brain">The Big Brain</a>, <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwertyuiopasdfgh_vfen_447a.html" title="User:Qwertyuiopasdfgh vfen">Qwertyuiopasdfgh vfen</a>.

<dd>The degree to which this is untrue, or rather insufficient, is the problem this article was (painstakingly, I might add) written to address. There are two arguments against accepting anarcho-capitalism as anarchistic, which are similar to why one might not call <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Zimbabwe_69f9.html" title="Politics of Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> a democracy despite the claims of the <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanu_PF_5b54.html" title="Zanu PF">Zanu PF</a>. Firstly, the "an-cap is an oxymoron" argument states that because capitalism (and in particular an-cap) supports the authority of ownership absolutely what would be achieved under an-cap wouldn't be a lack of a state but a series of private states, thereby a non-anarchy. The other argument is to point out that anarchism is more than a concept but a historical practice and a body of theory, one being entirely, incontrovertably anti-capitalist. This article sets out to address this, and shouldn't be deleted but made the cornerstone of the WP approach to an-cap-as-anarchism. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"If the article is supposed be about whether anarcho-capitalism's claim that it's a form of anarchism is a false claim". It isn't this - it is a discussion on that claim but especially on the relationship between the an-cap movement and the (universally socialistic) anarchism movement that predates and rejects an-cap. It is concerned only with an-cap-as-anarchism, and is not a discussion of the criticisms of an-cap at all. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions"><b>G</b><small>ood</small><b>I</b><small>ntentions</small></a><sup><a href="../../../g/o/o/User_talk%7EGood_Intentions_ebc9.html" title="User talk:Good Intentions">talk</a></sup> 06:07, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The title as it stands now seems to indiciate that Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism are two different things which, in my opinion, they're not.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no such dispute between anarcho-capitalism and other forms of anarchism in academia. It's simply some editors on Wikipedia debating over it and that's why there shouldn't be an article. You too seem to be assuming that anarcho-capitalism something other than anarchism in your wording that "this is a dispute between anarchism and the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism." Anarchism is an umbrella term than includes various kinds of anarchism. A debate between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism makes no sense at all and is inherently POV because the POV being pushed is that they're two distinct philosophies. <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">DTC</a> 16:18, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Blatantly untrue. Real scholarship on anarchism is rare, most cited works are simply broad works on philosophy and politics that mention without any real analysis what people say. Proper scholarship on anarchism is by anarchists - Chomsky, Peter Marshall, Paul Avrich, Howard Zinn, etc. Proper scholarship on "anarcho"-capitalism is virtually non-existent, aside from its own proponents. It's been nearly 100 years (1910) since one of the most respected works of reference, The Encyclopaedia Britannica, requested that Kropotkin write the section on anarchism because they recognised that the hostility against its ideas blighted virtually all other sources. This remains true, those who truly analyse and document anarchist ideas are anarchists themselves, thus the dispute between anarchism proper and "anarcho"-capitalism is central to the primary academic discussion of anarchism. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 16:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>No source is mentioned, which is logical inasmuch as the value of these equivalences seems very doubtful to me, for several reasons.</p>
<p>The chart gives equivalences between Greek and Norse gods but:</p>
<ul>
<li>there was no such “equivalences made in ancient times”, because pagan Greeks had no contact with Scandinavians, and because later Scandinavian writers of the Middle Ages had a mostly Latin, not Greek, cultural background;</li>
<li>I’m not sure these equivalences have very often been “proposed by modern scholars”, at least over the last century. Interesting comparisons can be made only between religions who both share important Indo-European features, which is not really the case of Greek paganism (cf. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georges_Dum%C3%A9zil_7d53.html" title="Georges Dumézil">Georges Dumézil</a>’s work, who hardly ever dealt with Greek myths).</li>
</ul>
<p>A few equivalences exist though between Norse and Roman deities, made both in ancient times (cf. <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>) and by modern scholars (cf. Dumézil again), but they’re far from being as numerous as in this chart, and far from being as obvious too. For instance, Odin is given here as the counterpart of Zeus / Jupiter, but he’s sometimes given as the equivalent of Mercury (cf. Wednesday) or Mars.</p>
<p>Finally, most of these equivalences are very much questionable: for instance Gefjun / Tyche, whereas Gefjun is generally connected to Diana (sometimes Vesta), or Járnsaxa / Athena: Járnsaxa is not even a goddess, but a giantess. I could give several other examples of deities who have nothing, or hardly anything, in common.</p>
<p>That’s the reasons why I think the few interesting facts should be mentioned in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretatio_romana.html" title="Interpretatio romana">Interpretatio romana</a>, and the rest should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigo_e102.html" title="User:Sigo">Sigo</a> 18:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, it's not a private essay article. I did gather some information on the subject. I started this article because I don't think this topic IS heavily covered, and I would like to see some community input. For example, what development methodologies do people developing web applications use? I couldn't find this information on Wikipedia. There's plenty of information on web design. And there's plenty of information on software development. But I haven't seen much about web application development.</p>
<p>Now, I'm making the distinction between web design and web application development. Are you making the same distinction between web design and web development? If so, maybe we could merge these articles, since I don't see nearly enough useful information on the web development page. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDRogers_1887.html" title="User:DRogers">DRogers</a> 18:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is deceptively long but it's still about an unnotable Myspace-band that self-produces its music and whose claim to fame is being in the "top 50 general comedy chart" on soundclick.com, hardly a reliable measure of his importance.

<p>Interesting, and probably valid, points all around. Forgive me for not reading the notability guidelines before posting. While it is true that BNATSC has not had any major commercial success, as far as "internet" bands go, BNATSC is, in my opinion legendary. A look at the artist's statistics on mp3.com, purevolume.com, myspace.com, soundclick.com, and download.com will reveal that BNATSC has received well over 120,000 listens, something most "myspace bands" never accomplish. Add in the fact that, BNATSC does not tour or promote his music regularly, and you'll see that the sheer volume of his popularity is quite impressive for being a result of heresay alone. A quick search on youtube.com will also reveal several fan videos of BNATSC songs.</p>
<p>Regardless, does this entry stand up as valid in light of the notability requirements for musicians and bands? I do not believe so. Though it does stand up against the vanity argument. My name is Todd and I am a long-time fan of BNATSC from Littleton, CO. I wrote the article to suit the interests of myself, the artist, and other devoted fans like myself.</p>
<p>I will not delete this article, but, in the light of my comments, feel free to do so. 84theman 13:02, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

A thorough Google seach turns up thousands of hits for hundreds of profiles and directory listings, but no non-trivial independent coverage (quick mentions in blogs I'm counting as "trivial").

<li><b>Keep</b>, as BrainBread is a considerably notable <i>Half-Life</i> mod. The mod is continuously in the top 20-25 ranking of all Steam multiplayer games and mods being played at any time (<a href="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" rel="nofollow">Official Steam Stats</a>); it was picked by Valve to be listed in Steam's store, both on the official Steampowered site and through the program itself, as a free mod to download (See its listing at the <a href="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=90006&amp;" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=90006&amp;" rel="nofollow">Steam store</a>, also note that <i>only</i> 24 mods, out of the hundreds and hundreds available, are listed); and it is one of the more popular <i>Half-Life</i> mods today. For example, Brainbread is, even to this day, consistently in the top 20 downloads of the week at <a href="http://halflife2.filefront.com/" class="external text" title="http://halflife2.filefront.com/" rel="nofollow">HL2Files.com</a>, which is, quite interestingly, a major site in the FileFront network dedicated to <i>Half-Life 2</i>, not <i>Half-Life</i>. It has currently amasssed over <a href="http://halflife2.filefront.com/file/HalfLife_BrainBread_V12_Full_Install;36091" class="external text" title="http://halflife2.filefront.com/file/HalfLife_BrainBread_V12_Full_Install;36091" rel="nofollow">115,000 downloads</a> on this site as well. As it was hand picked by Valve Software themselves to be listed in Steam, and it is one of the most popular <i>Half-Life</i> mods around, I believe that Brainbread is notable enough to keep. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 21:17, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You talk as if being officially recognized by Valve, quite possibly the most authoritative source around on the subject of <i>Half-Life</i> mods (they made the game, after all), is merely something to scoff at. Anyway, I think that you fail to grasp the concept at hand here. Valve is not simply just listing the mod on their site (although this in of itself is an exceptionally high honor), but they're actively helping to distribute the mod by directly advertising it through Steam. The same can only be said of about 20 or so other <i>Half-Life</i> mods.</li>

<li><b>speedy keep</b> - The nominator has suggested that there were only "vague arguments about the fact that people play [Firearms]." In reviewing the previous nom, I quickly came across this: "This was the number 3 mod after CS and TFC for halflife 1 until DoD came out. It was on contract with valve for distribution with all new HL cd's I believe starting with game of the year edition. It was featured in PC Gamer magazine. Won mod of the year from PCGamer and runner up game of the year for 2000." A re-nomination really should be done on the basis of considerable concern over the validity of the previous result, not because the article has not been improved. If that's the concern, then improve the article. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 21:43, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable, if only historically. Was an extremely popular mod, won several awards, was published by valve on their GOTY and CS retail releases, and an appreciation of its characteristics has direct relevance to upcoming HL2 mods such as WaW and FA:S. It also debateably introduced a number of features which are now common to FPSs such as stamina, reinforcements, territorial control game mode and going prone.

<li><b>Delete</b> -The label is more of a "anyone can produce their album" here kind of label. Their sole notability is as a local band that occasionally plays at small clubs. There is a reason for the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> policy. It is important to keep Wikipedia a serious encyclopedia, rather than a catalog of pop culture references and pages about our friends bands. Until they release a second album they should use myspace as a place to post their band info and promote their album. Wikipedia is not for promotion. The band does not have enough notibility to have had a page authored by someone who isn't a fan or acquaintance. If a member of the band, an acquaintance, or fan authors a page about someone it is possible vanity. Delete on grounds of non-notability of music band per Wikipedia itself, as well as Vanity, and self-promotion rather than informative content. If everyone puts up a page about themselves or their favorite local band against Wikipedia standards then Wikipedia will cease to have any order and serious content.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 23:48, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia. Put Elvis in there. You can even put Rev. Horton Heat in there. Those fellows were famous. They had a lot of music released. This band isn't notable according to Wikipedia policy. They have one release? How did it chart? Did it chart at all? Because anyone can have a cd out these days on certain labels. International tour? Maybe Canada is technically international. Its within walking distance of many American cities though. And playing all-ages venues that fit 50 people is a far cry from the kind of international tour that an actual notable like U2 puts on. Let's keep Wikipedia clutter free.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I did the google search and the results included their wikipedia article, which would be an absurd result to justify itself, as well as their own webpage, which anyone can have and will come up in google, and then a couple hits for the same local entertainment paper for a city that I had to look up. I don't think that google can be an exhibit of notable-ness unless the standard for notable is very low. I looked my own name up and came up with dozens of hits for myself, and dozens for other people with my name, despite its uncommonness. In the case of Strata also, many of the hits did not directly pertain to them, but pertainned to other things 'strata' since it is also a common word as well as their proper name. Google is easily misconstrued as a clue to notable, which it can never be- anyone can show up dozens of times. Try typing in your own name. Likely you will find comments you made in usenet, or a review of your high school football skills from 1989, or mention of you in the local Rotary chapter's web newsletter, or your myspace page. etc. Bluetie46 01:39, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is for a non-notable speedrun, about which the claims made just can't be verified. There's no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> claiming that this is the fastest ever, nor will there ever be, since the reliable sources that cover video game world records don't cover tool-assisted speedrunning (or much speedrunning in general, for that matter). This may be a world record, but it's a world record in such a narrow category (tool-assisted human-controlled Doom II speedrunning) that it's never going to be verifiable.</p>
<p>This was prodded but was deprodded with the justification that it's difficult to verify such things in reliable sources. I argue that things that cannot be verified do not belong in this encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:36, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>but there are other entries in wikipedia itself that read like how to guides for drugs so you argument for that is irrelevant (such as, the shotti page, the bong page, and even the coke page is way worse) and the fact that you don't even understand the legal charges that invole the possession of illigal paraphernalia or pot, would only get you around a month or less in jail, a fine, or they might just let you off. It seems to me like you are just being difficult in this situation for no reason, but if your webpage is supposed to be this great encyclopedia, well then excluding one page while allowing others in the same category is wrong, maybe the page does not get the hits you think it requires, then tell the page creators how to change that, and if you do not believe that the popularity of yattis is not on the rise you are wrong, I live in Canada as well and I have herd of them, I garuntee in 5 years it will be all over the place and with this page your site will be ahead of everone else, either way you should not be attacking the page the way you are, treat all people the same no matter their background, all are equal, thank you <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.173.164.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.173.164.121_aa48.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.173.164.121">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>poor editing and inappropriate content on other pages are no excuse! because the comment by 129.173.164.121 did not log in with a user name I am forced to respond here, but I would like to remind that person to more directly address their own reasons for keeping or deleting the article here and direct the extraneous criticism of my viewpoint, in a manner that does not directly pertain to the AfD, to my talk page. I would do the same, but it would not reach someone not signing in without a username. Canadian drug law has a maximum sentence of 5 years for marijuana possesion. It *is* the maximum, and would not be used for a first offense, but it does agree with my statement that it could fetch 5 years in prison. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_drugs_and_substances_act.html" title="Controlled drugs and substances act">Controlled_drugs_and_substances_act</a> and <a href="http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/96736.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.drugtext.org/library/articles/96736.htm" rel="nofollow">drugtext.org</a>. Furthermore, yes I should be attacking this and any other page that doesn't meet the standard of quality I expect from wikipedia. And it is in way about treating people in any manner regarding background. I stand behind my vote.
