<p>An article listing people who may or may not have had syphilis.

Previous keep editors were commenting on a well-sourced article, but it has only two book references as its only source of information. In no way meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and reads like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

A large percentage of the articles for those listed do not mention syphilis and one can suspect that some of them are not entirely honestly motivated, such as Charles Darwin and Stalin. I suggest that any proven cases be added to the individual articles if not already and the article be deleted and/or create a category for this list if necessary. <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b>Khukri</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khukri_f113.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 23:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The above remarks about "self-publishing and non-notable unverified" are unfair and false. The publishing houses can be verified that these pay royalities and the books are not self-published. Google search on "sukhraj dhillon" will bring over 600 references many of them showing various publications. The modified text below may clear some misunderstanding. Thanks.</p>
<p>For many of us yoga, prana, Sudarshan Kriya, meditation is something for which we go to some remote corner in Himalayas or some ashram in India and expect miracles. These ancient techniques are finally explained by someone who has studied science in the West at Yale University, and his books on Eastern and Western Approach has been accepted by major publishing houses. Dr. Sukhraj S. Dhillon is the author, for example, of practical guide that combines various stress treatment approaches that has been recognized for centuries by faith healers and meditators, and are now accepted by modern medical practitioners. The first Indian-American non-fiction author known to combine Ancient Eastern Wisdom and modern Western Scientific knowledge. What is called “Sudarshan Kriya” by new age gurus is a cycle of breaths—long, medium and short. Not only breathing patterns influence our emotions, the breath is in the present and is used to "rope in the wandering mind" that oscillates wildly between the past and the future. Like Zen masters who teach that the present moment is a chink opening into eternity.</p>

<p>Speedy nomination was declined, so I'm bringing this up at AFD instead. I believe that the subject of this article is not notable enough for wikipedia. He manages three divisions of the police department in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henderson%2C_Nevada_98c0.html" title="Henderson, Nevada">Henderson, Nevada</a>. In addition, he has been consulted for a few CSI episodes (although it does not become clear what he advised, and what was done with it) and he seems to have had a few very brief television appearances in a real life soap. Oh, and he chairs the Motorola Biometrics Users’ Group Executive Board. If something salvagable is in this article, it would still need a thorough rewrite.

<li><b>Delete</b> - "Knight" in German is <i>Ritter</i> (and in an unusual usage <i>ein Retter in der Not</i> =a knight in shining armour), so I'd need to see proof of the odd spelling offered.

<p>Actually I <i>don't</i> want to delete this article or its companion List of literary works with eponymous heroines but I do think something needs to be done with them. Didn't want to use the talk pages because I wanted a broader perspective. "Heroes" is subjective and POV and I'm unsure that there need to be separate articles for male and female characters. So I'm thinking move the article to List of literary works with eponymous protagonists and merging the two articles together but since merging would be a fair amount of work I wanted feedback before doing it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh, and if consensus is that separate lists are wanted then I would move the heroes list to List of literary works with eponymous male protagonists and the female list to List of literary works with eponymous female protagonists. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The word "hero" or "heroine" should not be considered "subjective" in this critical context (A character of a "hero" is actually a literary device, some academics would say). Though, "protagonists" would probably work just as well. Given the amount of works named for both male and female characters, I'd say keep the lists separate. Especially since there are a lot of lists separated by gender. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 02:06, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, in terms of a critical standpoint, those characters are considered <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-heroes</a>, and it just indicates that they're on the wrong list.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nominator may not want to have this deleted, but if he was looking for feedback and to have other matters assessed, that's what the article's talk page is for. Now that it's here, I believe it's open to the community to consider whether or not it ought to be kept. I do not see the encyclopedic value of this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> because being an eponymous hero/protagonist/whatever does not actually have encyclopaedic connotations, thereby rendering this a trivia list. GassyGuy 05:15, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Ultra weak keep</b> (copied from the sister debate on eponymous heroines) The debate is whether or not we consider this to be an indiscriminate collection of information. Although the list could use a bit of cleanup, the info in there is easily verifiable so <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is really the sole thing to worry about. While I personally see no great value in such a list, it could be kept on the grounds that Wikipedia is not paper. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 00:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is perhaps not paper, but we do have standards. One important one is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is violated whenever a list requires a "judgment call" as to whether something fits on the list or not. By way of example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Harry_Potter_d003.html" title="List of characters in Harry Potter">List of characters in Harry Potter</a> is not OR-a character either is in Harry Potter or is not, that requires no judgment on the part of an editor. On the other hand, a hypothetical List of evil characters (and that better not turn blue!) would require OR-who decides who is evil? Would Darth Vader qualify, given his eventual turnaround? This would require a judgment call and would therefore be an unacceptable subject-and so does this one. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 06:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand an "eponymous hero" isn't really a judgement call, unless we're nitpicking about the term "hero". Other than that, a fictional character who also happens to be the title of the work requires no judgement call. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 05:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, as was already pointed out, there are some debatable entries on the list (e.g., <i>The Great Gatsby</i>), so this one isn't quite as clear cut as the aforementioned List of characters in Harry Potter, even though I agree it is less subjective than would be a list of evil characters. GassyGuy 18:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, not that I feel very strongly about the whole thing but if the only argument against this list is that it should be cleaned up, then let's clean it up. How hard can that be? The argument should be about whether a "perfect" list on this topic would be worth keeping. In my mind it's a fairly close call. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 02:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My argument actually wasn't that it should be cleaned up, but rather that being an eponymous hero in itself is trivial, not encyclopaedic. I was merely pointing out that this isn't a completely objective criterium. GassyGuy 02:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He is the main subject of: "Technology pioneer blown away by the company he keeps now" (The Newcastle Journal, Oct 8 2004), "Search engine marketing: The Revolution Masterclass on search engine marketing" (Revolution Magazine, Feb. 2005) and there are at least another five other published articles where he is not the subject but is cited as an expert on search-based internet marketing. All of this is in addition to the BBC interviews presently linked in the article. The article needs work, but it shouldn't be deleted on the basis of non-notability. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 23:54, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I assume it is a variation of one of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html#Alternative_tests" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">alternative tests</a> offered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIO" class="extiw" title="w:BIO">W:BIO</a> which asks if someone will find this article useful in the future. This test is problematic in my view as it can allow people to slip into the "I've never heard about it/I don't like or care about it" trap and declare a subject not-notable because they think if they don't care now, no one could possibly care in the future. Personally, for me the subject of this article fails this right now (I don't care about the subject or find the article useful), but he has been noted and discussed multiple times in reputable sources satisying the primary test of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It is not the editor's job to judge notability of every article - published sources often do that for us. If they think he is notable, the subject should stay and perhaps this will grow into an interesting article. Ok, I'll get off my soapbox now.&#160;;) <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 09:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The rest of the relevant hits are law-related articles pertaining to his granting of asylum, pages culled from search stats, and one letter to the editor from a Kenyan paper, none of which either alone to in total are indicators of notability. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Question</b> What is wrong with <i>law-related</i> providing a basis for notability? --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 09:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Then what is notable about this article, the individual, or the case? This is an important distinction, and there's doesn't seem to be anything notable about Orenge aside from his case, which is what I pointed out in the nom. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 17:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Nahason Orenge is notable because he is/was a crusading journalist who was considered enough of a threat for the government to arrest in violation of the Kenya Constitution. That alone might be sufficient. He also would be notable as an asylum seeker who established that even a government officially friendly to the United States is allowed to prove the asylum standard, "in fear of his life" for political reasons. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 00:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think what you're esentially saying is that Orenge's situation is notable, but I can't find any notable accomplishments of his own, not even a listing of articles aside from that one letter. Also, one aspect of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> is that people are not notable due to situations they are in. Moreover, Orenge has not received the level of coverage of say, Mandela or Biko. In short, my contention is that there are plenty of political asylum seekers, and that alone does not make them notable. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 04:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(1)If you want someone to do something to be notable, being a crusading journalist who is willing to put himself at risk for the truth is one good way. I agree that he hasn't had as much coverage as Mandela or Biko did, but given the relatively short length time he was imprisoned compared to Mandela or Biko, it was a lot. His successful fight with Kenya alone should make him notable. (2) There are thousands of political asylum seekers each year. They don't make the newspapers. Orenge's successful, so far, claim is that political asylum can be sought against a peaceful, friendly-to-the-US government. That is why it was newsworthy and that is why it is important in our developing asylum jurisprudence. If Orenge did not have underlying crusadier journalist notability, then the Wikipedia article might well be just about the lawsuit and not about Orenge, but he does and we don't need two separate articles. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 04:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Other than (stating the obvious here) disagreeing with you. dasBlog is notable asp.net software. We have a larger fan base, greater name recognition and a longer history than many of the other entries listed in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog_publishing_system.html" title="Blog publishing system">Blog_publishing_system</a>. Since you place so much importance on registered accounts I'll have you know that over the past year I have contributed to plenty of entries, contributed to more than one WP donation drive, and been a generally active Wikipedia anonymous user/editor. This was the first time I wanted to start my own entry and thought it prudent to provide some reference to the content for those reading it, not those judging its worth.

<p>Article about one of many characters from a single novel (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Westing_Game_8281.html" title="The Westing Game">The Westing Game</a></i>). Has minimal potential for expansion due to the its narrow scope; currently only exists as a primitive list of characteristics, and could only be added to by summarizing most of the book at the same time. Nominating for deletion rather than redirecting because there is no conceivable reason why someone would be looking up the character rather than the book, and because the existence of an article for the one character at the omission of all the others is a minor spoiler. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnint_1508.html" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 02:45, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a copy and paste from an anarchist wiki which explicitly does not operate on the principle of NPOV for understandable reasons. However, the entire premise of the article is flawed; nihilism as a movement was quite distinct from anarchism despite some overlap between individuals and a general anti-State platform. "Nihilist anarchism" is a neologism at best; I feel that this entire article is original research, much of it totally off-base (to see Nietzsche as a nihilist is a patent misreading that no competent scholar of the man would take seriously). The information in the article which IS worthwhile should be in the <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a> article, and I suspect some of it already is. --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETothebarricades.tk_2bb0.html" title="User:Tothebarricades.tk">Tothebarricades</a> 03:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Asking why I think this is original research is like asking why I think an apple is an apple. It's written in the form of an essay, synthesizing the works of many writers/thinkers, who themselves are not properly referenced, as well as other statements that could be coming from anywhere. There is next to zero chance this will be sourced to wikipedia's satisfaction.

I wouldn't want someone to delete my edits without at least asking for sources first, just to make sure it's not original research. I know that there is such a thing as anarcho-nihilism. From the Anarchist Theory FAQ: "Closely linked to emotivist anarchism, though sometimes a little more theoretical, is nihilist anarchism. The anarcho-nihilists combine the emotivist's opposition to virtually all forms of order with radical subjectivist moral and epistemological theory."<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 05:26, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The entry is entirely sourced, though I did miss adding some of the sourcing. nihilist anarchy has become more common political theory within the anarchist movement in the United States. As stated in the talk section, the theories of nihilist anarchy can be found in the two largest anarchist magazines related to political theory in the United States, "Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed" and "Green Anarchy". In addition to this a growing movement is springing from these theories, which synthesize post-left critique and anti-civilization critique with Russian nihilist history, early Anarchist history (which shares a common trajectory with today's nihilist anarchy) and the works of Nietzsche, which act as much as an influence on the theory as Nechayev's Revolutionary Catechism Sourcing: Beginning paragraph and section 1 sourcing can be found at <a href="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org" class="external free" title="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.pistolsdrawn.org</a> section 2.1 did have a source from "The Epic of Russian Literature" notably the connection, between Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Russian nihilism.

<li><b>Dispute on Consensus still?</b>I don't think it should end with deletion, especially when there isn't a consensus. User William Gillis' statement isn't up to date with the anarchist movement and the currents that are coming from it. As a practicing nihilist anarchist, I can tell you that it is distinct in its synthesis. User Tothebarricades, I never implied that Nietzsche was a nihilist nor a nihilist anarchist, I implied that he is an influence on today's current of nihilist anarchy. Even the title of section 2 implies it "Nihilist Anarchy is not Nietzsche's Nihilism nor is it Neo-Russian Nihilism". The title exposes a possessive in regard's to Nietzsche and his theories of nihilism. If that didn't convince "Nietzsche's rebellion against nihilism has little to do with the Russian nihilists and their struggle against Russian autocracy" is also found in the intro paragraph to section 2. So Tothebarricades, I feel this analysis is without merit. I've read many wikipedia articles and footnote sourcing is more than common. I can apply inlines, but I need a moment to do so, I only became aware of this attempt to delete today.Brokendoor 04:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Edit but Keep</b>Okay, after reading more on "original research" I can see how you interpret some of this as original. The nihilist and anarchist history is simply to show the trajectory of influence many nihilist anarchists hold, while the explanation of Nietzsche is ment to overcome a common mistake to confuse "nihilist anarchy" "russian nihilism" and "Nietzsche's nihilism" I'll add the following notes and inlines tonight to justify keeping.</li>
<li>Section 2 intro "An understanding of the Russian nihilism of the 1860s begins with an attempt to understand the concept of nihilism. This is naturally difficult because if there is a word that has even more loaded, and negative, connotations than anarchism it would be nihilism. This is particularly because the primary vehicle of our modern understanding of nihilism is through the fiction of Turgenev and Dostoevsky. Neither of these authors were particularly sympathetic to nihilism and provided nihilist characters primarily as a frame with which to drape their morality tales." from "A History of Russian Nihilism" <a href="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=30" class="external free" title="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=30" rel="nofollow">http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=30</a> so paragraph 1. Dostoevsky is hostile to the ideas of Russian nihilism.</li>
<li>Because both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche are hostile to "nihilism" I figured a note was in order so that confusion didn't occur between the two terms, as well as expose the connection found in the "Epic of Russian Literature" that Dostoevsky's understanding of nihilism was a heavy influence on Nietzsche, who was also abstract of the Russia situation and developed his definition without its history in mind.</li>
<li>In "Nihilism as Strategy" <a href="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30" class="external free" title="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30" rel="nofollow">http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30</a> it states "Philosophically much has resulted from the nihilist ideas on value, aesthetics and practice. Most notably in Adorno's conception of Negative Dialectics, a principle which refuses any kind of affirmation or positivity, a principle of thorough-going negativity. The nihilist tradition includes Adorno, Nietzsche, Bakunin, much of classic Russian literature, Dada, punk rock, Heidegger, existentialist, post-structuralist and post-modern thinkers, and much of anarchism." Justifying a further look into Nietzsche and his ideas and exposing the connection to Dostoevsky.</li>
<li>Russian nihilism is declared an influence of nihilist anarchy in "What is Left?" <a href="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=30" class="external free" title="http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=30" rel="nofollow">http://www.pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=30</a> and explains the reasoning "What Nihilism provides then is an alternative to the alternative that does not embed an idealist image of the new world it would create. It is not an Idealist project. Nihilism states that it is not useful to talk about the society you 'hold in your stomach', the things you would do 'if only you got power', or the vision that you believe that we all share. What is useful is the negation of the existing world. Nihilism is the political philosophy that begins with the negation of this world. What exists beyond those gates has yet to be written." Because Russian nihilism is an influence on nihilist anarchy, I felt it necessary to detail this, I can instead insert this information in its appropriate channels.</li>
<li>"Fathers and Sons" is quoted because Bazarov is constantly sourced as a major influence and a felt I would expose an excerpt as to why and where Bazarov agrees with nihilist anarchy. To continue with "What is Left" the section entitled "Nihilism meet Anarchism" details "Libertarian Socialists also had another name that may be useful to differentiate from it from its Socialist brethren, anarchism. If Libertarian Socialism is overly concerned with self-management, federations, and workingmen's associations then anarchism may very well have been concerned with how to integrate the Russian innovations of nihilism. Bakunin is the case in point. Revisionists, of the Libertarian Socialist stripe, would focus entirely on Bakunin's positive agenda of arguing for collective action to achieve anarchy; freedom of press, speech and assembly; and the eventual voluntary associations that would federate to organize society, including the economy. They do not attend to his negative agenda of demolishing political institutions, political power, government in general, and the State. As Bakunin provided the Nihilists with a formative gift in his essay "Reaction in Germany" (1842), he also received a gift from the practice of the Nihilist Dmitry Karakozov and his failed assassination attempt of the Tsar Alexandar II. Ten years later this nihilist practice (that was is full swing by this time) became the policy of the largest anarchist federation on the European Continent. This so called “propaganda by the deed” is the primary historical vehicle by which we know anarchism (and which Libertarian Socialists spend much of their time apologizing for and distancing themselves from)." and justifies a deeper examination into this period of time to explain why. the source at the bottom entry for nihilist anarchism = "Nihilism and Anarchy" extends this sourcing to show that they do indeed share a common history, as does various sourcing within the "History of the 1st International" showing nihilists of Russia entering the anarchist movement. Does this explain that I'm not doing original research but in fact clarifying points that already are a part of nihilist anarchy?Brokendoor 02:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I dunno, I have written several articles about breath mints. I guess the question is, is this a <i>notable</i> gum. I bet we have an article on Wrigley's Gum (and if not we should). So how does a gum show notability? I don't know, I'm just asking. We don't have WP:GUM to look to. I find the claim that a <i>gum</i> gives you <i>bigger breasts</i> to be somewhat different, I don't know if that makes it notable or not. What happens if a man chews it? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 05:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, the WP:GUM seems a bit of a red herring, this article is specifically written about the corporate entity; not the product.

Their site also says they make herbal chewing gum and have their own "house brands" including breast gum, hoodia gum, stress gum, anti-aging gum, virility gum and teeth whitening gum. I think if the references were changed accordingly the topic should be kept. Sfiore76 18:30, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT Delete any of these articles</b> I come here today to inform you all that we are part of making history. How come we don't know who was mayor of Caulfield in 1963? How come I can't find it on Google or Yahoo? Because it is rarely documented. If we delete these people's name, we destroy history. If we are going to destroy councillors' history, then why don't we destroy every MP in the world's history? I beg of you all to rethink and change your vote to don't delete.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These councillors caused the famous and controversial sacking of Victorian local council. Alan Grossbard was Glen Eira's first mayor and a former Caulfield councillor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Veronika Martens was Glen Eira's first female mayor and was acouncillor for Caulfield and Glen Eira for nearly 30 years, I repeat 30 years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The mayoralty vote between Jamie Hyams and Bob Bury broke a 140-year tradition of confidential voting before the official vote so that the mayor was elected unopposed - that caused a lot of controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Peter Goudge and Rachelle Sapir were both political candidates for their respected political parties in 2002 victorian state election.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And who can forget Noel Erlich, also a former Caulfield councillor, been involved in brawls with Grossbard and David Feldman (before he was even elected to council). Erlich is said to have been the major cause the Bury vs Hyams mayoralty vote and the sacking of the Glen Eira Council.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The councillors after the sacking also caused history. David Feldman, Kate Ashmor and Nick Staikos are all councillors in the same ward under the age of 30. Nick Staikos is the youngest Glen Eira councillor in history and Steven Tang is the second youngest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All these councillors are apart of history. Delete them, and you rather's well destroy the Internet and burn every history book on your bookself, because delete them will be deleting history. I rest my case. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatonB_bf62.html" title="User:CatonB">CatonB</a> 10:47, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately (and I do sympathise with your position more broadly) I still can't see how any of these points establish notability for each of these individuals. Very few of these things matter outside an immediate local area, and probably not even to many people within that area. Most of these records you cite relate to events within one council - extend it to Melbourne-wide or even Australia-wide, and remember this is an international encyclopaedia, and you find the same sorts of things are going on everywhere. Many of these things (eg the 1963 Caulfield mayor) would be locatable in the State Library and various local libraries in the Local History section. My own council, for example, produced a 300 page book offered for loan or sale through all libraries, and neighbouring ones have as well which adequately document many areas, although admittedly have a pro-council POV and leave many gaps.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The councillors under 30 - doesn't Greater Dandenong have a mayor under 30? "Glen Eira's first female mayor" doesn't mean much when the council only goes back 12 years - the one I live in, for example, has 136 years of history and first had a female mayor in the 70s. Political candidacy does not ensure notability without any other criteria - if they don't win, their notability fades. However they would deserve a note under the electorate in which they ran. A decent piece on the sacking (I've attempted to write one at <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Glen_Eira_6af8.html" title="City of Glen Eira">City of Glen Eira</a> based on the published reports) belongs in the council article. If the only notable thing about a councillor is that they've been sacked, there's a councillor in my area who got sacked one year ago and was on the lead on Seven News, but whom I doubt is notable even as a 22-year councillor. There is at least one councillor in WA who has been in for - get this - 62 years. Read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> carefully - it almost expressly excludes local politicians unless they have some notability *outside* their time in office.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My suggestion would be to do what I'm doing for my home region and write a book about the local area. You'd be amazed what you can turn up in State Records and the State Library, and it may end up being a far more interesting narrative than anything you'd be allowed to publish here. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 11:11, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the suggestions. But I still think we need in the Glen Eira page to mention events and issues that occurred in Glen Eira eg mayoralty votes, sacking (which you've started on), brawls, and catergorise them. How about that in the page, but no biographies? <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatonB_bf62.html" title="User:CatonB">CatonB</a> 12:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That IMHO is exactly where it belongs - in the council article. It passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> thresholds (reportage in the Age, the independent report which is online and no doubt other media sources, even local Leaders or whatever, could be used to improve what is there now) and could probably be developed into compelling and interesting prose which meets all Wikipedia standards. If we can get more information (not *too* much though) on its ancestor councils - Caulfield and any others - and put them in a history section that would also be good. Should always be aiming for <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a>/<a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured Article</a> status with these sorts of things, even if it only gets to B-class (the level below Good Article). <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 12:27, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Can I make a suggestion that all articles that will be deleted be merged into the same article. But this time it will be part of an article called History of Glen Eira Council and one of the subheadings would be Glen Eira Councillors.

<p><b>Not true.</b> This has already been discussed on the article's discussion page. From that page:</p>
<p>1. Le Boom is the most popular band ever to appear on Denver's Heartbeat, the largest venue for Colorado indie bands. See my writing below for proof (in 11/22/06 -- updates).</p>
<p>2. Le Boom's album, Got It Tied, received a Critic's Choice endorsement from Westword Magazine, the third largest periodical in the State of Colorado. Proof of this can be found on Westword's web site at: <a href="http://search.westword.com/Issues/2004-12-16/music/critics.html" class="external free" title="http://search.westword.com/Issues/2004-12-16/music/critics.html" rel="nofollow">http://search.westword.com/Issues/2004-12-16/music/critics.html</a> 3. The above two are notable accomplishments. 4. The photo threatened with deletion, Leboommainpic.jpg, has now been released as a promotional photo by Le Boom and therefore may be used under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Appears not to meet notability criteria. I don't understand how it can be documented that a band was the "most popular" ever to appear on a local television show. Yes, the band was mentioned in "Westword," but there don't seem to be any other mentions. It seems that their debut album came out less than a month ago. They may well be a notable band in time, but--barring further documentatation--that time is not now. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 05:25, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did read the discussion page first. I am just unconvinced by your arguments. I'm assuming good faith on your part, please return the favor. It appears that the "most popular" claim is original research since you cannot cite a published source for it. And I did make a mistake about the release date of the album. However, I'm not sure that the fact that the album was released in 2004 instead of 2006 helps your case that the band is notable. Please don't take this personally. A nomination for deletion is not a statement on the quality of the band. Just the notability at this moment. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 05:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was bolding because people didn't bother to read the previous discussion. I'm being entirely reasonable by expecting people to read what has been written about this before. This has all already been discussed, and my frustration that people charge ahead with deletion claims without reading the prior discussion is extremely reasonable.

<dd>Your incorrect assumption that people who disagree with you do so because they haven't yet read your argument is compounded by the fact that you appear to have not read any of wikipedia's basic policy pages. Notability and verifiability must come from non-trivial, published third party sources, not by a person with a connection to the subject (someone who has produced one of their gigs, for example) who must be emailed for verification. If Sherry Lee writes an article in the Denver Post explaining how popular this band is, it would go a long way toward helping its chances on wikipedia. Also, if you continue to ignore requests to sign your posts with four tildes, you will open yourself up to accusations of bad faith.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Westword article is a published source and is not a trivial one as the third largest newspaper in Colorado (behind the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News, two publications owned by the same company). You can verify with no problems that Le Boom did indeed get a critic's choice endorsement. And Denver's Heartbeat is not a trivial television program either, at least not locally. And there's no requirement that a media source be national. The opinion of the producer of such a television show is indeed relevant and noteworthy. That someone may have to contact the person is a minor amount of effort, and is a basic requirement of any reputable publication. I didn't interpret Wikipedia's policies to mean that no one should ever have to put any effort into fact verification other than googling.</dd>

<dd>I had good reason to believe that people didn't bother to read the prior discussion. It was stated: <i>I don't understand how it can be documented that a band was the 'most popular' ever to appear on a local television show.</i> It wasn't stated, "Sherry Lee's opinion is not enough." It was stated simply, "I don't understand..." If you had read the prior discussion, you would have understood. You now claim you did read it. I don't buy that, and neither would any reasonable person.</dd>

<dd>My arguments made in the prior discussion were sufficient to keep the article published in November. We shouldn't even have to be discussing this now. A decision was already made back then and we should stick with it. I did forget to sign my posts, thinking that my user name would automatically be put in as is the case on most Internet discussion forums.

<dd>Let me take a minute to (<a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civilly</a>) dissect several of TomZC's arguements. Firstly, there is no policy whatsoever that previous discussions on the merit of an article are permanently binding. Secondly, while a thorough editor would read a discusion page before commenting on an AfD, this is not by any means a requirement. Evidence that a subject is notable must be either a part of the <i>article itself</i>, or raised on the AfD page and subsequently added, <i>sourced</i>, to the article, for it to count. And thirdly, having to call or e-mail someone to verify information <i>is</i> too much to ask, because we have to remember that these sources are not just for the benefit of diligent editors who regularly contribute to the project, but to all users. If a piece of information takes too much effort to track down and verify, it is increasingly unlikely that anyone will do so, and if that information is incorrect, it is more likely to remain uncorrected and be republished incorrectly. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb">contribs</a></i></sup> 16:30, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Not to mention that he has a base of 25.000 readers a day for the blog, a three times a week comic for geeks, and more or less the same amount listens to the weekly extralife radio show (also co hosted by brian dunaway from amissiondeep.com and Obsidian from commissionedcomic.com).

Yes he is popular, but so it is any other creator/host of a tv program for example. The way to establish notability in the internet is by links to his site, readers of his web page, establishing for how long he has been doing so, his reputation on the net and work he has done for the medium in question. He has been in press articles (he and his podcast ELR), links from other web comic artists (today a web comic artist should have the same reputation as a comic artist), his job like one of the first webcomic artists since 2001 and even one of the first people to start making podcasts (since 2001 too), <a href="http://www.myextralife.com/?page_id=6" class="external text" title="http://www.myextralife.com/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

He has many offerings from podcasts, comics, web blog, etc. Check out his work and see for yourself. <a href="http://www.myextralife.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.myextralife.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdensley_fa11.html" title="User:Bdensley">bdensley</a> 23:21, 16 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdensley_fa11.html" title="User:Bdensley">bdensley</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_bdensley_40db.html" title="Special:Contributions/bdensley">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<p>The article known as "Popalzy" has man flaws. First, the entry is titled wrong - the correct spelling in english is 'Popalzai' or 'Popalzi.' Secondly, there is another article that was submitted to Wikipedia titled "Popalzai" that was made before this article and is rightfully stubbed under categories like Pashtun Tribes, etc. Third, this article has factually wrong information. If you read the articles on the Barakzai, Popalzai, and Mahmadzai clans, this is the only article out of sync from those three. There is other historical flaws in this short article; I beleive this explains why the article has not had any refrences since its creation over six months ago - eventhough wikipedia has placed a sanction requesting them.

<p>The article was not written by the subject. I don't know what there is in there that suggests it is. Perhaps it's just written in a style that's slightly different to what you're used to.</p>

</ul>
<p>So the article makes no "claim to notability", yet it's also a "Vanity puffpiece"? If it exists purely to praise Mr Venturi how can it not be making his notability clear? And how could anything be added to suggest his notability without it being attacked for being too favourable to him? Unless what you really want is a claim to notoriety. I noticed that the section referring to David Fox and Venturi's unmade film was removed. If that was showing partiality to Venturi it would've accused Fox of ruining his project. It probably would've called Fox a bastard, or something. All it said was that they had a disagreement. Jung Dresden</p>

<p>It wasn't "entirely unsourced". Perhaps there weren't enough there or some of them were inappropriate, but sources were provided. And there's still one source there despite constant edits. Beyond that, there are probably errors on every page on this site. I was looking at an article about some Australian singer just a few minutes ago, and there didn't seem to be any sources there apart from a picture of him with a bunch of children. If you're going to have a user-created encyclopedia you're going to get errors and it's not going to be perfect. The point, though, is that it can be remarkably broad and cover everything, rather than just a few topics selected by an elite group of editors, whether a result of there own preferences or just their own limited knowledge.</p>
<p>I don’t believe this article should be deleted at all, but at the very least it should be given a bit of time so it can be improved. Keep the tag there if you want. Jung Dresden</p>

<dd>Mark - Wikipedia is NOT and NEVER has been intended to "cover everything". Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Like many new editors, you think that just saying "honest guv, it will improve, he's a decent bloke" covers it, it does not. There is one very straight forward and simple way for you to save your article - you need to provide sources from verfiable third-party media (such as a newspaper, magazine) that talks about your work and it's importance. That would stop the AFD in it's tracks, so if you want to save the article that's what you need to do. If that material does not appear by the end of this AFD process (which is about five days), this article will be deleted. Oh and "What about article X?" arguments NEVER work - all that happens is that you draw attention to them and people like me AFD them or try and clean them up. A crap article will not survive because you can point to 3 other crap articles. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 17:07, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I said before that the article was not written by the subject. I am not Mark. The fact that you and your fellow Wikipedia editors/moderators/police (I don't know what you prefer to be called) haven't heard of Mark Venturi is no reason to believe that nobody else has.</p>
<p>I wasn't attempting to draw attention to "3 other crap articles", and I don't believe I did. I'm not someone who likes to reports my peers to the teacher. And I actually think there are many more than three articles in this encyclopedia that would meet your definition of word crap, which seems to be 'not being thoroughly referenced'. It was helpful of you to link me to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, though I did read it before I contributed. Very early on in that article it says "there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover". With that in mind I'm surprised by the eagerness to delete the Venturi article. Having the tag there makes it clear to readers that the article isn't currently meeting the Wikipedia standards, and that there is a debate going on whether it should even exist. Jung Dresden</p>

<dd>You are wasting your time with this line of reasoning - The article requires sources from independent 3rd party sources if it is to survive - that's the start, middle and end of it. No amount of pleading is going to change fundemental wikipedia policy. It's also a red herring to say "you haven't heard of him", what matters is that you can show he's notable via sources. I've had a look this morning, there are no sources - he's a nobody in Wikipedia terms. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 18:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A source for what? that Mark Venturi exists or that he is a notable film-maker? I think we all accept that he exists (which is always a good start). The information contained on that site just indicates that he made two short-films. So the next element is - so what? Lots of people have made short films, What's notable about <i>those</i>? have their won awards? Been the subject of notable newspapers and magazines? Any of that? All the ducktape site tells us is that those films exist. Do you understand what I'm getting at? Something existing is not enought to include on here. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 17:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep (or <i>possibly</i> merge).</b> I can explain this, even though I am no experienced emacs user. Basically, putting (for example) "-*- perl -*-" on the first or second line of a text file causes emacs, when it opens the file, to assume that it is a perl program and open it in perl-mode. Since the text would be confusing to non-emacs users by itself, it may have become common in some circles to write "hey emacs, this is a -*- perl -*- file" by way of explanation. Emacs will still understand it, but it may be more readable to humans. As for the article, I can't say what the normal term for this is (the xemacs manual doesn't give it a name) but judging by the examples the article's creator has found, this may be it. I'll rewrite the article and make a post on the author's talk page to explain. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a>'s changes make the article readable, and now that I take the time, the article explains something that I have often seen and been curious about. A merge with emacs wouldnt do this justice as people wont read a long article to figure out a nuance of an editor that they dont use. Maybe this could moved to emacs file mode or just text editor mode to allow artifacts of other editors to be added.

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emacs.html" title="Emacs">Emacs</a>, a significant emacsism but not really worthy of an article of its own. There's another problem too, I'm not sure if this is actually called "Hey Emacs" anywhere except in slang (and I've not even heard it actually called that, even when I've seen the "Hey Emacs, this is a -*- foo -*- file" expression). XEmacs documentation calls this with a technical term "local variables list" and it can actually have an expanded format.

<li><b>Comment</b> This debate is confusing. I came to it through Berth (album), but when I clicked on this, it said only The Used 3rd studio album was nominated. Then, when I checked the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Used_755e.html" title="The Used">The Used</a> artice to see where both pages stood on the discgraphy, I saw it only linked to the latter and linked to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berth_%28CD_DVD%29_dd22.html" title="Berth (CD/DVD)">Berth (CD/DVD)</a>, but not the former. Then when I checked what linked to the former, I saw only <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handsome_Awkward_95f2.html" title="Handsome Awkward">Handsome Awkward</a> and DumbBOT's archive on the listing. So which page is correct, Berth (album) or The Used 3rd studio album? And are you nominating one of them or both? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMachchunk_0798.html" title="User:Machchunk">Machchunk</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMachchunk_42b3.html" title="User talk:Machchunk">make some noise at me</a> 05:50, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't aware of the other articles. I think <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handsome_Awkward_95f2.html" title="Handsome Awkward">Handsome Awkward</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berth_%28CD_DVD%29_dd22.html" title="Berth (CD/DVD)">Berth (CD/DVD)</a> are unrelated topics. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 04:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a growing trend of speculative articles about upcoming media releases with placeholder names like "upcoming studio album". Is there policy against such articles (if nothing else, it would prevent a clutter of "untitled" redirects being left behind)? Should there be? –<a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnint_1508.html" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 16:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am aware of WP:CRYSTAL (as if it were possible to come to this page and be unaware).

However, if RX-78 does get delete, it does prove that such action is valid. I apologize for the inconvience, but from our point of view, Star trek is as much cruff as Gundam. either both can coexist, or both can't. In fact, in Japan, more people know about Gundamthan Star Trek... you know, the whole worldview thing, so honestly, I am real pissed at Gundam being targeted simply because it's not "notable" in Western world. Once again, I hope that the Gundam articles will not get shot down left and right, else next time it's done here, it's no longer a WP:POINT, but by a precedent.<a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge_Leung_a0b3.html" title="User:George Leung">George Leung</a> 10:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I did <i><b>not</b></i>&#160;!vote to delete the whole specific gundam RX-whatever robot thingy article (I asked for one section to be deleted and another to be kept so long as its claims could be referenced properly) and there is no afd as far as I know regarding the main Gundam article which I have never commented on or edited. The burden of verifying the article rests on the content creators, not the commentators in AFD. I often run refs searches in afds but the provocative comments by certain Gundam Project editors in the AFD did not exactly encourage me to do so in this case. And notifying others that someone is abusing <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is not trolling. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_legendary_creatures_by_type.html" title="List of legendary creatures by type">List of legendary creatures by type</a> appropriate list that introduces information and classifies components. Improve the article or clean it up. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dragons.html" title="List of dragons">List of dragons</a> - appropriate list that introduces much information and classifies components. There's actually scores of redlinks - agreed that it could use a bath. This is also a sub-article of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">Dragon</a> that is a valuable overflow.<s><b>Delete</b></s> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_legendary_creatures_453a.html" title="Category:Lists of legendary creatures">Category:Lists of legendary creatures</a> (would be a short list at this point), <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_creatures_that_pretend_to_be_human.html" title="List of creatures that pretend to be human">List of creatures that pretend to be human</a> - not technically the same as <a href="../../../s/h/a/Category%7EShapeshifting_8d60.html" title="Category:Shapeshifting">Category:Shapeshifting</a>, but I don't think the distinction is necessary. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_demons.html" title="List of demons">List of demons</a> - fully covered by multiple cats. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_giants_in_mythology_and_folklore.html" title="List of giants in mythology and folklore">List of giants in mythology and folklore</a> - fully covered by cat, will stub the one redlink if I can ref. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Greek_mythological_creatures_1904.html" title="List of Greek mythological creatures">List of Greek mythological creatures</a> - fully covered by cat.</dd>

<dd>And I assume someone is actually adding the category to the articles (it's missing on almost every spot check I did) <i>before</i> the list is deleted?

<li><b>Strong Speedy extremely pissed off keep</b> based on my arguments set out above.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. Lists can coexist with categories if the list is designed to include more information, which many of these are. Mass nomination of mostly unrelated topics is not a good idea. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 01:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but with the option to review any individual articles for other reasons at a later date. I do not understand people who insist that categories completely replace lists. Perhaps they are more useful for you, but speaking for myself, I would rather look at a well-done list than a category every time. That said, it possible these lists do need to be improved, and I would recommend doing so. At the least, the top one would be much better if it described each species. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Reasonable list, fictional television shows, if you see a problem with the current criteria, suggest a more limited one if you feel it is appropriate.

<li>Responding only to the idea that "none of the points" of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> apply here...the points noted at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> are nt exhaustive and nothing in the document indicates that they are intended to be. Is "collection of every non-existent TV show ever mentioned in passing in some other medium" one of the listed points? No. Does that mean that the policy precludes such a collection from being considered an indiscriminate collection of information? Of course not. As I noted in another of these, List of all Americans who own cats isn't prohibited by the letter of the policy. Do you think such a list <i>wouldn't</i> get deleted as indiscriminate and unmaintainable? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm unsure as to what you think quoting that portion of WP:NOT does toward supporting your case. WP:FICT advises to use lists for minor items <i>within a work of fiction.</i> It does not suggest using one list to try to capture every single example of something fictional regardless of its importance to the work from which it's derived. WP:NOT instructs that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. If there were a List of fictional television shows from X then that would be a reasonable, focused list in line with WP:FICT and, most likely, a discriminated list in line with WP:NOT. A list of fictional television programs drawn from every source which includes such a program regardless of whether that program plays some actual roles within the real show or whether the program is merely mentioned in a line of dialog in a single episode, never to be heard of again, does not conform to WP:FICT or WP:NOT. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, to clarify, I'm not saying that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> supports my case - I'm saying that WP:NOT doesn't support your case either. And in the lack of policy on the matter, all we're left with is your opinion, my opinion and the community's opinion, which is looking more and more like it wants to keep these lists. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 04:46, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But there isn't an absence of policy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is policy and it prohibits indiscriminate lists by virtue of prohibiting indiscriminate collections of information. There is certainly a difference of opinion as to whether this list is indiscriminate which, frankly, I don't get because of the tremendously wide net the list casts in capturing material, but trying to consense on whether the list is indiscriminate or not is not the same thing as the policy's not applying. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is a guideline for lists of fictional things and it counsels against lists across multiple source materials. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm really sorry to keep harping on about this, and I promise I'm not being deliberately obtuse or obstructive here, but <i>where</i> does <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> counsel against lists from multiple source materials? I've read and re-read it and I can see nothing that even remotely backs up that assertion. I'll happily admit I'm wrong about this if you can point out the line or section you're referring to (I assume you don't mean the discussion page). I see what you mean about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, but, perhaps unfortunately, policy is formed by consensus, and there is no consensus otherwise there <i>would</i> be an explicit reference to lists. As I said, we'll have to rely on the community's judgement on a case-by-case basis - decisions I'll be happy to accept. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 04:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Nowhere in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is the notion of creating lists across works supported. Every example is presented in terms of items within a work of fiction. The broadest capture that <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> endorses is within works set within the same fictional universe (such as <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a>) "Counsels against" may be a bit on the strong side but not by much. But even setting aside <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> I still contend that the plain language of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is more than enough to delete a list which seeks to capture every fictional television show from every medium with no regard to the importance of those shows either in the fictional universe it's from or outside it. Just because there is not a specific entry in WP:NOT that talks about lists does not mean that WP:NOT does not justify this and other similar deletions. I honestly do not understand how someone can look at this list and think that it isn't indiscriminate. I don't get how someone can legitimately look at this list of however many hundred or thousand entries it is, gathering everything from The Alan Brady Show which was actually integral to its source program to something like Admiral Baby from The Simpsons which was a two-sentence joke in a series that's generated hundreds of hours of content, and think that it's useful for research or encyclopedic or discriminating. Usually when a debate about something like this gets contentious I can still see some merit in the argument of the other side but here I can't. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Already deleted twice as spam/advertising for a non-notable company. I was tempted to follow suit, but it seems to be a fairly large corporation — I was hoping that editors who are familiar with Indian culture could help out here. In any case, an AfD would settle the matter and open to door to protect the article in the future if necessary, since the creator seems determined to keep posting it up. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 09:56, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, this organization is big multinational. Operating in more than 100 countries, they have open to all large 500 Acres Research and demonstration center, training institutes for farmers, government officials. First time in India who brought drip irrigation and currently on top with 60% market share. Struggling to give farmers a status and drip irrigation as infrastructure industry within India. I like there mission of Organization 'Leave this world better than you found it'.

<p>Is a leading hi-tech agriculture Company and more... Jain Irrigation is the only company in the world that produces complete Drip Irrigation Systems including PVC Pipes, PVC Fittings, poly tubing and fittings, emitters, filtration equipment, and fertigation equipment under one roof. Had lot of other product manufacturing, service and support divisions. Subsidiaries of Jain Irrigation are in the USA, Europe and Africa, In India it has more than 8 plants, 58 Offices, 23 depots and 1262 distributor's. Other than India approx 5 offices, 380 distributor's, 7 Agents. Manufacturing more than 1000 products. I think this is enough to add this organizations page in WIKIPEDIA.

<li><b>Comment</b> I cleaned up the article a little today to try and give a better idea of what there is to look at. The history section is actually a copyvio of the Jain website and will need a big rewrite (if kept at all). I'm still holding off from offering any opinion about the notability of this company, but I wanted to let it have a fair shot of surviving this AfD. It can be tough to work in articles on subjects that are foreign to the mostly Western editors here (myself included, of course). While there are plenty of poor reasons offered above for keeping the article — the founder may be a nice guy, but that doesn't make him of encyclopedic importance — I wouldn't want to be too quick to delete this one. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 10:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> there is no need to have an article on fictional radio stations to justify this list (though I suppose one could argue for the creation of such a page, I wouldn't know where to start with it myself). however, this doesn't change the fact that fictional radio stations are real, used in fiction, and as such, someone interested in such a thing might want to have a collated list of them. It is completely sourceable, and verifiable. IF you don't believe me, take WNYX or WKRP. Completely easy to verify that they are indeed fictonal radio stations. If there are any entries on the list you can't source, then remove them. Exaggerating by claiming the entries on the list itself aren't verifiable is not a reasonable argument though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's indiscriminate about it is that almost every book, TV episode, film, comic book, etc. has at least one fictional company in it. If every such example of a fictional company were added to this list, the article would have tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of entries. There is no way that such a list can be useful or encyclopedic. Take a show like <a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a> as just one example, that takes place partly within the context of an advertising agency.

But that doesn't mean we don't have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cat_breeds.html" title="List of cat breeds">list of cat breeds</a> or other such lists. The real problem is, there is no policy argument that supports your position, and I just don't see a good articulation of why this list is bad. Sure, it's hard to maintain, it's potentially vast...so is Wikipedia. This list isn't any more impossible to manage than Wikipedia itself. Even if it reached the point where it was far too long, it could be broken up into "list of fictional X from American Media" or "list of fictional X from 20th Century Media" or whatever. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:08, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Unencyclopedic" and "unmaintainable" and "indiscriminate collection of information" are more than sufficient justification for deleting this article. It does not benefit Wikipedia to have an article consisting of nothing but the names of fictional companies that appeared in some piece of fiction or another. Is there any significance to the vast majority of the named businesses, even within the works themselves? Hard to say, because vast numbers of them offer no assertion of their notability or indeed <i>any</i> indication of what role they play in the narrative from which they are drawn. There is no value to Wikipedia in having a list to include business names that appear on billboards in video games and otherwise play no role in the game. There is no value in a list that gathers the names of, say, fictional groceries where the hero of the story buys his toilet paper. To which your answer undoubtedly will be that such entries should be excised. Which then brings up the inevitable maintainability issues, not to mention POV issues. If you don't like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> then how about <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>?

<li>That would be only your opinion that it's not encyclopedic. However, I disagree. These companies themselves may be the subject of articles themselves, or they may not, but that they can, demonstrates to me that there is potential encyclopedic value to them. This content is real, and if any of it in particular doesn't belong, remove that. And yes, the criteria for this list is very important, and as far as your concerns go, clean-up is an option instead of deletion. I'd say establishing some good criteria would fix your concerns just fine. If you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it. Leave it to someone else to maintain. And I would not agree that there would be no question that these lists would be deleted or not. Your past experience with nominating members of various professions should demonstrate to you that there are questions to it, and valid concerns. So I'm not sure why you think it would be automatically done. While you may think there's no question of deleting these lists, obviously other people do. So perhaps you need to work on either improving your argument, or recognizing where it's not applicable? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As far as nominating lists of professions, it remains my opinion that many of the keep opinons were in respnse to procedural concerns rather than the quality of the articles themselves.

<dd>I don't have to convince you of any of those companies, because I don't believe that they should have an article, though admittedly, I don't know much about any of them, so I really would refrain from expressing anything about them. Of the three entries you named, I only know I've seen one, and that was years ago. I wouldn't even know if they really were in the material. Personal ignorance therefore trumps argument. If you're concerned about those entries, bring it up to the people who added them. Besides, there is no requirement than a list be composed solely of entries with articles. Or even primarily. Still, even if they were, that the material they appeared in has a Wikipedia article is enough for me. And I think the general consensus is that almost any non-self published fictional work is going to be kept. Therefore, I believe that the standard you've created is a false one, and unsupported by Wikipedia practice. If you want me to agree to it, you're going to have to convince me of it first. And as far as the fictional professions go, while some opinions were on that reasons, many others were for actual ones. You should go back and look at them. There are real arguments there, not just procedurally kept ones. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But that's precisely my point, and the point of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. That something has a Wikipedia article doesn't mean that every aspect of it should be noted somewhere on Wikipedia. In tonight's episode of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a>, Lynette mentioned two companies in single lines of dialog that she wrote ad campaigns for. These companies have never been mentioned before, it's highly unlikely that they'll ever be mentioned again, and we know absolutely nothing about them other than one of them once ran a commercial involving fleas dancing the tango. By your standard, those two companies which mean absolutely nothing in the grander scheme of the work of fiction should be included in the list article. If the criteria for the list are such that these two companies warrant inclusion, then the list is indiscriminate and unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:22, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But nobody is asking for every aspect of everything. I do not watch Desperate Housewives, so I don't even know if the companies Lynette mentioned were real or not, or whether or not they would be mentioned in a biography about her, or in the episode of the show. The real problem is, your arguments are worth altering the criteria of the list, not arguments for deleting the page. And as far as it goes, I have not developed a standard for this list, the principle I expressed above was not a criteria for inclusion on this list, but for existence of it. Sorry if that was unclear. I thought I had made the point that I did not disagree with the potential value of better inclusion criteria earlier, but I guess you missed it. However, it is still applicable, and you are certainly welcome to bring it up on the talk pages of that page.

<li>If you can come up with some criteria that won't make the list become a nightmare of POV and verifiability (which it already is anyway) then feel free.

<dd><b>Comment</b> What bugs me in debates like this is that those who want the "lists of fictional whatevers" deleted continually cite policy as an argument, to the point of notes to the closing admin that those recommending to keep are not citing policy. <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and the oft-cited <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - none of these explicitly rule against such lists (and my reading of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is that it practically recommends lists instead of an article for each entry). There is no black-and-white policy that "lists of fictional entities" are violating, and you have to ask yourself why? I would say, and this seems to backed up by the keep/no consensus results of the frequent AfDs on the topics, that there is considerable community consensus to keep these lists.</dd>
<dd>Then out will come a logical fallacy like the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument or the <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> fallacy - naming a ridiculously broad and unverifiable list criteria (such as "List of Americans who own cats") and the assertion that if I think some lists are OK then I must want to keep the "List of straw men" as well. I'm not the ardent listcruft inclusionist you may think I am, I'll happily recommend delete where I think it is warranted (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_fictional_time_travelers_who_have_visited_the_Reign_of_Terror_5d76.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fictional time travelers who have visited the Reign of Terror">List of fictional time travelers who have visited the Reign of Terror</a>), but until it's there in black-and-white in a policy or even an unambiguous guideline, then I will continue to <strike>vote</strike> and argue as I see fit based on the merits of each list as I see them. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 05:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the list component of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. The policy doesn't suggest making lists of every fictional thing. It states that minor but encyclopedic things should be listed together rather than broken out into separate articles. So a dozen minor but important characters from the same film or book would have one "list of" article rather than a dozen separate articles. Similarly, if there were a fictional work with several minor but important businesses then a "list of businesses in X" article would be appropriate. Nothing in WP:FICT endorses the notion of gathering thousands of unencyclopedic bits of information into a massive list like this. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point is that WP:FICT does not forbid or even recommend against these lists - a guideline you have mentioned at least twice above as if it backs up your argument.

If I'm fundamentally misunderstanding these guidelines, which is entirely possible of course, please point out to me the statement(s) you think make your point, rather than saying that what isn't in the guidelines does. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 14:02, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP:FICT doesn't explicitly forbid creating a list of right-handed fictional characters or fictional characters who are shown milking cows or all sorts of other trivial things. Nor for that matter does WP:FICT explicitly bar creating a list of all characters who have ever appeared in fiction. Would any such list hold up under an AfD? Lord, I hope not. Yet this is exactly the sort of list this is. Even if one were to accept the argument that WP:FICT doesn't explicitly forbid this list so it's therefore acceptable under WP:FICT, it is still a violation of WP:NOT because the list is an indiscriminate collection of items of information. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:16, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The initial suggestion to delete the article is phrased in the same language used by BabyDweezil (a follower of political cult leader Fred Newman who vehemently opposes the inclusion of the Newman group in the list of purported cults in final paragraph of article) on the Discussion Page. The entire paragraph listing purported political cults is properly cited. Any essay by me is on the discussion page, not the article. Most of the article was written by other people although I did add or rephrase stuff to correct what I regarded as misleading impressions. As a recognizedexpert on political cults, I believe that there is no basis for deleting this article, but for vastly improving it. Much of it is properly cited and citations can be found for the scattering of sentences that are not cited. The attack on all writers and scholars in the field as allegedly being former communists turned anti-communists was put in by BabyDweezil to create chaos and can be easily deleted by anyone (if BabyDweezil keeps restoring it, demand arbitration). Again, there is no real basis for deleting the article and I urge readers of this post to go to the "Fred Newman" biography on Wiki and see the totalitarian and demented games that this group is playing on Wikipedia, often using sock puppets.--<a href="../../../d/k/i/User%7EDking_3156.html" title="User:Dking">Dking</a> 15:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The phrase "Political cult" is an invention of former Marxists who now oppose their own former groups and involvements. It is not a concept accepted or used outside the "anti-cult" field other than via occassional tabloid coverage of the subject. This is a simple fact, and relevant to any entry on "Political Cults." If <a href="../../../d/k/i/User%7EDking_3156.html" title="User:Dking">Dking</a> has evidence of sock puppetry he should present it instead of attacking those who disagree with him with false charges and his incessant cult-baiting of fellow editors. When I corrected his misleading claim that a book was "praised", King deleted the entire section. When the Marxist Leninist backgrounds of all the authors he cites are noted by me in the article (which seems emininently relevant background on authors who are charging various Marxist groups—in some cases their own former groups--with being "political cults"), King deletes the properly referenced section, claiming in the edit summary "Deleted ad hominen attack by follower of Fred Newman." It's annoying enough that Dennis King continued to use Wikipedia to attempt to publish personal essays, such as this entry and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Workers_Party_8df6.html" title="International Workers Party">International Workers Party</a> that he cannot find a legitimate publisher for. Yet in addition, he is using personal attacks, cult baiting, charges of sock puppetry, against anyone who challenges this. Very silly. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 16:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wish to correct the idea that opposition to political cults is a manifestation of a grudge against former M-L groups that some cult experts were once involved in. First, I was never in a political cult. The PLP, which I left over 30 years ago, has never been accused of cultism by any ex-member to my knowledge nor will one find complaints about it that are much more than criticism of what ex-members or opponents regard as extremely dogmatic politics or the typical Marxist top-down leadership. This is a group that banned Maoist style criticism/self-criticism in the late 1960s and encouraged its members to spend their time with friends, family and co-workers OUTSIDE the party rather than hanging around with each other (that's still its "line" today). As to Janja Lalich, she and most of the leadership and membership of the DWP rose up and expelled their leader (an unstable alcoholic) and voluntarily disbanded the party--who is she supposed to have a grudge against, her fellow rebels? As to Alex Stein, I believe from reading her book that her experiences inside the "O" gave her valuable insights into the nature of cults that she could not have attained in any other way; her former membership in the O speaks to her credibility, not to any prejudice. The same could be said of Tim Wohlforth. I am not aware that the group Prof. Tourish was in was a cult (most Marxist groups are not cults although they tend to elicit high commitment from their members). As to the dean of political cult watchers, Chip Berlet, he was never a member of any communist party or pre-party formation to my knowledge.--<a href="../../../d/k/i/User%7EDking_3156.html" title="User:Dking">Dking</a> 19:23, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, "Political cult" is different from a religious cult and deserves some discussion of what it is etc... (and the cleanest and easiest way to do it is in its own article). I'll assume good faith, but casual observors of this debate should be aware that some of those voting for deletion might have mixed motives.... for example I know at least one is a follower of political extremist "Lyndon LaRouche." It's neither surprising nor nefarious that groups that are often labelled as "political cults" would oppose the existence of a Wikipedia article. It's a fairly obvious point, but I just thought I'd mention it so that casual readers are aware of the issue. Mgunn 21:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I favor the inclusion of the "Political Cults" entry. The term is widely accepted by academics and professionals who study the dynamics of group behavior. I will cite just a few examples: Robert Jay Lifton, M.D. Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at John Jay College: "Any student of cultic behavior knows that it can find both political and religious expression." Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer, who recently passed away and was a clinical psychologist and emeritus adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley lists ten major types of cults including "Political" in her book "Cults in Our Midst." Dr. Marc Galanter, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and editor of the American Psychiatric Association's official report on cults and new religious movements, lists "political groups" among the charismatic groups that form cults (see: "Cults, Faith, Healing and Coercion.") It is understandable that current members of political cults will respond to the term in 2 ways: (1) while recognizing that political cults exist, deny that the particular group they belong to is one or (2) insist that political cults do not exist. If they were to recognize the group they belong to as a cult they would leavce voluntarily, or be forced to leave. I am reminded of the evolution vs. creationism dispute. That a few people disagree with the theory of evolution does not negate the fact that evolution is deeply rooted in fact and accepted by almost all professionals devoted to studying the matter. It is not POV. The term "Political Cults" is not a POV matter either. It is a commonly accepted term to designate specific organizations that do in fact exist and that function in a cultic fashion. I do feel the entry needs some more work. Most important is an explanation of how politics works in such groups just as religion works in other groups. This again is neither POV or OR. There is extensive research on this available that can be cited in the text of the entry.</li>

<p>This is another hoax page that I put up for prod yesterday. The prod text was as follows: <i>I strongly believe this page is a hoax. I've left it alone until now because there clearly is a "Giddy Goanna" in Australia, but this page was created by a vandal who specialises in creating fake children's programmes. The IMDB link is a 404, the run date is "2007 onwards" with a run of 306 episodes for a page created in 2006, and the infobox appears to be a cut-and-paste from another article, down to the names.</i> As you can see from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giddy_Goanna_%28TV_Shows%29&amp;diff=100389680&amp;oldid=100204952" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giddy_Goanna_%28TV_Shows%29&amp;diff=100389680&amp;oldid=100204952" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>, the vandal removed the prod tag and changed the year in the infobox to 2006. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 11:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but I think it should be divided up into seperate articles. I don't see why it should be deleted when there are other list of fictional things like it. I can make a start to it by moving the operas out of the theatre section and into the already existant <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_musical_works.html" title="List of fictional musical works">List of fictional musical works</a> where there is already a section for them. The publications section could easily hold it's own article and the tv/radio shows already have their own articles so they aren't needed here. That leaves the slogans and the plays from the theatre section. Slogans just needs a bit of work and additions from <i>Ninteen Eighty-Four</i> and <i>Brave New World</i> and it could be it's own article also. Not sure about plays, could be merged with another article though. If this does happen I'll add all the sections/articles to my list of things to watch out for in works of fiction.&#160;;) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETartan_0e75.html" title="User:Tartan">Tartan</a> 21:20, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note that several other of these fictional lists are also up for deletion, and more nominations may follow.

<li><b>Delete.</b> In general, there shouldn't be a "list of X" unless X itself is an encyclopedic topic, in which case it is more important to have an article on X. Logically, if X were encyclopedic and important you'd expect to see an article on X, which might contain a list of X, which would be broken out when it got disproportionately huge. There is no article on Fictional media. It's not an encyclopedic topic. You couldn't write one, because there are no books or other sources on which you could base it. Since it's not encyclopedic, neither is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_media.html" title="List of fictional media">List of fictional media</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't disagree with people who are suggesting clean-up to this list, but if you don't agree with the criteria, suggest changing it. I also don't see why an article of "fictional X" has to exist. Is this from some policy, or just a personal opinion? And have you considered that articles on X existing may be a good substitution? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree. There's a lot of stuff that could be trimmed, but also a lot that is verifiable. The chronology of cheat and anti-cheat software can certainly be verified from documentation for the software itself. The section about why gamers cheat and why gamers cheat in CS specifically are pretty much unsourceable, though. So fix it! There are also some legitimate references already included at the bottom. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 14:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I rarely, if ever, support the claim of original research as a reason to delete. If something is original research, there should be an attempt to source it instead of delete the article entirely. And even if <i>some</i> of it is OR, that can be deleted. However, as Brighterorange said, there's plenty of documentation about cheats from Valve. As for the section of why gamers cheat, I believe that it can be sourced. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">.V.</a> <i>(<a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">talk</a>)</i> 14:58, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

Of course, it doesn't mean the article isn't rubbish. I think there is a problem however with how cheating is presented on Wikipedia, there's no overarching organisation so we have other articles with overlap such as <a href="../../../a/i/m/Aimbot.html" title="Aimbot">aimbot</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallhacking.html" title="Wallhacking">wallhacking</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheating_in_online_games.html" title="Cheating in online games">Cheating in online games</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a how-to guide. If you find this article useful, perhaps you might enjoy www.gamefaqs.com, which is where this sort of thing should go. Any article about cheating in Counterstrike, if we had to have one, would be <b>about</b> the cheating, listing the history in a structured and referenced manner, the articles people have written about the cheating culture in Counterstrike, perhaps. Unfortunately, there are no reliable references, and there are no articles written about cheating in Counterstrike, so what we have instead is a shitty big list of ways to haXX0rz the game and a load of namedrops for a bunch of user / anon's awesome scriptkid buddies. Not even remotely close to an encyclopaedic article. And then for good measure, a crapload of original research about 'why Counterstrike is subject to so much cheating', with theories pulled out of the air, blogs, and forums. It will be unfortunate if the special interest groups get this one kept with <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">keep it because I like it</a> arguments, when there is not a single redeeming feature about it.

<li><b>Keep</b> per keep arguments above. A lot of the historical information can be sourced, it just hasn't been done yet. As well, this article is in no way a "guide" to cheating, nor is it a "strategy guide" on how to play while cheating. To imply so merely brings into focus an apparent lack of knowledge in relation to gaming and specific gaming communities. To claim that this article is a guide would imply that using soley this article and the tools it specifically cites you could thus go cheat, and cheat successfully in Counter-Strike. This is not the case. While the article definitely needs to be rewritten, and some portions of it need to be cut out, to say that the topic as a whole is a "shitty list of haxxors" would be a mistake. <a href="../../../x/e/n/User%7EXenocide85_0243.html" title="User:Xenocide85">Xenocide85</a> 21:34, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

I've never heard of it anywhere. It's websites seems to be a ghost really, there but not really active. I don't see any updates.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would agree with you - articles should be deleted in accordance with our policies. If other biographies exist which should not, they should be deleted in accordance with our policies, rather than used as justification for keeping equally non-notable other articles. However, you've failed to point out how Nina Hossain is not sufficiently notable to merit an article here. As you suggest, we do have a consistent set of rules to apply to such articles: it's <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and I see no reason why Nina Hossain is not sufficiently notable per these guidelines. How can "fame" never be "enough to justify the existence" of an article? Isn't that, in essence, what notability is? It sounds to me that you want this article deleted out of jealousy for the deletion of an article you authored. I'd suggest you could use your time more profitably discussing the reasons behind it's deletion at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 22:21, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to the point you raised about 'fame' equating notability, I don't think fame alone results in notability (at least not in the domain of wikipedia), and it's also highly questionable just how much fame can be attributed to Hossain. In fact, some would argue that whatever fame the subject has is down to sex appeal, and I would be inclined to agree with that. As a journalist if she achieved something significant in her field then fair enough, she deserves to be included. <b>Sir David Frost</b> is a journalist worthy of notability because he has achieved much in his field and is highly recognisable both in the United Kingdom and outside it. And not only that, but if Hossain did something outside of newsreading that increases her fame, then that too might merit her an article. <b>Natasha Kaplinsky</b>, for example, is notable not only as a newsreader but also as a popular celebrity thanks to her appearance on prime time television programs in the UK. But as it stands, being an ITV newsreader alone is not enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, and I don't see how knowing about her snowboarding and iPod passions are relevant for inclusion either.</dd>

<dd>Basically, as somebody who regularly features on a mainstream television channel she is notable. You seem to be a little confused about the function of AfD. It is not to judge whether what has been written is notable, but whether the subject <i>written about</i> is notable. Nina Hossain is certainly notable enough to have an article <i>written about</i> her, although all that is currently in the article may not be encyclopaedic. Note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states that one of the criteria for inclusion is: "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by: (e.g.) Name recognition". Since she appears regularly on national news on a major TV channel in a populous country she blatantly meets this criterion. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The terminology is significant, as not just many articles but also books published. It is impossible to explain a period without "first" grasping the realities of the period. It is advisable for all sides to consider (before developing tharguments) if the words (are using words) in their arguments which are based on current (modern nationalistic) concepts or if they are using how they were developed in its time.

<li><b>Keep</b> we have been over this already in the last AfD that you had proposed and withdrew. It is a valid topic, and it is true that it lacks certain references, but that's not a criteria for deletion. Many articles lack references, and this one has "expand" tags all over it. The reason why it is titled "Muslim" is because Ottoman census figures only took into account religious affiliation, which means we cannot have any "Ottoman Turkish" or "Ottoman Kurdish" articles. Just give it some time and contact the creator of the page to see if he can further help the article out. As for copy-edit, raise the points in the talk page. And the reason why it didn't have so many links at the time of the nomination is because you took them out of related articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=100441060&amp;oldid=99876828" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I&amp;diff=100441060&amp;oldid=99876828" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_I_casualties&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100441333" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_War_I_casualties&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100441333" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denial_of_Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100380101" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denial_of_Armenian_Genocide&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=100380101" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire&amp;diff=100441004&amp;oldid=97412844" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire&amp;diff=100441004&amp;oldid=97412844" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>&#160;:) Not a good sign&#160;:) I mean, we have many articles about fictional Star Wars and Pokemon characters and planets, why not give an opportunity to this article to develop?

<dd>This has also been explained, and the article also explains this in its first section: Ottoman censi grouped together Muslims under one heading. If someone can propose a way for us to distinguish who was a Turk, Kurd, Azeri etc from that population - then go ahead. There is also a fundamental difference between that example: religion was an important factor in many casualties of the Ottoman Empire; which was not the case for the British for example. British were fighting Germans, also Christians: therefore such a categorization would be redundant. But it was not the same thing for the Ottoman Empire, therefore the religious angle makes sense. But in any case the main thing is still the fact that Ottoman censi grouped together all Muslims, which means <i>there is no other way</i> to talk about them.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm less than happy with over specific lists. 'Ottoman casualties' is fine, but why limit it to muslims? Are the Christian and Jewish subjects of the Ottomon Empire to be given a separate list? I know what the reaction would be to [[British <i>Christian</i> casualties of World War I]] - we'd disallow it as a weasel way of needlessly excluding minorities that will be too minor to mention elsewhere. Unless a very good reason is forthcoming then <b>rename</b> to <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_casualties_of_World_War_I_a764.html" title="Ottoman casualties of World War I">Ottoman casualties of World War I</a>. I find the reason so far unconvincing: the difficulty of sourcing minority casualties is not a reason to exclude them <i>per se</i>. We should simply leave the list open, so that if sources are forthcoming at a later stage, then other casualties can be added.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 19:34, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As explained in the article, there is a specific reason: Ottoman census figures were done upon religious affiliation (the Millet system) - that's the only reason: It is not possible to have "Ottoman Turkish casualties" or "Ottoman Kurdish casualties" etc. This is about a specific topic among the casualties. There would be no problem developing another article for the overview for the global Ottoman casualties, nor about specific articles about Ottoman casualties for Jews or Bulgarians etc. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:42, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not neccessarily.. The article is being worked on anyways.. Please have a look at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millet_%28Ottoman_Empire%29_2b6a.html" title="Millet (Ottoman Empire)">Millet (Ottoman Empire)</a> for the specific demographic situation of the Ottoman Empire. In the Ottoman census, all the Muslims were grouped together, and the non-Muslims were seperate. That's why we cannot have anything other "Ottoman Muslim". But there is no reason why we can't have a specific article about the Muslim casualties - it is a valid topic. <i>In any case</i> - this is the deletion discussion, as I suggested before any other suggestions about references, clean-up or even possible renaming should be discussed in the talk pages of the article. As of now, no Wiki policies to merit deletion are violated, and the topic is a valid one. Did Muslim citizens of the Ottoman Empire die during World War I? Yes.

<dd>Your argument is bogus. Just because that source keep muslims separate, doesn't mean we need to. Much of this article is relevant to casualties in Anatolia of whatever religious persuasion.

<dd>(edit conflict) No, not at all. There are specific articles that cover casualties for other groups as well&#160;:) I still can't see why this discussion is relevant to the AfD: The references, clean-up and possible renaming belong to the talk pages of that article, not an AfD. AfD is to delete articles that violate Wiki policies. Were there Muslim Ottoman citizens who dies during the WWI? yes. That's all - the topic is valid.

<dd>Sincerely, I do not understand! Do you personally think that the casualties on the rest of the empire is so insignificant that it only deserves a footnote. Are you going to use the same argument for the Ottoman Armenian casualties, are we going to summarize them as a footnote. Also, does your statement "X amount of the troops killed were Muslims" assumes all the Muslims were troops, and no civilians? Why do you think that there should not be an article summarizing this side of the issue? If you help us, we do not have to "as you say imagine" on the duality of your thinking (Ottoman Armenians deserve - but other millets do not). I believe, WWI was hard on anyone.

<dd>I'm not talking about the value of a human being here and the cost of war. The Ottoman Armenian casualties article is strictly talking about those who perished during the Genocide. What's so hard to understand about that? Its the exact reason why they are no Jewish casualties and no Greek casualties of World War I articles. There's no special preference to one millet or the other but its specifically talking about the Genocide, which thus makes it relevant. This not even mentioning the fact that most of the sources on this page lack credibility and are unreliable (Zurcher? McCarthy?) because they not only deny the Genocide but claim that the most of the internal deaths of the Muslims were at the hands of Armenians.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 20:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has also been explained, and the article also explains this in its first section: Ottoman censi grouped together Muslims under one heading. If someone can propose a way for us to distinguish who was a Turk, Kurd, Azeri etc from that population - then go ahead. There is also a fundamental difference between that example: religion was an important factor in many casualties of the Ottoman Empire; which was not the case for the British for example. British were fighting Germans, also Christians: therefore such a categorization would be redundant. But it was not the same thing for the Ottoman Empire, therefore the religious angle makes sense. But in any case the main thing is still the fact that Ottoman censi grouped together all Muslims, which means <i>there is no other way</i> to talk about them.

<li>Not quite. This article already has references, and an editor has been working on it for some time. The article is already long, and there is no reason why there can't be such an article: Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, there are no limits as to what can be written. What Wiki policies this article's title breaks has not yet been shown. It has been explained why "Muslim" has been used, and considering the religious nature of many conflicts, it makes it an even more valid topic. There is no reason why we can't have a Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I either. I sense that people are assuming bad faith on the parts of the editors who created this article, and that's not helpful either. Have there been Ottoman citizens of the Muslim faith who died during World War I? Yes. The article's title is valid. The article also has many sources, it is long, and has expand tags where need be. Clean-up etc can be addressed in the article's talk page. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:59, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Baris, I still feel that the cross-correlation of the religious group "Muslims" with the ethnic group "Ottomans" forces exclusion of material that could <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> the article, and that a whole article on this segment of the populations affected is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>, given the existing relative articles for much greater scale of casualties. As I said, I <i>want</i> the salvageable content retained; but under a significantly larger umbrella (such as <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I_7372.html" title="Middle Eastern theatre of World War I">Middle Eastern theatre of World War I</a>, Middle Eastern casualties of World War I, or even Casualties of World War I to begin with!)

<li>Uh.. Why does it have to be merged there? This article is quite long already. If any thing, a section should be created in that article and give a seealso to this article. What is your main argument as to why this topic cannot have its own article? Because deaths of X are not notable enough? The FORK argument still hasn't been explained, either. How is "Muslim" a fork of "Armenian"???? Are we clear on the definition of "Fork"?? If anything, it can be a "parallel" article, and parallel articles are more than legitimate to explore a topic further (WWI casualties in this case).. Nikos, still no argument as to why this article doesn't merit its existance has been demonstrated, nor has it been shown what Wikipedia policy this breaks, except a few allegations of "non-notability", which can be considerd, at worst, as racist. This AfD is better, but in the last one nearly all the arguments said "non-notable"... People cannot AfD this article until they get the result they want, every single time pulling new arguments as if haggling for a carpet. Have there been Muslim citizens of the Ottoman Empire that died? Yes, and many. Is the article only a paragraph? No, it is longer than half the articles on Wikipedia. Why should it be deleted or merged? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 17:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(edit conflict)Again, the "Muslim" thing has been explained... There are no figures as to the ethnic repartition of the Muslim Millet of the Ottoman Empire. How are we supposed to talk about the casualties of Muslims in that case? Lots of conflict happened along religious lines. Religion has practically been the only source of conflict in the Middle East for millenia, that's why it is relevant. There is no cross-correlation by the way, "Ottoman Muslim" means Muslim citizens of the Ottoman Empire, it doesn't imply that all Ottomans were Muslims.</li>
<li>Undue weight argument doesn't make sense either. Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, there is no limit to what can be written, as lons as no Wiki policies are violated. You are saying that this article cannot exist because there is no Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I, or that similar articles are shorter. I am sorry, but that's not valid - pls create such an article. Nobody is stopping the expansion of other articles either, right? All casualties are notable, nobody can say "because X casualties article is shorter, Y casualties article must be deleted" - particularly when Wikipedia contains much longer articles about <i>fictional</i> Pokemon characters or Star Wars planets. Why can't real world deaths of numerous people have its own article? It still has not been explained why this topic is not notable or POV. It is a perfectly legitimate topic. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 17:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Other groups are humans too, and they too conscripted in the army, they too starved during the war. Are you denying their losses?

The Allied blockade caused food shortages and famine plus the Spanish Flu caused additional losses. The numbers of dead are difficult to determine and are a topic of intense debate. What is need is a person who is familiar with the literature on this topic to step in and clean it up to eliminate the one sided POV that deals only with Muslim losses.

<li>Pff.. We went over this already: how is "Ottoman Muslim" a fork? Of what precisely? This article is long enough, and the topic is more than valid, as pointed out above numerous times. There is no reason why there can't be a seperate article as pointed out above by many users, and it still has not been shown what Wiki policy this breaks. The choice of the title was also talked about many times. It is really sad that how there is this insistance on doing everything possible to not to have an article about this when there are thousands of articles about even fictional Pokemon characters. I really fail to understand.. Nobody is stopping the creation of Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I or "Ottoman X casualties during World War I". All of them are legitimate encyclopedic topics. Particularly since religion was such an important factor in the wars et al in that part of the world, the title is more than valid. In fact, seeing the size of this article, a seperate section should be created in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_casualties_15f4.html" title="World War I casualties">World War I casualties</a> and give this article as main. As pointed very well above by Okan, inexistance of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange.html" title="Orange">orange</a> does not legitimize the deletion of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a> given that articles dealing with 'fruits' do not violate principles. Nobody is stopping the expansion of other articles, their supposed shortness is not a reason why this article should be deleted. If anyone thinks that other articles need an expansion, <i>please</i> expand them - Wikipedia would appreciate it. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 22:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>So basically what you are saying is that the war only affected the Muslims, the famine only affected the Muslims, and death targeted Muslims. Not only per population more Christians died, but even on absolute figures as much Christians died.
<ul>
<li>Pff.. Nobody is stopping the creation of Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I or asking the deletion of other articles, nor stopping their expansion. The article's title is valid, and what you are basically saying is that X casualties article should be deleted because Y casualties article is shorter - it contains the assumption that X is less important Y. Expand the relevant articles, it is not a "either/or" situation. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 11:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>On Dardanelle, Jews and Christians were dragged in a labour battalion composed of non-Muslims where the casualty was reported very high (See Gilbert book on WWI). Every point raised on that article, other groups have faced. It is claimed that unlike Christians and Jews the Muslims did not get missionary Hospitals help. As I am sure you are well aware of the Red Crescent camps, how many were they? Did they have any of the restrictions imposed on the missionary hospitals? While the Red Crescent camps would only receive Christians after treating Muslims, the missionary hospitals would receive on the spot, read Ussher memoirs. In the East they were requisitioned by the army after the departure of the Armenians and would only receive the remaining, that is the Muslims. Some of the relief camps were even attacked by the Ottoman army, the Red Cross mission on Van for instance.</li>
<li>This article contains such irrelevancies, that cleaning them will place it in a shape that its title would have to be changed for Ottoman Casualties’, but since you claim alone it could and should survive, I have no other option than opposing. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am sorry, but I can't quite get how casualties and related events can be irrelevant.. In any case, it has also been explained why it is used as "Muslim" - if someone has a way of splitting them into Turkish, Azeri etc, then go ahead - but do not forget to mention how we are supposed to know who was Kurdish, Turkish etc since the Ottoman censi figures only took into account religious affiliation and categorized them as such. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong Delete</b> We have here another example of a RfD which abuses the system and uses targeted interest to pass an unencyclopedic article as valid. This article is indeed a FORK, as I have explained previously on its talk page. We are not talking here about if an article regarding Ottoman Empires casulties of WWI should be created, because that could be justified, we are debating here on whetever or not this article is a FORK yes or not. It is indeed one. Singling a population based on its religion in an event having affected the entire Ottoman Empire is clearly a FORK. This article has been created as a parallel to the Ottoman Armenian casulties page and seems to be indeed a diverted gimmik to be a "counter answer" to it. I already explained why the Ottoman Armenian casulties article is not a FORK while this one is, but I will once more explain it. Ottoman Empire was at war, any article about Ottoman Empires casulties of WWI accademically speaking will be in that context. There aren't any article on Ottoman casulties and we realise that one about Muslims is created. Baristarim justification doesn't make sense because no, Ottoman Jewish casulties during WWI can not be created in that context without being a FORK. For that to happen, there must be an encyclopedic justification of its existance, such article about casulties can not be an end. We can creat an article about Accadians casulties in the context of the Accadian deportation, this is not a FORK, because such an article will not be an end by itself. On the other hand, we can not creat an article about ethnically 'anglo-saxon' losses of life in the American army in the last years of the second world war at the door of Berlin. That would clearly be a FORK, unless so conscription system has been imposed on place founding a unite on ones anglo-saxonism to then sent on the front. In the context of war, and the context of the article, it would be like creating an article on the casulties of people with blue eyes during the American war of independence. Having said that, I don't think it is difficult to understand why the Ottoman Armenian casulties is not a FORK, it is because there were measures imposed against the Armenians which led to those casulties. The Christians and Jews were conscripted in the Ottoman army as well as the Alawis etc., the situation of war as justification, creating an article and singling the Muslims is definitly FORK. I don't expect my words to change anything, since I am convinced that those having voted keep for the most part clearly understand why the article is FORK. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I think I do, for a user who fought against it for over a year. But I admit I wasn't clear there in that I have skipped parts above. The main being that the 'varriable' article being disputed is not raised there, the hypothetical 'varriable', call it x for all it matters, but rather a way to skip it to creat a subcathegory to not have to raise issues. Lets say someone has a problem with an article 'x', and won't be able to get what he wants in that article 'x' because concensus will never be achieved or because it will be against guidelines or policies, the person start creating segments of the subjet as article, the 'end' by itself which existance could be justified by its own existance. In short, the user tries to get away with controversies by creating a parallel article and then using the argument that it is not a FORK because no prior article covers it (simplifying there), when the subject itself could not have found its place the way it is in this article in the already existing articles without violating policies and guidelines. The failure in incorporating(in another article, in this cases either the Armenian Genocide article or the casulties page attached to it) it should not be equaled with a value the subject could have as an independent article. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ask them, check the talkpage of the Armenian Genocide page and the numbers of time they have requested it.

<dd>Do not use "they", and assume good faith on the part of the creators of this article. I am not one of them, but I still cannot see why it would be a FORK. You are now saying that it is a "parallel" article - well parallel articles are <i>more than</i> welcome in Wikipedia to analyze a issue further - that's not what a fork is. With your reasoning <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> is a fork of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> or <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> since they are "parallel" articles. Inexistance/shortness of other articles do not bear on another article - nobody is stopping anyone from creating a Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I or the expansion of other articles. However the most ludicrous assumption is the claim that "Ottoman Muslim" is a fork of "Armenian" - uh, sorry, it is not. The article also talks about the Gallipoli campaign and Syria etc. It is also true that there were huge famines etc back in the day because of the war. This is a sub-article of World War I casualties, and nobody is stopping the expansion of that, or any other, article either. Fadix, your claims are bordering on fantasy and paranoia - it still has not been explained how "Ottoman Muslim" casualties is a fork of Armenian. Are you saying that no Ottoman Muslims died in the Middle East, Gallipoli, because of famine, blockades etc?? It has also been explained that the reason why "Muslim" is used is because of the Ottoman censi, and this combined with the fact that lots of conflict happened among religious lines, it is valid. Fadix, you are trying to guess and assume bad faith on what the initial creator of the article might have thought - that is not appropriate. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>??? I am sorry, but nobody is stopping the creation of Ottoman Jewish casualties during World War I or any other related article. This is a direct sub-article of World War I casualties, of which similar articles are also as such. There are shorter articles in Wikipedia, even about fictional characters and planets, I do not understand why the casualties of Ottoman Muslims cannot have its own article. The choice of "Muslim" has also been explained: it is not because of religious reasons, but because Ottoman censi grouped together all Muslims together, which means we do not have reliable information in a way which would permit us to have "Ottoman Kurdish" or "Ottoman Turkish" casualty articles. The choice is not religious, and it is explained in the article's first paragraph. Nevertheless, we all know that religion has always been an important factor in the Middle East for all sorts of wars and casualties. Nikos, as I said before, people cannot AfD this article forever until they get the 'right' result, every single time pulling new arguments. What is this insistence as to why there cannot be an article about this? The topic is valid, the title is valid, the article is long, I still cannot see how "Ottoman Muslim" is a "fork" to "Armenian".. I am sorry, but such insistence is very unWikipedian: there is no reason why there can't be articles as long as a article's scope is notable enough and it doesn't violate any guidelines. People can expand other articles as they wish, that has no bearing on this article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 12:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not quite, since even the Martians know that religion has been a very important factor in many wars and casualties in the Middle East, just like it was during the World War in the Ottoman Empire, Balkans and the Middle East. I tried to mention this somewhere above: having "British Christian casualties during World War I" would not neccessarily make sense, since the British were fighting the Germans et al, who were also Christians - therefore such a categorization would simply be redundant. In any case, still: The choice of "Muslim" has also been explained: it is not because of religious reasons, but because Ottoman censi grouped together all Muslims together, which means we do not have reliable information in a way which would permit us to have "Ottoman Kurdish" or "Ottoman Turkish" casualty articles. If you can tell us how we are to proceed to such divisions, please say it. That's why the article is not a fork - and it is definitely not a fork of Armenian casualties article. The choice is not religious, and it is explained in the article's first paragraph. This is about the casualties of a particular <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millet_%28Ottoman_Empire%29_2b6a.html" title="Millet (Ottoman Empire)">Millet</a> of the Ottoman Empire - and therefore the casualties they suffered is valid - particularly considering that the post-war partition of countries, and the foundation of many other states that arose from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire also happened along religious lines. Listen, it is common knowledge that many Muslims died, and <i>not</i> neccessarily for the same reasons - some of them did, some of them didn't. But again, the casualties of every ethnic and religious group had consequences for the political situations in the aftermath of the war. I said this in the last AfD: if there is anyone who can say with a straight face that no Turk/Kurd/Armenian/Greek/Sunni/Shia/Azeri etc was not killed by Turk/Kurd/Armenian/Greek/Sunni/Shia/Azeris during World War I for religious or ethnic reasons, sometimes with the involvement of many, then he should seriously get a reality check. The article explores a valid encyclopedic topic - however <i>please</i> keep an eye on the article for any POV issues. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:57, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The article definitely fails to illustrate how <i>the reasons that the Muslims suffered</i> were any different from <i>the reasons that all other Ottomans suffered</i>. I don't care if the Ottoman censi had data on blue-eyed tall people, as long as these fell in the same misery for the same reasons. If you find sources that discriminate casualty reasons on a religious specific nature as opposed to the rest of the Ottomans, then you'll have a point. But <i>you don't have such sources now.</i> The <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_flu.html" title="Spanish flu">Spanish flu</a> and the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine.html" title="Famine">famine</a>, did not discriminate on religion LOL!!

<dd>It is not just about famine. The article is trying to focus on the Muslim millet of the Ottoman Empire, and the casualties they had suffered. The article is not short, and it has expand tags all over it. What is the rush of not waiting for this article to be developed even further? Many Muslims also migrated during the World War precisely for the reasons that have to do primarily with religion/ethnic conflict, either in the Balkans, Middle East etc, and those also fall under the scope of this article. Many Turks/Kurds ended up moving from one place to the other during the war - and the reasons that caused their migrations were not always the same that caused the migration of other people. That's all.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well you can't focus on something whose same causalities have made more people miserable. Why do you work your way backwards?

We already have a <i>Genocide</i> article, which is far from including a tiny tiny Turkish POV section, so anything on the Armenian Casualities can be merged with it.

Pay attention to the justifications for keeping it and you will see that my claim of the article used as opposition to the 'Armenian.' <i>Muslims died too.</i> <i>They talk about of Christian losses.</i> etc. (I am paraphrasing) It is clear in the mind of those wanting the keep, at least the majority that this page is used advocating the <i>Muslims died too.</i> (a wording coined by McCarthy himself), it is a promossion. We are not debating here on Ottoman casualties. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The choice of "Muslim" has also been explained: it is not because of religious reasons, but because Ottoman censi grouped all Muslims together, which means we do not have reliable information in a way which would permit us to have "Ottoman Kurdish" or "Ottoman Turkish" casualty articles. If you can tell us how we are to proceed to such divisions, please say it. That's why the article is not a fork. The choice is not religious, and it is explained in the article's first paragraph. This is about the casualties of a particular <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millet_%28Ottoman_Empire%29_2b6a.html" title="Millet (Ottoman Empire)">Millet</a> of the Ottoman Empire - and therefore the casualties they suffered is valid. There are references, and there is no rule against having casualties articles. In fact, another section should be created in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_casualties_15f4.html" title="World War I casualties">World War I casualties</a> and give this article as main, if anything. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, but i still consider it a fork... Just as i would consider a fork a possible article about "Greek Orthodox casualties" (still a millet). <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 16:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see your point, however "Greek Orthodox" would simply be redundant since "Greek" is already an ethnicity, whereas "Ottoman" is not - it is just a nationality status. How can we create "Ottoma Turkish" or "Ottoman Kurdish" casualties if there are no reliable figures <i>at all</i> for the ethnic repartition of the Muslim Millet? I would also be ok with Ottoman Turkish et al casualties - but, as things stand, this is the only way. "Muslim" here is not a religious classification per se, it is a demographic classification used in Ottoman censi.</dd>
<dd>As for the other point, it wouldn't be fork and it could be a valid article. Wikipedia doesn't have a limit on what articles we can have as long as the topic is notable, and if the subject matter is valid. People are welcome to keep an eye on this for POV, but I cannot understand why it is not notable enough that it cannot exist among +1,5m articles in Wikipedia. But it is ok if you consider it a fork, and you are more than welcome to keep an eye on the article to make sure that it focuses on topic and doesn't stray from NPOV. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Orthodox_fe07.html" title="Greek Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> is not exactly "Greek" in the sense of an ethnicity...

<dd>I would also like to be able to find a way to split this article into "Ottoman Turkish" "Ottoman Azeri", but it is not possible since there is no way of determining who is of what ethnicity among the Muslim Millet - not to mention the fact that ethnic identification was quite blurry to begin with. Why not create a section in that article and give this as main? This article is longer than half the articles on Wikipedia anyways.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is (inadvertantly) an insult to the Ottoman Empire and to the human losses it suffered. The military and civilian casualties were Ottoman Muslims who were native speakers of Arabic/Albanian/Greek/Kurdish/Laz/etc... as well as of Turkish. There were also Ottoman Christians casualties who even spoke Turkish. Thousands of those casualties or commrades in arms often lived in mixed regions. How dare we impose on those victims a post-modern, pseudo-nationalistic segregation? After the Young Turk revolution, all Ottoman citizens were equal. Indeed, there was no 'purefied' ethnic or linguistic unity - just Ottoman citizens. Likewise, I would ask for the deletion of an article on 'Greek Orthodox casualties of WWI' or whatever. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 17:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> Baristarim. You are pulling my leg again. I never said casualties related articles are irrelevant, what I pointed to is the irrelevancy of singling Muslims when none of the cases provided single Muslims. We do not create ‘anglo-saxon’ American casualties’ of the Vietnam War, can we create such articles? We could if there were some policies back then, which would only send ‘anglo-saxon white Americans to Vietnam, if no such policies existed singling them would even be prejudicial.</p>
<p>As for the term ‘they’, ‘they’ refer to the active contributors, it wasn’t used in a pejorative way. As for the main contributor, no, I do no assume good faith, he already admitted his intentions when he tried modifying the Armenian casualties’ entry to fit the purposes of existence the Muslim casualties’ page.</p>
<p>Now coming to Judaism, Islam and Christianity articles. Look, you are an intelligent person, so please don’t include comparisons you know don’t fit in. The Torah is not the Koran, those elements differentiating them each justify them. Check all the factors presented in the Muslim casualties’ page, which one was specifically proper to Muslim? The answer is none, there is no specificity justifying it, I don’t say had their been an Ottoman casualties’ page and that in such a page the specificity of the Muslim deaths would have taken too much space, a page on excess deaths could not have been created, but you know that is not the cases. So for those reasons, I think you pretty much understand why this article is a FORK, I don’t need to tell you that the major contributor is the same contributor who toyed with the Armenian genocide page as well as the Armenian casualties’ page, the same contributor who added irrelevancies attempting to dump the Ottoman Muslims and will find himself now working on a Muslim article. That’s the FORK.</p>
<p>Lastly, I never said there were no Muslim casualties’, I do believe that there were heavy losses. But none of the cases mentioned would justify singling them when other Ottoman subjects were also victim, the excess Christian mortality reached per population as much in some region as over the 4:1, and I was the one opposing the creation of a Christian casualties’ page. If you want to create an Ottoman casualties’ page including all the groups go ahead, very good idea. But you will not make me believe that this article is not a FORK to the Armenian articles when there is even no page on Ottoman casualties’ of WWI, and then one on the Muslims pop-up, and this worked by the same person having disrupted both Armenian articles. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 17:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, my example with the religion was an exagerration and some lame straw man, and I also can see your point about the tensions that might have existed before with some other editors. However, I really would like, somehow, to find some sort of working ground where we can encyclopedically cover many aspects of this part of history. I also disagree that "Muslim" is somehow the opposite of "Armenian". In any case, I said before that, per <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, any editor can edit any article, and the supposed initial intent of the creators of an article do not have much bearing on the validity of an article. Listen, unfortunately I have never had enough time to get involved with many related articles, and I know that there is a lot of work to be done.. I just think that we should give an opportunity for this article to develop and that any editor can keep an eye on the article for NPOV. I <i>know</i> that there are always some POV games going on in many Wiki articles, but at least let's try to marginalize such games and try to concentrate on content. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:33, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

I want you here on record saying that you have absolutely no problem with an article like Russian Christian casualties of World War I&#160;?

<li><b>Keep, but with reservations</b>. I am not per deletion; the article IMO can stay, because it offers useful info, but I have a huge problem with the article's quality. For instance, claims such as "Ottoman Empire's casualties can be certified to have been enormous regardless of the method used in the calculations." definitely need citing. And something ever more important: I admit I read the article quickly, but, nevertheless, from this reading I got the impression that the article does not adequately explains me what caused these casualties? How was exactly Ottoman Empire and Ottoman muslims involved in the war? I think some clarifications should be offered. I must also say that I would prefer a more general title like Ottoman population casualties of World War I or Ottoman citizens casualties of World War I, because I do not like the discrimination between Ottoman muslims and Ottoman christians.

<p><i><b>Important note:</b></i> I just today from Tabib reference have seen that OttomanReference has acted in bad faith. Three Armenian casulties pages exist, two of them Ottoman Reference is responsable of the existance off, one those, the Armenian casualties of World War I. When one was redirected, he had cut the redirect to created an independent article and created another one to justify the existance of those two articles which I STRONGLY OPPOSE their existance. Let me reinterate, the page which I have created long time ago on the Ottoman Armenian casualties deals with figures and inspired by the Researchers Note on Armenian population and losses, an encyclopedic article on Britannica. It's existance is in regard to the controversies in the accademia, and one reading the article like the one on the Ottoman Armenian population will clearly view the differences. Those two articles(Armenian casualties and population) were created because they would have taken half of the Armenian Genocide page put together. I am hating OttomanReferance way of working, he had in the past a history of using socks to implament his edits, and now had used a cheap tactic to creat two other Armenian casulties pages to justify this article. I welcome anyone in creating an Ottoman casualties page as it is the only way to stop this unti-Wikipedian way OttomanReference has to implament what he wants here. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 00:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>!!! OMG, this article is soooo informative.--71.107.167.245 01:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep, Rename, and Expand</b> I support renaming the article to take out Muslim and also expanding the article to reflect the changing demographics of the OE over the preceding 50 years or so.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is a major encyclopedic topic buried in all this hate-mongering:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Ottomans had been in non-stop war-fare and military actions for far earlier. The result is that the stub of the OE left at the time of WWI is already filled with refugees, war-time orphans and a dearth of men of military age. This is the background against which the OE participates in WWI, not in isolation. The change in numbers due to the previous several decades is significant enough to change the demographics of the Ottoman lands, let alone the social and economic fabric of the land. Any discussion of the casualties of the WWI does not make sense without this background of a country with most of its strength already sapped.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>WWI is a time of great divisiveness in the OE - when the Millet system collapsed etc. I think this is the reason why the name of the article is "Ottoman Muslim Casualties". But, few as they may be, some actually believed in a different reality and died for it. This article totally neglects the existence of hundreds of non-Muslim officers who participated in the war, on the Ottoman side and lie, buried with their Muslim brethren in "şehitlik"s. Mostly military doctors, a few combat positions, but they are there, along with common infantry, who can also be traced. The OE may not have been successful in its attempt to forge a nation-state, but it does not mean these people did not exist and die for it. And I, for one, consider ignoring them to be deeply irrespectful of their memory. Aside from the respect issue, this is also significant since the inclusion of non-Muslims in the Ottoman armies was a relatively recent reform (I believe 1908) and is part of the reform attempts of the early parliamentary monarchy period.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Gallipoli.... What a human story and one that does not get mentioned at all in this article. How can you have an article about Ottoman casualties of WWI and not mention that the 1919 graduating class of Galatasaray does not exist due to Gallipoli? Again, put it into context and show that an entire nation's intelligentsia perished in the war. 1,000,000 or so casualties in the WWI when the newly founded Republic of Turkey had 13 million total population is what puts the meaning of WWI into context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To wrap up... This is a major topic. An article about the Ottoman casualties of WWI should exist. It should have the proper context showing the change in the demographics of the land due to the previous several decades of constant warfare and military action. It should not be about Muslims only and should not trample upon the memories of the few that actually did believe in a multi-national OE, but should be about <b>all</b> that fought on the Ottoman side. It should also show, rather than just numbers, the meaning and context of the numbers. -- only then you can put it into context of what a total annihilation has been lived through in these lands.

<dd><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a>; The problem is that article is using “ottoman statistics” to bring validity. Even in this form there are a lot of people (read the discussions) who want to delete it. They do not want to see the existence of the terminology. Even in this limited form, it generates hate and raises the guard of (“defenders”) to what they are protecting. When you move from ottoman realm to what you are talking about, you will loose the ground that Ottoman Empire build with its own documents, reports and etc. You have to remember, Ottoman classification is not based on true devotion to a religion, it was based on ones affiliation to a community. British documents of its time classified <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Revolutionaries_2d85.html" title="Turkish Revolutionaries">Turkish Revolutionaries</a> as Muslim millet of Anatolia. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Revolutionaries_2d85.html" title="Turkish Revolutionaries">Turkish Revolutionaries</a> end up abolishing the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>. If you want to tell your story, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_d0f5.html" title="Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire">dissolution of the Ottoman Empire</a> has a lot of free space for you develop that idea, and you do not need to rename this article. Besides who is going to deal with Armenian casualties (deal with the "defenders", by the way I'm not a "denier" so take me out of that list), if you want to have a document that covers all the sides.<a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 06:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>True, there was a definite distinction between the Muslim and Christian subjects of the Ottoman empire. There has to be seperate article covering the Muslim casualties. Besides even the "deletists" here prefer to distinct the Christian casualties.--<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Gonzo_bed0.html" title="User:Doktor Gonzo">Doktor Gonzo</a> 06:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guys, I am against re-writing history to make it black/white and to make the distinction of religion synonymous with distinction of side. As for statistics, for example you can refer to the statistics of Tıbbiye - Istanbul School of Medicine, which has published books about army doctor casualties of WWI. For example, in 1917, they held a memorial service to 215 of their graduates who had recently fell in war - 75 of these were non-Muslim. I, for one, am firmly within the Ottoman realm, how about you? --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> 08:05, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However, one note for <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a>; there are reasons behind this article, and they are sound reasons. You do not have to accept and live with it, but unedrstand and respect to it (I woud like to see even if you can add one or two points). I belive the term muslim millet was used as a community and did not have the same contenation of our times (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFree_smyrnan_a597.html" title="User:Free smyrnan">Free smyrnan</a> wording in the message does not reflect this difference). By the way ottoman casualties are close to 5,000,000 (? Armenians, 500,000 in Syria (as an ottoman region) and it continuous... ) and tibbiye is only 215 (lets double it 500, not even 1% of the story). <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 08:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If this article is to be renamed as Ottoman Casualities in WWI, then the article Ottoman Armenian Casualities and any article regarding to the losses of Armenians in the alleged genocide and WWI must be included in that article rather than staying as independent articles, because they can also be classified as Ottoman casualities. Any article related to the alleged genocide except the main article <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a> is to be merged into this article or to be deleted. This wouldn't be helpful, because all the non-Christian casualities would be presented as Muslim casualities, due to the fact that there is no source for the casualities of Turkish, Azerbaijani, Kurdish or Arabic casualities other than the Muslim casualities. Such a page would most probably have four subtitles: Armenian Losses, Greek Losses, Assyrian Losses and Muslim Losses. Why do we try to make things more complex? It is quite simple and understandable now. <a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 10:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I propose we start working constructively towards that direction now, and stop all other displays of passion.

In that case let's merge the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Armenian_casualties_f537.html" title="Ottoman Armenian casualties">Ottoman Armenian casualties</a> to Ottoman casualties during World War I, since another article at <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> also exists; then divide that article to military and civilian casualties etc. I am still too suspicious of a possible rename. My point to you earlier was the fact that we had an awkward situation because a sub-article was started before another possible main article was created. In any case, this article is still a sub of World War I casualties, and it is too long to be simply merged. However, that awkward situation notwithstanding, I still think that there can be a seperate article. The article is being worked on, at least let's give it some time. <i>Nevertheless</i> there should be another article for Ottoman casualties anyways.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 13:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Ottoman Muslim casualties’ page is very, very different than the original Armenian casualties’ pages. The Armenian page does NOT concentrate on the reasons of the death, it relate to a controversies and in a cold way relate to the different statistics, much like the Ottoman Armenian population page. The reason of the death could go in the Armenian genocide page or a page on WWI and a page on the Ottoman in WWI. The page created about Muslim casualty is not the same sort of article, it is not an encyclopaedic article on losses, it is an article regarding the condition of Ottoman Muslims which led to their deaths. I did need to create a page on population statistics controversies and casualties controversies, because both put together would have taken half of the main Armenian genocide page. There are no real controversies and debates on Muslim casualties, the figures could be presented in one paragraph, placing figures. But there clearly are controversies and different positions on the Armenian population and Ottoman Armenian casualties, each position should have been explained. So in no way could the Muslim casualties be compared with the Armenian casualties’ page, the Muslim casualties could rather be compared to the Armenian Genocide main page. If the article should cover the Ottoman situation during war, civilian losses etc, OK, this could be legitimate. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My prediction is that this poll will close with no consensus. Anyway ... Some thoughts just in case! <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Armenian_casualties_f537.html" title="Ottoman Armenian casualties">Ottoman Armenian casualties</a> refers to a period broader than the World War I; I am not sure if it should be merged into an article named Ottoman casualties during World War I. IMO Ottoman casualties during World War I is a better title for the article in discussion here, because it passes over the discrimination between Muslim and Christian Ottoman citizens. After all, they were all equal citizens of the same state, and they all suffered dring World War I: I suppose suffering was not limited to one religion. And even with a different title, the emphasis of the article will be inevitably on the muslim citizens, because they were the most populous in the empire. But in order to adopt the title Ottoman casualties during World War I the scope of the current article should be expanded and cover the other religions as well. Are the editors of the article willing to expand its scope? Would they accept collaboration by other editors (not me, because my program is a mess right now!) to expand it.</dd>

<dd>The thing is that while the Ottoman Armenians have mostly died from 1915 to 1916. Most Muslims died from mid 1916 to 1922(Muslim death were also very heavy after WWI). There are many events which are problematic. Excess mortality during the Arabo-Turkic wars, the Kurdish rebellions etc. There are also the fact that the east was starved to death after the eviction of the Armenians. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 18:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How many times were the articles you have created placed for deletion? Do you damn know what an encyclopaedic article is? I have already explained why that particular article about Armenian casualties’ exist. Since you seem to either not understand or don’t want to understand, let me capitalise that: IT IS BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON THE NUMBER OF OTTOMAN ARMENIANS HAVING DIED, IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN COVERED IN ONE PARAGRAPH, THAT ARTICLE ONLY PROVIDE STATISTICS FROM ALL THE MAJOR PARTIES CONCERNED. That article should have been part of the Armenian genocide page but since it would have taken too much space it was created. The two articles you have created about Armenian casualties have no justification to exist, neither the one on the deportation, and we have Tehcir, with don’t need a thousand of articles created on the same issue, I have really tried in vein explaining you, but you refuse to understand. The Armenian deportation is already covered in the Armenian genocide page, the article on Armenia, World War I article too and many others. You have created multiple articles and are being disruptive such behaviour is the sort that endanger the integrity of Wikipedia. I have kindly asked you on various occasions to stop this disruptive behaviour and what best you have found to do is accusing me to hide the ‘facts.’ What facts? That Muslim suffered? Where have I ever tried denying that? Where were you when I have said in the WWI that the Ottoman casualties presented there were too low? Does it seem that I am hiding anything at all? What I ask, is to respect few simple things. Check how many articles you have created about the Armenian cases, the executioners, the lists you had created in the past, two involving the deportation, 2 on the casualties. All disorganised, with no rational reason for their existence. Many Turks who voted here were quick on the gun believing that this was about erasing the history of the Muslim suffering, but I am confident that if they take time to understand the issues I have raised, they will see that what I am opposing is not that, but rather opposing to your irrational way of 'founding' articles.</dd>

<dd>Now, tell me since you opened the subject yourself, why could Russian Armenian casualties of WWI and what followed should not be included in the Armenian republics history section? And what about the other Armenian casualties’ page you have created? What about the deportation page, the Tehcir page? In this case, the easier way is to create an Ottoman casualties page, since it will be a way to stop your disruption, and I will even accept the Armenian casualties’ page to be merged there if it could help fighting against your disruptions. I think I have made my point very clear and need nothing to add more in this page. And about the Muslim deaths, check professor Panzac review of McCarthy's work which I have previously refered to. This was one example I brought. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 21:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

So if you take the risk of creating and keeping it without POV tags and edit wars go head with the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_casualties_of_WWI_fa27.html" title="Ottoman casualties of WWI">Ottoman casualties of WWI</a>, we will put a link to your article. If you also take the risk of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_casualties_of_WWI_fa27.html" title="Ottoman casualties of WWI">Ottoman casualties of WWI</a>, we can put a link from <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Muslim_casualties_of_World_War_I_7e8c.html" title="Ottoman Muslim casualties of World War I">Ottoman Muslim casualties of World War I</a> and summarize this content in your article.

Instead of spending your time here; begin to work, we will catch you up. Otherwise , "Ottoman Muslim Millet" is not something that I come up with, you and Armenians can delete this from this place, by voting! But it exists, what can I say more about this issue, and other concepts, too.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - not one of the responses so far have addressed the actual reasons for deletion. The simplest google search would find the commercial promotional web page most of the information initially came from. Which begs the question of plagiarism from a website. The term is not commonly used by local news media, it is a commercial construct. It is not a major geographic region - it is a narrow coastline - a mere small component of the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swan_Coastal_Plain_1e4b.html" title="Swan Coastal Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>. On the basis of possible plagiarism, and lack of addressing the actual reason for deletion - from my perspecctive the keep comments carry no weight whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 02:32, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One possibility is to change it to a redirect - but to what I'm not exactly sure (possibly Perth, Western Australia). If it survives as an article, it should be purely about a name and campaign devised by the WA Government's tourism department and its success or failure based on a range of sources, rather than about the region - the fact is that as you said, very few people in Western Australia use the name. I might see what I can find and propose an alternative article. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 02:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

As for the name - It's a bit of a weird one, in that it is an official (tourist) name that is not used extensively locally, that seems to have been "sub-let" by the Tourism Department of the WA Government to a private tourism association who promote their own members.

Please note that it has been linked up to various WA relevant articles, because those coastlines or beaches are in fact part of Sunset Coast, as a Wikipedia editor, this is my responsibility and right to make supplement based on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_eaec.html" title="Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a>. In practice, most significant places used to attract tourists that locals are always seldom go even don't know it exists. For example, the Pinnacle Desert in WA, the peak in Hong Kong, the Hollywood Boulevard (Hollywood Walk of Fame )in Los Angeles etc. Those all usually ignored by locals.

<li><b>Response and Question</b> Let me see if I understand you correctly. It's a name coined for the purposes of tourism, so discussing the promotion of tourism in the article is tantamount to advertising for the tourism agency? So, discussing tourism on Wikipedia is not allowed? What about advertising? Is there an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_Commercials_55d1.html" title="Super Bowl Commercials">Super Bowl Commercials</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b> An example of its use - "Promote beaches - expert", <i>The West Australian</i>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">25 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, p.&#160;11. "Mills said that WA's politicians, planners, developers and the community had to decide whether they wanted WA's beaches, particularly the Sunset Coast, promoted as tourism destination, and if so, how that could be achieved. Sunset Coast Tourism Association vice-president, Andrew Slomp, said the Sunset coastal strip had to develop its own identity, like Fremantle and the Swan Valley. However, Slomp added that the association was not interested in development similar to the Gold Coast." In a real estate writeup in September 2002 from the Sunday Times: "WITH land prices booming along the Sunset Coast, the shack at 40 Branksome Gardens must be one of Perth's hottest properties." So as you can see, it's not used in the same way as one would use the Gold Coast as a location, or Perth as an area (any Perth person would just say "Perth" or "northern suburbs" or "Scarborough") - but does exist from a tourism promotion point of view. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 04:37, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I nominated this article for deletion for the second time because as I started reading the first nomination, a "no consensus" conclusion was made and the article was removed from nomination before I got the chance to voice my argument. Here is the reason again (sorry if this is redundant, but I'm not sure where is the proper place to put this note):</li>
</ul>
<p>This article represents the Shia point of view which sharply contradicts with the foundation of the faith of the mainstream (Sunni) Islam. Worldwide Sunni Muslims (comprising 90% of world Muslims) believe that this list is nothing but a fabrication by the Shia sect. This is not new; this has been going on for centuries. This online encyclopedia is NOT the proper place for those kinds of extremely controversial issues, especially when they represent points of views of a minor sect (Shia) of the global religion of Islam. Of course the Shia scholars will continue to claim that their views and deviant beliefs are supported by Sunni references and sources. However, all they have been doing over centuries is misinterpreting those references, taking them out of context and twisting them to support their views. They've had a historical enmity towards the 3 rightly-guided Caliphs of Islam which are revered by over 1.2 Billions Sunni Muslims and have been revered for the past 14 centuries, while Sunnis never carry any sort of enmity towards the sacred figures revered by the Shia such as Ali ibn Abi Talib or Fatimah. There is not one single Sunni Muslim or Sunni scholar that will accept the Shia interpretations of the references otherwise, if they do, then over a Billion Sunni Muslim will convert happily into Shia. Therefore, further attempts to quote the so called Sunni sources to support those Shia views should be discredited and not to be accepted a valid argument in any way. According to Sunni Islam, this list does not even exist. Ali, Fatimah and all those Sahaba enlisted in this list have given their full allegiance to Abu Bakr and to believe that they were at odds with him is totally absurd. Again WIKIPEDIA is NOT the proper place for those minority views.TrueWisdom1TrueWisdom1</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, merge what is salvagable into Shi'a view of Abu Bakr. most of it is a "list of sahaba not giving bay'ah" <i>according to</i> shi'ites. others (i.e. the rest) in the list are redundant, as they only briefly opposed then subsequently offered their <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay%27ah.html" title="Bay'ah">bay'ah</a>, making their inclusion in the list pointless. furthermore, the some of the sources used are extremely poor: a fundamental source is the comical "<a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshawar_Nights_8a8d.html" title="Peshawar Nights">Peshawar Nights</a>", which narrates of a so-called "Sunni-Shi'a" discussion (which some believe simply did not happen and was frankly made up - the Sunni character clearly doesn't know his stuff), and is used nowadays solely as a polemical device. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:56, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you regard those scholars as Shi'a scholars? If not, why are you suggesting that their information is of Shi'a origin, and more importantly, why does it belong in an article about the Shi'a view of a single person? Further your argument of <i>"as they only briefly opposed then subsequently offered their <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay%27ah.html" title="Bay'ah">bay'ah</a>"</i> is an <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument, since nobody has nowhere stated that this is a list of person that opposed him <i>indefinitely</i> but in fact, the article clearly says <i>"was <b>initially</b> opposed"</i> --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 15:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bukhari/Muslim/Tabari are narrating hadiths, not their opinions, so the material becomes a primary source, which is something which generally shouldn't be utilized. Ibn Qutaybah/Ibn Abi al-Hadid may too be narrating hadiths (seems unlikely in the latter case)- however, their attributions have seemingly been obtained from media less than reliable -- one being a wordpress ppt presentation, the other a Shi'a website. what is really needed is independant verification. Gibbon is one i overlooked, yet he has only been provided in verifying the existence of the dispute, and not for verifying the individuals in the list. this is why i suggested that whatever can be salvaged should be merged into the proposed article or in <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> which can then give it an appropriate overview.</dd>
<dd>if the opposition was temporary, 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months even, then what's the point of making a list about a period of time as brief as this, apart from forwarding a particular view about this general dispute? thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 21:30, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tabari is admittedly only narrating hadith, he stated that in his introduction of the book and thus is his book only a primary Source. But we all know as a fact that the same kind of thing can not be said about Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj: both are celebrated by Sunnis for the great achievement of only including reliable narrations in their <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Sahihs_5c0d.html" title="Two Sahihs">two Sahihs</a>, thus is their work not only an extremely reliable secondary source of early Sunni scholarship, the sunni even praise <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> as the "most Sahih Book after the Qur'an" <a href="http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/hadith/bukhari/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/hadith/bukhari/index.html" rel="nofollow">ummah.net</a>, <a href="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=838" class="external text" title="http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/profile_story.asp?service_id=838" rel="nofollow">islamonline.com</a>, <a href="http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/imam_bukhari.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/imam_bukhari.htm" rel="nofollow">sunnah.org</a>, <a href="http://yarehman.bizbrowse.com/islam/Mazameen/Personalities-English/Imam-Bukhari.htm" class="external text" title="http://yarehman.bizbrowse.com/islam/Mazameen/Personalities-English/Imam-Bukhari.htm" rel="nofollow">yarehman.com</a>, <a href="http://www.inter-islam.org/A-Z/B/B.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.inter-islam.org/A-Z/B/B.htm" rel="nofollow">inter-islam.org</a>, <a href="http://fatwa-online.com/classicalbooks/hadeeth/0000101.htm" class="external text" title="http://fatwa-online.com/classicalbooks/hadeeth/0000101.htm" rel="nofollow">fatwa-online.com</a>. This is enough to end the disccusion regarding if this is only a Shia view or not, and considering the Bukhari/Muslim narrations, it is only expected that you find other non-Shi'a like Ibn Qutaybah/Ibn Abi al-Hadid narrating hadith to the same effect.</dd>

<dd>It is true that i found the Ibn Qutaybah in a non-Muslim teaching course, and considering that i also have two independent Shi'a sources give the same quote, but with small variations in translation, you either have a Shi'a/Shi'a/non-Muslim conspiracy to misquote Ibn Qutaybah, or he did in fact narrate that hadith. The same can be said by Ibn Abi al-Hadid the non-Shi'a non-Sunni <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a> scholar who is widely known for quoting narrations that Sunnis agree are Sahih but do not feel comfortable being reminded of. Again, this is an editorial issue, add a request for a better tag if you wish, the Bukhari/Muslim quote is enough to refute the nomination arguments.</dd>

<dd>Gibbon verified that the Banu Hashim "and their chief", ie, Ali, did not give the oath: <i>"the Hashemites alone <b>declined the oath</b> of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house, maintained, <b>above six months</b>, a sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar"</i>. If nothing else, this is a secondary source of the Bukhari/Muslim secondary sources, voiding all allegations of this being a Shi'a only view. Gibbon is the second non-Shi'a non-Sunni holding this view, together with Ibn Abi al-Hadid.</dd>

The fact that there was a large amount of Sahaba that just like Ali did not initially give his oath is uncontested and readily admitted among the early Sunni historians, the practice of trying to deny this is a more modern phenomena that is at strikingly odds with all the early historians, including Bukhari/Muslim.</dd>

<dd>The opposition is widely quoted as <b>six month</b>, an indeed notable time period considering that the state became engaged in warfare during that period and is nowhere near the 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months you mentioned. This event is notable enough to warrant a full and detailed article, something that can not be given justice to as a section in an already large article: going into such great detail in the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> would spark even stronger felings and revert wars than if given it's own article, so given multpiple arguments, i strongly oppose merging this to <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> or an Shi'a view article.</dd>

<dd>well, the reason we don't use primary sources is not because we doubt their authenticity, but because we're not in a position to intepret them. sometimes you can use primary sources when there are extremely explicit, but with most hadith there are too many ambiguities. the hadith cited in the article make little mention of duration (from my observation), it's difficult to tell whether the witholding spans a few days or a few months (apart from Ali). there may also be other sound narrations reporting slightly differently on the assumed chronology, events, and details. that's why we use secondary sources. did <i>all</i> personalities mentioned resist for six months? nobody is denying that a pledge may have been temporarily withheld, but for how long? and what is its encyclopedic relevence, if the problems of verification are overlooked (if the problematic sources were removed, then much of the article would also thus be removed)?</dd>
<dd>i don't think anyone finds such information "uncomfortable", it's simply about what is factually accurate. who, and when, are questions that this article doesn't seem to answer convincingly. that's why i think this stuff can be comprehensively overviewed in two paragraphs of prose in one of the other articles. as it stands, the article consists mainly of a list of names, and some blockquotes from certain personalities. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No one among you should have the misconception that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr took place suddenly. No doubt, the oath was pledged in this way, but the Almighty protected the Muslims from its evil consequences [which might have arisen] and remember! there is none among you like Abu Bakr, whose greatness cannot be surpassed. Now if a person pledges an oath of allegiance to someone, without the opinion of the believers, no one should pledge allegiance to him as well as to whom he [himself] pledged allegiance because by this both of them shall present themselves for execution. (Bukhari: No. 6830)</p>

<p>Sorry for the late answer, i have been doing other things IRL. Some anon is adding strongly pov material, so if you are looking at the article, make sure you are not looking at some pov version.</p>
<p>ITAQALLAH argued that we should not interpret primary sources, and i agree 100%. Problem is, the article is not trying to interpret anything. ITAQALLAH said <i>"sometimes you can use primary sources when there are extremely explicit"</i>. I argue that the following qualifies as "extremely explicit":</p>
<ol>
<li><i><b>She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet</b>. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect 'Ali much, but <b>after her death, 'Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude</b> towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. '<b>Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death).</b> <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.546" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.546" rel="nofollow">5:59:546</a></i></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. <b>She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger</b> of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. 'Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, 'All received (special) regard from the people. <b>After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him.</b> So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. <b>He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months</b><a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Muslim_6c10.html" title="Sahih Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4352" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/019.smt.html#019.4352" rel="nofollow">19:4352</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You do not get any more explicit than that, there is no interpretation needed in this issue, Bukhari and Muslim are crystal clear when they state that Ali did not give baya for six month. And the article is not quoting hadith, Gibbon , a noted scholar, is also quote, and he is not the least ambigous regarding the rest of Ali's tribe, the Banu Hashim:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>After the simple inauguration of Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle.<a href="http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap50.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume2/chap50.htm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>But in either way, the article does not try to pin point how long the whit holding was, it faithfully presents the sources that are available, it gives dates when they do and omits dates when they do. When a source only states that the subject only withhold for a period, but does not specify the period, it does not make the withholding any less notable. Ie, if the source does not state for how long, it is not our job to try to guess how long, we only report what the source states.</p>
<p>Also, we are not here to determine what sources are sound or not. If other relevant sources exist, then of course do they need to be presented, but that does not make the other sources any less relevant.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>"did all personalities mentioned resist for six months? nobody is denying that a pledge may have been temporarily withheld, but for how long? "</i>, that is irrelevant. We report a timespan when there is one, and do not report one when there is not one. Lack of timespan does not make the subject any less notable. There is not problem with verification here, there is no un-verified information present in the article, every single part is sourced.</p>
<p>And im sure that nobody would argue that the question of how many people did not give the baya in the most crucial event in the Islamic history is irrelevant or non-notable.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>"Well, this is a controversial topic, but I would like to point out that we should not miss the point that in these disputes the main concern of the early Sahaba should have been Islam rather than desire for wealth or power."</i>. I don't understand this, what does their motivation has to do with anything, we are not here to guess or do original research.</p>
<p>And this is most certanly not a pov fork, stating that something is a povfork is a bad faith statement, accusing me of creating this to do dodge consensus. I most certanly did not do that, at most, this is a content fork, and it is not even that, since this information is not covered in any other article. Further, the article is a apart of the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> series and it is way to detailed to be included in the main article. Im sure nobody that surprised is by the fact that the Succession to Muhammad can not be described in full depth in one single article.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 16:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I spoke on this, because I have seen a history of POV-pushing in Islam related articles before, and I think all can agree those exist: <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_c5f9.html" title="Third holiest site in Islam">Third holiest site in Islam</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reforms_under_Islam_%28610-661%29_7678.html" title="Reforms under Islam (610-661)">Reforms under Islam (610-661)</a>, just to name a few. Please please please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a> - it was not a bad faith statement.

This, unsurprisingly, should lead me to the idea that it may be a POV fork. I would probably speak out, at this stage, in favor of keep, but I see absolutely no evidence at compromise on including the Sunni POV that this list is bogus (clearly, neither side appears to be have accomodated at all: - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sahaba_not_giving_bay%27ah_to_Abu_Bakr&amp;diff=101194206&amp;oldid=101136035" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sahaba_not_giving_bay%27ah_to_Abu_Bakr&amp;diff=101194206&amp;oldid=101136035" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, and no talk page discussion). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 11:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This was written by a friend of mine, who I'm teaching how to use Wikipedia -- it was his first edit of any kind, and wasn't "rejected in other articles" (you should look through histories before you make claims like that); he was going to add it to <a href="../../../v/a/j/Vajrayana.html" title="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a>, but I thought it was too long for that and suggested he make it into its own article. As far as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, he's cited a few texts, as far as I can tell, but I'll see if he can add some more references. <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> <small><b>(</b> <a href="../../../t/l/o/User_talk%7ETlogmer_36b4.html" title="User talk:Tlogmer">talk</a> <b>/</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tlogmer_cc7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tlogmer">contributions</a> <b>)</b></small> 18:21, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I suggested the merge because the second paragraph could be deleted entirely, as it's the origins of tantric buddhism and would therefore already be explained in the article it would merge to. I think that a section in the tantric buddhism article entitled "Intoxicant use in Tantric Buddhism" with two subsections: "Pre-Existing Use of "Divine Intoxicants" in the Hindu Tradition" and "Internal and External drugs" would be good and it wouldn't terribly overburden the article it's moving to. <a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V.">.V.</a> <i>(<a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">talk</a>)</i> 19:14, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - the whole premise of the article is factually incorrect. There is no documented use of intoxicants besides alcohol in Vajrayana. The sources given do not say that there is. It appears that this editor is attempting to "read between the lines" and create a use of intoxicants out of thin air. The "nectar pills" used in Tibetan Buddhism are herbal and medicinal. I have had the opportunity to take some myself, and it was in no way intoxicating. What is required here is a citation to a source which <i>directly</i> discusses the issue. I either have or have read all the books listed, and none of them does this. This is OR, pure and simple, and bad OR at that. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 15:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>-Web Notability does not apply because it is a teaching organization. Never mind, TEFLWatch has been approached for information on several occassions in the past about situations for TEFL teachers.</p>

<p>-Trying to hide the organization would be a disservice to thousands of teachers worldwide and would be considered a victory by schools that are taking advantage of teachers.</p>
<p>-It is linked to by other articles on wikipedia and is pertinent to</p>
<p>-Wikipedia is a general interest online encyclopedia, not an specific interest encylopedia.</p>
<p>-TEFLWatch's website has the most page views and vistors of ANY similar site.</p>

<p>For teachers who are very concerned about this, you may want to be fully transparent as to why you want to delete the article.</p>

<ol>
<li>first invite discussion on the talk page if you are at all unsure as to the article's worth. Just because you haven't heard of it, doesn't mean it's not notable!</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Don't know what tags you use to vote to keep it, but I vote to keep it. It is well known in its area, but I agree they need to show it is notable. Maybe you can help teflteacher by telling him exactly. Another question is why notability was never raised in the Talk Page for the article? It seems like that would have been a better place to start then putting up a 5 day deadline. In fact, I thought that was how it was supposed to proceed and before you look at how many edits I have, I only have a few on my username. I usually don't log in to make edits.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> --I started the article because I thought if three wikipedia articles had references to the organization that it needed to have its own article. Frankly, it's not notable outside of the TEFL community, but in the TEFL community, it is known. Frankly, it can stay or go and I am not bothered in the least. Let's look at two scenarios. It stays, people wondering about the organization are able to visit the article within Wikipedia and find information on exactly what it is about or the second scenario, in those articles, a direct link to TEFLWatch can be made and people visit the site directly to find out more about it. I think offering a non-biased place is better, but in the end, wikipedia admins will make the call, as they should. I, like two others on this page, am curious why issues hadn't been brought up in the talk page first. I know when I edit a page, my first instinct is to put something in the talk page before I would ever think of tagging it for deletion.</li>

<ul>
<li>I feel strongly that notability within a small community of interest is just as worthy as notability in a large one. I believe we should have articles on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_chromodynamics.html" title="Quantum chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Arne_afea.html" title="Thomas Arne">Thomas Arne</a> even though the vast mass of the world population has never heard of them. I've taken a look at the TEFLWatch site, and wasn't impressed by their approach to ratings, which seems to me to be very weak - if I were a teacher I would take the site with a very large grain of salt - but it certainly exists and seems to score well in google-hittage. I'm inclined to say that the article passes the notability barrier, and I believe that adequate references/sources can be found ( although current referencing is rather weak ). Where I do feel uncomforable is with the tone of the article: strictly speaking, much of what TEFLWatch provides is opinion, not information. This needs to be made clear, ideally by finding a reference that points out the site's weaknesses, and incorporating the appropriate points into this article. I think that at present the article appears superficially NPOV ( and it is clear that the writers have tried to be NPOV ), but is at risk of conveying the view that the site itself acts in an NPOV way, which ( because of its rating methodology ) it can't do. Subject to this being made clear, I'm inclined to say <b>Keep</b>, though with a re-write where appropriate. If my concerns here are not clear, please feel free to get in touch with me, and I'll try to explain further. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is just one person's perspective (mine), but the first I've ever heard of TEFLWatch is through Wikipedia. There are numerous online watchdogs for the TEFL community (as an EFL teacher of three years I am acutely aware of a number of them), and none of them are notable enough to warrant their own pages. In fact, if we were to lower the requirements for notability, there are one or two watchdog groups that deserve their own pages before this website. Content-wise, TEFLWatch is nothing resembling a comprehensive website concerning the TEFL community, which is a criterion for notability if I could add it as one. In addition, a close look at this page and I can't find a way to edit it to make it not look like an advertisement to the site. On the flipside, I try to keep an eye out for anything TEFL-related on Wikipedia that sounds like shameless plugging for the big businesses in this community, and I don't think it's out of line to insist for the same when it comes to their watchdogs. Furthermore, if this is strictly an advocacy issue for those who prefer to keep the page, there are a number of concept pages (i.e. <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cram_school.html" title="Cram school">cram school</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_school.html" title="Language school">language school</a>) that could do with an external link to the website, or better yet, more details about the state of teaching English abroad. Certainly the "Problems" section of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaching_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_d864.html" title="Teaching English as a Foreign Language">Teaching English as a Foreign Language</a> could be better served with greater elaboration than what is already there. Just having a page out exclusively about the website TEFLWatch does not further the cause of EFL teachers, if it concerns you as much as it concerns me. <a href="../../../r/o/e/User%7ERoehl_Sybing_69e0.html" title="User:Roehl Sybing">Roehl Sybing</a> 03:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>IMDb has been shaky in reporting whether or not a film had entered pre-production or not, as well as peculiar additions to the cast list and defined release years where there has been no such thing. However, I've never had an issue with IMDb confirming whether a film had been completed or not. Besides, on the official site, you can see footage of the film, so it's not like the project never happened. Even if it's not "completed", work has definitely been done on it, which is more than I can say for some crystal balling film articles. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 17:45, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Film is coming out this year.</i> Even if that is correct (which there is no way to verify, as it has not yet happened), how is that a justification for keeping the article? This is not a rhetorical question. If a product has not yet been released, there is no way to verify anything about it. Any available information is based solely on press releases. Is it appropriate for Wikipedia to be a marketing venue? If so, then so, but it was my understanding that Wikipedia articles were not to be used for advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The film has sources that seem to verify not only its existence but that it has started and finished production.

<li>I did voice my concerns: the film has not been released, thus there is no subject for the article, thus the article is either fancruft or mere advertising, and should be deleted. There is no question of "improving" the article, because there is nothing to write an article about. That's my opinion. If it turns out that the Wikipedia community is fine with using articles as advertising for products which have not yet been released, then I will know not to recommend such articles for deletion in the future, and no harm will have been done. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></sup> • 2007-01-14 01:41Z
<ul>
<li>I don't understand your opinion; are you suggesting that the creation of film articles should be held off until after the films' release, or are you suggesting that the article for <i>Highlander: The Source</i> was created for promotional purposes? For the former, I've found plenty of objective information for upcoming films (<i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> is an extensive example). For the latter, there would usually be opinion in creating articles for films before they come out. That doesn't make their creations wrong; if the content of these articles are disputable, then the tone of the content can be adjusted for appropriate readability. Obviously, press releases try to make the film exciting, but it's a matter of boiling the information down to its essence to be objective and succinctly informative. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 01:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I have not been clear. I am suggesting both. Wikipedia is ostensibly an encyclopedia, not a fan club home page, a tabloid, or a venue for press releases for "Coming Soon" attractions. At least, that's what I thought. I could be wrong. -- <a href="../../../b/b/l/User%7EBblackmoor_49d5.html" title="User:Bblackmoor">BBlackmoor</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/b/l/User_talk%7EBblackmoor_cd2b.html" title="User talk:Bblackmoor">(talk)</a></sup> • 2007-01-14 18:46Z
<ul>
<li>There are many articles on topics on Wikipedia that wouldn't exist in your father's encyclopedia. For articles about upcoming films, I think adherance to Wikipedia's policy of a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> helps preserve their integrity. There is information that does come out prior to release, and I think it's easier to build up information in bits by creating the film articles when production is underway. I mentioned <i>Spider-Man 3</i> -- one of my favorite bits of information is how they used a congenital amputee boxer for the illusion of punching through the chest. I don't know if we would have been able to dig that up after the film's release, as there is a <i>lot</i> of nonsensical coverage of <i>SM3</i>. I don't think that <i>Highlander: The Source</i> was in good shape when you initially put it up for AfD, but honestly, part of my reason for the improvement afterward was to show you that it <i>could</i> be improved, even though I have little interest in seeing it. Information like the film originally having the title <i>The Journey Continues</i> isn't promotional; it leans more toward the encyclopedic purpose, even though the film is not going to be some kind of <i>Schindler's List</i> (maybe it will, but it's doubtful). —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 21:53, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I agree the synopsis is not officially verifiable yet, but the page should stay, and the cast is verified. Ocnomad 13:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe I missed something, but I don't see why this would be speedy. Apparently <a href="../../../r/a/w/Rawalakot.html" title="Rawalakot">Rawalakot</a> is a province in Pakistan, (whether it belongs to Pakistan or not is debatable, but no point in going into that). So Rawalakotis are (I'd assume) the people residing therein. That would mean that this article, if properly named something like List of notable Rawalakotis, would be roughly like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Calgarians_bcdf.html" title="List of notable Calgarians">List of notable Calgarians</a>. And, indeed, it seems to be made up largely of names of (arguably) notable people from that province. That's not to say that it should be kept, of course - just that I'm not sure why we would speedy it. It's badly formed and badly named, but there is more to it than pure nonsense. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> He is the key figure in a major news story that has garnered daily national coverage since it began. It's hardly "just another abduction," as some of you have (somewhat coldly) stated.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> This is an extremely relevant case that will intrigue many in years to come. The rarity and unusualness of a 4 1/2 year kidnapping are undeniable. As a psychologist, I have a special scholarly interest in Shawn Hornbeck, clearly this boy may have suffered from an extraordinary case of Stockholm Syndrome similar to that of Elizabeth Smart who was held captive for 9 months. Also his kidnapper Michael Devlin, should have a linked but still separate page. Also I'm sure as information comes out about the tactics Devlin used to terrorize Shawn, and what he endured during his captivity, there will be much more to add to his page. Also for all everyone saying this boy is just out for 15 minutes of fame, 4 1/2 years of captivity with a man who probably did god knows what to him is never something someone would do for attention. I think that's a horrible suggestion.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - Was held captive for four years. If you want an AfD, try the other kid who was kept for two weeks or something like that. --<a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 17:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Not my goal to AFD.

<p><b>Keep</b> - <i>"Does not seem notable"</i>?!?!? How can a normal person think that this case is not notable. A child goes missing for over four years, in a situation where most kids are murdered, and he is miraculously found alive!?! What are you thinking?!?!

<p><b>Keep</b> - I agree that because of the rare nature of the discovery following such a significant amount of time after the kidnapping, this article should be kept. The article could be greatly revised and expanded, but it should be included. Nicastpj 17:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. No indication of <i>encyclopedic</i> notability. Wikipedia is not a news report archive or a news service (that's Wikinews, a totally separate project) or a record of crime victims. News notability is not the same as encyclopedic notability. Encyclopedias are not news record archives. If the foundation created in the victim's name could be shown to have developed into a substantive, long-term organization, I would probably support a move to an article about that foundation. But of time of writing, the foundation website is down, and its unclear to me how significant this organization is. If there is evidence that this case had a broader substantive cultural or legal impact, I'll reconsider my&#160;!vote. Personally, I believe that the widespread conflation of Wikipedia's mission as an encyclopedia with its use as a news and magazine article archive is the most underestimated/underconsidered urgent problem facing the project (and its sister project, Wikinews). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:31, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b> wikipedia isn't entirely for encyclopedic notability, think of all the actresses and actors on here. Shawn should be on here for the same reasons as Holloway and Smart, and then some. There is some "encyclopedic" notability in here however, it will be interesting to learn why his captivity went on for as long as it did. This is not so much a news article as it is an investigation into an extremely unusual kidnapping.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> - I am in concurrence with Bwithh above. I am beginning to see the need for differentiating between Wikipedia and Wikinews. There's not much more to this boy (and I'm not downplaying the tragedy) than the fact that he was kidnapped and found years later. The brevity of the article demonstrates this. I do believe information like this should be available via the internet, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_kidnappings.html" title="List of kidnappings">here</a>, but the proper place is Wikinews until this story can demonstrate long-term and lasting notability.

<dd>In regards crime victims, generally I look to see if either the case has created a change in law, had a substantial cultural influence, or there has been a significant book, film, play etc. about the case or the case has attracted <i>sustained</i>, <i>substantial</i> national media attention. The Elizabeth Smart case seems to pass these criteria. The Hornbeck case, I don't think so at the moment. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Elizabeth Smart has an article because she made international headlines..for about..a year. She also had a tv movie, and a bunch of other stuff related to her. That's why she gets an article. Shawn Hornbeck and Ben Ornby and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_J._Devlin_a8b0.html" title="Michael J. Devlin">Michael J. Devlin</a> should all probably be merged into an article about the kidnapping, if anything. (If Shawn's get deleted, Ben's should probably go as well. At least Shawn's article has sources, and all that wikijazz). I'm not going to properly vote keep, or delete, but I strongly oppose the comparison to Elizabeth Smart, and Natalie Holloway. There's no way these guys are anyway more notable, no offense. I think the story is sad and all, and glad they're okay, but still. Just because you feel bad for them, and are interested in the story, and because they made national (not international like E.Smart's and N.Holloway's) headlines for a week doesn't make them that notable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBlueFlamingo_4a4b.html" title="User:TheBlueFlamingo"><font face="Verdana"><font color="SteelBlue">theblueflamingo</font></font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheBlueFlamingo_0d80.html" title="User talk:TheBlueFlamingo">Speak</a></sup> 09:19, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> 1. They have made international news. Google news turns up hits from the UK, at least. 2.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a person who could become a crucial witness during the current investigation of the kidnapping suspect.

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not wikinews, neither is it a crystal ball so arguing on possible future notability is moot. Is this person newsworthy? Sure. Is he encyclopedic? I don't belive so. I concur with Bwithh, in that that wikipedias purpose as an <i>encyclopedia</i> is being hurt by using it as a news outlet, tracking breaking news without regard to its historical relavance, for the simple reason that we cannot always judge historical impact until some time has passed, and putting everything that splashed on the front pages into wikipedia is counter to wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">basic policies</a> of not being a source of indiscriminate information/news outlet/memorial. When an event is current, it always appears more notable, which is why I belive the best thing to do in cases like this is <a href="../../../d/u/s/WP%7EDUST_e3db.html" title="WP:DUST">let the dust settle</a> before creating an article on someone - all living people too, so don't forget <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, most notably the "write conservatively" phrase. However, I have also found that if an article does get created, it is better to wait a short time before nominating it for afd, because, as the above debate shows, insults seem to fly becuase current events can inspire heated debate.

<p><b>Delete</b> An eleven year old boy is kidnapped and goes missing for four and a half years, and is presumed dead. Instead it turns out that he is still alive and happened to be within reach of his family. He probably suffered rare psychological trauma and abuse during his captivity.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Acknowledged he is in the public eye, but this is not encyclopedic. Unfortunately, kidnapping occurs all over the world, and it just so happened that this one boy landed in the public eye simply because of the length of his captor's hold on him. Please get rid of this article; this kid already has his name in the press- and if it's exposed that he's been molested or raped- it simply is not right to throw his name on some wiki article for the whole world to see. You want encyclopedic? Write about the trial of Michael Devlin, just don't exacerbate the emotional state of this boy! Consider this, in a few years after this has all blown over- people will hopefully remember the perpetrator, not the victimized, and Wikipedia should not be used as a proxy to expose victimized minors to the whole of society. The fact that were even considering posting the name of a potentially victimized minor is disgusting, and I was hoping that Wikipedia held itself to a higher standard. I agree with several posters- it's a current events news article- not an encyclopedic event. It's sad that were even considering leaving this up; imagine 15 years from now being Hornbeck (if he had been victimized) and having a Wikipedia article screaming: HEY I WAS RAPPED! Don't do this to a child...--71.194.128.49 08:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>71.194.128.49, you've been here a month and made valuable contributions to the project.

To assert that deletion is warranted based on speculation that Hornbeck is a <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> victim would set a dangerous precedent of removing content based on supposition about what the subject of the article would think of it, or about what we may later find out.

<p>I had <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">prodded</a> this article before. The day after it was deleted it was remade.

It's a hopeless stub, there's no guarantee the product is going to be a permanent part of the menu, and it has not achieved iconic status like the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Mac_9141.html" title="Big Mac">Big Mac</a> which could justify an article.

None of those three articles are really fleshed-out enough to stand on their own, but merging them into one page (after some cleanup) and adding similar short sections about other notable DQ items seems like it would make an informative page without making the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dairy_Queen_6448.html" title="Dairy Queen">Dairy Queen</a> main article too big. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 20:14, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> if there is consensus to merge I'm more than happy to do it for Moolatte and the other items Elkman mentioned. I wanted to delete this article because I'm opposed on principle to the idea of having an encyclopedia entry for a random item off a fast food menu, but in retrospect a merge &amp; redirect is probably better because it will make it less likely someone will recreate the article. <a href="../../../t/o/c/User%7ETocharianne_4249.html" title="User:Tocharianne">Tocharianne</a> 14:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Because this single <b>absolutely did not reach #2</b> on Billboard's R&amp;B chart. I'm quite confused why somebody is under the impression that it did. It actually reached the illustrious position of #70. It <i>may</i> at some point merit an article, but for now I think everything about it can be covered in the article about its artist, should that ever exist. See, for example, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_and_Michael_dae7.html" title="Brian and Michael">Brian and Michael</a>, which covers all the info on "Matchstalk Men &amp; Matchstalk Cats &amp; Dogs (Lowry's Song)," because it simply doesn't make sense to split it out yet, although that song is obviously notable (UK #1 single). Anyway, this tune is very borderline as far as its notability, and I don't think it really merits an article at this time. GassyGuy 05:53, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please see the link above regarding its chart history for the confusion. It doesn't quite match with Billboard's history <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&amp;model.vnuArtistId=182172&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=276354" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&amp;model.vnuArtistId=182172&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=276354" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, but it still charted on <i>two</i> charts, making it quite notable in its own right. Also, "Matchstalk Men" should probably be split out. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 05:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, Hot Rap Singles at that time was just a list of the (thirty? I can't recall the number) highest-charting rap tracks on the R&amp;B Single Sales chart, so while I agree that that's two charts, I disagree that that somehow adds to the significance. GassyGuy 06:05, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> I was surprised that this space wasn't taken by or linked to the notable Cyberpunk novel of the same name... looks like I have a new project. As it is, pure dictionary definition, but I think it might be able to be more, it's a common metaphor (IE for any unchangable behavior, I've heard it used in the context of behavioral science (in terms of 'hardwired reflexes') and it's a common technique/feature in computer science. I would like to note that though I may well be considered a deletionist I'm somewhat bothered by a common theme lately that sees articles put up for deletion based on the quality of the article, not the quality/notability/verifability of the <b>subject</b> of the article. In my opinion this is a notable concept and should be expanded not deleted. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>keep/transfer to wiktionary</b>, this is certainly a relevant term in computer/electric engineering. But I agree, the notability is not asserted, and there are no enough content yet.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> In 1913, in Kingdom of Serbia was conducted an enumeration of population in military purposes. At that point it was determined that in the area today considered as Kosovo and Metohia, an overall count of population was 497.455.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next official demographic enumeration in Kingdom of SHS was conducted after the World War I, in 1921 (on Jan, 31st). Then it was determined that total overall count of population at todays Kosovo and Metohia is 439.010. (Source: Ethnic and Demographic Processes on Kosovo and Metohia, Prof. M. Radovanovic, LiberPress, Belgrade, 2004. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 86-7556-018-4</a>)</p>
<p>According to the article during this period 350.000 Kosovo Albanians were killed. Documented period from 1913 to 1921 doesn’t cover three year period from 1910 to 1913 in which territory of Kosovo and Metohija was under Ottoman rule and Kingdom of Serbia was heavily engaged in two Balkan wars. This claim is even more appsurd if we take in consideration that whole army of Kingdom of Serbia numbered approximately 350.000 soldiers (including so called Third Call, men sixty and more years old).</p>
<p>One more question: which soldiers or better whose soldiers are numbered in table that represent list of massacres in this period? Kosovo and Metohija didn’t have its own army since it never existed as independent state. Are we talking about Albanian soldiers in Turkish army and latter in Wermacht and Wafen-SS? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarko_M_7cf8.html" title="User:Marko M">Marko M</a> 21:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This article contains information about one of the schools in Nepal. The information that the author of the article has provided is true indeed. Therefore I see no reason for the deletion of the article. Hence I would like to recommend the committee to <b>Keep</b> the article. (<i>by User:202.161.131.76</i>)</li>

<p>This article was speedy deleted as a biography which did not assert the importance or significance of the subject. It was then re-created twice in quick succession, in a substantially similar form. After the third deletion, I protected the page. I have now recieved two messages on my talk page, which are copied below for convenience (contact details removed):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not an administrator and I will seek that you be banned for deleting Nysted.<br />
Lee Nysted, Owner; Managing Partner NystedMusic, LLC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My page has been the subject of vandals.<br />
Please re-submit the following on Lee Nysted and ban the user that keeps changing my stats.<br />
I have been in the music business for 30 years, playing for 40.<br />
The obvious links to the name Lee Nysted can be traced back to Google or even Wikipedia.<br />
Whoever has "protected" the page should be verified. If it is Chris_73, then that person should be aware that my company will pursue this issue until resolved.<br />
Lee Nysted, Owner; Managing Partner NystedMusic, LLC.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usernames of the users who left these two messages match those of the two users who created and re-created the article. The article thus appears to go against <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> as well as having the notability assertion problems mentioned earlier. In reponse to the requests made in the message above, I have decided to re-create the most neutral version of the article and list it here; hopefully this will eliminate any desire for anyone to have anyone else banned, while demonstrating consensus to either keep or remove the article – <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_e84c.html" title="User:Gurch">Gurch</a> 19:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable. "Levi Meir Clancy" (with quotes) gets approximately <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Cl8&amp;q=%22Levi+Meir+Clancy%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=Cl8&amp;q=%22Levi+Meir+Clancy%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">100 Google hits</a>, many of them mirrors of the Wikipedia page (or of other Wikipedia pages where his name has been inserted), and many others pages unrelated to the Levi Meir Clancy of the article. The sole notable thing about Clancy seems to be that his mother filed a lawsuit in California to get the state to pay for his college education. However, there are barely any online references to the lawsuit, aside from a handful of news articles. Nothin that strikes me as meriting Clancy's inclusion in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>He does not appear to pass the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability guidelines: he's not a notable public figure, and there are very few actual references to him I could find. Finally, I'll note that many of the edits to the page were made by a user (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/76.169.227.207" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/76.169.227.207" rel="nofollow">76.169.227.207</a>) whose other edits include inserting references to Levi Meir Clancy in articles where it was blatantly irrelevant. "Another" user has done the same thing (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/O1no1ne" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/O1no1ne" rel="nofollow">O1no1ne</a>), although they don't seem to have edited the actual Levi Meir Clancy page itself. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 19:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(co-nominating) I prod'd this without realizing that David has already prod'd it as well. This seems more like a fandom-y debate than a scholarly debate. Sexism among Lewis's human characters has already been addressed, but I've never heard anything much about creatures -- besides, he had the power to make up their reproductive capabilites if needed. The argument doesn't seem to hold too much merit anyway -- we may have seen only one gender of each creature but not the other. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">☑t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">☛c</a> || 20:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. This is a very odd article, without any references in the text save to the web-page of Zirnevis itself, which is entirely in arabic script but appears to be a commercial site for selling this group(?)'s products. (By the admission of the article, by the way, these products are in infringement of international law). The group's alleged popularity amongst Iranians has no suuporting evidence. The article is an orphan not linking into any other Wikipedia article. An external link has been given to a pop song dubbed in Farsi - without any indication whether this dubbing has been done by the group Zirnevis or not. Googling shows that apart to references derived from Wikipedia, internet links are to commercial products of Zirnevis. Reasons for deletion could therefore include:</p>
<ul>
<li>unreferenced article</li>
<li>commercial plug without encyclopaedic reference</li>
<li>non-notable subject (orphan in Wikipedia)</li>

<p>(Zirnevis web site is not in "Arabic" script; it is in Persian.)

I'm surprised the article has lasted this long. One might be made notable through press coverage resulting from their appearance on a game show, but not simply by appearing on it or else we would have an article for every game show contestant which is simply not encyclopedic. For instance, many contestants on the show American Idol have become famous yet did not win. This is not the case here. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 20:56, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Strothra implies that it is obvious to someone familiar with the relevant policies and guidelines that this article's subject is non-notable. I don't see that at all. I'm not a game show aficionado myself, and found this article through <s><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Director_41c6.html" title="User:Red Director">Red Director</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Red_Director_b5a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Red Director">contribution history</a></s> <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Director_Pages_I_have_created_156d.html" title="User:Red Director/Pages I have created">User:Red Director/Pages I have created</a>, but it is clear to me from the claims of record-setting in this article itself, and in the article on the television program <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greed_%28game_show%29.html" title="Greed (game show)">Greed</a>, that she would be considered notable by game show aficionados. I believe it would be highly controversial to start deleting articles on "trivia" about baseball, <i>Star Trek</i>, or Tolkien's fiction, however lacking in interest they might be to those not part of the relevant fandom. I am a new user and could be wrong about this, but I believe the subject deserves more discussion than Strothra's dismissive comments would imply, especially in light of the lack of clarity of the notability guidelines themselves. Perhaps Strothra would like to write a proposed guideline on "fandom" articles, including game show fandom, or point me to such a guideline if it already exists? —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromath_ffc9.html" title="User:Neuromath">Neuromath</a> 23:14, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, that would be controversial. That's why I didn't do it. I nominated this article, not articles about triva regarding baseball, etc. No notability of these individuals among "game-show aficionados" is established in the articles. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 03:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A related point: the episode you refer to is famous enough that print sources that mention it are likely to exist, even if they can't be found on Google.

Rather than deleting this article along with its page history and its uncontroversial factual assertions, it would be more constructive to leave it in place with "needs to cite" tags. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromath_ffc9.html" title="User:Neuromath">Neuromath</a> 07:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not a claim of fact, it is a value judgment. Since I am not making this claim myself, evidence for or against it is not relevant. I am reporting the fact that Game Show NewsNet (GSNN) has made this claim, in order to demonstrate notability of the individuals involved. Since the fact that GSNN has made such a claim is not in dispute, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is not relevant. Please keep in mind that we are discussing whether Daniel Avila is notable—not whether the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Avila_dc1b.html" title="Daniel Avila">Daniel Avila</a> should assert that he took part in the greatest moment in game show history. The fact that such a claim has been made by a fan site (not "page") is evidence that the three individuals in question are notable among game show fans. GSNN says on its <a href="http://www.gameshownewsnet.com/inside.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gameshownewsnet.com/inside.html" rel="nofollow">masthead</a> that it <i>began</i> as a fan page, not that it is just a page at present.

The latter states in its opening paragraph, "Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed." I don't see a single controversial factual claim in any of the three articles you have nominated for deletion; the whole question is about significance ("Who cares?"), not reliability ("Is it true?"). The opinions of fan sites are relevant to judgments of significance, regardless of the reliability of their assertions about matters of fact. As to numbers of sources: I found at least one other relevant source in my Google search on "Melissa Skirboll" (a list of people who have won over $100,000 on game shows), and I only looked at a few pages of hits; GSNN was just an example. I didn't look more closely because my interest is not in game shows, but in avoiding the setting of unfortunate precedents for deleting Wikipedia pages. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromath_ffc9.html" title="User:Neuromath">Neuromath</a> 05:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> In the Time article cited above, Avila is the first person discussed and is the subject of 118 words. In the second reference, he receives a 133 word coverage. These are far from a trivial or passing reference, and thus meet the requirements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Per ongoing discussion at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)</a> The "primary subject" requirement cited by Strothra should not be interpreted as "the only subject" or "the sole focus." The intention is to require that the person be <b>a subject</b> of the article, and not, say, a witness to a news event who is merely given a passing mention and could as easily be replaced by someone else, or a brief mention in a directory. He was "the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself." " journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it." In the third cite above, the USC Daily Trojan, he was the sole subject of a 702 word article. The link above did not work but this one should: <a href="http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/paper679/previousarchive/V138/N58/01-photo.58c.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/paper679/previousarchive/V138/N58/01-photo.58c.shtml" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> The first two count as multiple, and they are verifiable and independent, as well as being mainstream news publications of wide circulation. The campus paper is not automatically excluded as a reliable source, per discussions at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and should be judged on its merits. This paper has an independent editorial board, print circulation of 9,000 and is one of the top 10 widely read campus papers online, and has been published since 1912.

<p><b>Delete</b> non notable individual per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Generic game show contestants are hardly encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Of all game show contestant articles to delete, why this one? Curtis not only had success on Greed, but other game shows as well. Many other articles just contain winners who have only had one successful appearance on a game show. Curtis, unlike them, has made a name for himself in the game show world. The episode of Greed Curtis was on was a memorable one for all game show experts.

I told him I'd provide more, and whilst putting this further edit together, Chris decided to nominate the article for deletion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sister_Spit&amp;diff=100510905&amp;oldid=100506239" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sister_Spit&amp;diff=100510905&amp;oldid=100506239" rel="nofollow">[46]</a>), a whole sixteen(!) minutes after I told him I was in the process of finding and adding more references (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chris_73&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100507435" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chris_73&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=100507435" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>).

<li>There were more than 4 hours between the first notability tag and this AfD. After you removed the notability tag you stated that there are enough refs for its notability, which were exactly two refs that IMHO did not satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and the mentioning of only one album. Finally, after I asked you about a possible AfD prior to the AfD, you told me to do what I think is right. Anyway, with the current refs it is likely that the article will survive AfD, even though many refs link only to the discs for sale. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> | <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 21:57, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The sole smidgen of verifiable information the article desperately clings to is a domain name registration. There is no trademark registration.

<li>Actually, I was almost bang on for most of that article, and Dhuum did havea major part in the storyline of that chapter.

<li>The comments above about what "Wikipedia is not" contain links to official site policy. Your statements here have not linked to policies to defend keeping it, but instead only confirmed that it's opinion and conjecture at this point - which, if you read policy, you'll see is not what should be documented on Wikipedia. It <i>may</i> be the actual name - even then, the entire content of the article beyond the fact that the domain name has been registered is nothing but conjecture and guesswork. --67.168.14.198 15:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. WP is an encyclopedia, not a rumor mill or press venue. I'm pretty lenient about having articles about released commercial products, but articles about pre-released (and pre-announced) products are pushing it. I don't see what's wrong with just waiting until an official announcement is made before creating an article. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 17:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The press release was how the two preceding chapters were confirmed - before that it was just fan speculation.

<li><b>Comment</b> no one cares about verifying that the game, under this or that name, has been announced. The game itself has no existence, it has no non-trivial treatment in multiple reliable sources, it is an <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> black hole. The article arguably verifies in reliable sources that the game is coming out, and under the name provided, but that verification is irrelevant because the name of this article is not <i>speculation about Guild Wars Utopia</i>, which is what the sources verify; rather, the name of the article is just <i>Guild Wars Utopia</i>, and no information is provided on that actual subject.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 19:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: It says on the page it is not limited to one province, but attracts students from several countries.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've voted to delete dozens of other mun conference articles, but McMUN is one of the truly notable ones around. McMUN is one of the largest and most prestigious conferences around the world, attracting not only a large amount of delegates but also corporate sponsorships. Nonetheless, I recognize that there are verifiability issues -- most conferences are not picked up by news media. Perhaps there needs to be a notability standard drafted for model un conferences. I also think that personnel information should be removed pending a keep as per <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a>. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystache_ac31.html" title="User:Mystache">Mystache</a> 02:21, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Along with having an album, Drist has performed music for Guitar Hero, which is notable media. The guy also performed most of the stuff in the entire game since it's a bunch of covers.

<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with Voretus. Do a bit of research before you guys delete an up and coming band. Theyve only recently gotten publicity through GH and GH2, but produce their own stuff. <a href="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11584/11584823.html" class="external free" title="http://www.emusic.com/artist/11584/11584823.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.emusic.com/artist/11584/11584823.html</a> 3 albums TOTAL. You are free to listen to them there. This article should be UPDATED if anything, by someone who has the amount of time to dedicate to them. Not delete it because of their 'lack of publicity' or 'exposure'. It takes years for some bands to get out there, especially those producing their own stuff and being their own label.

<dd>Right, and when they get "out there", Wikipedia can have an article about them.

Granted, they arent HUGE numbers, but they have certianly fullfilled the requirement to get their own wiki page.

<dd>I'm not seeing where these sources are, and they're unlikely to be independent if they're on the band website. Any independent source that mentions them non-trivially will do. The fact they contributed songs to Guitar Hero doesn't really qualify on its own - the guidelines for inclusion are on <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. And unfortunately, Wikipedia can't be used as free advertising for the band - if they have little to no information about them online, then that's their fault. And trust me, their influence on the traffic of Wikipedia will be minimal. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 23:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Wikipedia guidelines, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is a criteria for the inclusion of an article in our encyclopedia. <i>A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other.</i> It is quite clear that these lists fail this criteria. Except for that, it should be noted that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_directory" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. Based on well, this argument, and some others, the highly relevant <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Livingston_Airline_Destinations_1b29.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Livingston Airline Destinations">AfD on Livingston Airline Destinations</a> resulted in a delete. Please, before submitting your thoughts here, read through the relevant discussion there.</p>
<p>In addition to the nominated page, I would like to batch-nominate <b>172 related articles</b>. Per instructions on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, I was to add a list of batch-nominated articles below using {{<a href="../../../l/a/_/Template%7ELa_6d37.html" title="Template:La">la</a>}}. However, the sheer size of that list - <b>172 entries</b> - prompts me to link it instead. You may view it <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_American_Airlines_destinations_Nominated_articles_2970.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Airlines destinations/Nominated articles">here</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, it contains <b>every article listed in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Category%7EAirline_destinations_a311.html" title="Category:Airline destinations">Category:Airline destinations</a></b> at the time of writing. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 23:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment Reply</b> - They inform the readers the places where an airline flies, which is pretty vital information when you think about it, just like airport articles contain large lists of the airlines located within the airport, as well as the destinations flown by those airlines from that airport, a reader would want to what destinations an individual airline flies to. The reason we separate these into subarticles, however, is because they are most often very large and won't fit well within the airline's article itself, thus, these are actually just subarticles attached to the airline articles (just like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_victims_of_the_Columbine_High_School_massacre_3a80.html" title="List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre">List of victims of the Columbine High School massacre</a> is attached to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>). It's the same basic information as that list there, just like people want to know who died in that massacre, and people would also like to know where an airline flies to, it gives a better perspective on the airline's goals and achievements. Most of all however, these lists are important information from a main article which doesn't fit in it so, something that exists ALL OVER WIKIPEDIA, if you delete these, then we better get on deleting all of those, too. -- <a href="../../../s/m/t/User%7ESmthManly_78cd.html" title="User:SmthManly"><font color="black">SmthManly</font></a> / <sup><a href="../../../s/m/t/User_talk%7ESmthManly_fa27.html" title="User talk:SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyTalk</font></a></sup> / <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SmthManly_7bda.html" title="Special:Contributions/SmthManly"><font color="blue">ManlyContribs</font></a></sup> 07:43, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

Even though I live on the other side of the world I am unable to comprehend how one can compare a list of murder victims in a highly publicized massacre shown in the news ALL OVER THE WORLD - with a list of trivial airline destinations. The list of Columbine victims is not trivial, it is certainly of encyclopedic value and most definitely passes all notability/verifiability/etc guidelines you could think of.<br />
Now, compare that to a <i>list of destinations of an airline</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, the list of victims of Columbine isn't any more "encyclopedic" than a list of airline destinations. Obviously the event itself deserves an article, but the fact that it was a horrible event doesn't mean it should receive special treatment when it comes to a list of victims. Should we create a list of every single victim of the Holocaust? I don't think anyone will argue that it was less significant than the Columbine massacre. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 20:17, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, you group AfD&#160;!voters in a highly unfair way. I would certainly not defend the inclusion of non-notable high schools (in fact I'd do my best to get even my own deleted), and if I did, I would CERTAINLY not do so <i>to death</i>.<br />

But that said, given that there is a) precedent to have it exist due to interest, b) precedent demonstrated by other Wikis to take more narrow subject matter off of WP (see, for instance, Wikia), and c) plans to create a transit Wiki sitting on my desk at home, would there be interest in including such information within such a realm? --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indiscriminate in the sense that the list adds not enough value and the items linked have no relation with the list as such.

What else is an airline supposed to do, then, besides transporting people and goods from point A to point B? You contend that articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_dd89.html" title="List of Presidents of the United States">List of Presidents of the United States</a> allows you to "learn more about the subject <i>of the list</i>". In what way does a list of continents, regions, countries, cities, and airports an airline flies to fail to allow you to learn more about the market reach and geographical extent of an airline's transport services? Clicking on any of the airports listed usually shows the same airline listed in the airport's airline list, and allows you to compare this airline's market share with its competitors to and from this destination. Do you not learn more about the competition this airline is facing in this particular market? So in what way is the above an "indiscriminate collection of information"? As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I find it ironic that others are also demanding for these articles to be removed because they represent "dublicated" information from relevant sources. I am still wondering how possible it is for information to possess both qualities at the same time?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To reply to your last point first: the sources which give the information (from which it is duplicated) are primary sources , not secondary ones (the websites of the airline companies, to be precise). A good indication that this is not an encycloepdic list is that there are no sources given which give a historic overview of these destinations, only current lists (encycloepdic articles are supposed to be timeless, although of course new info can be added: but if we don't ahev any historcal info, how encycloepdic can it be?) As for your first point: I don't see how a list of what airlines come to what airport show the market these have (how often do they fly: what is the number of passengers? ...). And to clarify my comparison with other, useful lists again: when you click the link to any rpesident, you understand better what he did when he was president and so on. The subject of the list (presidents) is explained and clarified in every single listed subject. Teh subject of the list "XX destinations" is not clarified or expanded in the linked subjects though: I don't see why city YY or airport ZZ is a significant member of the list, beyond the fact (in the case of the airport) that, well, the list is correct. Big deal, this does not learn me anything. But let's agree that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> indiscriminate list is in this case perhaps too subjective, and let's focus on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>... 16:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise if I could not quite catch what you are trying to say in the first few lines. Primary as well as secondary sources <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research">may be used in wikipedia</a>. Just because the former is said to require additional care dosent mean it results in a case of non-Verifiability and a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If so, we will have to remove tonnes of information in wikipedia, many of which are actually based on primary sources. We even had individuals who insist on removing all sources except official ones in airline articles. Encyclopedias do not neccesary reflect "historical value", and in fact, wikipedia is often lauded for being able to update itself and reflect contemporary information faster than traditional mediums. I thus find it strange why you suggest anything devoid of "past information" is less encyclopedic. If so, are articles like <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Airlines_destinations_caff.html" title="Singapore Airlines destinations">Singapore Airlines destinations</a> "more encyclopedic" because it lists and details terminated destinations? And talking about "historical value", I actually had my efforts to include service commencement dates in these lists removed by members of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Airlines_7d52.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airlines">WikiProject Airlines</a>. Rather ironic, it seems. All the more so when you also asks why these lists do not include flight frequencies, number of passengers, etc. I once had such information deleted precisely for being a "discriminate collection of information" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_airline" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_airline" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_destination" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Huaiwei/Cold_Storage/Singapore_Changi_Airport_passenger_traffic_by_destination" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>. As for your presidential analogy, I beg to differ in opinion. So a click on a presidential's page tells you more about a particular president. Why should a click on an airport served by an airline not tell you more about that airport, and the airline serving it (as per the list of airlines and destinations I mentioned earlier)? Clicking on <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Heathrow_Airport_e5d1.html" title="London Heathrow Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> after noting its "hub" status from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_destinations_e375.html" title="British Airways destinations">British Airways destinations</a>, realising the airport is a major airhub as "the busiest airport in the world, based on international passenger transfers", and then noticing the airline flies to plenty of destinations from this airport, and is up against an entire slew of international airlines, many of which fly on the same routes as British Airways, would normally form quite a marked impression on someone wanting to know the kind of environment the airline is operating in, and to better understand the challenges and corporate decisions it makes. I learn plenty just by clicking on one airport link in that destination list, even if you dont.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b>, not encyclopaedic, and because this offers exactly the same information as the airlines, only with a greater-than-zero chance of it being out of date, downright useless. A lot of keep proponents in this discussion are making the mistake of using the "It's useful" defence, and "it's useful" is the reason why the <i>airlines</i> host this information.

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> From what I'm seeing, most of the people asking for these articles to be deleted are probably in no ways interested in the information anyway. There are many people who are interested, and just because you are not does not mean the articles should be deleted. One of the benefits of having such lists on Wikipedia is that they provide an organized listing for a good amount of airlines. One of the arguments by the Con side is that other websites, in this case airline websites, provide the same information. However this argument can easily be put towards a majority of the articles that are on Wikipedia, so I don't see why it can be used here unless the other articles are to be deleted for the same reason. In the case of airline destinations, most airline websites I've visited are very disorganized when it comes to having a list of their destinations, and unless you really know where to find the information beforehand it can be very irritating to find. Wikipedia is the answer to this trouble. And although it may not be quite up-to-date, it still gives a fairly accurate representation in an easy to use, easy to find place. <a href="../../../n/c/s/User%7ENcSchu_9fea.html" title="User:NcSchu">NcSchu</a> 14:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Normally when information is removed from an article to reduce the article's size, its notability is still based on the article it came from. While the goal is to keep each article notable, this will be easier to do with some. There is no issue with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> other then the amount of time needed to include references for each and every entry which is apparently what the delete voters are asking for. Just exactly what will be served by doubling the size of every one of these articles to provide these references? Exactly what value will they provide? Will anyone actually look at those references? If anything, trying to add those references would increase the workload so much that the lists would not be updated and become obsolete providing a reason to delete them. Also, main airlines do publish this information in their in flight magazines. Since these are closely watched by stock market analysts, any misinformation would be made know to the public so they can be considered accurate and reliable. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The articles are encyclopedic and verifiable. To fully understand how a given airline works and its function within society, business and aviation, it is nessesary to know where a given airline flies. Remember that Wikipedia not only includes encyclopedic information for Average Joe, but also for people with special interests within specific topics - this is one of Wikipedias greatest strengths. Some people want encyclopedic information on airports, airlines and aircraft, and so there is a lot of usefull information about this on Wikipedia, including information that some would consider excessive, because they are not looking for information detail at the same level as others. Personally the reason I started reading Wikipeida and later editing it, including articles related to many other topics than aviation, was because Wikipedia had a lot of detailed, still encyclopedic, information on airlines, including their destination, that I read simply because I found it interesting to read about (which maybe is the main purpose of Wikipedia). <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsenikk_9ef3.html" title="User:Arsenikk">Arsenikk</a> 15:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> These articles provide information about the airlines and their destinations is important to provide readers with more accurate and detailed information on the subject.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b> The primary reasons for deletion have been: 1) Verifiability - primary is an airline and secondary, at minimum is OAG or the airport itself, so this is no longer a concern. 2) Frequency of change - airline destinantions really do not change that often, and people are watching and updating most of these articles regularly (the ability to update info is what makes Wikipedia valuable compared to a book!). 3) Information is on airline websites - while this info is available on an airline's website, it is often difficult for a lay person to determine as it is usually intermixed with their code-share destinations, whereas this list focusses entirely on those flown by the actually carrier itself. This leaves the question of encyclopedic value. The list has value as it relates to an understanding of the nature of the specific airline - where they fly is of core importance to understanding the business itself. What would be of greater value would be inclusion of service dates, but lack of this information should make it a candidate for improvement, not deletion. Ideally, the information should be included on the main airline page, but doing so would make the article too long. <a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphenry_9310.html" title="User:Aphenry">Aphenry</a> 23:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> per Aphenry. The destinations are an accessible record of an airline's involvement in the cities and airports it serves, just as railway lines. Part of understanding and researching the history of an airline is to know its specific area of service, and summarization in an article won't cut it. Deferring to an airline's website would not help anybody, especially if there's no English translation or is cluttered with codeshare/alliance info, and only adds a very inconvenient step for those who seek Wikipedia for the same information. Improvement of the lists should be the goal. It seems to have been the WikiProject's decision to not include more info about destination lists and make them more "encyclopedic", if that is a viable allegation. Here are some questions I have:
<ul>
<li>How exactly is this information supposed to be adapted for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, for those who suggest it belongs there? According to the English Wikitravel's <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article%3F" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article%3F" rel="nofollow">"What is an article?"</a> and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel_talk:What_is_an_article%3F" class="external text" title="http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel_talk:What_is_an_article%3F" rel="nofollow">their talk page</a>, they seem to have little or no interest in having lists of airline destinations, much less articles about airlines or airports (or other transportation modes).</li>
<li>Would categories work (e.g. Category:American Airlines destinations) in which its contents would be airports? They would output exactly the same info as with the destination lists, but prohibit expansion of other info (e.g. inaugural service). Templates could also work, à la those used for radio and TV stations and companies.
<ul>
<li>Categories would present the same problem as putting the destination lists on the airline pages: they would be too long. An airport such as Frankfurt, Kennedy, or Heathrow would be overrun with categories. Keeping it as a separate list enables those who want the information to easily find it, while at the same time allowing those who don't want it to ignore it. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">DB</a> (<a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbinder_633d.html" title="User talk:Dbinder">talk</a>) 02:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, there are people who are dedicated to updating airline and airport destinations. Destinations are added and subtracted occassionally, but they are not changed often. (What financial or market-based purpose would changing <i>destinations</i> frequently have for a scheduled airline?) Flight frequencies and days of operation vary, however, and that probably causes the confusion. That is a scheduling issue... <i>that</i> is unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 01:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep of all the articles</b>. These are all very valuable supplementary articles to our airline articles. They are not intended to give timetable information (there are no departure times, arrival times or flight numbers listed in any of the lists), but to give readers an idea of where an airline flies and hence see where the airline has a comprehensive route network and where an airline does not fly. Information on an airlines destinations is <i>obviously</i> relevant to coverage of the carrier and is very useful to the reader. For example: By looking at the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia_destinations.html" title="Iberia destinations">Iberia destinations</a> we can see that Iberia has a comprehensive longhaul network to Latin America while there network to North America is less developed. OK, we could add a sentence which says that in the Iberia article, but for the reader, it is <i>much</i> more informative to have the entire list so that s/he can see for him/herself. As for notability, newspapers regularly write about airlines establishing and closing down routes so I think it easily meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as well. I myself have frequently found myself wanting to read about airlines, and these lists are a godsend to finding relevant information about them. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 16:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem is that all of these lists are entirely uncommented. Further down you say that the <i>List of Ryanair destinations</i> tells you that Ryanair tends to fly to secondary airports.

<li><b>Keep</b> - These lists were originally part of the associated airline articles (which are not up for deletion) and a list of destinations is a valid thing to include in an article about an airline.

<li>Hello there people! Yes, I am still around. I am sad to notice, however, that during the 36 hours and counting my internet connection has been down, this AfD has been flooded with keep&#160;!votes. The only new argument to come up seems to be Vegaswikian claiming that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not applicable has he HAS found - namely <a href="http://www.oag.com/NorthAmerica/AirlineAndAirport/RoutesFinder.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.oag.com/NorthAmerica/AirlineAndAirport/RoutesFinder.asp" rel="nofollow">OAG</a>.

<b>BUT</b>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not nor has never been my argument for deletion. I steadfastly maintain that mere lists of airline destinations is <b>not encyclopedic content</b> - not even if they are considered "part of the main article", "subarticles" or whatever you may call them. True, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, but neither is it a Directory or an Indiscriminate collection of information.

<li>The precedent set by the AFD you cited was in fact to merge the list in with the airline per an agreement between me and the closing administrator. In that case I think merging was acceptable because the airline in question was such a small one with a fleet of six aiplanes. In addition, your citing of precedent on a single AFD, which many of the people in the Aviation projects missed, is just as spurious reasoning as the <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> votes you accuse people of making as you will see from reading the same essay. In fact, Huaiwei and Aphenry among others have provided strong arguments for why this is encyclopedic, not just ILIKEIT. Regarding your other arguments, the lists are <i>not</i> indiscriminate, they were made to provide information about an airline's business, and since flying people from X to Y is what an airline does as its main business it is natural that we provide information on where these X and Y are. We did not just make up a random trivial criterion, we made a criterion which is highly relevant to the coverage of the airline. The lists are not a directories either, a directory is something people use to look up a directory entry in. Nobody is going to use these lists to look up JFK International Airport. The lists are lists to illustrate an airline's business. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I would also like to point out that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is not a very good policy since hundreds and probably thousands of articles fall under its guidelines which would basically nominate all for deletition.

<dd>I am confident that this debate will be closed appropriately. I'm actually quite surprised by the number of people who want to keep these pages, as we have a clear and long-standing policy that "Wikipedia is not a directory". This, for me, is the "killer policy breach". What is it about these articles that makes them anything other than a directory&#160;? That's what I can't see. My concern is that no-one who wants to keep these pages has answered this question. I'm quite prepared to accept that the contents of these articles is verifiable, but that's not enough. Several people have suggested that these articles contribute to an understanding of how an airline works: I don't see why - surely the underlying principles of airline management are broadly ( and with certain well-defined exceptions that can be documented in the appropriate articles ) independent of the exact locations serviced. Having just come to this debate today, the balance of reasoning seems to me to be fairly clear, but my worry is that there are several people who seem to have invested a lot in these articles at an emotional level; my hope is that this can be resolved with minimal discomfort for all.

<dd>They contribute to an understanding of how an airline works because an airline's purpose is to fly to destinations. I know to some people it may seem insignificant, however an important aspect of any company is knowing what it specializes in. In examining an airline's destination format, this can be achieved most easily. <a href="../../../n/c/s/User%7ENcSchu_9fea.html" title="User:NcSchu">NcSchu</a> 21:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see how <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_Air_destinations_fca9.html" title="Brit Air destinations">Brit Air destinations</a> gives more "understanding how the airline works" than a line in the main Brit Air article saying that "Brit Air has regular flights to many regional airports in France and Western Europe" (or a paragraph with the same contents), and a link to the airline website or wherever you get this info from. Similarly, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines destinations</a> can for this purpose be summarized as "American Airlines flies to xx destinations in the USA and yy major cities in all continents". The fact that it flies to Barajas International Airport in Madrid is not really relevant or informative for this purpose. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That American Airlines flies to Madrid is <i>not</i> irrelevant to our coverage of American Airlines. It shows that AA has a fairly extensive network in Europe since it sees a market in flying to Spain. Large US carriers such as United Airlines do not fly there, so from a person interested in aviation, the fact that AA flies to this city is quite relevant. Saying simply simply that they fly to 11 destinations in Europe says much less. Which 11 destinations? The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Airlines_destinations_29ba.html" title="Continental Airlines destinations">Continental Airlines destinations</a> article tells us that the airline has 27 European destinations, many of them fairly small cities such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>. That tells us a lot about <i>their</i> business model, that they see good business in having many direct routes to Europe to smaller airports while some other carriers may rely on routes to larger hubs such as London or Paris. That several of Europe's main airports are missing from <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair_destinations.html" title="Ryanair destinations">Ryanair destinations</a> tells us a lot about their business model, how they try to avoid costly big airports and favor smaller regional airports in the interests of keeping costs and ticket prices low. Trying to summarize this into a paragraph as you suggest will be unhelpful to the reader. The author of such a paragraph is forced to make a decision of what is significant enough to fit into a small paragraph and that leads to a certain bias: what s/he determines as significant is not what someone else may determine as significant. Perhaps the author does not appreciate the significance of seeing that Northwest, Continental and USAirways fly to Gatwick rather than Heathrow in London, while United and American go to Heathrow, but from an aviation perspective, this may be quite significant. The reader is left to trust the author's bias and that is detrimental to his or her understanding of the business model of the airline. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to explain your reasoning. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this. I think it is much better to explain the business model of the airline in text format, with some enlightening examples (and sourced of course, no OR), than to give a list of destinations and let the user make his own conclusions. While I agree on the difference between Ryanair and other carriers, I don't see a clear difference between the 5 American carriers you mentioned, and it certainly is not obvious (to me) from the list of destinations. But that's my opinion, not really a policy or guideline debate, and "I (don't) like it" or "it is (not) useful" are not really good arguments (not directed to anyone in particular, I use them as well). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:21, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An airline's purpose is certainly to fly to destinations, sure. And I can easily understand that there may be differences in the ways that a regional airline serving a large number of small-ish cities and an international airline serving only capital cities, say, may be managed; I'd expect us to cover this appropriately. I can also understand that certain routes ( London to New York, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, say ) may be subject to special conditions; I'd expect us to cover this. But I don't see what is gained by giving a detailed list of exactly which airports are covered by exactly which airlines. What I'm trying to say is that I think we're right to cover general principles of route management and so on, but that we shouldn't go to the level of granularity you're advocating. I feel that our articles should aim to enlighten people about general principles - if you want to know how an airline works, we should be your first port of call - but if we follow your train of reasoning through I suspect we end up trying to understand how each airline works at a level of detail that, by focussing on the individual airports, tends to detract from an understanding of the more general principles of airline management. I do think that the point that you're making here makes sense, but I think that if we follow it through to its inevitable conclusion we end up being less instructive, by obscuring generalities with specifics. When we get down to the level of granularity you're advocating, I think we move out of the realm of encyclopedia and into the realm of specialist text. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 21:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Very Strong Keep</b> I don't understand why these articles have been flagged for deletion. I use them. I enjoy them. Lists in various forms are essential parts of enyclopaedias. The only thing I can think of is that a minority group wants to impose its will over another minority group in Wikipedia. I note that the initial person proposing the deletion of these articles regards himself first and foremost as an anarchist, and I then wonder if this proposal to mass delete is simply part of power struggle to show what a single anarchist can achieve. I note further that this deletion proponent has no particular interest in aviation, and wonder why he is concerned about this subject, when there are undoubtedly a lot of dubious articles in his areas of interest that could warrent further attention. Many people have spent thousands of hours working diligently to collect information that many other people use for a wide variety of purposes. Now a group of "aginers" wants to destroy this invaluable work. I find these lists of destinations at least as notable, and as valuable, as the discographies of countless singers and groups. The sheer number of these articles indicates that there is an interest in them, and the discussion here indicates that many feel a need for them, and that Wikipedia is the appropriate place for these needs to be met. My major concern is that if these pages are deleted it will be a signal to many active editors that their services are no longer appreciated at Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> I would like to address the issue of these articles as directories as that seems to be a major premise in the case for deletion. They are presented as concisely as possible and without scheduling or routing (stopovers etc). Therefore they are not directories, they are supplementary reference articles. I reject the analogy airline destinations = directory, I would say these articles are more like reference tables. Under the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> there includes the caveat "Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference." An example of just such a quick reference is that Air Canada, for instance, flies to several routes in South America but none in Africa. This information is often unavailable or masked on airline websites because of their extensive alliances and codesharing. I argue that including all notable destination information in the body article would be unnecessarily long-winded. It has been well-established in this thread that the information is verifiable (see comment 20:36, 14 January) and that they are updated regularly (see comment 13:38, 17 January 2007; others have noted the possibility of adding a disclaimer). Nothing in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> directly applies to these articles, including <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a>.

<p><b>VERY STRONG KEEP</b> I found this deletion page because I was looking for a reference for destinations to which <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mal%C3%A9v_Hungarian_Airlines_5cad.html" title="Malév Hungarian Airlines">Malév Hungarian Airlines</a> flies. Exactly the point of Wikipedia… to serve as a reference. To those who argue that the airline webpages are where you’ll find this information most accurately, that is incorrect, otherwise I would have gone there first. Many airlines will list destinations without actually flying there… instead their codeshare partners do. Case in point, looking at the <a href="http://www.malev.hu/" class="external text" title="http://www.malev.hu/" rel="nofollow">Malév Airlines</a> corporate page, one would be led to believe that Malév flies from Budapest to Cleveland. They don’t. To get to Cleveland on this airline one would have to take a Malév flight to New York's JFK Airport, and then transfer to an American Airlines flight to Cleveland. While you can’t determine this from the company webpage, you can determine from Wikipedia that Malév doesn’t serve Cleveland. In this case and many like it, Wikipedia’s information is clearly more informative and precise than the airline’s own site. Further, I learned far more about what Malév is as a company by looking at their destination list than what I learned from reading in the main article that “Malév flies to 59 cities in 35 countries.” That last bit of information doesn't tell me much. If I was looking for a travel guide the airline's webpage would suffice. As a traveler I want to go from point A to point B. I don't really care how I get there. As someone interested in both commercial aviation as well as foreign commerce, the destination list is extremely helpful. In addition to giving a clear depiction of the scope of the airline's operations, the destination list also provides an indication of the home country’s trade and commerce partnerships (Hungary in the case). In another example of this, the list of the 157 cities served by <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_destinations_2abc.html" title="American Airlines destinations">American Airlines</a> looks quite different from the list of 87 cities served by <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeroflot_destinations.html" title="Aeroflot destinations">Aeroflot</a>. It is also very useful in comparing the competitiveness of each airline in various markets. Simply put, a list depicting where they fly indicates to me in many ways who they are. The argument has also been made that these pages should be deleted because the Livingston Airline destinations page was deleted. Wikipedia clearly states that precedence is not a valid argument on whether or not to delete a page; perhaps we could forget that argument. The argument has further been made that airline destinations change too often to be listed, implying that updating them would prove burdensome. I used to work in the airline industry and can assure you their destinations do not change all that frequently, certainly not as often as tens of thousands of other ongoing topics that are covered by Wikipedia that change daily! These destination pages are references. They are good references. Please keep them. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENtk53s_64da.html" title="User:Ntk53s">Hebron</a> 05:52, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I haven't studies this example, but how do you know or think to know that this information is more reliable than the company's website? The article is completely unreferenced, so any info on it is uncheckable for now. I know that being currently unsourced is not a reason for deletion, but I wonder where you get the very strong certainty that this page is correct, when you didn't know what info you would get beforehand (if you did, you wouldn't need it as a reference).

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is discused above. Even the nominiator agrees this information can be verfied by independent third party sources. If these articles are kept, I suppose that a template could be created to list all of the sources and included in every article. It would be rather large however. Or we could start referencing the source for each change. That would probably make the article unmaintainable since the extra workload would be huge compared with each change. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 06:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>These articles are informative and give information which is totally neccessary. If these aren't included, then all the airline articles loose a lot of credibility. Not having the destinations would be like having an article about a football team without a list of players, it just wouldn't work.

<li>No, the article doesn't find the European destination list notable. What the article does is state the thesis that Continental finds it profitable to fly to secondary airports in Europe and then lists those secondary airports that the company put on in the last few years. This is by no means the complete list of destinations in Europe. In contrast, the "List of Continental Airline destinations" is huge, uncommented and supports no thesis whatsoever. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 14:21, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been arguing pretty strongly that these articles <i>do not</i> violate any policy. The lists are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> (sources are at the very least the airline's timetables, and if you must have something independent you can see OAG per DB's comment). Since the lists are plainly read off these sources without any form of interpretation or synthesis along the way the articles are not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> either. Since the articles present bare facts and no value judgements, there is no violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Since the destinations of an airline, that <i>is</i> an airline's main business, are highly relevant to the airline's business, and since newspapers frequently write articles about comings and goings of an airline, and business journals frequently discuss an airline's route network, the lists are <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and not indiscriminate. Saying that the argument for inclusion is based solely on <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> arguments is patently <i>false</i> and it is becoming very tiresome to to have to say this. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

I have restored it, but I suspect from the attitude shown in the edit summary at the time of removal that it will be removed again. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 00:35, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is no different from having an article on a television show pilot episode. For that matter it is no different from any other article on any TISM album.

<li><b>Merge</b> - a demo tape is not notable ina nd of itself. A pilot episode is a bad comparison as it is actually aired as opposed to a demo tape which is not mass duplicated and sold. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 05:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Pilot episodes are not usually aired. Generally they are recreated from the script, using the newly available studio funding. The new creation may air as the first episode or as another episode in the first season, or as a subplot within an episode, or they may never air at all. See <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_pilot.html#Bare-bones_pilot" title="Television pilot">Television pilot#Bare-bones pilot</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_pilot.html#Airing_the_pilot" title="Television pilot">Television pilot#Airing the pilot</a>. A demo tape is like a bare-bones pilot. No reason not to have an article about it. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 06:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
