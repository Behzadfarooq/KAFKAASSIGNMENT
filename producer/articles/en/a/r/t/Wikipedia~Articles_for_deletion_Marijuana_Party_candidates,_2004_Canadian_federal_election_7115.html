<li>I disagree with your assessment: I was the one who proposed the compromise and I obviously take a strong interest in the matter, but I'm certainly not the only one who supports the continued existence of such pages. The list pages provided a functional resolution to a bitter debate, and they've <i>worked</i> as a compromise for over a year. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 05:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as status quo compromise. This 'List of...' article is a proactive alternative to individual candidate pages that spring up every election. Theoretically (in my mergist fantasy), all candidates get a redirect page to this kind of list page (or, more practically, as it is practised, all candidates get merged/redirected to such a page once someone creates an article on them). This page solves some rather annoying things, like endless afds on electoral candidates who just want the free ad space and get it for at least the 5 days the afd takes (hint: don't take it to afd, just merge/redirect it to the list pages) and a one-stop shop to monitor for abusive or peacock descriptions of the candidate (opposed to monitoring hundreds of pages during that grace period candidates are normally given during an election). This topic had a centralized discussion here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>; and this proposal came up here: <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html#A_mergist.27s_solution" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates#A mergist's solution</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean<small>25</small></a> 07:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not convinced, reading <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia_talk%7ECentralized_discussion_Legislative_candidates_5bb0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates">Wikipedia talk:Centralized discussion/Legislative candidates</a>, that this compromise has any more consensus than any other. I'm also not sure we need seperate lists for each party, when they are of these lengths. I think I'd be inclined to keep merging these lists to a point where they aren't unwieldy and aren't potential forks and aren't granting undue balance. On the last point, do the major parties <b>also</b> have lists of their failed candidates? If not, we are creating articles on an undue balance basis. At the moment, <b>delete</b>. I could see a value in Candidates in the 2004 Canadian federal election, but we're not debating that here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 07:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm at a loss why a party that got way way less than 1% overall (yes, individual ridings varied but they competed in what, 5 ridings tops??? even less than the other party articles Brenny put up today) needs an article about a particular election outcome. I think merging this stuff with the main party article is the way to go. To those that cite other party articles, as examples that it should be done this way, I suggest perhaps that other minor party articles need the same merging/purging treatment too. Nothing much more could ever be said here, could it? It is with great and over-riding (get it?) joy that I support Mr. Brenny in his noble endeavour. (KIDDING!!! about the noble part I mean...) and therefore I must suggest that the right thing to do here is <b>Merge with redirect</b>...

<li>There is a vanishingly small amount of encyclopedic information in this article, and the others. Why do we care what some irrelevant loser (yes, really, he lost) describes himself as? Why is the percentage information not properly in context in the main article about the election? Why do we care a fig, frankly, who failed to get a single candidate elected and who, judging from the article were of approximately zero impact at all levels.

<li>To the first point: my apologies, but you signed anonymously the first time (subsequently corrected). In any case, I'll reiterate that an afd decision and afd precedent supports the compromise. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:20, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One prior AfD decision (that was probably wrong) and little to no precedent. I don't think that either justify spending pixels explaining what someone with &lt;1% of the vote "describes himself as". Adding a summary percentage somewhere relevant, would be fine, of course. I don't understand the reluctance to do so and be done with. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:23, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>They fielded candidates in 2000 and 2006 (and they didn't exist before 2000). The party most certainly <i>did</i> have an impact on the national debate on cannabis legislation. I believe it's established that the individual candidates don't (automatically) deserve bio pages, but they remain public figures and merit <i>some</i> coverage in a review of the nation's political history. Anyway, I'm not sure this debate is getting us anywhere. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure that <i>is</i> established, and I'm reasonably conversant with AfD. I don't think that a single AfD in which the key assertion was "other articles exist" i.e. a repetition of the argument used here, making it at best a tail-biting assertion. The statistical info in this article can be and already is elsewhere. There is not much added by this article: I mean, why does it matter that <i>"Zupansky has described himself as a business owner and salesperson"</i>? The only reason this debate might not get us anywhere is if people decide not to engage in it: asserting that it should be overruled by a largely non-existent precedent. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:15, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article about the <i>party</i> is fine (and is not up for deletion that I know of). This "list of failed candidates" page, on the other hand, is not inherently encyclopedic. I do not agree with the statements above that there is any precedent to keeping such pages. Note: This page has already proliferated to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana_Party_candidates%2C_2006_Canadian_federal_election_cc81.html" title="Marijuana Party candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election">Marijuana Party candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election</a>.
