<li><b>Keep</b>. Qualifies for inclusion as a glossary of terms used by Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh's use of lanuage and rhetoric is widely discussed and analyzed - books and articles are written on the topic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156584260X/103-6187627-9919020?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156584260X/103-6187627-9919020?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. By citing an essay and personal opinion on the interest of the material, the nom has not made much of a case for deletion. However, looks to me that the subject would have very broad interest among those researching American culture, political history and etymologies. A number of the terms do seem to be referenced, but better referencing would be welcome. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Provides a useful space to merge Limbaugh's new epithets as they are invented, and having them here is preferable to having articles on each. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:22, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>-complete fancruft and at best it's a list of neologism which have no place here anyway. Now if there was a reliable source somewhere that had an article explicitedly about rush Limbaugh's jargon then you would have grounds to keep it.

<li><b>Delete</b> per the Crazy Russian. This is clearly cruft, although I agree with <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">User:Ihcoyc</a> that this is better than independent articles on each neologism.

<dd>Following your logic, articles like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland_5961.html" title="List of High Kings of Ireland">List of High Kings of Ireland</a> might have to be immediately deleted since there are not references for "each and every item".

<dd>You nominate it and I'll give you my opinion at the AFD. There's at least a degree of difference between "I picked up a book and copied out what it says" lists, which are verifiable and sourceable by adding the book(s) the material was extracted from as reference(s) (i.e. there are two lists of High Kings of Ireland in Frank Byrne's <i>Irish Kings and High Kings</i>, albeit neither matches the main list in the article in question), and "who knows where this stuff came from&#160;?" ones like this. The fate of both articles should be to be reduced to verifiable, and thus shorter, lists. However, we're now at AFD for the Limbaugh list, so the time for eventualism is past. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 12:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> for the following reasons.
<ul>
<li>I am new to wikipedia, but if what I hear is really true--that, for example, lists and descriptions of each and every Simpsons episode reside here--then I don't see how Limbaugh jargon qualifies for deletion. "Unverified through anything other than listening to [or watching] the show" (quoting CrazyRussian above) &#160;? Check. "of limited interest to a circumscribed minority"? Check. Simpsons episodes and Limbaugh jargon must plead guilty to both charges.</li>
<li>As for a positive argument for "keep," I endorse what the "absolutely keep" entry said above: "Limbaugh jargon is used to parody and satirize the object of the jargon. It is a distinguishing feature of his program and therefore required for a encyclopedic entry."</li>
<li>As for the verifiability problem:
<ul>
<li>This can be fixed for most entries in this article. For example, a lexis-nexis search on " 'feminazi' AND 'limbaugh' " yielded 120 results in "major papers" and five in "magazines and journals." I am sure that among those is an article that could be cited where relevant information about "feminazi" could be mined.</li>
<li>For any entry that cannot be found in published articles, it would suffice to reference a date when the term was heard on Limbaugh's show, since audio archives of the show are available.</li>

<ul>
<li>Yeah, I saw that. Also wanted to chime in and mention the Wikiquote option that we used on Levin, which helped win over those opposed to outright deletion of the list. If implemented on Limbaugh's page, the Rush jargon would survive intact at Wikiquote and you culd easily provide a link to it in the jargon section of the 'pedia article.

<li><b>Keep.</b> OK guys, I did a little research and I see that there is an article on wikipedia titled "List of neologisms on The Simpsons." It is <b>78 kilobytes.</b> I just don't see how the list of Limbaugh jargon is any worse. Maybe the title of the Limbaugh article should be changed to "List of neologisms used on The Rush Limbaugh Show"? 152.3.246.168 05:18, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are many items in that list that should be pared. However, the list itself should stay. There are several notable entries with their own articles on it, such as <a href="../../../d/27/o/D%27oh%21.html" title="D'oh!">D'oh!</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese-eating_surrender_monkeys.html" title="Cheese-eating surrender monkeys">Cheese-eating surrender monkeys</a>.
