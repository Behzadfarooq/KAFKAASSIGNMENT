<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> says, "Wikipedia is NOT...Mere collections of internal links, except for disambiguation pages when an article title is ambiguous, and for structured lists to assist with the organisation of articles." I don't see it assisting in any organization of articles. (Also, there are unresolvable disputes going on as to who is or isn't a "major philosopher." Article creates an excuse for unnecessary and useless conflict, distracting editors from working on real articles) There is already a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Philosophers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Philosophers" rel="nofollow">Category:Philosophers</a>, so what's the point? <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I find it hard to believe we are supposed to delete all of these.

<dd>FWIW, many, if not most (or even damn near all) lists on Wikipedia go back to the days when a) the Category system hadn't been implemented in the software, so lists were the only way to collect 'like things', and b) when there were few articles, so the lists of redlinks were a good way to encourage article creation. Some number of lists (no idea what percent--haven't been editing on EN much the past, um, year, nearly) have since been deleted if it was determined that they had so few redlinks that they no longer served that purpose, in which case many people argue that they are redundant with the category, thus no longer needed. 24.18.215.132 03:26, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is false. Watch yourself...Al. First of all, Rand is not my favorite philosopher. I'm only vaguely familiar with Objectivism and am in the process of trying to learn about it. Secondly, I'm not deleting it because I can't get Rand in it. I explictly stated in Talk that I didn't really care if Rand was in it or not, because no one reads this article anyway. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=57112319&amp;oldid=57112012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=57112319&amp;oldid=57112012" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Contrary to your claim, at no time did I ever state that I was attempting to delete it because I couldn't get Rand in. I simply stated in Talk that its existence appears to be in opposition to Wikipedia policy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=56348256&amp;oldid=56345197" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_philosophers&amp;diff=56348256&amp;oldid=56345197" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. An additional reason I'm voting to delete it is it is distracting editors (including myself) from working on articles that people actually read. As evidence of my good faith and selfless devotion to policy, see here where I recently voted to delete a similar article even though I thought the article was useful: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_anarchism_web_resources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_anarchism_web_resources" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (that's where I learned of the policy) I'm trying to keep Wikipedia content in compliance with policy.

<li>Yeah, I don't believe you. Your actions reveal you to be an orthodox, hardline Objecvtivist, regardless of any claims you make to the contrary.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Main actors in the debate have stopped argumenting. Consensus of the debate was that no <b>objective definition of major philosopher</b> can be constituted. My suggestion is to make a redirection to the philosophy portal. Intangible 03:51, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not we have arrived at an 'objective definition' (a standard that seems unreasonably high given that most regular English terms cannot be defined with complete objectivity), there is no consensus that 'major philosophers' is problematic. Plenty of us are fine with it. I also think it's telling that everyone who has voted to 'delete' has been part of the unsuccessful campaign to produce a consensus to add Rand. It looks a lot like sour grapes to me. <a href="../../../f/i/9/User%7EFi99ig_a691.html" title="User:Fi99ig">fi99ig</a> 04:19, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The standard is not high. All it needs is a wikipedia consensus that the philosophy term has been added to the philosophy category. Intangible 04:34, 8 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are you serious? It's not a philosophical term! 'Akrasia' is a philosophical term. 'Apperception' is a philosophical term. 'Analytic' and 'synthetic' are philosophical terms. But 'major philosopher' is just a regular english term. I defy you to find a single work of philosophy where it is used in a technical sense. <a href="../../../f/i/9/User%7EFi99ig_a691.html" title="User:Fi99ig">fi99ig</a> 04:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I cannot defy something I do not claim. I was refering to terms such as 'rationalism', 'empiricism' and 'nihilism', among many others, which all have been added to the philosophy category. Intangible 04:58, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you guys... serious? A "complete" list? Are you aware of how many philosophers there are? That's like listing every single baseball player in the world. ANYONE can be a baseball player or a philosopher. But the fact is, 99.9% of philosophers in the world don't matter. I have a philosophy on life, I am a philosopher (so to speak), but I don't matter.

<li><b>Delete</b> While this list is useful there is just too many problems with the definition of "Major Philosopher" that Alienus and Fi99ig are promoting, which by the way I think they have designed specifically to keep Ayn Rand off of the list due to the Anti-Objectivist bias that they both have. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 18:23, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Very intensely STRONG KEEP</b> - What's the point? Here's the point: the list system and category systems are parallel (in purpose). However, they each reflect a different style of construction (and maintenance), and therefore tap the different strengths of users - some users like working with lists (perhaps because those users are good at spewing lists right out of their heads, or maybe they like lists because the links are centralized for easy access), and others like tagging articles (the decentralized approach - you can't edit the links at the category). Lists are here to stay, in spite of the category system's overlap/redundancy - this is a long-standing precedent. If we get rid of this list for the reason of category redundancy, then we might as well put up all lists for deletion at the same time and save the trouble of deleting them one-by-one (there are thousands of them). The list system isn't being replaced by the category system, as each system has its strengths and weaknesses. Also, the list of lists included on this page alone makes it worthy of keeping. As for the list of major philosophers, since there have been so many philosophers throughout the ages, it is <i><b>helpful</b></i> to have a list of the most influential ones. Therefore, it is not a mere list of internal links, rather it is a valuable summary or condensation. It may interest you to know that the list is slated for inclusion in the project <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConcise_0bf0.html" title="Wikipedia:Concise">Wikipedia:Concise</a> (<i>see</i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EConcise_2871.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Concise">talk page</a>), which would not be possible if this list had been deleted! --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolar_Deluge_b7f6.html" title="User:Polar Deluge">Polar Deluge</a> 12:57, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I tend to like lists in general, esp. useful ones like this. I like that the list seems dedicated to only include real, notable philosophers.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 03:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It <i>excludes</i> more "real, notable philosophers" (i.e. philosophers who have a wikipedia article) than it includes. David Sneek 11:10, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have a question regarding procedure. It seems that a clear majority wish to keep the list (by my count, over two-to-one in favor of keeping it). Should this majority hold up, at what point (and how) do we settle this issue and remove the tag on the list page? <a href="../../../f/i/9/User%7EFi99ig_a691.html" title="User:Fi99ig">fi99ig</a> 21:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There needs to be a clear consensus in favor of deletion, and that's clearly not going to happen. I think it's time to declare this closed and remove the scare tags. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html" title="User talk:Alienus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alienus_1d05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alienus">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>From the AfD instructions:</p>
<p><b>What to do after an AfD discussion has passed with a confirmation?</b></p>
<p>Nothing. If the discussion has been listed according to the rules above, at the end of the discussion period (usually about five days) an administrator will see the discussion listed under Wikipedia:Articles for deletion and erase it. Non administrator users do not have the technical capability to delete articles.</p>
<p>Five days has passed, and consensus is in favor of keeping. Therefore, I'm removing the tags. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolar_Deluge_b7f6.html" title="User:Polar Deluge">Polar Deluge</a> 05:54, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
