<li><b>Speedy keep</b> Cameron Stout has his own page, and nobody remembers him. Pete, on the other hand, has his own band, was already a local cult celebrity in Brighton, had the shortest odds of any Big Brother contestant at the halfway stage (1/8), was the only bookmakers' favourite to win the entire series, is already regarded as being one of the greatest housemates that's ever lived, and is the favourite with Ladbrokes at 2/1 with Daddy Fantastic to have the Christmas Number 1 single, despite not having released a commercial single yet. The idea that he shouldn't have his own page is laughable and is actually giving me a painful stitch due to me laughing so hard at how ridiculous it is. I am in agony but I will continue writing to portray your ignorance on the subject. And anyway, why shouldn't he have his own page? Is there a limited number of pages allowed on this site? Is there a drought? No, there isn't. You're just being idiots. Pete deserves his own page, and there is no reason for having this deleted.

<li>Look, seriously. You know you're wrong. You know this isn't going to be deleted. You have a large number of people telling you to get your head out of your arse and stop pissing all over Pete's achievement and get on with your miserable life. You've got evidence that wanks all over your supposed arguments in the forms of pages for Anthony Hutton and Cameron Stout, who are no longer famous and weren't very well known in the first place, compared to Pete who was the biggest Big Brother favourite in the shows existence, has a highly anticipated band who are favourites for the Christmas Number 1 single...I can't believe, actually, that you are still trying to drag this discussion out. I have single handedly proven that you are an idiot, and a host of others have also stated that they disagree with you, and you are in a minority that shouldn't have existed in the first place. Once again, Pete is staying on here. There is no reason to take him off even if you did believe he wasn't noteworthy. There is no shortage of available Wikipedia pages. All you're doing is trying to ruin Pete's credibility because you probably supported Aisleyne or someone, or maybe you just hate Big Brother and you're a massive hit on the Restoration page or something. Either way, don't bother responding because you just can't win. Take care now, honey.</li>
