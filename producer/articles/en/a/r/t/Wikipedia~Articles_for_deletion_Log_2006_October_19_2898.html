<li><b>To consider</b> I only added the comic after I saw a few listings that were asking for a wiki page for Tales of the Traveling Gnome. The comic itself has had over 10,000 readers for months now, and it's constantly ranked in the top 150 comics in all of ComicGenesis ( <a href="http://www.comicgenesis.com/wrank.php?&amp;limit=150" class="external text" title="http://www.comicgenesis.com/wrank.php?&amp;limit=150" rel="nofollow">Reference Link</a> ) even though it's never done any advertising that I'm aware of.

<li><b>Thoughts</b> Among these comments I've yet to see something that comes specifically from the guidelines to deletion. The closest I see is 'not notable' which in this seems more a matter of opinion based on a seeming bias towards webcomics. (See first line of nomination.. notice suggestion is towards all webcomics) The WCAA is actually considered a prestigious award ceremony among webcomic artists, and the fact that hundreds participate actually goes forward to show this. The idea that it takes place on line should make sense, given that the people involved aren't rich and live hundreds or more miles apart. The idea that 'being listed at Comic Genesis' makes it not popular and even crappy is yet mere opinion yet again. Many comics that have gone on to be very popular, and featured at Keenspot the 'holy grail' of webcomics started at ComicGenesis. Yes there are many crappy comics there, but that does not by default denote bad without so much as a perusal of the actual comic. It's a resource, therefore attracts good and bad. There are not specific rules against webcomics being listed in Wikipedia. Nor are there specific implied rules that webcomics must be 'popular' or 'noteworthy'. I can't imagine there could be, because such terms tend to be the realm of opinion, and wikipedia tends to take a neutral stance instead of opinionated stances. Deletion on opinion is expressing of opinion. Deletion just because of being a webcomic is doing the same. -JH (reachable at phreakphit@yahoo.com) 10:19 AM Eastern, 24 October 2006</li>

<li><b>Clarification</b> - Per <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a>, below, I want to clarify my position. I am applying <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> only, specifically CSD A7. I am not suggesting the author be given undue weight in the AfD process, which would be a violation of policy and process. I'm not even suggesting that the author be given undue weight in THIS AfD. I'm merely pointing out that <b>1)</b> The article doesn't claim notability. <b>1a)</b> The article's author didn't claim notability. <b>2)</b> The article has been reviewed by numerous editors and none have added claims of notability. <b>3)</b>The deletion appears non-contentious. <b>4)</b> The subject has had a chance to review the article, and did not add a claim of notability. That the author doesn't think it's notable is only a plus, not a central reason. It shows even clearer consensus. (On a side note, per <a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAQu01rius_1acc.html" title="User talk:AQu01rius">AQu01rius</a>, it is interesting that the subject, or rather the subject's author, noticed it the same day it was created and asked for an AfD.) I believe in process, but I believe the AfD process is unnecessary here. It's the wrong process. There is consensus on deletion. <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">WP:SPEEDY</a> is met. There is no reasonable chance of there being dissent through the rest of the AfD period. The only discussion is wether to speedy delete or just normal delete. Anyway, I think I've clarified where I am comming from. It doesn't really matter at this point, I suppose. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubreyEllenShomo_7ada.html" title="User:AubreyEllenShomo">AubreyEllenShomo</a> 16:09, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <s>government</s> inspection report shows verifiability, yes. Notability, no. In general, the existence of non-trivial third-party sources shows that the outside world (as represented by the publisher of the source) deems the subject notable, hence we Wikipedians consider it notable enough for inclusion. But <s>a government</s> an inspection report on a school isn't published because its publisher, or anybody, deems the school <i>notable</i>, it's published because <s>government</s> schools are accountable to <s>the public</s> parents.

<p>The performance artist Ms Divine is a director/actress and she and her films are listed in the movie guide. '<b>Do Not Delete'</b> Here are the links again with reference and proof of notablility for Ms. Divine</p>
<p>Ms. Divine listed in the New York Times - <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=454333" class="external free" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=454333" rel="nofollow">http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=454333</a></p>

<p>Ms. Divine listed in All Movie Guide - <a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:454333" class="external free" title="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:454333" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:454333</a></p>
<p>Ms. Divine's film at the Pioneer Theatre <a href="http://www.twoboots.com/pioneer/monthly_programs/2005-11.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.twoboots.com/pioneer/monthly_programs/2005-11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.twoboots.com/pioneer/monthly_programs/2005-11.htm</a></p>
<p>I also have the official website as well.</p>
<p>She also currently has several movies in the works on her official website. The internet movie database which is a very popular movie guide has her listed because their site encompasses a body of useful information. That's why people frequent that site so much, because they find information that is not always that easy to find.</p>
<p><br />
In addition to Ms. Divine being a director/actress, she also has her local TV show as well. That is why there were 2 articles, one for Ms. Divine and one for Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure.</p>
<p>The Television network that her show airs on is supported by TimeWarner Cable and RCN Cable, under a franchise agreement with the City of New York. Which means that is a legit channel accessible to all cable customers.</p>
<p>Her program is listed in the guide at <a href="http://www.mnn.org/viewers/schedule" class="external free" title="http://www.mnn.org/viewers/schedule" rel="nofollow">http://www.mnn.org/viewers/schedule</a> On the drop down menu for channel selection select "TW 67/16 RCN 86"; For Time select Mon 10/16 scroll down to the time 10:30pm and you will see the program listing for the show Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure..</p>
<p>The other program is listed under <a href="http://www.qptv.org/iq/ProgramGuide/ChannelListings/tabid/95/Default.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.qptv.org/iq/ProgramGuide/ChannelListings/tabid/95/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.qptv.org/iq/ProgramGuide/ChannelListings/tabid/95/Default.aspx</a> Select Monday then scroll down to the time 8:30pm, on channel 34 You will see Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure listed there. Also select Wednesday then scroll down to 1:30pm on channel 56, again you will see the program listed there.</p>
<p>There are other programs that air on these channels that are defined in wikipedia. There are people out there that want to know and read more about these programs. That is one of the reasons why i took the time to write the articles.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The external links provided seem to point to valid websites that people do trust and turn to for accurate information. For e.g., the New York Times, IMDB.com and local tv guides, are all well-known, well-regarded and well-trusted sites. She is listed for a reason...for public consumption and apparently that makes her a public figure and therefore is very notable. Plus, who is to say that she is not famous just for being associated with other "famous" people...what makes a person who has dated a quasi-celebrity (for e.g. a reality tv "star"), a celebrity by association and therefore newsworthy? I can list many examples of the case of celebrity be association...at least Ms. Divine actually has a growing list of interviews with public figures and a large body of work that has been featured on television and in theatres.</li>

<p>2 of the links are linking to that movie.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> as encyclopedically non-notable public access channel filmmaker. To address the external links: 1) It's easy to get listed in the All Movie Guide<a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=21:avg/info_pages/a_product_submissions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=21:avg/info_pages/a_product_submissions.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The only criteria is that the film product has to be commercially available in the country of release. That's it. If it's a theatrical film not available as a video or DVD, all you need to do is send them a press kit - so even easier 2)The New York Times film database is taken from The All Movie Guide<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/amglegal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/amglegal.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Main difference is that a "readers' review" forum is allowed so that indie filmmakers and friends can post vanity reviews of their own films. (Nice touch with the "only" 4 star gushy review but then the effect is spoilt with three 5 star gushy reviews) <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/rnr/movies/rnr_read.html?_r=2&amp;fid=.f86e728&amp;id=339446&amp;title1=&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer" class="external autonumber" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/rnr/movies/rnr_read.html?_r=2&amp;fid=.f86e728&amp;id=339446&amp;title1=&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. 3)It's not that hard to get into the IMDB (possibly even easier than it is to get on Amazon.com). IMDB is a database with barriers to entry that are as low or almost as low as the All Movie Guide, and which is not well policed. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Steve_Nguyen_%28Second_Nomination%29_fe36.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Steve Nguyen (Second Nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Steve_Nguyen_(Second_Nomination)</a> for instance. 4) The Pioneer Theater also has bracingly low barriers to entry for film screenings<a href="http://www.twoboots.com/pioneer/submit.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.twoboots.com/pioneer/submit.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Good for them, but this does not make it a good reference for encyclopedic notability. 5) As for the qptv and manhattan neighborhood network showings - the whole point of these public access channels is that ANYONE living locally can have a chance to show their program at some point. The city authorities made the cable tv companies support these "community" channels in return for letting them dig up neighborhood streets to lay cable pipes. I've occasionally come across some entertaining stuff on MNN e.g. silly "opera" staged and sung with cuddly toy animals; raw unedited amateur footage of hot European fashion shows - but basically there's no quality or content control whatsoever... anyone can stage a show and pretend to be an expert at whatever or use it as platform for their unusual political/religious views or to show off their "unique art" or whatever <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, First my article is for Ms. Divine who is a performance artist NOT a public access channel filmmmaker. I was asked to proove her notability, so I proved it by providing those external links. Those links describe her diversity, which includes filmmaker/actress.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMDB - Internet movie database is a popular database. If it has such low criteria as you stated, you would see all sorts of "bogus movies". That seems to be your opionion about IMDB than what you actually see. For instance, wikipedia has more bogus entries than Internet movie database.</p>
<p>Also the movie is mentioned in the New York Times, would you say that is bogus too?</p>
<p>The idea of wikipedia which is a user defined encylopedia is for users to access information that they want to find. Writing my article for Ms. Divine and Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure, does just that.</p>
<p>There are many Public TV shows that are long running and have gained cult status. What about Democracy Now by Amy Goodman. That is also a Public TV show. Should you then go and delete that entry? If this show is about "rubbish" as the user previously stated, then how did her movie and her work get accepted to Internet Movie database and to the local theatre.</p>
<p>And most importantly this discussion is also for the performance artist Ms. Divine not just for her show. As mentioned before I have proved her notablitity and existance from the links shown. PeterWeller 02:55, 19 October 2006 (UTC)PeterWeller</p>

<dd>Democracy Now is broadcast on over 500+ radio and tv stations in North America<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/stations.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynow.org/stations.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. It also has established standards of content submission rather than an open access free-for-all. I already explained where the NYTimes listing comes from and about the theater and IMDB. Wikipedia has more intensive content policing that IMDB but also covers vastly more numerous subjects. I didn't say everything on public access is rubbish. I specifically said there is some stuff which is quite entertaining - this doesnt make it encyclopedically notable. Finally, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a search engine or a directory. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:03, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Democracy Now started as a very small independant media and then grew. The New York Times listed the movie because it is a valid movie that aired in a theatre. That prooves the notability.</dd>

<p>There are more mistakes in wikipedia than I have seen in IMDB which makes me feel that IMDB's criteria is much higher. Determining what's notable has already been prooven with the links. The person does exist, she has an audience and her work is on display on all sorts of media ranging from TV to the internet to local theatres. Wikipedia is supposed to be an encylopedia where you can find information about subjects, especially hard to find subjects such as this underground performance artist. It seems to me that wikipedia is just for defining pop culture. PeterWeller 03:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)PeterWeller</p>

<dd>"<i>It seems to me that wikipedia is just for defining pop culture</i>". Um... a lot of effort goes into trying not to be that. Anyway aren't you contradicting yourself by identifying with pop culture. And I look forward to the day when Ms. Divine is broadcast regularly and frequently on 500 stations all over a continent. I'm already gone over the issue with All Media Guide/NYTimes. And yes, NYTimes operates a local listing service which includes the Pioneer Theater. This doesnt prove encyclopedic notability<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:30, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now it appears to me that wikipedia is there for pop culture. At the time that I did this article I thought wikipedia was for providing information about all sorts of topics which included information about underground artists. Sort of like finding information about topics ranging from general to obscure. If the Wikipedia authors are too narrow-minded and are unable to respect art, then wikipedia shall always remain a stagnant "closed off" encylopedia. Thankfully the artist has established her own underground audience.</dd>

<p>The Pioneer Theater has high standards for feature movies. I saw the Bank Heist Movie in the Pioneer Theater. The theater has HIGHER standards than a commercial movie theater which only accepts movies based on their expected profit margin. The standard in question being a creative standard not a commercial one. They do no accept homemade movies, a lot of people tried that already - it does not work that way. On Public Access shows - Quite a few of them are far more entertaining and creative then the junk that gets passed as entertainment in US networks.</p>
<p>Deleting this article is equivalent to pandering to what Big Movie Studios Television Networks deem to be acceptable viewing. The fact is corporate media is filled with garbage shows with no real actors - just reality shows that are fed to the masses who watch anything on the networks.. A few numbers down and you get public television that features struggling artists trying to get their work out. So the morons who act in realty shows are notable? What a joke! In effect no independent film artist can be notable unless they appear in corporate media.

<dd>Well, personally I'd delete 90% of the reality tv show contestants, and 60% of the reality tv shows, but popularity counts for a lot on Wikipedia. As for struggling artists, win a well-recognized &amp; well-established award at an indie film festival or distribute online and get good reviews by well-known critics and you'll have a solid standing on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:15, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok- so essentially what I just said. Win an award from Corporate Media (do you know what indie film festival is?!). Sure. By the way the show is quite popular online from what I've seen. But its good to know what Wikepidia accepts. I will remember that you guys only accept what what is popular. So I don't need to come to this site ever again to find out something, since I can get all my answers to <i>popular stuff</i> elsewhere. Thanks.</p>

<p>The only reason I even signed up to make a comment was that I happened to notice the deletion notice and the invitation to comment. I decided to comment because I had seen some of her work. A search for Ms Divine on Google brings her website and this entry only appears afterwards so I doubt if she needs Wikepidia for promotion as one of your sagacious administrators claims. You admin people are clearly deluded, for I am not part of an drive by user or whatever ridiculous terms you assign to me.</p>
<p>I find it quite offensive too that you add that belittling little comment at the end of my username after clearly posting a link that regular users can comment on this.</p>
<p><i>I hope other regular users who read my comment (if it is not deleted) will refrain from adding anything to this stupid one-sided discussion among the narrowminded people who administrate the wikepidia.</i></p>
<p><b>I also urge the original poster who put up the original content to ignore this site and to remove all content from it- this site is clearly not meant to be a <i>free encyclopedia</i></b></p>
<p>And this is not the only blatant deletion I have observed: An interesting piece on possible plagiarism by Albert Einstein at this site was suddenly deleted with no explanation given despite this information existing (and being confirmed) on other sites. (Even as an allegation this charge is quite 'notable')</p>
<p>I would advise Wikepidia to close off these discussions from the public since these do nothing but reveal the administrators blatant disregard for their general users. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.246.105.38 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.246.105.38_c72d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.246.105.38">contribs</a>).</small></p>

</ul>
<p><b>Issues of notability and validity with regard to my 2 articles</b></p>
<p>My first article was for the show Ms. Divine's Tee Hee HEure. Some have argued saying that Public access channels are not valid thus the show is not valid. This is an ignorant statement to assume.To brush the matter off as a simple local channel show, shows a lack of respect and a lack of understanding of the importance of these channels and the role it plays in the community and culture of New York.</p>
<p>The Television network that her show airs on is supported by TimeWarner Cable and RCN Cable, under a franchise agreement with the City of New York. Which means that is a legit channel accessible to all cable customers. The reason I choose to write about this show, is because it is a show that has been running for the past 4 years, and has maintained an underground audience. I looked up the criteria for notablity in wiki and it states that it is notable if it has some sort of underground audience. Not many shows have done that. This show exists, is long running and has a cult audience and thus deserves notability.</p>
<p>There is a page in wiki on public access TV right? Is it not appropriate and perfectly NOTABLE for the show Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure to be mentioned as an example? And if so, would that not justify a page to link to the show to present the type of stuff they play on public access?</p>
<p>That seems reasonable to me. Also, it is a matter of New York TV, culture and art, particularly Queens and Manhattan. This is <b>NOT</b> about promotion or PROFIT. One wiki admin states that he is "worried" by the Selfpromotion and vanity. Nice snide remark but still not one of logic. Perhaps what one should be concerned about is the biasness that is related to "notability", and the other inaccuracies that plague wikipedia's articles, such as False information. The blatant self promotion that I see is more often in the profile of admin users, who list all these things in their profiles when in actuality they are not notable. Not to mention the obvious cooperate promotion that exists here. See more below for what I am referring to.</p>
<p>This article was written to present users with articles and information that they can find out about. I am arguing my points because its a matter of principal, and I do not believe that deleting both pages is justifiable. And yes, I am determined to atleast state my points before leaving.</p>
<p><br />
Plus there are pages in wiki about bands (<a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_242.html" title="Front 242">Front 242</a> , Devo</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/v/Devo.html" title="Devo">Devo</a>,(<a href="http://www.mutatovisual.com/beautifulmutants/reports/fuse/html/gvc_intrv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mutatovisual.com/beautifulmutants/reports/fuse/html/gvc_intrv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mutatovisual.com/beautifulmutants/reports/fuse/html/gvc_intrv.html</a>) <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Numan_1986.html" title="Gary Numan">Gary Numan</a>, <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Kaufman_a905.html" title="Lloyd Kaufman">Lloyd Kaufman</a> that have that have been interviewed by Ms. Divine and have been a part of the show Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure. So why can't the show be notable as it presents the users with information about the show that the artists have been guests of.</p>
<p>My second article was about the performer <b>Ms. Divine</b> who is the producer of this long running TV show comedy and in addition to that, she has been making numerous sketch films (one of which is listed in IMDB) that aired in local theatres, television and available thru various internet sites. She also has interviewed the above mentioned bands. She also as an established online presence. Ms. Divine is an all-round comedic performer and has gained an underground audience throughout the years, that's why I defined her as a performance artist and felt the article would be quite informative.</p>
<p>This article was not up for deletion at at all and was hastily deleted after the show Ms. Divine's Tee Hee Heure was deleted.</p>
<p>Again there are articles in wiki about independant performers, sketch comedians and thus it is perfectly NOTABLE for Ms. Divine's to be mentioned as an example and thus justify a page to explain the sort of stuff that she does.</p>
<p>To submit proof of her film and of her, I enclosed the external links (with the exclusion of the official site) for Internet Movie Database, the listing in the NY times and the listing the theatre. These links listed her movie and also listed her credits and bio which included director/actress etc. which is more proof to my article where I write that she is a diverse performance artist.</p>
<p><b>The links are not simply "passing links", if you look at the links carefully it is more than a simply listing, it contains more information. Please refer to the bottom of the page where i have enclosed the details of the link</b></p>
<p>One wiki admin author states that Internet Movie Database is not valid for anyone can submit information. That statement is NOT true. Just go to the site imdb.com and see how many "Bogus" INVALID articles that you find. Probably none. Thus IMDB has valid selection criteria. However, take a look at wikipedia and you will find a a good number of BOGUS and INVALID articles written. Thus one can conclude that it is wikipedia that has a much higher chance of NOT being credible. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that all of wikipedia is wrong, but we all know there are many inconsistencies and false facts in wikipedia.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the same wiki author states that Pioneer Theatre in New york City has low standards. That is a matter of opinion. The Pioneer Theatre is a legit theatre. They obviously do not accept just anything. They are known to promote the works of independant artists. Try submitting a bogus film to Pioneer or a home video. It will NOT get accepted. To slander a theatre without knowing how it really works shows a lack of knowledge and an ability to understand art.</p>
<p>The same wiki author tries to discredit the New York Times listing of Ms. Divine and her movie. The movie is valid and so is she. How many "false' listing have you come across in the NY TIMEs listing database. Now again compare the NY times database that to wikipedia, you will see that wikipedia always has more bogus articles than ever. Why not spend more effort in correcting these inconsistencies instead of spending time in deleting a page such as this that has validity and is LEGIT and NOTABLE.</p>
<p>I understand that there are many people who falsify documents and articles in wikipedia, so i can see why articles need to be investigated. However, i am not trying to do that. Ms. Divine is a legit peformance artist. The links that I have provided from various EXTERNAL sites proove that. However to dismiss the links as not notable has become more like a form of bias. The Wiki biography states once again that it is notable if the person has an underground audience. Thus the artist does fit that criteria. She obviously has a long running TV show and movies that have been acknowledged and validated via the links that I have sent were just some examples.</p>
<p>If wikipedia is going to continue their policy of their so-called "notablity" by only relying on cooporate entities to define what music is, or what artists are. Then wikipedia is living in a very "closed box" for they FAIL to understand the valuable contributions that independant artists have made. Not only that, but wiki shows no respect for people that want to find out about these contributions. The subject of notability appears to be more of an "opinion" among the wiki admins than that of reason or logic.</p>
<p><br />
Apparantly defining Lionel Richie's daughter, Nicole richie is considered notable. Defining Hilton sisters is notable. Wikipedia is not a unique online site that encompasses a wide variety of topics. It is an online site that obeys co-operate media for wiki feels Paris Hilton is legit because co-operate media said so and thus she is notable? <b>Thus wikipedia endorses cooperate promotion</b> But yet, defining an independant artist is "non-notable" despite the fact that I have backed my article with various links that prooves her works, her existence etc..</p>
<p>There are many bands and topics that are defined in wikipedia that do not have any backing of external links, yet these articles continue to exist.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an online Enclyopedia, its supposed to be an online site that amasses a large amount of information. People would want to use a system like that, to find articles on topics especially obscure topics that they can't always get their hands on. That is why I choose to write my 2 articles on the performance artist and the show. However, if the article is going to be deleted, then what use is wikipedia to the segment of the population that is trying to research hard to find items. Anybody can find out about Paris Hilton. There are millions of articles all over the web about that person.</p>
<p>Thus wikipedia is not unique in the way that it claims to be. It still contains lots of false information. It still only defines items that most people already know about. It doesn't serve as a source of information where one can find the answers to unqiue topics. Not only that, but many of these wikipedian authors or so called admins (I by no means mean that all admins are bad), appear to gleefully enjoy this "authority" of deleting articles, without using any kind of valid reason. Repeating "notability" like a parrot is not a valid point. Some of their reasons are irrelevant and mean spirited showing a complete lack of professional journalism and utter biasness. And these are the people behind wikipedia. Truly Pathetic! This only serves to impede the development of wikipedia even more. Thus users who want to find information about unique topics and artists will look elsewhere, for wikipedia has failed to provide that information to users.</p>
<p>It would be great if there were any admins out there with an open mind who can understand these points and is willing to <b>KEEP</b> the article. I am also very open to improving the article, categorizing etc etc.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Nish (one of the administrators) who was open-minded enough to re-open this article up for debate, and giving me the chance to express how I feel about that. Thank you very much...</p>
<p>And also thanks to all for taking the time to read my points. I do appreciate it very much. Have a good day. - Peter Weller</p>
<p>PS -</p>
The zoologist Desmond Morris who wrote the book "the Human Zoo" provides some interesting insightful observations about the creative individual. I feel this quote is very appropriate.
<blockquote>
<p>"The creative talent will therefore find himself alternately praised and damned by society in a bewildering way, and will be constantly in doubt about this acceptance by the rest of the community:" Desmond Morris (The Human Zoo, Chapter 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Thus inorder for the creative talented individual to be accepted, society must evolve first..</b></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> No indication of notability. None of the sites you mentioned seek to screen their entries by notability. Several independent filmmakers I know, whose work is extremely obscure and has been seen only at very small local screenings (and in no way qualifies for Wikipedia inclusion), have entries at IMDB and the other sites. Inclusion on those sites have never been considered criteria for inclusion. Public access shows, as has been mentioned, are also not any sort of indicator of notability, nor is acting in local, non-distributed films. Peter, it sounds like you take issue with Wikipedia's notability guidelines in general. This is by no means the place to try to change them -- try the Talk page at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>.

<dd>Where's the "blatant" assumption of bad faith? It's not a personal attack, as I'm talking about his reasoning. Alpharigel says himself that he's judging by the amount of interest "alone" shown in the afd i.e. the amount of text the afd takes up on the afd page. Since he would have come to a discussion where everyone except one (who seems to have personal or professional links with the article subject) has made delete arguments, I'm questioning his logic. I say nothing about whether his logic is good faith or bad faith. I'm calling him on his strange reasoning. Possibly he may be talking about the NYT/IMDB/AMG references but that still sugggests he hasn't read the discussion, but merely scanned it. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You or I don't know how this editor came to their conclusion (nor if the editor is a he or she). "All this interest alone" in no way demonstrates they simply measured the amount of text on an afd screen to reach a conclusion.

<dd>Sigh. You're entitled to your own opinions. People arguing keep based on the amount of discussion in an afd crop up more often than you might think.

<p>My understanding of Wikipedia is that is defines many various and sundry subjects, people, ideas etc. Having been a longtime viewer of Ms. Divine's creative efforts - weekly TV shows, movies etc. I support her fully and wonder why you would delete her from your website?</p>
<p>Any thinking human being should be able to look on this website, get a description of who/what is Ms. Divine or any other entity listed, access the original information referred to, and make up their own mind as to the value of the information thereby derived.</p>

<p>Nobody is arguing for a "keep" based on length. That is an assumption that lacks logic. Users that vote "keep", have a right to. It is unnecessary to take a harsh tone with ones that do..</p>
<p>If you are referring to my response with regard to notability as "spamming". That is an incorrect assumption to judge the length of my response as spamming. In order to debate, I need words, and in this case, I have used words to express my reasons for keeping this article. Yet, this is another case of some administrators that live in a "closed box", and are quick to be sarcastic.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as I have found out, Wikipedia is more about "notability" than comprehensiveness. I concur, philosophically, with the guy who wrote "Wikipedia is deluded" in that I think Wikipedia should consider being more comprehensive in the realm of things in the public sphere (television, radio, newsprint, etc). But, at this moment they are not and as such this article is not notable under the Wikipedia guidelines and practices right now.

<li><b>Questioning this</b> Forgive me: I am not an expert on the criteria for the deletion of articles on Wikipedia.</li>

<p>I noticed that the initial removal was a “speedy deletion”? After reviewing the criteria for this type of removal I did not see how the deletion met the guidelines: patent nonsense or pure vandalism?</p>
<p>I also noticed that regarding notability, verification was an issue. I did a search on Wikipedia for Public Access, found an article on this sight for that subject, scrolled down and saw a link for Queens Public Access, clicked on that site, then their programming schedule and found a listing for the artist’s show, as referenced in her article.</p>

<dd>The speedy deletion criteria applied was probably A7, lack of claim of notability. However, there was evidently some disagreement over that, hence its having been brought here.

<dd><b>Comment</b> First, WalterWalrus originally did not sign his comment and stated that he had not voted, which was a lie, as he had already "voted" (and, in fact, created the article). Second, AfD is not a vote- the person who closes the debate will consider (and, if necessary, give weight to) all comments. Third, the above user was very obviously referring to the fact that "minute" is misspelled "minuet" multiple times in the article; perhaps its original creator, who claims to not have voted, should copyedit it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My thought was that the rationale for voting merge in a deletion debate was to make sure that a worthwhile topic does not drop of the map with the removal of the article (i.e., someone would merge the content before it was deleted). Here, I kind of think that the article should be deleted first, while the debate on inclusion is taken to the page on the school.

<dd>Yes, I reverted your talk page after you deleted two warnings you received about vandalism. As anyone can see who looks at your talk page, those were not the last warnings you received either. I tend to feel that the deletion of said warnings gives newer visitors to your talk page the impression that you have not received said warnings in the past, and is intended to be deceptive.

Just about every argument and complaint that anyone could possibly come up with has been addressed in the talk page over 100's of man-hours of discussions. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 03:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think there is a distinction between <i>NPOV</i> and <i>fair and ballanced</i>. NPOV is the use of neutral language. It is easy to talk about a partisan issue in a neutral tone. <i>Fair and ballanced</i> is where you try to represent both sides equally. But what does that mean? Do you give both sides equal time? Do you give each side equal time proportional to their contribution? After all the 'pro bush' side is not participating in the 'debate'. What if their are multiple sides, how do we calculate what is the right ballance? NPOV is something that can be achieved, it can be argued at the level of individual sentences and phrases. Fair and ballanced is just a matter of opinion. We will never satisfy everyone with such a rule rule, so wikipedia doesn't have it, and rightly so. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzie_9cfb.html" title="User:Mozzie">Mozzie</a> 23:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (What the heck is a "speedy keep"?) Skimming over it (I agree it's too long), my assessment is, while this article may need NPOV improvements, it doesn't seem to be an article <i>promoting</i> the movement. Rather, it appears (to me) to be an article <i>about</i> the movement. Articles <i>about</i> a partisan effort are still valid for an encyclopedia. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 03:22, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's an awfully slanted article because of its reliance on pro-impeachment sourcing and lack of anti-impeachment sourcing. But POV cases are never hopeless. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't catch anything in the entire, looooooong article casting doubt on the move to impeach or showing that it is advocated only by a fringe of the Democratic party in Congress.

Even a well-sourced repository of complaints about Bush is...a repository of complaints about Bush. The "impeachment resolutions" are presented as much more high-profile than they really are. The vast majority of even the most liberal groups don't advocate anything of the sort. Things like "The ImpeachBush.org website claims to have collected over 736,000 signatures (as of September 25, 2006) on a petition to impeach Bush. None are known to have been created to oppose it" feel like <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">weasel words</a> -- could the reason be, perhaps, that this movement is so low-profile that no one would bother to oppose it? I don't see any petitions opposing the movement for the violent overthrow of the US government either -- is this evidence for the movement's success? Of course not. The "rationales for impeachment" section is no better -- this title really just seems to be an excuse to make the article Why Bush sucks and not have it deleted.

<dd>I see "POV fork" thrown around quite often in AfD's -- but you can't label it a "fork" without saying where it forked <i>from</i>. If not here, where else on Wikipedia do we document the people and organizations who want to impeach GWB? If we did it in the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article, it would be too large and would justify a <i>Main article</i> split. That's all this is. In fact, this article was originally created (year or two ago) because the amount of material was overwhelming the GWB article causing a POV unbalance in that article. There was no intentional foul-play ("POV fork") by anyone it just evolved organically like most articles on Wikipedia do when the subject matter becomes long. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 03:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Not really an answer, since whether notability is demonstrated or not is frequently an opinion, not a foregone conclusion, which was the essence of the question. You can't just claim something is non-notable (just as you can't just claim that something is notable); you also have to say why it's not notable. Frequently in these debates (and with PRODed articles) I read the article and am at a complete loss as to why anyone should think it wasn't notable. The deletionists often seem to believe that determination of notability is their prerogative alone, hence the desire of non-deletionists to know their exact reasoning and not just a "NN Delete"-type response. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well it is an answer. Any object by default isn't notable. A good rule of thumb in this regard for when dealing with common objects (such as schools) is that subjects to be notable need to meet some criterion which makes them distinctive from the norm. Hence, people point to age or the point of many notable alumni or something similar. Essentially, what makes this school at all different from any others? If you can't point to anything it isn't notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:14, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I'm sure you know, as far as schools are concerned many people believe that all schools (or at least all secondary schools) are notable, for reasons explained many times over on many different AfDs, and thus the "any object by default isn't notable" argument is disputed with regard to this particular subject. But my point was a general one, as was the original question. Just claiming non-notability without explaining why is, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. Some things are blatantly non-notable to pretty much everybody, true, but many articles that are nominated for deletion <i>do</i> in many people's eyes already establish notability. When notability is obviously clear to some, it is not productive to vote simply NN. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A school, and particularly a public high school, has an inherent claim of notability that no Wal-Mart -- and certainly no individual person -- can ever make. Society seems to have this thing with education and schools that confers an inherent notability for all schools in general, and for each particular one. We are taxed to fund universal public education and required to send our children to school for an education (or to educate them independently). Wal-Mart meets none of these criteria. While I do not believe that every school deserves a Wikipedia article, I do believe that any one of them starts with a greater leg up on notability than does any Wal-Mart store or any individual. While this article will benefit greatly from expansion, the article (as updated) more than meets the minimum standards for retention. I disagree that schools are no more notable than a Wal-Mart (or an individual), which I find to be a particularly poor line of reasoning. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The school meets WP:SCHOOL Criterion 4: "The school has a substantial and unique program, structure, or technique that differentiates it from similar schools." It was on the No Child Left Behind hit list in 2003. It instituted a apecial tutoring program for students with inadequate English skills, emphasizing peer tutoring by seniors in advanced English, and all students were brought up to meet all federal benchmarks by 2005. Many fine high schools have not been so fortunate. This special program and technique diffentiates it from other schools and merits its having an article. The article is still stubby and could use revision.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The Soccerbase link on his page states for Oldham 20+ times, so that establishes his claim to notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Allow time to improve. I don't know the book, it would be more interesting to me if the article was wikified to link it to a discussion of Recovered Memory Therapy, Multiple Personality Disorder, Satanic Ritual Abuse and other such issues of controversial therapeutic practice that were quite crucial at the time, (1996) and are still important now. Then the article would be a good read, if the books'perspective on these issues was discussed. As it stands its a bit like something straight off 'amazon' or another book site, but linked to these issues it would make a good article for me. I supect this is what the books' about, those contemporary issues, discussing the authors views on these issues more to put the book in context would stop it being purely a rave about the book. I was referred here by user smeelgova as we had agreed on a previous article. But I like to think I've been reasonably impartial. I am passing my suggestions on to the article's talk page and smeelgova himself so if there is any value in them hopefully they will be used and the article will improve- for my tastes at least<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerkinsmum_5c9a.html" title="User:Merkinsmum">Merkinsmum</a> 00:38, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But it's not a single. It's not even an aborted single. It's a song that was rumored to be a single but never came to fruition. What circumstances? That it was leaked? Entire albums often leak in this day and age, but the songs on them don't all become notable. That they had trouble clearing the rights for it? Can you imagine how many hip hop songs would become automatically notable if problems clearing rights equated with notability, given the amount of sampling etc. that is done? GassyGuy 03:31, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps. But the only other circumstance where artists fought over a song was over Mariah Carey's "Loverboy" and Jennifer Lopez' "I'm Real" (well, technically, they fought over a loop), and that was certainly notable. And it's not about clearing rights for it because of a sample, so I don't know where the comparison is there. And it IS an aborted single; why else would radio stations have received promos? The leaked version was played on a major radio station (I believe in LA), and remixes were done for the song as well. Remixes usually aren't done for album-only tracks. So this must have been planned as a single, at least for a while. In any case, my vote is...</dd>

<dd>I'm comparing it because it's still about clearing rights, and there are hundreds if not thousands of examples of songs where there have been disputes over rights for usage, be it due to sample usage or what have you. Those disputes are at least legal - these sorts of disputes <i>don't even have legal bases.</i> &lt;shrug&gt; I may be wrong that it isn't an aborted single, but it was still aborted, so it still wasn't a single. It also wouldn't be the first time that album tracks received airplay - I mean, isn't that what FM radio play was all about in the day? Or, for a more modern example, a station or two spun Kelly Clarkson's "Gone," but it too wasn't a single. I just don't see how this has done anything to set it apart from other album tracks.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Theres a school of thought that seems to believe that anything picked up by the Keenspot network instantly makes it a notable work. I don't subscribe to that view at all. Even though the editors at Keenspot may think that its a cool comic which would draw the advertising money in, it doesn't make it notable or popular. Alien Dice is no longer a member of Keenspot. It has an Alexa ranking of <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=aliendice.com%2F" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=aliendice.com%2F" rel="nofollow">700,000</a>, and Wikipedia's awesome advertising board is one of the top sources for <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/ds/linksin?q=link:aliendice.com/&amp;url=aliendice.com%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/ds/linksin?q=link:aliendice.com/&amp;url=aliendice.com%2F" rel="nofollow">incoming links</a>. Why users like Kizor treat Webcomics like a special needs case is beyond me.

When a website still needs to rely on people clicking on votes to topsites such as Alien Dice, it doesn't exactly suggest that it's encyclopedic. There's another comment that comes across a lot on webcomic debates, is that webcomics are such an amateurish new phenomenon that we can't be expected to have reliable sources, well, so is game modding and thats been picked up by the popular press.

<p>This is clearly a non-notable album. The article itself asserts it's non-notability. There is a page for the band, which essentially contains all of the information in the article, so arguably it would be a candidate for a redirect.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I know that, in general, albums by notable artists are considered notable; however, this isn't a full length album, but rather a three track demo with under ten copies pressed. Neat rarity worth mentioning in the band's article if it can be sourced properly, but does not merit its own page. No need to redirect from this title as it isn't even formatted correctly. GassyGuy 04:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect to the band</b>. Even if you do stipulate that albums by notable bands are notable, notability alone does not a worthy article make. If there isn't anything to <i>say</i> about something (like about a 3-track demo, for example), then there isn't an article to be had. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="#F0B400">Che</font> <font color="#004411">Nuevara</font></a> 05:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Surely whether his ideas were "hoakum" or not is irrelevant - what is relevant is whether he and they are known.

<li>This used to be a fairly popular webcomic while it was still updating. How can I prove that, or say anything about this webcomic that isn't sourced to the webcomic itself or to webcomic forums? I can't. This article and this subject, albeit once somewhat popular, fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> miserably, and should be <b>delete</b>d. Comparisons to PvP (covered and reprinted in RPG/card game trade press) and Penny Arcade (widely covered in viceo game press, hosting a yearly national convention), both of which have multiple printed collections, is a red herring. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:29, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have no illusions about AR being comparable to either PvP or PA. I'm just pointing out that in my arrogant opinion Edison's standard is unreasonable. Now, why does failing WEB constitute straight grounds for deletion when it's expressly meant to be applied together with common sense and there's a (so far completely ignored) case to be made for the article? Why is absence of proof the proof of absence, when the article already survived one AfD and <i>especially</i> since it's uncontested that the comic did, in fact, meet the requirements? In fact, how is BradBeattie not liking the result of the first AfD a sufficient change of circumstance to merit having another one? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 12:27, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> While I understand the nominator's point of view, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. After reviewing the reasons found here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_site#Deletion_Reccomended.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_site#Deletion_Reccomended.21" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> as to why the article was nominated, I must disagree with the original nominator. First of all, "grotesque" is a very subjective word and open to multiple interpretations. Second, Wikipedia isn't endorsing these websites by writing an article about them anymore than they are endorsing <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> for writing an article about him. Third, we cannot rely on unreasonable hypothetical scenarios when judging the criteria for deletion. It is unreasonable to delete the article because "a hacker" might come to the page and link one of these websites to someone else's webpage. Using the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> comparison again, we would have to delete that article because it lists his address (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) and thus someone could use that information to harm him. This deletion nomination is therefore unreasonable and should be denied. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 05:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, let me give both sets of arguments at once. My opinion is somewhat neutral, I've been involved in trying to keep this article from being a liability for some time. The reason behind the actual decision to nominate by a new user are along the lines of "this is gross, why should we cover it," but there are definitely reasons to be concerned here. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro deletion: This article is, basically, entirely made up of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Most of the article consists of the list of various shock sites, very few of which have really satisfactory source (<a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a> does, but it has its own article anyway). Although individual sites have some references, a bigger problem is that the non-list part of the article is completely unreferenced, and probably unverifiable. A web search for the term "shock site" on google turns up around half as many hits when we exclude Wikipedia &amp; its mirrors.. and apart from Encyclopedia Dramatica and Urban Dictionary, nothing really comes close to the level of describing the use of the term or defining it; the rest are examples of use. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Con deletion: First of all, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shock_sites.html" title="List of shock sites">List of shock sites</a>, which got merged to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a>, was already nominated for deletion four times: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_3aa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites">1st</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28second_nom%29_6459.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (second nom)">2nd</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28third_nomination%29_e953.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (third nomination)">3rd</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shock_sites_%28fourth_nomination%29_7730.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shock sites (fourth nomination)">4th</a>; each time, the article was kept (the first three debates had "keep" outcomes, while the 4th one was a "no consensus," with a hella lot of participation). Although the content is distasteful, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and this is certainly a notable phenomenon. Finally, this article attracts vandalism and inappropriate edits from new users a lot... but this probably keeps those users from continually creating new articles on their favorite shock sites individually. Also, the article <i>is</i> sourced, even if the sources push the boundary of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, that may be necessary given the kind of topic this article covers. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The source for that one is an official letter from Slashdot complaining about that picture being used for trolling; they ask Rotten.com to move it to a different URL.

<dd>Well, like I said, I think the sourcing is generally sketchy, but this is <i>something.</i> Personally, Rotten.com has a reputation for posting complaint correspondence, and they have no reason to fabricate the letter.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article contains useless sites that can have no benefit to people at all. Maybe friends can joke eachother into going into the sites, but that's about it. These sites are grotesque and need to be removed, along with this whole article. Some of these sites contain pornography, viruses, trojans, and more horrible things. If a hacker gets on someone's site they could come to this wiki, look for one of these sites, and redirect the homepage he is hacking to the shock site. A friend could trick a gullible friend into going to the site. None of these things have any benefits to anyone at all. People don't even need to know this information because it can not benefit them in any way positive, besides for them to make a mental note to never go to that site... This topic needs to be deleted because of these reasons.Sumperson01 23:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>None of those reasons fall under any WP policies I've seen, and like I said, I have used the article in question to avoid finding out what some awful site (I'm a very curious person) by going to it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously the concept itself is valid, it's an observable and reported phenomenom, and itself an outgrowth of more traditional juvenile behavior like <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mooning.html" title="Mooning">mooning</a>. It seems to me that the real problem is that this article includes links to sites that cause this sort of problem. That may be so, but itself is not a reason to remove information from Wikipedia, any more than we remove information about software emulators because people might pirate video games, or information from chemistry articles so people can't make poisons or explosives. Or heck, pick a gun based on information about firearms here. Unfortunate though those risks may be, censoring this site just to avoid a person's possible misconduct is not a viable choice.

<dd>To be fair, many of us who came in early were addressing the original nomination, which didn't really raise this point. I haven't finished sorting through the article, but so far, all of the sources appear to be primary, which is definitely a problem. However, I was thinking perhaps we could go through and purge some of the most egregious violations. First, though, I must question: has there anything been written on the concept of shock sites? If so, then I'd say keep this, as its unsourced but verifiable; if there really isn't anything reliable on the topic, then I will amend my vote accordingly as it becomes unverifiable OR.

<dd>Well, sources and NOR are valid concerns, but I don't see them as especially problematic for this article.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> It's articles like this that severely weaken and cripple Wikipedia's credibility. This is <i>supposed</i> to be an encyclopedia, not a repository of useless, senseless crap, which is what "shock sites" are. Honestly, I can't fathom how anyone who has ever listened to the vision of Wikipedia as espoused by Jimmy Wales can support the inclusion of this or any other junk article. Wikipedia is supposed to <i>add</i> to human knowledge and <i>increase</i> our understanding - <b>that is the purpose of any encyclopedia</b>. Instead, Wikipedia is gradually becoming more and more of not just a pop culture resource (with endless television episode guides and character profiles), but a resource of useless trivia. Even Jimbo has acknowledged these problems. If we want Wikipedia to be taken seriously, if we want Wikipedia to be <b>accepted as an encyclopedia</b>, then we're going to have the cut this crap out of the loop once and for all. If anyone here is interested in the true mandate of this project, which is to help build a free encyclopedia, they will vote to delete. IMHO, anyone who votes to keep this and other articles like it is not interested in this mandate, and is instead contributing to the demise of this fine resource. metaspheres 18:50, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree that the list isn't necessary and will probably just turn the article into a "post your own shock link" page. If this page has a list, it should only contain info on shock sites that are notable enough to have their own articles. I don't believe, though, that the whole article should be deleted, as shock sites are a notable internet phenominon. I also suspect that the user's personal taste may be influencing this deletion nomination. Grotesque or no, Wikipedia is not censored and content shouldn't be removed just because certain users find it offensive.--<a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERouge_Rosado_5aea.html" title="User:Rouge Rosado"><font color="Darkred"><b>Rouge Rosado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../r/o/u/User_talk%7ERouge_Rosado_223f.html" title="User talk:Rouge Rosado"><font color="red"><i>Oui?</i></font></a> 21:09, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The question should not be, <i>"Is it offensive?"</i> but rather, <i>"Is it encyclopedic?"</i> The question of offensiveness is moot. There are plenty of things in any encyclopedia - even Britannica - that one may find offensive. For instance, articles about human anatomy or sexuality. As I have stated in my comment, <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia</a>. The purpose of an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is to inform and educate. This is the goal of Wikipedia and this is why we have <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_1.0_24e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0">Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0</a>. Articles such as this do not conform to the mandate of Wikipedia and if this project is to ever achieve parity with "closed-source" encyclopedias (Britannica, Columbia, Encarta, etc.) these articles <i>will</i> have to eventually be phased out. If not now, then in the near future. But I can assure you that it will happen, and it's already been slowly occurring since late 2005 when it became clear that the quality of articles in the arts and humanities and culture (as opposed to science) leaves much to be desired. Let us not avoid the inevitable but quickly set things into motion. The sooner Wikipedia cleans this junk out, the sooner we will arrive at a high-quality 1.0 release, and even better releases beyond that one. metaspheres 08:29, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Metaspheres, I'm afraid I must disagree. While you may be right to have concerns over the contents of this article, as I'm sure there are folks who see this sort of thing as the place to troll, that's not a reason for deletion. It's a reason for concern, and attention, but this article is still about a real phenomenon, which is itself the outgrowth of yet nother aspect of human behavior. It probably does need some study and documentation, as it is important for the social sciences to study humans as they behave, and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good. in fact, that sort of stick your head in the sand and just believe what you want to believe mindset has been the bane of social science for a long, long time. It really needs study by clear-minded folks, and if Wikipedia wants to help with that, it won't be by deleting this article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>But you see, what you have just described is original research. As far as I know, there are currently no academic works on "shock sites." If Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">original research</a> is still in effect (last I checked, it was), then this is one for the sociologists and culture critics. Once they've come up with a thesis or two and published their findings, then more power to everyone who wants to include this junk. metaspheres 20:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wow. Did you look at those references? Because they (1) don't back up any of the substance of the article, they're only in the list. (2) Even for the sites, some of them are kind of sketchy in backing up the inclusion of the site or its status as a shock site. (3) Not a single one of them is clearly a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 02:36, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but even if I agreed with you about anything being OR in the article, the problem of original research is not so endemic to this article that it warrants deletion. This article isn't about a theory of behavior that leads to the creation of shock sites, but describing a real and observable phenomena, that nobody is going about denying that they exist. There is a wide gap between theory and observation, that sometimes that NOR policy doesn't cover very well. And yes, there are people writing about them, here's a book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1580081371&amp;id=l17ov4anzIMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=rotten.com&amp;sig=cYhsAzKc9xm8zgGMpBVcsM3vL9E" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1580081371&amp;id=l17ov4anzIMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=rotten.com&amp;sig=cYhsAzKc9xm8zgGMpBVcsM3vL9E" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> on the subject of disgusting websites. Not serious and academic, but enough to demonstrate some interest. On TV, there's this report of a Consumer Reports article <a href="http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3644152" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3644152" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which indicates that this exists, not to mention this <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-3320" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.out-law.com/page-3320" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> bit of news which uses the term to describe the actions of the German gov't.

Even though they use different terms, I think it is clear what they are talking about. Since they are a firm providing tech support services, I'm reluctant to add them to the page, but they do show that there is interest in the subject. I suspect there's more in discussions on content-filtering, protecting children, and whatnot, but I must admit, I have little familiarity with them, so I'm not even sure where to look. Still, I don't find your objections, either in terms of what Wikipedia should be, or OR, very persuasive. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think that satisfies the question of whether there is any possibility of any valid sources. I'd prefer something more substantial like this article, but this should show that it can be achieved.

<li><b>Keep</b>. metaspheres argues: "The sooner Wikipedia cleans this junk out, the sooner we will arrive at a high-quality 1.0 release...." I respond that we won't reach 1.0 by screening all 1.4 million articles and deleting those that don't belong. The more common vision of 1.0 is that it would represent a selection from among all the articles. There's a large middle ground of articles that wouldn't go in 1.0 but that shouldn't be deleted. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

The vision of Wikipedia, as outlined by Jimbo, is as a free encyclopedia. Which is to say, an encyclopedia along the lines of a traditional one such as Britannica or Encarta. The only difference being that it is free (obviously) and perhaps just a bit more "liberal" in it's outlook and what is included - for instance, including articles on localities, institutions, software programs, etc. that wouldn't normally be included in a traditional print encyclopedia. But, <i>not</i> so liberal as to go ahead and include articles (such as this one and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a>) which literally add <i>nothing</i> to the "sum of human knowledge" (per Jimbo's original vision) but actually <i>take away</i> from it. I'm serious - articles like this one have become so numerous that like reality shows on television, Wikipedia will begin lowering one's IQ. Most visitors <i>invariably</i> will come across these articles if they spend more than a few minutes here. What you're basically saying is that Wikipedia 1.0 will be the <i>actual</i> encyclopedia and that this, the original Wikipedia, is just a "knowledge base," a repository, if you will. That's fine. Then Wikipedia should redefine itself, and Wikimedia should fork Wikipedia into two, similar to the original setup with Nupedia and Wikipedia. One, the actual encyclopedia with informative, educational articles, and the other, a repository of mostly useless pop and Internet culture references. metaspheres 16:11, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

But if what is there is true, it's a good piece of Inidian hstory that seems deserving of an article.--<a href="../../../s/i/o/User_talk%7ESiobhanHansa_31d8.html" title="User talk:SiobhanHansa">Siobhan Hansa</a> 08:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> In as much as I can make head or tail of it, it appears to be original research in support of an external agenda. I am not satisfied that the article is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, the sources do not allow me to verify that, and I do not have the wherewithall to fix it, so unless it <i>is</i> fixed it should be removed as violating core policies. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 13:02, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I desperately want to say keep on this, because I'm just sure enough about this to think it's worthy, but I'm not sure regarding the source and don't know enough about it to make a clear decision. I'd suggest whoever chooses to close this see if they can get input from someone more familiar with the history and subject (or a similar subject) to get a clearer idea on this one. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless article undergoes a major rewrite and upgrade of sources. As noted above, the writing style is difficult to understand and suggests an author with limited English language skills. The <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">surname</a> of the primary source author matching the subject of the article also raises concerns about the objectivity of the cited sources. While this could be valuable material it appears just a likely that this article is an attempt to promote the importance of a family or clan using private family histories. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 13:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

They are different people and the term sock puppet does not apply to that. They have reacted in that way since they are new to the Wikipedia. Is there a policy in Wikipedia that gives more weightage to an user of Wikipedia who knows absolutely nothing about a topic, rather than experts from that area who are not Registered Users in Wikipedia. Does it mean that once you are a registered user you have every right to pronounce judgements about areas that you have idea or knowledge. This is a disturbing trend. The article is poorly written, but atleast there should be no doubt about the Notability and Verifiability. Can every one who has voted above tell me what all steps they took before telling this is Non Notable and Non-verifiable. AFD should involved active participation and not just "delete" even in areas where one has no knowledge <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 13:24, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Nonetheless a group cannot ensure their article is on Wiki unless it is notable and verificable; which this article fails.

<dd>What all things you want to verify. Tell me some 5 points and we will post the question to the over enthusiastic guys who are trying to defend the article. Many books have been cited. Just because the users in India don't have time to go to library and just because those books are not available online, it does not mean that the sources are false. If there is a doubt, you have to <b>keep</b>. Give them some time to scan and upload.

<dd><i>The only sources to support it is one website and few offline non-English books whose existence cannot be verified</i> The only sources for MOST of India related contents are non English books and 99 % of those are offline.

<li><b>Comment</b>-(May not be provoked) Little Cleaning-up is needed to the article.I agreed!. But no need to delete. Cutting off the head is not a medicine of headache.I can't blindly comment that a community or a caste is non- notable.(Days of untouchability has gone) Union Cabinet recently approved inclusion and modification of certain castes and communities in the Central list of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Castes like Mall-Saindhavar,`Kurmi-Sainthwar' and `Kurmi-Mall' as sub-castes of Kurmi and Unai Sahu have also found place in the list.There were a number of news reports that I have read about their repeated pleas for inclusion in OBC list. Anyway Mall Sainthavar is a community of historical significance.A news report that I have found from The Hindu daily is furnishing herewith-<a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/07/stories/2006010706381200.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/07/stories/2006010706381200.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENileena_joseph_bcd1.html" title="User:Nileena joseph">Nileena joseph</a> 16:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

What should be noted here is that <i>Mall</i> and <i>Sainthwar</i> have been mentioned as sub-castes of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurmi.html" title="Kurmi">Kurmi</a>. But, the article says that Malls and Sainthwars are <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajputs</a> and gives a "historical" account of these castes as Rajputs without any reliable sources/citations. I'd happy to change my vote to keep, if some convincing sources are provided. My reason for voting delete is not that Malls and Sainthwars don't exist. The reason is the article only contains false information. The link provided by you only strengthens the view that the article is Original Research/Hoax/Attempt to rewrite history. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 03:16, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>++++ Respected Utcursch sir ji, if you are considering the OBC list to decide that Mall and sainthwars are subcaste of kurmi, then I think you are trusting on Indian politicians who are greedy about vote. Kurmis and mall-sainthwars don't have marriage relationship. This entire politics was started by one Congress Politician who said that sainthwar kshtriyas should be included in OBC list- just to gain vote. He alongwith some more politicians were successful in doing that but later on court order they were removed from OBC list. Again during 1994, few politicians started the move supported by some local sainthwars to include them in OBC list. That was the time when every caste wanted to be in OBC list to get the benefit of reservation. This time, there was no chance for inclusion in OBC list only by name - sainthwar. So a big game- where by this caste alongwith MALL will be declared as sub-caste of Kurmi and few sainthwars gave written affidavit that they have marital relationship with kurmis to avial benefit of reservation. This was enough for those politicians and by this, these two rajput clans became subcaste of kurmi on government record BUT NOT IN SOCIETY.</p>
<p>Being an Indian you must be knowing that how politicians are playing on the name of caste and religion. How they became nervous after supreme court judgement on creamy layer. What I want to say is that - Instead of wide gap between Mall-sainthwar and other rajputs, there are marriage relations but not a single relation with kurmis except love marriage. I would also like you to visit some villages like Pali, Bhusawul, Bharrohn, Dughra, Danaur.. and get the royal feel. Bharrohn village belongs to BHATI RAJPUT migrated from Jaislemer, Rajasthan. Sir, one can write anything to glorify his past, but what about existing Historical places which are named after Historical events.......

<li>Respected utcursch ji, Your are right if you go by govt. papers. There are two opananion about this too. But some historian has done a lots of research on this topic and most of them are non Sainthwar, they have tried to prove that Mall Sainthwars are rajputs. Actually this is a tiny community and limited mainly to eastern part of U.P. Some are still located in kashmir and Rajshthan. Many Sainthwars.. especially some Malls have a very systematic "vansh chart" (community pedigree chart) which prove their roots to old royal rajput families. If they are a subcaste to kurmi then some questions need to be answred. Why are they found in a limited place (mostly in eastern U.P.)? Why don't they have any relations with kurmis? Why "Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha" recognises them as Rajputs/kshatriya? Why the UP govt once put them out of OBC category? Dear, you know that how vote politics can defy and distort history to gain some personal advantage in India especially in north India, where caste based politics is given prime importance. So don't go by the politics.. <b>wait for complete revised article with many more citation for verification and then give your verdict.</b> Had it been your doubts only then it was most welcome but you have tried to put your thoughts so forcebly as if evrything is very well known to you. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalendrasingh_fb33.html" title="User:Shalendrasingh">Shalendrasingh</a> 07:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>* * KEEP* * * This is regarding the mail by Utcursch where he strongly supported to 'delete' by saying that he is Indain and go on blaming that History is Cooked by Mall - Sainthwars Rajputs. Sir, if you are Indian then kindly visit North India, know diffirent clans of Rajputs and kindly read some books like books Vishen vansh vatika, Kshatriya kalpdrum, Kshatriya kalplata, Kshatriya Rajvansh, Gorakhpur janpad aur iski kshatriya jatiyon ka itihas etc., these books can not be found on internet but that doesn't mean that these books are wrong. Further kindly refer the 16th century battle between Noorjahan Begum and Mahawat khan in Kashmir near Jhelum river.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some places which are named after some historical events. Aine-e-Akbari is not written by Mall and sainthwar rajputs nor we need historical cooking to prove ourself. For some political benefits, one political partiy declared mall-sainthwars as 'sub-caste of kurmi', which I highly condemn. Regarding our existence, you can very well refer to 'Central OBC list' of India. Also I request to visit Rajasthan, place of Rajputs and look for Bhati rajputs in Jaislmer. You will find the link.

<p>This is a psychiatric treatment facility in New York State. Judging from the page history, it was created primarily to disparage the facility, alleging variously that their treatment methods are nonstandard or nonapproved, that they mistreat patients, etc., all either unsourced or sourced to blogs and other non-reliable sources. Recently an evident supporter of the facility has begun editing the article, wildly swinging it the other way, and adding extraneous information about the founders and their methods that do not belong in an article about the facility itself. My requests to the editors to adhere to verifiability and NPOV have gone largely unheeded, so I ran a LexisNexis search to see what I coud find myself. In the last 10 years the only newspaper articles to mention the facility are about other psychiatric issues, naming the director and quoting his opinion on unrelated topics. AND, one case in which a patient drove away from the facility and committed two murders. However this is not proof that their treatment methods are flawed, of that their care is substandard. The newspaper articles do not even allege, much less state as fact, that their security is lax. Fundamentally there are no reliable sources about this treatment facility, so it fails notability and verifiability. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 07:16, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>undecided</b> I am not an objective source as I have positive experiences with SLS which I like to share. Regarding noteworthiness, they are one of the few facilities to offer exposure response prevention treatment for addictions and they are one of only a handful of facilities to use an objective, evidence based tracking system to measure patients progress. They track patients symptoms and improvement over time - this Target Behavior Tracking system is based on Dr. Santoro's Ph.D. thesis. Aside from that the Executive Director of the Wellness Center is a regular expert on Court TV. The people treated usually prefer to stay anonymous and so the lack of sources is not surprising. As the person attacking is very persistent and has now moved to the unprotected discussion page the downside of keeping the page is that it would probably have to be protected and/or patrolled for a long period of time. -- Rrgg 14:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although for the most part well written and sourced, this article consists almost entirely of details of things which people thought <i>might</i> happen during the World Cup (still written in the future tense) but actually didn't. Whilst there was some hooliganism, it was no worse than at any other major tournament and could probably be covered in a couple of sentences in the main World Cup article. On the other subjects (trafficking of women, denial of service attacks, etc) there really isn't anything to say from a post-World Cup point of view.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 07:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, scratch that; I just checked the date of the album's release, which was 2002. If it was a more recent album, the liklihood of its release as a single would be much higher (in which case it would be nice to have a pre-existing article ready to go, just sitting in the history). Considering that Poetic Tragedy is a dead-end article, just deleting it won't affect any links. I've changed my response to reflect that. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 15:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Gotcha. Sorry to be pedantic but here is another example that illustrates my point. Princess_Comfort_Okpudili_Amobi_of_Ogidi This family were rulers only of Ogidi and therefore absolutely not the ruling family of any country - Ogidi is simply a regular sized town, in Anambra State, in Nigeria. Only 6 Google hits on her, two of those being Wikipedia hits and two being Answer.com hits hit. Therefore this person and her family would not seem to fit your critera for being notable for being royal, but you have however seen fit to include the article.

<p>Cambridge University is <i>not</i> a school, and drinking societeies may deserve entries if notorious enough, but this is riddled with inconsistencies which suggest it is a hoax. For a start, if Nick Hancock achieved a first in law (true) in 1976 as stated, he would have been only 14. Hancock is clever, but not that clever! (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Hancock_%28actor%29_acbb.html" title="Nick Hancock (actor)">Nick Hancock (actor)</a> gives details). Secondly, the list of Presidents has Hancock 1976- 1977 and is then empty until 2004. My suspicion is that this club was set up in 2004 and has latched on to a celebrity as a mythical founding father, but in their inebriated state they have failed to research dates properly.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So, by that rationale, any film with notable cast members is a candidate for Wikipedia? That rather suggests to me that a huge number of very bland, uninfluential, middle-of-the-road films are going to end up with articles. My nomination for deletion was predicated on the assumption that the film should have some specific significance in its own right (be it historically, socially, or in its influence on the industry). <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 16:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To answer your question, yes. Middle of the road movies and even horrible movies deserve articles if they are verifiable and national or international releases. A movie doesn't have to have won an award or be Citizen Kane to have an article. That's one advantage of having an online encyclopedia; you can include a lot of extra information that a printed encyclopedia couldn't handle. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:17, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. When you open an encyclopaedia of films, such as <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1579581463</a>, what do you expect to find? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:03, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well if I were looking at a general encyclopaedia (which is the light I have always viewed WP in) then I'd not expect to find documented anything but those films which were industrial milestones, iconic or historically influential. In a specialist encyclopaedia of film, however the field would naturally be much braoder. Your point is well made, and understood.

<li>What matter? How would her having been sent a message clear anything up?

<li><b>DELETE</b>. This article is nothing more than a publicity page. Wikipedia is not a bulletin board for posting advertisements. Interesting that the only contributor to the materials on the article has participated in this deletion discussion by calling the article "her [Brianna's] <i>profile</i> here." Wikipedia is not a place for profiles. MySpace is. I am sure this cute little girl has a lot of potential, but she still has a long way to go before she makes it into an encyclopedia. Best of luck to her, and bye-bye!<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 04:26, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Fans? I see only one fan, that person being yourself. If Brianna Rieffel's alleged fans find the idea of this deletion upsetting, how come they haven't come to the rescue by providing the 3rd party references that were previously requested? Threats to spam the email boxes of other Wikipedians are not an appropriate way to keep an article in the system. I think that Brianna Rieffel is probably a super-great little kid, but she's not an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article yet. Maybe in a few years. I hope to see great things from her in the future. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 18:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!!</b> I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about? There are several other child entertainers that are listed here on Wikipedia and they are ABSOLUTELY ADVERTISING. Do we need to post newspaper articles to make this "notable"? These other child entertainers are ALL advertising on here so why delete this one? Unless you care to delete ALL OF THEM? Why single out this one? This little girl is making a big impact on those affected by hurricane Katrina by the heartfelt song she wrote for and about all those people. She has been on <a href="../../../w/d/s/WDSU_5c49.html" title="WDSU">WDSU</a> TV News, radio on KMRC 1430 which can be found on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_radio_stations_in_Louisiana_f2ae.html" title="List of radio stations in Louisiana">List_of_radio_stations_in_Louisiana</a> and in The TIMES PICAYUNE because of this song. She is donating ALL of the proceeds from her song back to the people of New Orleans. For this article to be deleted would be a serious injustice to this little girl's cause. Like I said, if you delete this one, then you need to delete all of the young entertainers that are on here! User:breezee95

<li>Because, of course, Brianna has so much more public recognition than "all of the rest of the child entertainers". <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 04:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No more no less. She should be treated equal. The other "articles" on these other child entertainers are clearly advertisements, just as you claim this one to be. All of these kids have positive messages to send this world, so let them speak and quit trying to delete it. It's starting to sound like you have some "personal issue" with this particular child entertainer. Otherwise move on to getting someone else deleted. user:breezee95
<ul>
<li>I am not sure I fully understand why someone is working hard to get Brianna Rieffel's profile deleted. Granted, she is a little girl so she would not have a extensive history to mark as accomplishments. She is a survivor of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and has written a song to express her feelings over the "promises that were broken". Since Hurricane Katrina has been one of the biggest natural disasters the United States has ever witnessed, to find someone so young who wants to express the feelings of tens of thousands of people in such a positive way by writing and recording a song about those feelings are remarkable. Remarkable in the way that she has no plans to profit from Katrina (many have), but has choosen to give the proceeds back to building schools in Louisanna, to me, is a postive in keeping her profile on Wikipedia. In my opinion, you can never give children enough examples of positive, child role-models. Brianna will be a huge success regardless of whether she makes the pages of Wikipedia or not. user:AGTGrasshoppa</li>
<li>That's very nice. When she <i>does</i> become a huge success, then she will have met our guidelines for notability, and she can have an article about herself. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 17:05, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think the child, Brianna, cares either way if she is listed on this site or not. I don't think that is the issue here, delete her if that is your goal. Personally, I see no harm on leaving her profile on Wikipedia. It doesn't take up unnecessary space and after reading just one entry on the homepage about Ramu in the category of "famous monkeys" I have to wonder how this particular monkey became so "notable". Now I ask "why this monkey and not others?" Forgive me for comparing a talented 10 year old child to a pesky monkey whos only claim to fame seems to be biting people.user: AGTGrasshoppa</li>

Yet, she gets no press, no attention, and rejection from idiots sites like Wikipedia. She gets profiled on Wikipedia and her fans were estatic. Only for those morons to drop her because it "did not follow their guidelines". Who needs them? She has three things: her family, friends and fans. You just wait until a country superstar finds out about her and asks her to go on tour. Heck, don't be surprised if she sings the National Anthem at a Tennessee Titans NFL or Nashville Kats Arena Football game. She's that talented!</i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – regarding which tower this actually is: the Brighton article recently had mention of this building added to it, in addition to an apparently separate "Marina Tower". (I removed the latter because it was a link to a building in Swansea, though I understand from the above that there is to be a Brighton Marina Tower too.) Certainly, the reference to neighbouring Sussex Heights (reference made in the Brighton article, and presumably in this article too, although here it's written "Sussex House") places the tower in the heart of Brighton, not at the marina. Also, just to clarify, my nomination isn't just to open the discussion, it's also a <b>delete</b> "vote". The place for this, <i>if anywhere</i>, is in the Brighton article or perhaps <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmarks_and_notable_buildings_of_Brighton_and_Hove_5eec.html" title="Landmarks and notable buildings of Brighton and Hove">Landmarks and notable buildings of Brighton and Hove</a>. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 01:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b>I'm not going to argue it all relentlessly to be honest as I have other projects both on wiki and elsewhere which are consuming all my time. So I have to apologise and say I can't sift through the internet and papers to uncover sources about the tower in media. All I can tell you is this tower will be a.) one of the tallest buildings in the United Kingdom and Europe, b.) It will have a massive local impact and most of all c.) it will likely be a British landmark, known by just about everyone in the UK and many from the US, Europe and elsewhere within 10-20 years time. Its being made by the designers of the London Eye....that in itself suggests this is not just going to be some small tower block affair. For that reason it really does deserve its own article. I'm a very impartial wikipedian, speaking up in an AfD is really very out of character for me, and as a resident of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> I have a somewhat unique perspective on it. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 22:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

But now am unsure as per the other post highlighting similar concerns above. I recommend a redirect to i360 tower perhaps or deletion is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 14:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an article about a screenplay by a webcomic artist. Parts of the screenplay has been published as a regular feature on the website.

<li><b>Keep</b> I understand the concerns about this article, but must stress that the screenplay <i>is</i> in the works as a motion picture, the article <i>is</i> under construction as details of the production are released, and this article <i>is</i> being written in response to demand (from a considerable fanbase) for a reputable source of factual information on the subject. As far as verifying the information goes, there will very soon be an IMDB entry relevant to all of these concerns and cementing the production as 'notable', but the entry <i>cannot be created</i> without the wikipedia pages on Krzykowski's projects as third-party references. I have already explained this difficulty to Scientizzle, who suggested suspending the creation of these pages until we have the IMDB reference, but as I have already said: For the IMDB reference, we need wikipedia pages. Even so, this is an article about a developing motion picture, in which there is a great deal of public interest - not about 'a screenplay by a webcomic artist'. I feel there is a basic misunderstanding of the nature of TMWKHATTB.
<p>Oh yes, and I strongly suspect that Bruce Campbell was not entirely out of mind when Krzykowski wrote it. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 22:54, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"this article is being written in response to demand [...] for a reputable source of factual information on the subject", "the [IMDB] entry cannot be created without the wikipedia pages on Krzykowski's projects as third-party references" — This is clearly a gross abuse of Wikipedia as a publisher of first instance, to host the original never-before-published documentation for a film, with the intent of citing Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a> elsewhere. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a publisher of first instance nor a free wiki hosting service</a>.

<li>As I said in the Fishermen discussion, it seems on more recent information about the IMDB process that my previous comment was misjudged and factually incorrect - for this I apologise, I am relatively new to wikipedia and know nothing about the processes these films are going through besides what I have been told as a member of the fan community. Nevertheless I stand by the fact that the articles were not created for the purpose you suggest. It is not a case of 'never-before-published' documentation, because as I have said, the demand for the article was for a logically compiled source of information <i>that is otherwise disorganised and hard to find</i>. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 12:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As with the article on TMWKHATTB, I feel the notability is being severely underestimated. While <i>Fishermen</i> has never been commercially released, it has played in filmhouses, it has been showcased to producers, it has been widely downloaded and viewed through the homepage, and it has been shown (as mentioned in the article itself) at a film festival. The article has been written in response to demand from fans, and even if we put aside its status as an independant film, it is notable as being a 'back yard' movie that earned its creator a hollywood contract. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 23:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think I have mentioned already that these articles are still under construction...I am most willing to add any relevant information that is required, but I have spent more time today trying to get through all the complaints levelled at me than I have actually adding content. My point in any case is that <i>Fishermen</i> has had a great deal of public exposure and <i>the article is in response to demand for a factual resource</i>. Surely 'notability' comes down in the end to whether it is something people are likely to come looking for in an online encyclopaedia. The answer in this case is undeniably 'yes', as it was public pressure that prompted its creation. Even so, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> clearly states itself to be a <b>guideline</b> and not a Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 23:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For the record, "the public wanted it created" is a poor argument. Can you cite a source for this claim? I have a <i>very</i> hard time believing that people around the world were thinking "Man, that Wikipedia is okay, but if it had an article about <i>Fisherman</i>, it'd be awesome!", or anything even remotely similar.<br />
And yes, you're right, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> isn't a policy (yet); however, it is the closest thing we have to a guideline on the matter. In cases where there <i>aren't</i> specific rules about something, open discussions such as this one are all the more important. That said, there <i>still</i> isn't evidence to prove this movie's notability. Do you have <i>anything</i> other than "public pressure prompted it"? Anything <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>? <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 05:07, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is an impossible situation - what you're asking me to verify is the pressure from the fan following, without referring to a 'self-published' website, which is the very place that hosts the news blogs, reactions to news blogs, forums and fan discussions. I can supply a link to the original thread in the fan forum that greeted Fishermen's online launch, for what it's worth. All I can say to you is that there is considerable interest in a wikipedia article on this topic, mostly <i>because</i> its popularity outweighs the reliable information currently available about it. I feel like a snake chasing my own tail. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 11:30, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, I think you will find that I quite clearly stated the reasons for writing the pages as being response to demand for a reliable article bringing together what has until now been very loosely collated factual information (<b>not</b>, I might add 'never-before-published') . While I am doing my utmost to find the kind of third party citations wikipedia asks for, this is not a straight forward task due to the nature of the topics and the restrictions of the internet. The IMDB entry I mentioned was <i>not</i> the <b>reason</b> for the writing of these articles, and I never suggested that it was. What I meant to demonstrate was that there was an IMDB entry in the offing, which would allay 'notability' concerns but that there continued to be a similar issue with the availability of suitable citations. The fact is that the IMDB entry does not rely on the wikipedia articles. They would <i>help</i> a heck of a lot, and it would mean that after a short grace period everyone would have their citations, and the articles would be able to fulfill their primary purpose of fully and factually informing people. I am not involved in the IMDB process, and I am party to no more information on the productions than any other fan, so I can't speak for that side of things - it's just an issue that I was aware of that I thought relevant to the 'notability' concerns. I apologise unreservedly if I have caused or been the subject of misunderstandings as a result. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 12:32, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An IMDB listing would <i>not</i> allay notability concerns. We have a very strict policy regarding what can and cannot be listed; IMDB, as far as I can tell, does not. (for example, *I* am actually on IMDB, but that doesn't parlay into a wiki article) <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 14:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I addressed this in the discussion of TMWKHATTB - it turns out this was in fact a factual error on my part, for which I apologise, but in either case I did not say that this was <b>why</b> the articles were written. The IMDB issue came to my attention after the articles were begun, and I thought (again, apparently mistakenly) that it would be relevant to the situation. I feel that these articles are being persecuted with some amazing vehemence - they are factual, they are in popular demand, they are relevant to a number of notable motion pictures in production and an acclaimed artist, and I am entirely willing to give the references they lack, but I am only a fan trying to write about something I have no direct contact with; I can't wave a magic wand and make hollywood producers bare all. In the case of Fishermen, I will be able to give sources and reference to third party articles, but they are not instantly available to me. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinestra_785e.html" title="User:Kinestra">Kinestra</a> 16:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I should have said "official elected to a national legislature" or some such. However, saying he wasn't an elected official because only some people had the vote is like saying Abraham Lincoln wasn't an elected official because presidential candidates were picked by a small number of party delegates (and voted on only by white men). Manners was according to the laws of his country of his day an elected official on the national scene. Edited to add: please don't lecture me on what I "should" know.

If we're going to get rid of non-US legislators because they were "handpicked lackeys", we'll have to get rid of articles on thousands of US legislators as well, so why pick on non-US legislators? I'm sure you realize that most US senators were once hand-picked by state legislatures or by governors personally, and that most junior representatives were hand-picked to run by more senior politicians.

The consensus seems to be that if one is the member of a legislative body, one merits an article.

<p><i>Editors should remove any controversial material about living persons that is either unsourced, relies upon sources that do not meet standards specified in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, or is a conjectural interpretation of a source…These principles apply to biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia….</i></p>
<p><i>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if derogatory, should not be used at all. Information found in self-published books, newspapers, or websites/blogs should never be used, unless written by the subject.</i></p>
<p><i>If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources.</i></p>
<p>There are two versions of this page <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Grove_0df1.html" title="Bohemian Grove">Bohemian Grove</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_Club_9726.html" title="Bohemian Club">Bohemian Club</a>. The AFD applies to the first only, as the second only needs some editing. I am asking that Bohemian Grove be both deleted and protected from recreation.</p>
<p>Between the main page and the talk page we have allegations of child prostitution, sexual harassment, involvement in an "ancient Canaanite, Luciferian, Babylon mystery religion ceremony", etc. with those attending including Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan, Dwight D. Eisenhower, William Jefferson Clinton, Robert Novak, Jimmy Carter, John Kerry,</p>
<p>The original article was created on 7 November 2003, with the only source cited being <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">Alex Jones (radio)</a>. The proper name for the club is the Bohemian Club, however, Jones sells a video titled “Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove” so we have an article titled Grove instead of Club -the name of the club’s compound instead of the name of the club. IMO Jones used “Grove” as it sounds more pagan/sinister than “Club”; whatever his reason, his usage is the reason for the current page title. The only reason for someone to look-up “Bohemian Grove” on Wikipedia is to validate Jones’s claims, which seems to be the main reason for this page existing. If someone had never been exposed to Jones, and wanted information about the club, they would use the correct name “Bohemian Club”.</p>

<dd>
<ol>
<li>Neither the Bohemian Club nor the Bohemian Grove are people. Thus the WP:BLP does not apply to the article. Specific details about people within the article may need to be edited but this is not cause to delete the article.</li>
<li>The Bohemian Club is an organization. The Bohemian Grove is a place. The two are as different as " <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Defense_b846.html" title="United States Department of Defense">The Department of Defense</a>" is different from "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">The Pentagon</a>" <u><b>The Bohemian Grove has its own unque history and purpose, apart from the Bohemian Club.</b></u></li>
<li>I saw no defamatory information about any living person or individual.</li>
<li>Lack of References is not cause for articles to be deleted. Instead, they should be improved. If notes and footnotes are needed regarding either the Club or the Grove, they should be requested rather than the article deleted. Either that or a bunch of articles should be deleted.</li>
<li>However the article is actually pretty well referenced, but it is not <i>footnoted</i>. The references are in other sections labeled "See Also" or "Further Reading" which is not particularly wikipedia standard, but it is still references.</li>
<li>There are kooks who see demons and so on in the actions in the Grove. In the interest of NPOV their views should not be cause for deletion. However, alternative views should be sought. I have sought them and they are not easy to find, so their lack of existance here is not direct evidence of bias. But if the article is biased... improve it, do not delete it.</li>
<li>The two articles LOOK similar because of lists of people (which should be verified) but the lists are actually different and so is the content of the articles.</li>
<li>However, if two articles is one too many they should be merged (with redirect) not deleted.</li>

The larger problem is that in validating any of the conspiracy theories, or appearing to treat them as being potentially creditable, we have given underpinnings to all. If someone makes ten claims, and Wikipedia treats three as being potentially creditable, it becomes harder to dismiss the other seven outright.</dd>

<dd>I am not in agreement with Merge because they are two different things: A club (with separate address and activities) and a High-end Camp Resort owned by the club but with its own unique history, purpose and significance.</dd>
<dd>As far as the comments about being forced into sexual acts with boys... this is ONE SMALL Paragraph nearly at the end of the article under a section clearly labled "Controversies". It is verifiable and referenced (though it could be referenced better). It does NOT violate any wikipedia standards and it is written in standard news / summary style. The problem that you are having is with wikipedia standards. Your idea that including allegations is a bad idea might be a good one. I would support it. But I would have you note that there are problems with it too. For example, Bill Clinton faced numerous allegations that were never proved in court or substantiated regarding sexual misadventures. Bill O'Reilly had a lawsuit with many lurid details filed against him. These were not sustained in court but they are significant events and reasonably included in any encyclopedia. So what rule could you establish that would allow those things in but NOT permit the same thing related to Bohemian Grove?</dd>
<dd>Finally, I would point out that merging does not get rid of that content. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 14:41, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If this article is derogatory and controversial, then label it that way let people make up their own minds. Maybe wikipedia should create a category for this very thing. It's is controversial and derogatory and maybe some dismiss the citations but people should be given the opportunity to make decisions for them selves. I would suggest that they create a category conspiracy theories or just theories, because some times all you have are theories, and what make one persons theory more credible then another. Like evolution for instance, there is evidence but not conclusive thus evolution is a theory, a credible one at that but its still a theory and people should treat it like that. Let people make up their own minds and let them examine this evidence and any claims people make. It's the only way it will be able to move past a theory. It's the only way people will investigate it and gather more evidence to prove it. Its how science works, publishes an interpretation of a evidence, a theory and others examine it and add to the body of evidence to either prove or disprove it. You cant just dismiss some thing because its controversial. If we did that we would be no better then those who killed Galileo. Don't delete, don't merge because its controversial and when or if it is disproved leave it there and let people decide.165.146.80.83 01:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did you even look at them? There are several. There is nothing particularly unusual that they attend -- it is covered in the ordinary press as "incidental". It is a vacation for them. For example, Bill Clinton went there and the press almost ignored it. You can read that he went there a year after the fact in an article by Alexander Cockburn, for the September 1995 edition of <i>The Nation</i>, (by the way, that would be a reference if you need one) but he wasn't talking about the Bohemian Grove, he was talking about Bill Clinton going on vacation to Yellow Stone Park and mentions that last year he went to Bohemian Grove. My point here is that it is not a scandalous thing, nor an unexpected thing that rich and powerful people attend a campground club designed for rich and powerful people to <u><i>routinely</i></u> attend. That George Bush attended is also attested to in several sources. For example, the Sonoma County Free Press has published a list of people who have spoken at the "Lakeside Talk" at Bohemian Grove. <a href="http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/bohos/highlights.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/bohos/highlights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/bohos/highlights.html</a> It includes George Bush. It is not a scandalous thing. It is, in fact, a matter of distinction and an honor rather than something that would lead to libel per WP:BLP, so on both counts: Lack of sources and on danger of libel I do not understand this concern. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 19:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have any sources I can cite though I do know for a fact that CBC Radio One, in September/early October, aired a program about the origins of the phrase 'bad chinese drivers'. The stereotype came from the time when many Hong Kong imigrants were able to come to B.C. and illegally purchase driver's licences. The program briefly listed some other negative stereotypes of the time including HongCouver. I can also from my own experiences, have only heard the term used a couple times and in a degratory manner. I'm not strongly passionate about this article, but I do believe in Wikipedia's NPOV and the quality of articles. We could spend all day trying to find out whether the term has negative or descriptive properties. I suggest we follow the evidence and look more to its validity. If any notable sources: City of Vancouver, Mayor's Office, B.C. Government, Federal Government, recognize the name, it should stay, otherwise it is a slang term and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> prevails. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw">Mkdw</a> 01:24, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LOL. ROTFL. More fake mythology about "racist undertones" which, as we all know, is what lies underneath white skin, at least as far as anybody who doesn't have white skin sees it. "Bad Chinese drivers" was a common phrase in Vancouver LONG before the 1980s-era influx, and is not a stereotype except insofar as many people seem intent on fulfilling it. No kidding. And we had other kinds of bad drivers, too - people from the land of yellow licence plates (Alberta), Fraser Valley farmers, Sunday drivers, people from Montreal/Ontario who assume BC's driving laws are the same as their own; bad Alberta drivers, bad Ontario drivers, bad greyhair drivers, pig-headed Fraser Valley farmers, the advent of the Greeks in Kitsilano in the '70s, and much more; feeling singled out by equating people's complaints about ACTUAL BAD DRIVING by hiding behind the endless whine about white racism against the Chinese don't matter piffle as far as the truth of the situation goes. It's not about race, it's about culture <i>and actual driving habits/customs</i>; one reason other than the simple absence of driving regulations/driver testing in some countries explains why "yield" and "stop" signs were ignored (and continue to be), and help "the rest of us" understand why the Chinese politicos/SUCCESS were so hot-to-trot to stop the prosecution of the 150,000-300,000 cases of bribing public officials that were ensuant upon the influx, where "cultural differences" were cited as the reason why Chinese immigrants thought that bribing officials was OK, and having a bought-and-paid-for drivers' license was also OK, but there was NO WAY it was OK to prosecute the perpetrators because, since 98% of them were Chinese, "it would have been racist" to proceed. But oh, wait, I should be talking about <i>before</i> the influx, as promised: blind/rude Chinese drivers have been a fact of life on Vancouver's East Side since immigration was opened up again in the 1950s; and it's not because they're racially Chinese, it's because they're still driving in an Asian context; multiculturalism on the roads has been a disaster. And to hear someone trot out yet another bit of fake history that this term was created as a result of the influx shows just how far in denial people are about owning up to things, instead of pretending it's someone else's fault/wrongdoing. How do I know this? Hmm. Probably by having been run down by a Chinese driver who didn't like me riding my bicycle in his way, and by being witnesses to accidents where, frankly, you have to wonder what the person was thinking (two in recent months) and where clearly "bad driving" - disrespectful, dangerous driving - was clearly the cause. And the perpetrators were clearly Chinese (and I <i>do</i> know the difference between Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos and others; and "bad Chinese drivers" is apparently a phrase known in the local argot in Manila, Bangkok, and elsewhere. So grow up and get over it, and get your parents to realize that, while they may drive sanely, a lot of people show up here from HK and Mainland China with no regard for local laws or customs, on the road or otherwise.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the bulk of those "warnings" were from axe-grinding revisionists, and I recall that the majority of the "several" were from the same person (HongQiGong); their own insults and personal attacks on me I didn't bother citing wikipolicy on them the way they did on me, but theirs were far worse. So much easier to make an allegation and consider it a conviction, I suppose. I'm polemical by style and inclination but not as "personal attack"; only in calling spades spades, and familiar enough with my own history and culture to know when it's being slandered by somebody who has an agenda against it (as with HongQiGong) or, as in your case, somebody who's been here for twenty years who doesn't know the whole situation/history and has been propagandized by "official media"; or as in Yuje's case (someone else from the pages where HongQiGong and I have crossed paths), someone who knows a lot about Chinese immigration/life in the US, and is insistent/incredulous that it is any different here. As for the CBC airing that sow on "bad Chinese drivers", the CBC is hardly an impartial source; Calling what people racist for observing that new-Chinese immigrants drive differently/badly "racist" is one of those over-reaches of current p.c.prejudicialism that, while they may be all very earnest and self-righteous, are entirely misplaced. My apologies for any personal slight towards you - had I known you were a WikiGod I might have stepped a little more carefully; or not. I'm getting tired of the rewrite of BC's history and culture to flatter the various new elements, whether they're from TO or HK. My First Nations friends know what I'm talking about, and sympathize; but of course in any arena where someone else has power over what can or can't be said it's easy enough to shut someone down, as you've just threatened to do. Fine - Wiki would lose a major contributor on BC historical and geograpical articles, with dozens of articles on the backburner yet more to go, and someone who knows the early history of the province to sort out the mumble-jumble that's too common about it; no point in giving you examples; just examine my edit history; don't just judge me on HongQiGong's endless whining (I've given up on edplaining to him why he's wrong, as he'd just call me a white racist - and in a mocking tone, as if I was stupid, which obviously I'm not). Anyway, I know an AfD page isn't the place for an exegesis like this so I'll leave this off; further dialogue on issues raised welcome via email or on my talk page.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:16, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article resulted from the lengthy (and similarly irrelevant) section about it that at one time existed on the Vancouver page. Its content has been trimmed back recently, but expanded and tends toward discussing various aspects of the HK-annexation era influx to Vancouver; content that could/should be on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chinese_immigration_to_Canada_ef7c.html" title="History of Chinese immigration to Canada">History of Chinese immigration to Canada</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinatown_%28Vancouver%29_9350.html" title="Chinatown (Vancouver)">Chinatown (Vancouver)</a>; I actually think, given the special nature of Chinese society in Vancouver, that the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Chinese_immigration_to_Canada_ef7c.html" title="History of Chinese immigration to Canada">History of Chinese immigration to Canada</a> article needs complementing by a History of Chinese people in British Columbia or something of that kind; that where some of this latter-day content could go, as well as the discussion (unresolvable) as to whether HongCouver is derogatory or not (see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Orient_4354.html" title="Talk:The Orient">Talk:The Orient</a> for more on doublespeak/denial and the re-tooling of vernacular English to suit politically-correct biases). HongCouver is not in common use - an earlier version of this article omitted the "not" from that opening sentence; I inserted it - and does not deserve an article, except perhaps one discussing the various claims against it; on the one hand, as claimed/presumed by some new immigrants, it's a flattering term alluding to Vancouver's synthesis/transfer of HK's culture and population, to long-time Vancouverites it's an uncomfortable reminder that the city we knew is no more, to the resentful types it's proof that the people who find it uncomfortable are racist, er, white, er, racist, er, white.... (they have a problem telling the difference).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 05:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>keep: hongcouver is a very accurate description of vancouver, there is a 30% asian population and its only increasing, they might as well rename the city hongcouver there probally will be hardley a white anglo saxon left there in 50 years</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I hope I'm weighing in my thoughts correctly as outlined in the guidelines. I created this article. I did it to give information regarding this person's new band, which is seperate from his Idol career, and thus (in my opinion) should be seperate from his personal page. I thought it would be useful to be able to link from one page to another to give people a chance to read more of about the band itself and alone from the person. FYI: I am also one of the contributors to the band's website, and have permission to use the content from the site and have the photographer's permission to use the photo (if there is a way I should have credited that, forgive me). I also disagree that it is nothing more than advertising. "Buy Our Album" is advertising, this is information.. articles about other bands, movies, actors, artists, books, writers, etc are permitted in the encyclopedia and are not considered advertising for their work, correct? --LLFRyan 08:45, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable phrase supposedly based off of an Internet image, however Google doesn't know it. The article appears to be an attempt to direct viewers toward the image, going so far as to tell how you can find the image in Google (hint: don't search for "Paint the Possum").

<p><b>Keep</b> The article has already been cut down considerably several months ago. The author is involved in Christian-Islamic dialogue in Southeast Asia and beyond. In the light of the many misunderstandings between the world's two largest religious communities, his contributions have been widely publicized, recently also in Singapore's leading daily newspaper Straits Times. It would be good if the discussion on this article could be less polemical and more scholarly.</p>
<p>Moreover, I wonder why this obviously strong, one is almost tempted to say "personal interest" in deleting or vandalizing it??? With regard to hits: try first "google" and other search engines. I would be glad if other scholars (!) could enter into this discussion. Moreover, with regard to "self-promoting" etc.: the links to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore (recently rated as among the world's top ten in the fields of sciences, although not a "Western", American, university) has NOT been added by the article's author. In the past, as in the case of earlier attempts to delete or vandalize this site for whatever reason, I had to lament certain prejudices, in particular by certain North American contributors. Again, it would be good to get the views of other, perhaps a bit more scholarly contributors.... By the way, the articles mentioned had not been on the Pope's visit to Singapore (which has not taken place anyway, but on his invitation to dialogue to Muslim scholars). JSTOR is ok, but not necessary telling. Marcinkowski published also under his Muslim name "Ismail Marcinkowski", but anyway, it's up to you guys, I just don't appreciate that aggressive tenor of the one who is again advocating its deletion....

<p>Was originally put up for speedy deletion per A7, but I removed the tag and decided to send to AfD. I did some research and it appears to be notable (using Google and Alexa to back up this claim).

<li>Using Google news and Lexis-Nexis I can find only one article where BPN is featured, and it's in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, practically BPN's "hometown paper." <b>Delete</b> unless <s>more</s> other reliable non-trivial third-party sources can be found. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:37, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I totally agree it's reliable.

<li><b>Keep</b> Counting Google hits is a <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Ventura_0ea7.html" title="Jesse Ventura">sham</a> and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers, but BPN was actually featured in numerous news articles outside the Bay Area (45 at Newsbank, although with a number of duplicates.

The one exception is the Guardian article, which is a column not an article. Don't think there's enough here to establish notability of BPN, by analogy with existing notability guidelines which generally require multiple non-trivial sources. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 00:13, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note:</b> Dina says that "poo poo blowjob" only gets 2 google hits; however we can rename this article and <b>keep</b> it if there is a similar taboo act which actually exists. Also, I believe that "ZFU 738" is a license plate number of a car that a former <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarenceville_School_District_24a3.html" title="Clarenceville School District">Clarenceville</a> student drives; and why would a user use a familiar license plate number as a username? isn't that disturbing? --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarenceville_Trojan_717e.html" title="User:Clarenceville Trojan">Clarenceville Trojan</a> 00:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The point is that we already have an article that describes this taboo act -- <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coprophilia.html" title="Coprophilia">coprophilia</a>.
