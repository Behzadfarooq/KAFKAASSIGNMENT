<p>The <b>art of Australia</b> usually refers to non-Aboriginal art and often neglects to include one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world - that is, those of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_of_Australia_a704.html" title="Edit section: Early Colonial Art">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Colonial Art</span></h2>
<p>The first descriptions of Australia by European artists were mainly "natural-history art", depicting the distinctive flora and fauna for scientific purposes. <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Parkinson_629e.html" title="Sydney Parkinson">Sydney Parkinson</a>, the plant draftsperson on <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cook_83d3.html" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>'s 1770 voyage that first charted the eastern coastline of Australia, made a large number of such drawings under the direction of naturalist <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Banks_e3ea.html" title="Joseph Banks">Joseph Banks</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Banks' suggestions, no professional natural-history artist sailed on the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Fleet_d34c.html" title="First Fleet">First Fleet</a> in 1788, so until the turn of the century all drawings made in the colony were by soldiers, including naval officers <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Raper_8fe1.html" title="George Raper">George Raper</a> and John Hunter, and convict artists, including Thomas Watling. However, many of these drawings are by unknown artists. Most are in the style of naval draughtsmanship. Most of these drawings were of natural-history topics, specifically birds, and a few depict the infant colony itself. Many of these drawings were met with scepticism when taken back to Europe, for example claims that the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platypus.html" title="Platypus">platypus</a> was a hoax.</p>
<p>Several professional natural-history illustrators accompanied expeditions in the early 19th century, including <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Bauer_4934.html" title="Ferdinand Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a> (who travelled with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Flinders_d24d.html" title="Matthew Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a>), and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles-Alexandre_Lesueur_cc97.html" title="Charles-Alexandre Lesueur">Charles-Alexandre Lesueur</a>, who travelled with a French expedition led by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Baudin_e3a8.html" title="Nicolas Baudin">Nicolas Baudin</a>. The first resident professional artist was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lewin_7356.html" title="John Lewin">John Lewin</a>, who arrived in 1800 and published two volumes of natural-history art.</p>

<p>As well as natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of Aboriginals, particularly in the 1830s. This is aligned with a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic.html" title="Romantic">Romantic</a> tradition of the 'noble savage', now much aligned for it's implicit <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_darwinism.html" title="Social darwinism">social darwinism</a>. Artists include <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Earle_d851.html" title="Augustus Earle">Augustus Earle</a> in New South Wales and in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Art in Australia from 1788 onward is often narrated as the gradual shift from a European sense of light to an Australian one. The lighting in Australia is notably different to that of Europe, and early attempts at landscapes failed to reflect this.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_Martens_787d.html" title="Conrad Martens">Conrad Martens</a> worked from 1835 to 1878 as a professional artists, painting many landscapes. He was commercially successful. His work, though, is regarded as softening the landscape to fit European sensibilities. Another significant landscape artist of this era was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Glover_%28artist%29_05f9.html" title="John Glover (artist)">John Glover</a>.</p>
<p>A few attempts at art exhibitions were made in the 1840s, which attracted a number of artists but were unfortunately commercial failures. By the 1850s however, regular exhibitions became popular, with a huge variety of art types represented. The first such was in 1854 in Melbourne. An art museum, which eventually became the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Gallery_of_Victoria_3b8e.html" title="National Gallery of Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>, was founded in 1861, and began to collect Australian works as well as gathering a collection of European masters. Some of the artists of note included <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_von_Guerard_abd9.html" title="Eugene von Guerard">Eugene von Guerard</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Strutt_38cf.html" title="William Strutt">William Strutt</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Buvelot_f7bc.html" title="Louis Buvelot">Louis Buvelot</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_of_Australia_a704.html" title="Edit section: Heidelberg School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Heidelberg School</span></h2>
<p>The beginnings of Australian art are often popularly associated with the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heidelberg_School_7a74.html" title="Heidelberg School">Heidelberg School</a> in the 1880s. The Heidelberg school focused on achieving a truer account of Australian lighting conditions than had been achieved before. Some see strong connections between the art of the school and the wider <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionist.html" title="Impressionist">Impressionist</a> movement, while others point to earlier traditions of plain air painting elsewhere in Europe. Sayers states that "there remains something excitingly original and indisputably important in the art of the 1880s and 1890s", and that by this time "something which could be described as an Australian tradition began to be recognized".</p>

<p>Leading up to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the decorative arts, including miniature, watercolour painting, and functional objects such as vases, became more prominent in the Australian arts scene. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Lindsay_9597.html" title="Norman Lindsay">Norman Lindsay</a>'s works caused considerable scandal around the turn of the century. One famous drawing, <i>Politice verso</i>, caused his first scandal, as it depicted a "writhing bacchanal of nude Romans" giving the thumbs-down to "a scrawny figure hung on a cross". By this time, women's artworks started to attract wider attention, such as the pastels of Florence Rodway, or the paintings of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Cossington_Smith_5d40.html" title="Grace Cossington Smith">Grace Cossington Smith</a>, who painted the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_c7db.html" title="Sydney Harbour Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> as it was being constructed.</p>

<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">modernist</a> art began to make its presence felt in the Australian art community, causing considerable controversy between its practitioners and detractors (though this is probably an oversimplification). 1921 saw the founding of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Prize_5165.html" title="Archibald Prize">Archibald Prize</a>, Australia's most famous art prize, for <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portraiture.html" title="Portraiture">portraiture</a>, though defining portraiture has always caused controversy - most notably in 1943 when <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Dobell_b2d7.html" title="William Dobell">William Dobell</a>'s highly figurative portrait of an artist friend won the prize and was challenged in court on the basis that it was a caricature, not a portrait. Also notable in the 1930s period was the photography of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Dupain_8534.html" title="Max Dupain">Max Dupain</a>, whose images of bronzed (often nude) Australians on dazzlingly-lit beaches added to the mythological connection of white Australia to its coastline.</p>
<p>In the 1930s and 1940s the opening up of Australia's interior saw an increasing cross-pollination between Western and Aboriginal art, with European artists imitating Aboriginal styles and some Aboriginal artists adopting Western techniques. The most famous of these is undoubtedly <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Namatjira_c5ea.html" title="Albert Namatjira">Albert Namatjira</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1940s a new generation of artists began experimenting with styles such as <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a> and other techniques. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Boyd_8f82.html" title="Arthur Boyd">Arthur Boyd</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Tucker_%28artist%29_0c78.html" title="Albert Tucker (artist)">Albert Tucker</a> were prominent, and a number of artists spent time at <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heide.html" title="Heide">Heide</a>, a house in Heidelberg - the site of the Heidelberg school several decades before. Amongst the artists that spent time there are <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joy_Hester_9b57.html" title="Joy Hester">Joy Hester</a> and, most prominently <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Nolan_1bf2.html" title="Sidney Nolan">Sidney Nolan</a>, the best known artist of the immediate postwar period, whose iconic <a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned_Kelly_8bc7.html" title="Ned Kelly">Ned Kelly</a> images are probably better known than the artist himself. The effect of the <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ern_Malley_264f.html" title="Ern Malley">Ern Malley</a> poetry case, its cover illustrated by Nolan, also reflected around the art world.</p>
<p>The aspects of Australia's landscape depicted by artists continued to widen, with the suburban landscape brought to attention by such artists as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brack_7965.html" title="John Brack">John Brack</a>. One of the best known painters is the Sydney artist <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Whiteley_80bd.html" title="Brett Whiteley">Brett Whiteley</a> who died in 1992. Twice winner of the Archibald Prize, he returned to Australia in the 1970s after spending time in London, Italy and New York and, amongst many other subjects, pushed the horizon to the top of the canvas and produced an array of landscapes of Sydney and particularly its inspirational harbourside.</p>
<p>In 1971-2 art teacher Geoffrey Bardon encouraged the Aboriginal people of Papunya to paint their Dreamtime stories on canvas, leading to the development of the Papunya Tula school, or 'dot art' which has become possibly Australia's most recognisable style of art worldwide. <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_Possum_eaa8.html" title="Clifford Possum">Clifford Possum</a> was one of the best-known of these artists that came from Papunya.</p>
<p>The 1970s saw the widespread introduction of the government funding of Australian arts, and thousands of artists continue to produce a huge variety of works in media from oils to digital projection. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Gallery_of_Australia_6298.html" title="National Gallery of Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> was opened in 1982, and the state galleries have continued to expand.</p>
<p>The 1980s saw some artists flourish without the need the for government funding. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Hart_a194.html" title="Pro Hart">Pro Hart</a> established a gallery in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_Hill_5b6d.html" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a> and sold works to HRH <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Phillip_d0c9.html" title="Prince Phillip">Prince Phillip</a> and to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_house.html" title="White house">White house</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> he was awarded the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> and was the Australian Citizen of the year in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Done_f9a8.html" title="Ken Done">Ken Done</a> also sold works internationally and in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> received the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Australia_61eb.html" title="Order of Australia">Order of Australia</a>. An original Ken Done work has featured on the cover of the weekly <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazine</a> <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanako.html" title="Hanako">Hanako</a> for over ten years, and in recent times Ken has also become involved in the movement toward a new Australian flag. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Done was asked to create a series of works for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies programs of the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Olympic_Games_ec8c.html" title="2000 Olympic Games">2000 Olympic Games</a>. He was Australian Father of the year in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.</p>

<p>Classical realism persists as the mainstream of Australian commercial painting, with artists such as portrait artist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Newton_6dd7.html" title="Paul Newton">Paul Newton</a> and landscape painter <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Benjamin_6c77.html" title="Jason Benjamin">Jason Benjamin</a>. Then there is the photorealist style of 3-times Archibald finalist, Michael Zavros, Tim Storrier or <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Smart_550a.html" title="Jeffrey Smart">Jeffrey Smart</a>. The Archibald prize is an important society event which continues to lead artists into objective portraiture as a means to secure financial security and popular support.</p>
<p>Some artists have been involved in controversies such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Dobell_b2d7.html" title="William Dobell">William Dobell</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Cullen_5333.html" title="Adam Cullen">Adam Cullen</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Ruddy_c036.html" title="Craig Ruddy">Craig Ruddy</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bell_5e8a.html" title="Richard Bell">Richard Bell</a>. Much of this controversy surrounds the Archibald and the ever present questions surrounding what actually constitutes 'art'. Some, like <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Radford_c289.html" title="Ron Radford">Ron Radford</a>, Director of the National Gallery of Australia, have expressed the opinion that although "you'd never change it, let's not kid ourselves the Archibald is about art". Still many contemporary artists continue to be involved with the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Prize_5165.html" title="Archibald Prize">Archibald Prize</a>, such as Archibald bridesmaids, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Leak_92bb.html" title="Bill Leak">Bill Leak</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Harding_b2d6.html" title="Nicholas Harding">Nicholas Harding</a>, who have both been finalists in the prize eleven times , and <a href="../../../e/u/a/Euan_MacLeod_26c9.html" title="Euan MacLeod">Euan MacLeod</a>, who has been a finalist in the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulman_Prize_8be7.html" title="Sulman Prize">Sulman Prize</a> four times, and the <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynne_Prize_7ae0.html" title="Wynne Prize">Wynne Prize</a> three times.</p>
