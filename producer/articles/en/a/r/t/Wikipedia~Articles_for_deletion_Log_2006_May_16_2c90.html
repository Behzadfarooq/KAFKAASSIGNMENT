That's more than all of DrunkDuck (already survived an AfD with a Keep, by the way). Likewise, its Google results look good, with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=snafu+comics&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=snafu+comics&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">236,000</a> hits, and if you'll take a look at the first few pages of results, they're all about Snafu itself. Yes, the articles could stand some references, but I'm going to take the eventualist position and say that Snafu at least is sufficiently verifiable that some will be added. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 11:29, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I simply can't decide on this one. On the one hand, it was a huge play that was analyzed over and over and over and over again. On the other hand, it was just <i>one</i> 4th down play, and one that, in the long run, was unimportant- the Eagles still lost in the conference championship game. This isn't to say that other huge plays haven't come from teams that didn't win the Super Bowl, but those plays were things like the Music City Miracle or the Miracle at the Meadowlands- absolutely spectacular, you-will-never-see-this-again plays. A 4th-and-26 play does not fall into that category. So, tough as it is, I'm voting for delete.

<li>Well, I've come to agree that there is some claim to notability here, but for the record I think that some of you don't fully understand the significance of plays like the "Hand of God," a very famous, oft-replayed and controversial goal. A similar claim can be made about the "Immaculate Reception." The Catch and the Fumble, likewise, have their place etched in sports lore. There's Doug Flutie's Hail Mary, a last second 50-yard prayer that is miraculously caught and wins the game. There's The Play, a game won between two heated rivals based on a kickoff return featuring five laterals. This, on the other hand, is simply a long fourth down conversion in a non-championship, conference or otherwise, playoff game. It was impressive and probably notable as it relates to Eagles fans, but I don't think it's at all accurate to compare it to these other plays. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 06:05, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alright, I'll bite. I'm not sure, but I don't think this group is notable.

<p>Prod, but I feel we should have a debate. Prod reason was: "The first Google mention of this item combining terms "the show" and "michigan state" is number 48. I find it difficult to find a reliable mention. Is this notable?" from <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">User:Matthew Platts</a>, who I have notified. I deprodded and brought it here because I find it plausible that The ShoW is the longest-running college sitcom, as the article claims (and as their website claims), and if this can be verified, it seems like a reason to include it. Even if that can't be verified, if the show was created in 1988, that's a really long-running show. Still, I remain <b>neutral</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 03:58, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Even if verified I don't think it's sufficiently notable.

<p>Though the article is cleverly coloured at the start to look like a serious article (e.g. cites of legitimate books like Scarry &amp; Steiner} it seems to be largely a hoax, &amp; the article eventually devolves into a fart joke.

<dd>OK, looking a bit through the history I'm wondering if the best thing is to simply revert to the very first version of the article? It looks to me like the problem is that the article started off as a serious piece on one topic (the mooted "New Sincerity" in the wake of 9/11) &amp; then got expanded via a completely different topic (a radio show), &amp; then the latter seems to have attracted some jokers (fans of the radio show? grad students with nothing better to do?) who have completely overrun the original, well-intended article with piles of nonsense. -- I'm not very impressed with the person who's posted to the Talk page that the article deserves preservation because it's "brilliantly retarded". <a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 04:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - I am actually writing a paper on this at the moment, and I assure you there is fair basis for New Sincerity to be included, but the article has certainly been vandalised and changed beyond the truth of the matter. Although many people claim to be the originator of New Sincerity, the phrase has been around for almost a decade in describing the work of director Wes Anderson and more recently people like Jared Hess. I think there has been enough discussion about this in various essays and magazine articles to warrent it's inclusion. (Hippo Shaped)15:22, 06 May 2006

<dd>Onion: Does it bother you to be potentially pegged as the head of a new movement? I know there’s a Film Comment article that mentions you as part of something called ‘the new sincerity.’ Do you pay attention to any of that?</dd>
<dd>Wes Anderson: Well, I don’t know. Who else is in ‘the new sincerity?’</dd>
<dd>Onion: I don’t know. I think it’s just you at this point, and they’re waiting for people to line up behind you.</dd>
<dd>Wes Anderson: Oh, well, I’m not waiting for that line to form, and I don’t expect it to. I don’t know if there’s ever going to be much of a movement in that direction. It sounds like one that could be boring for a lot of people.</dd>

* <b>Strong Oppose</b> Well that interview was from 1999, and references the 'Film Comment' magazine article from January that year. It was around that time the phrase started so of course he didn't know. Whether or not you agree on who invented the phrase or when, the phrase describes something not described in any other way and has been used in a variety of places over the last 7 years. I'd fix this article myself, but i've never really written an article in the Wikipedia style before, but if I have time I will give it a go. Almost the whole thing needs to be reorganized and rewritten, but not deleted. (Hippo Shaped) Re:Above(17th May 2006)

<li><b>Strongest Possible Keep</b>. Sourced, can still be expanded with a little bit of effort, and, at this point, this nomination does not appear to be in good faith. Not a single effort has been made by "hardline deleitionist" Crawford to expand this. After THREE AfDs that failed to come to a deletion consensus, and after noting that the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, along with a platinum-selling rock music act and various television shows have more than noted its existence, this shouldn't even be a question.

<li>That's an exaggeration of the provided source. The term was one of a multiple mentioned in a transcript, included in an exhibit, of a government report. No signficant government official (to my knowledge) has made special mention of the term. The radio personalities are the ones "validating" the term, not anybody in government. <s>I won't vote on this, due to my distaste for re-AFDs.</s> But let's not pretend the "FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES" is behind you. I don't think we want to be tossing in every term that's mentioned in a transcript, included in an appendix, of a federal government document. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>We must be looking at different places.

This is *not* a transcript of an FCC proceeding. This is a transcript of a radio show, included as an attachment to an FCC document. Nobody from the FCC make *specific* reference to a "Cleveland steamer". The people using the expression are labelled MV1, MV2, MC3, MC6 identified as "cast members" and callers of the radio show <i>Deminski &amp; Doyle Show</i>. So the *only* thing this proves is that the term was used *one* day on one radio show. The FCC discussed the transcript in *generall* but did nothing to "note" a specific term. Also, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_steamer&amp;oldid=53460091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_steamer&amp;oldid=53460091" rel="nofollow">version before my edit</a>, implied the term was mentioned in a hearing, but there's no proof of that. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:43, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's actually a rather incorrect statement regarding the merge request. I reverted the merge for two reasons: 1) lack of discussion meaning lack of consensus, and 2) one of the worst merges I've ever seen where almost none of the information from the article being merged was inserted into Coprophilia. I still disagree with a merge, given the notability of this subject.

<p>Seems that other than listing the name, and how to do describe an entitiy without that, there is NO self promotion nor is there any link to Chemistry Set Records (but there should be). NN - except on about 50+ artists Myspace sites. (Per Google search) on independent white boards such as www.thejamzone.com with no affiation Also see below: Talk:Chemistry Set Records From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search My opinion is to keep it so that users are aware of this aspect of the whole "Weed" thing. I have researched on Wikipedia only to learn about the file sharing of music side. What's important to us Artists is to know how to get our music into the system and Wikid doesn't explain it anywhere else like this page does. I did a search for independent record labels and there had to be 50 entries in the "c" but Chemistry Set Record was not listed there, wonder why is that.?--Brokerdelete 21:32, 16 May 2006 (UTC) Electric Doormat, Bret, Jeff Marklein, Countrside (UK) and other artists who use CSR find this entry to be completely legit - proof? Visit Myspace.com/jeffmarklein Myspace.com/countrysideland Myspace.com/bretgrey Myspace.com/electricdoormat Visit www.chemistrysetrecords.com and select the "musicians" link and tell THEM that CSR isn't relevant. You do realize your being extremely discriminatory and favoring other labels which we artists have never heard before all over the Wiki place. Don't be biggots. Jeff. _ _ _ Wes, you gotta help me before I slam my head on the table real hard. Please please please explain why this info is worthy of a big old tag about being considered for deletion: Chemistry Set Records is an online 'label' and ICP (Independent Content Provider) for Weed™ which is a service developed by Shared Media Licensing (“SML”) [1]that lets you sell your music over the Internet and continue earning revenue even when your fans share your music with others. Note that there is nothing but factual information there. I guess you'll have to search "Chemistry Set Records" in order to see the links and you'll see NOT A SINGLE ONE even goes to CSR. There are couple internal Wiki links and only one external which is the "SML" which goes to www.weedshare.com Hey if THAT is the issue I'll gladly remove that link. You do realize that peeps going to weedshare's site helps me in no way right? So am I a vandal and spammer or something again here? Wiki is ridiculous, but Wes, you are a righteous dude so I'm hanging in there a bit longer (on 6 hours sleep). --ChemSet 15:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC) WHY would you consider this for deletion?

<li><b>Delete</b> per head-spinning-inducing screeds. Anons, please note that ranting about unrelated articles isn't going to help the case of <i>this</i> article. Also, "Someone doing something first" isn't notable per se, unless the action really is world-changing (think of then-famous and now-famous bands getting leverage from <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napster.html" title="Napster">Napster</a> - while this is just some company hopping on the bandwagon a lot later). In this case, Weed may be notable, but there's no evidence about the company's notability (unless some is provided); as such, it may warrant a small mention in the Weed article. But unless this company is notable in its own merits, it doesn't need an article of its own - so please, read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> carefully and explain a contrary point. (And what does <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=arist" class="external text" title="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=arist" rel="nofollow">rising up</a> have to do with P2P music distribution, anyway?

Doesn't have any resemblence of spam. Doesn't have a link to themselves even. It's true no other known ICP also has a online radio station to PROMOTE and EXPOSE the artists who have files available for download in Weed format. No less "notable" than other entries. Also true that Wiki has NO information for the interest of aspiring artists (all existing Wiki is on file sharing and addresses music fans instead of bands and artists).--69.178.130.210 21:18, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Everything within this article is NOTABLE.</p>
<p>Chemistry Set Records happens to be THE FIRST <a href="../../../i/c/p/ICP_ec78.html" title="ICP">ICP</a> to not only offer the Arist access to the <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weed_music_distribution_service.html" title="Weed music distribution service">Weed music distribution service</a> system but to ALSO play their songs online via stream audio radio station on SHOUTcast.com.</p>
<p>(How do you think their songs get put into the weed digital format? You can't just got to the Weed site and say "ADD ME PLEASE" as the response will be "GO THROUGH AN ICP PLEASE")</p>
<p>You are completely missing the point that until now Wiki ONLY has information about the end user aquisition and <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_sharing.html" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> the Weed file alone, and ZERO info on how an Atist can get into the system. This is wrong completely wrong of you. Please reconsider.</p>
<p>The system in itself is NOTABLE and a few seaches around the net will produce many indepedent publications mention over the last 3 or 4 years... I haven't the time at the moment but will post some the history and technology behind it tomorrow.</p>
<p>A business plan like Weed shows a new use of technology, etc and is therefore notable. But the COMPLETE picture and this side of the equation has been missing on Wiki for all these years for some reason.</p>
<p>Same thing with GarageBand.com I was completely shocked that until I came along and added a page for that Wiki seems to have slept through THE BIGGEST thing for unsigned artists on the net SINCE 1997</p>
<p>Lastly, instead of simply suggesting deletion, why not add constructive critisism or ways to correct to your satisfaction (never understood that part)--24.182.12.127 15:09, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Plus, <a href="../../../v/e/l/Veloso.html" title="Veloso">Veloso</a>, the author of <i>Irrational Exuberence</i>, is also there, and Kepple is just as popular. Another supporting point: since <i>French Erotic Film</i> is mentioned in the Wikipedia several times, and there is a page on <a href="../../../o/m/e/Ome_Henk_67ac.html" title="Ome Henk">Ome Henk</a>'s song, <a href="../../../o/p/b/Opblaaskrokodil.html" title="Opblaaskrokodil">Opblaaskrokodil</a>, in which Kepple wrote <i>French Erotic Film</i>, there should be a page on Andrew Kepple. One final pointer: not all famous flash persons draw ALL notable works. AltF4 is famous MOSTLY because of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ultimate_Showdown_of_Ultimate_Destiny_8533.html" title="The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny">The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</a> and seldom anything else. There is just one undeniable thing that there is: this page is in a stark need of a cleanup, but does not deserve to be deleted. In conclusion, even if this page is not saved, it should.

<li><b>Comment</b> - A lot of keep comments seem to say that he's active and notable on the "Animutations" circuit. How large is this community exactly? If you could give actual numbers, that would help. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 14:23, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Sorry to go on this commenting thing again. Anyway, to take a far less aggressive approach, he was famous because of his animutation series, the <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Mochrie_4fc2.html" title="Colin Mochrie">Colin Mochrie</a> vs. JHC trilogy</i>, which can be seen on <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino_Blacksheep_f6fb.html" title="Albino Blacksheep">Albino Blacksheep</a> but he wasn't just an animutator, but also a cartoonist in general: a contributor of two major entertainment sites. Somehow, Andrew Kepple is on the WikiProject Webcomics, and is threatened for deletion because of that. If only we could take the webcomic business as very little as possible and only mention the webcomic stuff on the external links (as is the page on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega</a>, where his <i>Farchie Archie</i> webcomic is only mentioned in the external links), this might help just at least a bit by taking it out of WikiProject Webcomics. I wouldn't really care if the page is gone, but I do have a slight feeling he is notable in a ways. Oh yes, and there is about a few hundred members right now (I believe) in the Animutation Mailing List, but if anyone has a reliable source of information in regards to how large the animutation world is, please post it here. Forgive me, all y'all, for being rather stubborn. -- <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENeryon_e83a.html" title="User:Neryon">Wartys Neryon</a> 3:02, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>No vote</b>, for now, and <b>comment</b>. I'm a big fan of TmsT's work, and I tend to hang out in the same online circles as him, such as the Animutation discussion list and the Lemon Demon forums; given that, I probably have an imbalanced perspective of his notability, since he is indeed quite noted <i>relative to those communities</i>. I don't have a good sense of how widely noted he is on the Internet in general, though if the article is to be kept, then it should include explanation of his notability, which it currently lacks.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> When one or more episodes of a popular show are banned (or withheld or whatever you prefer to call it), there's usually reasoning behind it and in most cases is quite interesting. The Porygon seisure epsiode in particular made worldwide headlines when it occured...

<li><b>Very strong Delete</b> - read the article, please, chaps. Not a single one of these episoes has been banned by any normally recognised definition of the word: they're just not shown. The writer speculates that the episodes have been withdrawn, but gives no proof at all. The episode with the epilepsy-inducing flashes is covered (better) elsewhere, and even that has not actually been banned. Non-notable, non-encyclopedic, speculative fancruft that is potentially untrue. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 15:23, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Would appreciate guidance about the proper use of Cleanup, Factual Accuracy, Merge, and OR tags. 03:40, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Truth_theory_b7f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Truth theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Disclosure</span></h4>
<p>JA: With regard to the article <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_theory.html" title="Truth theory">Truth theory</a>, that was a page that already existed in the form of a redirect to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, but which I changed from a redirect to an article in order to add content that was being wholesale deleted from Truth, initially by a single editor who had been away from the page for an extended time and simply started deleting everything that he considered too "abstract", "advanced", "technical", etc., and who objected that the References section was "bloated and inappropriate" to what amounts to his opinion about the preparation and needs of the intended reader.</p>
<p>JA: Thus I believe it is not accurate to describe this page as resulting from a POV Fork. The need for a separate page arises from the need to address a different intended reader, one with more than an initial interest in the subject, and one who will be tolerant of a more abstract, advanced, comprehensive, and detailed technical discussion, with all due "bloat" of the Bib that this entails.</p>
<p>JA: The article on Truth has always been a turbulent site, as anyone can well imagine, but the editors who were doing the actual work on site up until that time had evolved a modus vivendi, involving the excruciating examination on the talk page of every bit of controversial text, that seemed to be working about as well as anyone could expect. All that went out the window on May 12. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 17:42, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a></b> as per GRBerry.

<p>JA: Banno is a party to the dispute at <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">Truth</a>, and has a distinctive POV with respect to the questions of intended reader, level of detail, technical level, and so on. These are not primarily disputes about content, as we had a routine for resolving those issues that was working up until May 13, when Nathan Ladd came back from a long break and simply started deleting text en masse that he said was too "abstract", "advanced", "technical", and so on. If the reviewers will trace the course of the edit history beginning at the link that I posted in my first WQA, copied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth&amp;diff=52956203&amp;oldid=52950043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Truth&amp;diff=52956203&amp;oldid=52950043" rel="nofollow">here</a>, then I think that the record will bear that out.

<li><b>keep</b>: The article <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> is both too long and too technical. That article should give a brief discussion of truth in philosophy, with each major school defined, but the more technical parts should be moved to <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_theory.html" title="Truth theory">truth theory</a>. On the other hand, the article <i>truth theory</i> should cover a variety of ideas, not just one philosophical specialty. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 13:15, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. With a 5d-4k situation, I realize that I may be on shaky ground, but I think that is the result which best summarises the discussion. One argument given for "keep" by Kicking222 is <i>"...if it's verifiable that the group exists or did exist, then its article is warranted"</i>, but that is <i>not</i> consistent with the previous precedent we have had for bands (<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>); except for unusual circumstances we have required some releases on major record labels or a bit more on independent ones, in this case <i>no</i> albums have been released. TheMadBaron has argued that tracks have been commercially released, but after looking at the article myself I cannot see that to be evident. The participation of a notable artist like <a href="../../../x/z/i/Xzibit.html" title="Xzibit">Xzibit</a> has also been given as an argument for inclusion, but his participation appears to have been only a minor side-project. In all, I find the arguments presented by <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> (lack of Allmusic entry, no productions in over seven years of existence) to be convincing. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ubelivable behaviuor! Congratulations! You have just deleted all my argumentations here that were well written and documented forcing people to read another page to read my arguments, so people who must vote to keep the article have nothing to read directly about WHY to keep it.</p>

<p>An Amiga emulator is no more a <i>Virtual machine</i> then any other emulator. Should we have pages for NES virtual machine, Mac virtual machine, etc...? I believe the topics in this article is sufficiently covered by <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/WinUAE_d2f0.html" title="WinUAE">WinUAE</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnss123_b25d.html" title="User talk:Anss123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anss123_de65.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anss123">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> An emulator is just a program running into an host machine. Programs run by the emulator are considered alien by the hosting machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amiga Virtual Machines create a series of Hardware Abstraction Layers between the hosting machine hardware, and the software, and let it run as if it was in the original Amiga environment.</p>
<p>Often Amiga VM are associated with emulators engines and/or code interpreters, but this fact can't let an Amiga VM be considered as like as a merely simple emulator. AVM just could be integrated with emulators to obtain new results with limited re-use of existing software solutions.</p>
<p>There are at least 4 Amiga Virtual machine known. Petunia from AmigaOS 4.0, ABOX from MorphOS, Amithlon as stand alone product and Amiga Anywhere as standalone product. Read more about these products into the article itself.</p>
<p>Also I remember to all readers that the Amiga world it is evolving and different solutions are considered by different people developing Amiga. In the future more about virtualization will take place into Amiga world, so more phenomena will emerge and will deserve Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>This is a summary of all my testimony to let this article be kept alive, and a summary of all my comments to detractors of Amiga. Hope that at least this summary will be let to stay finally without receiving any censorship.</p>

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> <strike><b>Keep with reserve</b></strike> <b>Strong delete</b> (this is getting more and more absurd).

<li><b>Keep</b> If you don't personally like Amiga Virtual Machines then that is fine but that is no reason to damage wikipedia by removing a clearly written article. To Mr. LjL, your complaint is false as Macintosh Virtual Machines and PC Virtual Machines are already listed in various other parts of the wikipedia such as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_virtual_machines.html" title="Comparison of virtual machines">Comparison_of_virtual_machines</a>. Perhaps you feel that Java inc. owns the term "Virtual Machine". It does not. Furthermore the term "Virtual Machine" is synonymous with "Emulator". The trouble is that people who type in the phrase "Emulator" are usually looking for games, while people who type in "Virtual Machine" are typically searching for some type of serious application to perform work. Thus 2 different articles are needed, each with its own clear focus. Also if you were to discriminate against PC, Mac, Amiga virtual machines and delete them then you would also have to delete Java Virtual Machine. It sounds like your complaint is an attempt to give Java a Wikipedia monopoly. There are <b>many</b> types of virtual machines in the world today and they are <b>ALL</b> worthy of wikipedia articles.--StoneGiant 07:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the discussion here is getting a little out of hand. Keep the the article for now. The discussion about where to merge it, or what content should be here vs. elsewhere, should take place on the article talk page, and should NOT have the time limit that an AfD discussion has. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:06, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or possibly redirect to <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a>. Emulation of the Amiga is already covered in <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiga_emulation.html" title="Amiga emulation">Amiga emulation</a> and various articles such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix_Amiga_Emulator_be25.html" title="Unix Amiga Emulator">Unix Amiga Emulator</a>. It's redundant to have two articles, so they should be merged, or this one deleted. I agree than "Amiga emulation" should be the primary name - this phrase is far more common that "Amiga virtual machine". Furthermore the article confuses Amiga emulation with Amiga Anywhere, which is an entirely different thing - this should be moved out into its own article. I realise that the article states they are different - but it's confusing to cover them together like this. If we want to cover both articles, then the article should be converted into a proper disambiguation page. This should also be deleted as a non-notable or unreferenced term - only 1 non-wikipedia Google hit <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Amiga+Virtual+Machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=jKW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Amiga+Virtual+Machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=jKW&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, and that says "Too bad there isn't an Amiga Virtual Machine"! <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 00:44, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It's debateable how many hits should be considered "enough", but 5 is absurd. Even <i>hundreds</i> is generally considered non-notable (e.g., I get over 1,000 on just an online name I use which is unique to me). Also note, of those 5, none are relevant to this article: 1 actually appears to mean a Java virtual machine, 2 talk about a hypothetical Amiga virtual machine for the A\BOX, which was never released, and 2 are actually duplicate hits, I've no idea what the mention of Amiga virtual machine is about, the phrase just appears in some RSS feed. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:40, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Magazine owned and run by a group of redlinks. Which is not a crime. But here's the interesting bit: I downloaded the advertiser's media pack and <b>there is no circulation figure</b>.

<li>What's with the circulation figures thing is that circulation is vitally important to a magazine. Which is why I went to the trouble of downloading their media pack, so I could see if this was just garden-variety spam (having found it through the edit history of a vandal). <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 17:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, circulation figures are important for a magazine, and every good magazine should include them. But I can't grasp why their absence is somehow a criterion for deletion or suggests vanity for some reason. 3 seconds on Google shows that these are by no means anyone's xeroxed-at-school fanzine... "Fast Company" in quotes brings <b>6.6 million Google hits</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, you know how it is, trailing through the edit history of a vanity spammer and vandal, you can get overwhelmed by skepticism. I spent far longer than 3 seclonds downloading and reading their media packs and other data looking for evidence <i>from them</i> which would establish their notability, it never occurred to em that they might consider themselves so well known that they didn't need to announce circulation, only the number of subscribers to their web forum.

<p>Stub article on a magazine whose media pack gives no clue as to circulation. It says how many subscribers the web forum has, but not how many people read the magazine.

<li>No question that this is linkspam; Google news search on "Stock Fraser Cukier" results in zero hits. The only possible claim to notability that I could find (which wasn't in the article) is that they have acted as an agent for the House of Lords in an international law dispute. Note, however, that hundreds (if not thousands) of other law firms could make the same claim. I'm not sure whether <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applies to lawfirms; if it does, they appear fail it.

<p>Either a hoax, or a fictional backstory for a band. The details all appear to be made up; "deek hoi" as a source of music appears to exist, but the only listings I can find are a myspace page (similarly nonsensical) and what appear to be a listings for a handful of local gigs. In other words, the article as it stands fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> quite spectacularly, and I can find nothing to suggest that a serious article on the real "deek hoi" would meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> notability guidelines. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:56, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - let me say firstly that I think this test is a load of bull*&amp;%*. It has no scientific value, and no other value other than to propagate the insanity of some Japanese guy. Nevertheless, it's encyclopedic because it's notable. Keep. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 00:22, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> – As the original creator of the article I would simply point out that the article as originally created, however imperfect, would seem to meet Wiki criteria. So far as I can determine the alterations/additions which prompted the nomination for deletion were made by a proponent, and that their insupportability speaks for itself. I'm a comparative newcomer to this process, so please pardon any infelicities on my part. <a href="../../../f/u/c/User%7EFucyfre_c139.html" title="User:Fucyfre">Fucyfre</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This article clearly stands up to Wikipedia criteria. There is no original/new research: the article refers to and points to in the external links already published research. The research mentioned is also by reputable sources - they are medical doctors, scientist etc all with the standard doctoral or medical doctor qualifications. The idea expressed here that the information or that the Test itself is unscientific is flatly incorrect. The research and methodology of the BDORT satisfies accepted scientific method: observation, hypothesis, induction/deduction, etc. The claim of "pseudoscience" itself needs to be examined. Are any of the commentators here scientifically trained to Ph.D level? especially regarding electromagnetism? The BDORT deals with electromagnetic phenomena. This is a neglected paradigm in orthodox western medicine, but not among all doctors, which is a key point. See for example the many presentations by US doctors, scientists etc at Google: Whole Person Healing Summit. In other words, to say that it has no scientific value etc, is an opinion, that is, it is non-neutral. Are the commentators here seriously claiming to be able to refute the many published research papers of around 50 recognized scientists/doctors around the world?! On what basis is this credible? It is of course not. This is an absurd idea. The original author of this page obviously, as with some of the other contributors to the page, does not 'like' the BDORT. But that is not sufficient. You cannot call it names because of that. They are giving their opinion throughout their text - which is not Wikipedia practice. Their comments are therefore very biased indeed. When I simply added further information, as for example in the case of the NZ doctor, rather than deleting the existing text, my additions - which were extra information about the subject - were deleted. This outrightly violates Wikipedia policy. This needs to be 100% clear. What is being objected to, on analysis, is that I am presenting information that does not cohere with the bias of the contributors. On that insufficient basis, the different Wikipedia criteria are being sited, but erroneously as I have explained. Phrases like "and that their insupportability speaks for itself" sounds impressive, but are not substantiated in any way given. Regarding my non-neutrality, I am of course an advocate of the BDORT. But I have aimed in my last big rewrite to only include <b>information</b>, facts, figures etc. If people wish to improve on the neutrality of the information I have written, then please do, but please also note, that that does not equate to deleting <b>information</b> - which is the basis of what an encyclopedia is for. ---- RichardMalter</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - could we get some more opinions here please? So far there's one keep vote (from me) and that's the lot, since the nominator is now neutral.

<blockquote>
<p>In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress included in the definition of “compilation” the first express statutory link between compilations and original works of authorship “...that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes a work of authorship.” (8) Cases under the 1976 Act were divided about the continuing viability of the sweat of the brow doctrine. Some circuits continued to apply it, (9) while other circuits rejected it, requiring a showing of sufficient creativity in order to entitle a compilation to copyright protection. (10) The Supreme Court resolved the split in the circuits in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. (11) In that case, the Supreme Court held that the white pages of a telephone directory (containing an alphabetical listing of all residents with telephone service in a defined geographic area) was insufficiently creative to merit copyright protection. The Court held that the requirement of creativity was not merely statutory, but rooted in the Copyright Clause itself. (12) Thus, the sweat of the brow doctrine was laid to rest.<br />
What remains is a thin layer of copyright protection for qualifying databases. In order to qualify, they must exhibit some modicum of creativity in the selection, arrangement, or coordination of the data. The protection is thin in that only the creative elements (selection, arrangement, or coordination of data) are protected by copyright. Explanatory materials such as introductions or footnotes to databases may also be copyrightable. But in no case is the data itself (as distinguished from its selection, coordination or arrangement) copyrightable.</p>

<li>Wow, where to begin? I thought from the title that this was going to be an article about a Mastercard issued by some entity called Phentermine Pharmacies. I didn't see any evidence in the DEA press release linked that the DEA is focusing "in particular" on stopping the online sale of phentermine; their press release (<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/pr121905.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/pr121905.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>) mentions only "amphetamines, anabolic steroids, and narcotics" (although for all I know phentermine may be one of those types of drugs; at any rate, it isn't specifically mentioned). Perhaps things are explained more clearly on the "Phentermine &amp; Mastercard" page linked in this article; I didn't click on it because its being hosted on an IP with no domain looks awfully phishy. At any rate, this article is littered with external links, appears to be original research and/or crystal-ballism, is so difficult to understand that it could possibly be considered nonsense, is unencyclopedic in tone, and has a misleading title (incidentally, I can't help but wonder if the title was conceived with search engine spamming in mind).

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not entirely happy with the starting point of this AfD where vanity <i>per se</i> seems to be considered a basis for deletion. It is not. See <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">Vanity</a>: "vanity by itself is not a basis for deletion, but lack of importance." We should be considering whether this article is about a subject of sufficient note. From the list of shows and previous mention of google hits, it would seem the subject may well be. In this case we are deleting a subject because it's badly written. The whole point of a collaborative project is to work together to improve articles, and to communicate with other editors.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:13, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Should be rewritten for NPOV but I don't think it deserves deletion. He is obviously a noted and popular figure in Brazil. The lack of article here means that it probably should be on the Portuguese WP (where he also has an account), but now that it's here I think it could be made into a good article. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 23:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know whether Araripe is notable or not; this isn't my area of expertise. I only noticed that this user had been spamming other pages when I was doing some category cleanup, and then poked around to see if he had other edits that needed to be reverted. Certainly the content of this article as it stands now is unacceptable, and there is nothing to revert to. I've also noticed in the past that proposing a problematic article for deletion is the surest way to bring it to the attention of someone who cares enough to fix it instead.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.frog_7088.html" title="User:Dr.frog">Dr.frog</a> 01:23, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Can't you see? On the Lise of Pokémon by Species, or whatever, you have to kepp on clicking and clicking, which is annoying on dial up.

I apologize for not knowing I had to leave a comment every time). --user: otis_pjc 08:42, 17 May 2006</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> this is an encyclopedia site which should make available all correct and historical information on all subject matter (in this case a band called anal cunt) regardless of how any one person feels about the subject at hand.. i don.t particularly even like the band (though i am fond of the genre of music which they were historically a part of).. allow the censorship of any one piece of historical information and you might as well also support (and expect) any and all censorship (hiding/alteration/subjective control) of any and all information..</li>

Keep: No proof exists either way and their are many problems with the traditional account of the moon landings and gaps in the information that is currently in the public domain.

These pro-hoax editors have zealously reverted edits that try to replace hoax-as-equally-valid wording with neutral wording, such as by reverting to references to the "landing believer community" and "landing advocates", as if these were equally valid alternatives to their opposites according to the mainstream consensus. It is simply not NPOV for a purported encyclopedia to use such loaded, pro-hoax terminology, that would never be referred to by anyone who does not buy into the "moon landing hoax" idea. Since they are unwilling to avoid reverting repeatedly to blatant violations of NPOV, particularly by presenting fringe views as equally valid, this article has persisted in qualifying as "Text that does not conform to all four policies" and that therefore "is not allowed in the main namespace".

<li><b>Keep</b> I think a strength of Wikipedia is the highly controversial and contended over articles that no one is ever happy with, but which give a fair minded reader a pretty good sense of the arguments on both sides. I worked on the Apollo project during the summers of 1966 and 1967 and know how ludicrous the hoax notion is. But I was impressed with this article as it stands right now. It's far better to vent these kinds of theories than to let their supporters claim they are being suppressed.

<li>I'll say this again: Of course it is a noteworthy topic. But there's a huge difference between explaining about belief in Roman gods or alternative medicine or Holocaust denial, and writing about any of these things in a way that gives equal validity to whether or not they are true. I've tried several times to make <b>modest</b> modifications to tone down the pro-hoax bias in this article, and each one was simply swiftly reverted by pro-hoax editors. I think the controversial and contended over articles are great too - but not controversial articles that don't incorporate any contending because single-POV squatters revert anything outside their own single fringe take on it. I think this article deserves to be here, but only if it is edited by the community at large who can make it NPOV, instead of pro-hoax hobbyists camping out on it and reverting any non-pro-hoax edits over and over. In other words, only if <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Giving_.22equal_validity.22" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia's policy on avoiding NPOV violation by giving equal validity to fringe beliefs</a> is actually practiced and is not just empty words.

<li><b>Keep</b> With doubts. I have looked into the hoax theory, and I am convinced that the moon landings never took place. I am also convinced that the thruth will come to the mainline media some day, and Wikipedia should have an article about it until that day. But the hoax article in the Wikipedia is really telling anyone interested that the Apollo program was for real. I mean the opening sentences, the pictures, text under pictures, the longvinded "rebuttals". This article is not showing the hoax claim in a clear and fair way. That is why I am having doubts with "keep". The Apollo believers makes this page an Apollo propaganda page. (Axlalta 19:40, 17 May 2006 (UTC))

<li>The moonbats' seemingly simple questions do sometimes require "longvinded" explanations. I have also looked into the hoax story (it's not a "theory") and found it severely wanting.

<p><br />
this page should not be deleted for several reasons - first i havent gotten a chance to explain the differences between the 80's post gth movementand the modern one - even considering that the 8's post goth label was missapplied and most crtics just claim its all goth, and thats where the modern movement differs - it really i post goth,</p>
<p>as for self promotion - it isnt - the three bands i put in there are all legit notable groups from this genre each with a major national or international following, each with radio eaiplay - they are the lab animals, vhs or beta and unkle.</p>
<p>wiki cant delete articles because one person believes a genre doesnt exist - it would leave wiki uncomplete and out of touch with moden culture which it seems many of the people voting for deletion say -</p>
<p>i submit you must prove that this genre doesnt exist and thereby disprove rolling stones and nme's articles on the subject.</p>
<p>wiki cant afford to let personal taste or selfishness dictate its knowledge base or risk becoming outdated and insignificant.</p>
<p><br />
the page is still uncompleted any deletion before it i finished would do wiki users a disservice and will apply deletion erroniousy</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - None of the bands listed sound even remotely Goth, in fact, they're all fairly stylistically different from one another. VHS or Beta is Indie or at best modern Post-Punk. The Lab Animals put it nicely on their myspace page... they're Down-Tempo. The Glass Project is also Down-Tempo or possibly dancey Synth-Pop with a dash of Future-pop. Unkle77 floats between Avante-Garde Hip-hop and Illbient. The only relation that is obvious is that "Moth" or Dimitri Spanoa is creator of the Glass Project, and The Lab Animals, however there's confusion about this since there are contradicting stories from both this page and the probably nonnotable <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> article for Dimitri Spanoa.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree with the points the other editors have brought up. There are no citations to back any of the claims made in this article; VHS OR BETA defines themselves as Experimental/Rock/House on their MySpace page; post-goth is not listed on allmusic.com as a subgnere nor are there any notable websites devoted to "post-goth" bands or the "post-goth" subculture. Any references I can find for "post-goth" via a google search are contradictory and confusing, the label seems to be applied in a haphazard manner to any band the writer the writer can think of (the Vanishing, the Cure, My Chemical Romance, Dead Can Dance, Bauhaus, Devo, etc.), and most of the "post goth" google hits are referring to something other than a music subgenre (which is significantly inflating the number of google hits). Until it can be clearly demonstrated that "post-goth" is an already existing music subgenre (one which is not being artifically manufactured), then the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilmGal_e6f6.html" title="User:FilmGal">FilmGal</a> 02:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There really doesn't seem to be enough usage and acceptance of the term out there to prove that this is an actual genre. Also, I checked out the bands, and they really don't have any connection..other than possibly being referred to as "post-goth" somewhere, or having some sort of "dark" imagery. In order for a genre to exist, there should be some sort of underlying similarity in the sound of a number of bands. I don't see it here. Also, despite being well-read and rather knowledgeable on the goth genre and other genres that predated and followed goth, I have NEVER come across "post-goth" being a genre in the 80's. "Positive punk", yes, "post-punk", yes, but not "post-goth". As of yet it's not a current genre, sub-genre, or subculture. Therefore, it has no place in wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatZilla_2e6a.html" title="User:CatZilla">CatZilla</a> 20:42, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
