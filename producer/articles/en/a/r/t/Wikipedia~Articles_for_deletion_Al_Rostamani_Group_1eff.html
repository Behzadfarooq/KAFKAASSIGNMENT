<p>Disputed notability, placing here so debate can take place. <s>I'm choosing to <b>Abstain</b> for now.</s> Change to <b>Delete</b>, after researching I can find very little notable about this other than its size, and I don't think much more could be added to the article. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:20, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The user stated "Not listed in indices, not stock market listed" as an argument for deletion along with what's beyond the comma. I choose to to counter what was specifically that argument. What's beyond the comma, "few (if any) mentions in published non-trivial works according to Google." is an additional point that the user was making. If you want to point out the fact I didn't respond to that second argument (which I assume in good faith is already apparent to the readers), go right ahead, but don't make a personal attack claiming I didn't read the whole thing. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 20:19, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. According to the company website, net assets are in excess of $550 million USD. One of the subsidiaries, Arabian Automotive Co, sounds fairly notable as a distributor of several major car marques. Website is very out of date though, so difficult to tell if company is still notable today. Given that the company is in private ownership, it's hardly surprising there's no stock market listing; that doesn't particularly make it non-notable. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDWaterson_1985.html" title="User:DWaterson">DWaterson</a> 22:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Assets is not a measure of notability. Having a stock market listing is according to <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 08:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Point of Information</b> FYI, while net assets of a private company are not quite the same as the market cap of a publically traded company, note that a public company with less than US$2bn market cap is generally known in the finance world as a <i>small cap</i> company. Being in the $2bn to $10bn range is known as <i>mid-cap</i>. <i>Large cap</i> is &gt;$10bn<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/031703.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.This company's website says that its net asset worth is $1bn with not much debt... this most likely places it in the small cap range if it was publicly traded. Also, the UAE is a wealthy country, so it is not obvious that a &lt;$2bn company is a dominant player. Also rough estimates for self-valuation by private companies which are not required to disclose any or verify (publicly audit) any financial information to the public should probably be considered an unreliable, self-publishing source for this particular kind of information <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As anyone who regularly invests in stocks or stock mutual funds knows, publicly traded companies very frequently will have market cap values that are much higher than the companies' actual value (real assests). This is usually attributed to investor speculation. Comparing a publicly traded company's "market cap" to a privately held company's "assets" is like comparing apples to oranges. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 06:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not comparing apples to oranges, though they are different (and market cap value can be <i>lower</i> than the value of a company's "real assets"). Valuation of market cap or of assets is not primarily understood as the result of on the one hand, "speculation" or on the other, just "fire sale value" - its key that it must incorporate the expected future earnings of the combination of technical, human, and financial capital in place. A company's asset value doesn't just include the base price of tangible real assets. It's the market value of the tangible and intangible assets. Obviously if you fire the personnel, give up the goodwill, and sell off the equipment piece by piece, the "fire sale value" is going to be less than the sum of the parts. But we talking about the worth of a <i>company</i>, not a just a bunch of random stuff for sale. Anyway, my primary point was that a $1-2bn company is not that impressive. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 14:50, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comparing an unknown nonexistent "market cap" to the real "assets" of a private firm is not a correct method of gauging the scope of a company. As you said, the open market might value a company <i>lower</i> than a company's "real assets," as well has <i>higher</i> and sometimes <i>several times higher</i>. We just don't know. As this company is not publicly traded, any assumption on market cap value is guesstimation. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 20:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
