<p>Personal essay. Original research. Non-neutral point of view. Article itself notes that there "is no authoritative list." So, where did the list come from? The personal authority of contributors, I suppose. It also notes that the term is "misleading." If good evidence is presented that this is a frequently used term that refers to a list of schools that is as well-defined as <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivies_e052.html" title="Public Ivies">Public Ivies</a> then I'd accept the topic as encyclopedic. Nominator votes "delete." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:15, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, clean up, expand. It's been a long time since I was up on current college-application slang, but it appears to be a widely used term (I certainly knew what it meant before I saw the article). Google for "Little Ivies" and "US News" finds a few dozen hits where the term is used on academic sites: e.g., <a href="http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050320.html" class="external text" title="http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050320.html" rel="nofollow">this Harvard mag article</a> assumes you know what it means. There doesn't need to be any sort of "official" list for it to be a generally-understood term. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 15:35, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; unlike Midwestern Ivy League this term is in fact has historical and specific use in reference to the listed institutions listed, akin to Seven Sisters or the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Colleges_%28Massachusetts%29_e024.html" title="Five Colleges (Massachusetts)">Five Colleges</a>.

<li>Anyone got <i>any</i> reference that could serve as <i>some kind</i> of external authority for which colleges belong, and what, if anything it means other than "good college?" Most of the references cited so far do seem to "assume you know what it means." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:04, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't especially think we need one. It means, effectively, small, old, private liberal arts schools in the Northeast United States. What schools exactly should be included is a matter of content for editors to determine. I'm taking the liberty of removing Davidson, which was added by an anon and for which I can find zero relevant hits on Google, and which is by location alone questionable. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 00:57, 2005 August 24 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well (I know this is OT here but we have a group discussing it here) if the article is kept, as seems likely, I'm thinking it should be revised drastically. Your above definition sounds plausible, anyone got an external source for that definition or anything like it? I'd add "academically distinguished" to the list of adjectives. And apparently only colleges that were historically men's college count are included, right? No Wellesley or Smith, which otherwise would meet your criteria. I'm thinking that the article should say it is a <i>vague,</i> generic term for: small old liberal arts colleges that are academically distinguished, located in the Northeast U.S., and historically were men's colleges, as exemplified by <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_College_b06a.html" title="Amherst College">Amherst</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williams_College_d6ab.html" title="Williams College">Williams</a>. With a note on the Talk page strongly discouraging listmaking, because, <i>unlike</i> the Ivy League or the Five Colleges or the Public Ivies, there is no definitive list or objective criterion for inclusion. Any such list is subject to the same objections as the "list of notable colleges" which was VfDed years ago. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:22, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> This material warrants one or maybe two sentences in the "<a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html#Terminology" title="Ivy League">Terminology</a>" section of the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> article. Pick the most illuminating quote out of the usage examples and incorporate it there. (Note that the "Associate Justice Kennedy" link doesn't actually include the phrase "little ivies", saying instead "Little Ivy League". It illustrates the general concept, but not the specific term.) I trust everyone remembers the <i>Cynic's Dictionary</i> definition of the Ivy League — eight schools who agree to play each other in football so that one of them will win. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 16:18, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Unlike Midwestern Ivy League, this is <i>not</i> an invented term and actually has currency. That's reason enough to keep it. Individual contibutors are then free to quibble over what schools to include and support their arguments accordingly. I think incorporating "Little Ivies" into the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> article is a particularly bad idea. That league is defined as only 8 schools, and an elaboration of the "Little Ivies" beyond their present (brief) mention there opens the door for every other other college wanting to be mentioned as some kind of "Ivy." If there are "Rust Belt Ivies," "Pacific Rim Ivies," "Middle Eastern Ivies" etc, let the contributor create a new article where the legitimacy of the term can be discussed and decided on. -18.95.1.22 20:04, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems notable (though obviously not a hugely popular term.) Google isn't the end-all be-all of determining notability. Since it was nominated, some good work has been put into this article to provide sources and expand the article. I think this is a good entry that has some potential. ~ <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrae_1e20.html" title="User:Syrae">Syrae Faileas</a> 20:36, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Some aspects of this article probably require discussion, but there is no question that this term is in common usage. The list is ill-defined by it's nature, but that isn't reason to delete the article. However, pointing out how arbitrary the inclusion of some schools (after Amherst/Williams), is essential to understanding the usage of the term. Also, the 2003 Wall Street Journal ranking of "Feeder schools" used this term in reference to Williams.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. Term is common. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 01:56, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>.The "real" Ivy League was similarly an informal grouping of colleges until it was formally organized. However, in that time period "Ivy League" was an accepted and used term. The lackof a formal organization for the "little Ivies" is not grounds to deny the concept its own page.
