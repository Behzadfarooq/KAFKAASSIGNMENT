<p>I closed the original debate <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Able_and_Baker_5f4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Able and Baker</a> as a "delete", having erroneously overlooked a few valid keep sentiments and arguments due to a deluge of sockpuppeteering. A request for the article to be undeleted was made, and I have decided to correct my original wrong decision and relist here for a hopefully <i>clean</i> debate. I have not done much research into finding out how notable this webcomic is so I am <b>not voting</b>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I've never heard of it either, but with hundreds of strips under their belt and a pretty decent sized <a href="http://www.jimburgessdesign.com/comics/fanart/" class="external text" title="http://www.jimburgessdesign.com/comics/fanart/" rel="nofollow">fanart</a> page it seems pretty notable to me. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 06:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Absolutely <b>Keep</b> - comic is on <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayfree_Press_6295.html" title="Dayfree Press">Dayfree Press</a>, a notable webcomics syndicate of which almost every other strip has an article. As a result, <a href="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dayfreepress.com:81/network/ableandbaker/Able%20and%20Baker/short_ableandbaker2-a.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> appears as a sponsored link from both <a href="../../../q/u/e/Questionable_Content_a910.html" title="Questionable Content">Questionable Content</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Dinosaur_Comics_952e.html" title="Daily Dinosaur Comics">Daily Dinosaur Comics</a>. Furthermore, the editor of Dayfree was named as one of the 25 notable webcomics people in Comixpedia for 2004, and used his interview there to mention Able and Baker as a hot strip. Since Dayfree membership is by application, its membership in the syndicate constittues a jdugment of quality and notability from a highly important source. I also ask whoever closes this debate to glance at <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_Webcomics_0e1f.html" title="User:Snowspinner/Webcomics">User:Snowspinner/Webcomics</a> - I believe I have qualifications that make me a particular expert on webcomics and their notability, which might be taken as relevent in determining consensus. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 06:59, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b>. Does <i>sponsored link</i> mean advertizement, or something else? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 11:12, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case it means unpaid advertisement - the Dayfree strips all run an adbox that randomly serves up an ad for one of the other Dayfree strips. The adbox doesn't appear along with other ads on the site, but as part of the framing. It's probably best to go look at, say, <a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.questionablecontent.net" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - the box that says Dayfree Press? Periodically advertises Able and Baker. (The other ad in that section is for QC merchandise - the point being that an ad in that section is a different thing from the top banner ads, which are generally for unrelated things) <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Per above, though i dont think Snowspinners presented qualifications necessarily mean his <s>vote</s> opinion should weigh heavier. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War">The Minister of War</a> 09:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And if this page were about votes, I would agree wholeheartedly, but I take the move away from calling it "votes" for deletion to mark a change in that. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 10:34, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The wording change was made to recognize this is about <i>consensus</i>, not voting. I don't know of any reason to believe it was to give greater weight to one user than another; opinions here are intended to be grounded in Wikipedia policy rather than expertise or anything else. (Generally, FYI, any view either way is counted, whether grounded in a specific policy or not, with the exception of apparent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">sockpuppets</a>.) -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 10:54, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"consensus" beats actual expertise? That statement is, on the face of it, ridiculous - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Expertise beats consensus? Does that make any more sense? Agreed, its not a vote. Still think self-proclaimed credentials have no place here, and shouldnt weigh in. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War">The Minister of War</a> 12:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Expertise surely should beat people who know nothing about a topic but weigh in anyway. This isn't a "vote" - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 12:48, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This seems to me to be a very anti-Wikipedian notion, Mr. Gerard. All of us voting, I hope, have done our homework as best we can. I think the most important expertise to have is to be familiar with general Wikipedia standards for notability. Experts can provide <i>information</i>, but according to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#The_role_of_expert_editors" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research#The_role_of_expert_editors</a> they must provide sources! Nobody gives me a free pass when I write physics articles; I have to find sources both in and out of academia if someone feels like questioning what I write—and I've done so before. The problem here is that Snowspinner's primary source, Dayfree Press, wouldn't normally qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reputable source</a> per Wikipedia policy. This not being a vote certainly does <i>not</i> mean it's a matter for experts only to decide! -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:01, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're applying a policy to a realm it was never meant to apply to, first of all - yes, it would be original research for me to go and start adding to Wikipedia articles, "In the view of Philip Sandifer, this webcomic is particularly important." It would not, of course, be original research for someone else to do so based on anything I were to publish on a given webcomic. But all of this is beside the point, because deletion debates are not article writing. It is absolutely not original research to consult with a subject expert on the importance of a topic to decide whether to write about it - it's a perfectly intuitive and obvious thing to do. Indeed, we consult with experts on a number of non-article writing matters in Wikipedia - Jimbo has done so in a debate regarding the creation of a separate Cantonese Wikipedia, for instance, and we have <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">Template:Expert</a> for a reason. Second of all, you misunderstand what a reputable source is for - Dayfree's website is a perfectly reputable source for the matter of "What comics are in the Dayfree syndicate right now," and consulting it is not original research - primary sources are acceptable sources, although assembling them in "novel" ways is not. I do not find any novelty in asserting that Able and Baker is on a syndicate that it is on, however. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 16:44, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point is, I am not sure that presence on Dayfree is an indicator of notability—and you are effectively using it as a "source" to assert exactly this. I think this is a point of legitimate difference of opinion, which is why we are seeing well-thought-out views on both sides—but I don't see how expertise makes one view count more. I claim that expertise in a field, <i>in general</i>, might give the expert a distorted sense of its importance, so that expertise is actually <i>more</i> relevant for article-writing than AfD's! This, combined with the explicit statement on consensus in <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a>, makes me pretty sure that "expert" views are not intended to count double. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 16:59, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And them my question becomes, on what grounds of knowledge do you say that Dayfree isn't notable? I mean, to be honest, I have doubts about the quality of your view, since I remember explaining yesterday the nature of the Modern Tales syndicate. But no, expert views shouldn't count double, because this whole notion of "counting" misses the point. To use an extreme pair of examples, as a closing admin, if I find a nomination with five votes of "Delete nn" and one vote of "Actually, as a subject expert, this is a really important article in the field," I will keep the article, assuming the subject expert claim is decently backed up. On the other hand, if I find an article with five keep votes, the first of which is a subject expert claim and the next four of which are "Keep, agree with X," and then a lone delete vote demonstrating copyvio, as a closing admin, I will delete. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 17:10, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Normally, again, you would cite some sort of <i>external</i> source to indicate Dayfree is notable; my concern is that most evidence you provide is somewhat circular, or confined within a set of webcomics that assert each others' notability. I shouldn't <i>have</i> to be an expert to understand evidence that something is notable; if it's that obscure, it doesn't seem such a good argument of notability to me. I believe that the action you propose for closing a debate would be inappropriate and inconsistent with Wikipedia precedent; admins (and everyone else) should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and not discount arguments of established users because they make a personal judgement about the "quality of [their] views." -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 17:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>However, I propose this as a compromise: your expertise, and arguments, seem to be swaying peoples' opinions to your side. That <i>is</i> part of consensus, and if that's how it goes then this is an AfD I don't mind "losing." I say again we should move forward on getting <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> up to snuff: I propose a set of criteria based on a list of syndicates and hosting services, along with awards and other critical attention, with Alexa used only as a backup. Maybe you could put a list of appropriate syndicates and hosting services on the discussion page, along with a bit about them, so we can put a new proposal together? -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 17:40, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh - so you're looking for a link like <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2011" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> where the founder of Dayfree is tagged as the 11th person in a list of 25 people in webcomics? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:06, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's the idea. And then we should discuss. My question is: does one person/host being notable mean that everyone associated with him is notable? It seems to be that, in general, a notable host may not make a notable webcomic—for example, <a href="../../../k/e/e/KeenSpace_d4c1.html" title="KeenSpace">KeenSpace</a> is clearly notable, but only some comics there are. It's not obvious, so we have to figure out how to decide. I think I'm likely to agree with you pretty substantially, but we really have to get these arguments ouf of AfD's. Guidelines will help a lot with that. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 18:14, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, yes - Dayfree is editorially chosen, Keenspace is "anyone can join." So the notability is that the comic was specifically chosen by #11 on Comixpedia's 25 people in webcomics list for a syndicate. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 18:22, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Jimbo said "reputation" and "credibility," not expertise. I see no evidence whatsoever he meant that established editors, who are acting in good faith and working actively to understand the issues, should be counted less than established editors who claim expertise. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 22:29, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

For the record, deleting this article won't destroy it as a useful resource for webcomic fans or fans of the comic; this article is already on Comixpedia, and the fans of the webcomic already know about the Comixpedia entry. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:26, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I count 6 out of 17 that don't have articles, for a total of 2/3 that do. And its claim to fame is not, and never has been, a twice removed link to Comixpedia - stop making a straw man out of it. Its claim to fame is that the editors of Dayfree Press, one of the oldest webcomics syndicates, judged it to be a comic worth making part of their syndicate.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I do not agree with the fact that being a member of Dayfree Press equals instant notability. The dayfree press is a comic collective, motivated towards the promotion of its comics. Just because <a href="../../../a/b/l/Able_and_Baker_a7be.html" title="Able and Baker">Able and Baker</a> is linked from a notable webcomic, or webcomic portal, doesn't mean that it is instantly notable. What about saying that every signed band for the most minor of record labels should have an article? What about every book/pamflet/flyer printed by the same publisher as the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> publisher? The only argument for keeping this, is that it belongs to a comic promotion syndicate. It has not on its own done anything notable, there is no in depth coverage from either the mainstream press or even the webcomic press. In the previous deletion debate, the only assertion of notability were the fan's chimes of, "It was mentioned one in passing by the Dayfree Press founder on comixPedia", and so far, that's still the only thing I see. Whereas say, Little Gamers, also on the Dayfree Press, I think is notable, because it appears in a national magazine, PC GAMER. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 17:53, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> non-notable, as per brenneman and others. There is nothing in this article that would indicate notability -- the article explains only that this is a webcomic and it has characters. This webcomic is not award-winning, widely-read, critically-acclaimed, or in any other way notable enough for an encyclopedia entry. Alexa ranking of 1,116,269 is far too high for a web site to be considered notable. The artist's output (someone pointed to 400 comics) does not indicate notability when almost no one is reading those 400 comics. Further, not all members of notable comics groups are notable (just as there are non-notable actors in notable films, non-notable bands on notable record labels, etc.), and the notability of this comic syndicate is itself questionable, as per A Man In Black. Being almost-sorta mentioned in Comixpedia is not any indicator of notability; Comixpedia allows comics artists to post their own news and regularly writes about non-notable comics (See <a href="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1253&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" rel="nofollow">L33t Pixels</a>, etc.) <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:22, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The page appears to have sources indicating notability. On issues of verifiability, and <i>objective</i> notability, personal opinion cannot be <i>expert</i> without sources. Anyone holding themselves out as <i>expert</i> should produce sources upon polite request. Consensus matters much than <i>expertise</i> because expertise is an imprecise term open to too much varying interpretation (especially in areas of pop-culture where objective certification) and <i>abuse</i> (by people claiming expertise without warrant.) Given what I said, I hold the statement "Censensus beats expertise is ridiculous" to be itself worthy of some ridicule. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:41, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I used google (both as a search and with "backlinks"), alexa, searched various blog sites (myspace, livejournal and xanga) and got VERY few results for it, this comic is barely known by anyone. I also did the same for the dayfreepress, and it also is poorly known. This has been compared to a comic syndication medium, but really it appears just to be a glorified banner ad service from their mission statement.

<dd>If it were "Neanderthal theory of the autism spectrum", we'd expect to find that our sources were those which normally cover Neanderthals and/or autism. I don't know what "Diesel Sweeties" is. Webcomics as a whole are a form of web culture that hasn't attracted much mainstream media attention, so they are a much more difficult to find authorities on because traditionally reliables sources haven't chosen to cover them much. Some degree of self-referentialism is to be expected, just as Reuters, AP, CNN, et. al. all reference each other. Cite the best references available in the article, and allow the reader to decide the reputability of them. Tag the article to indicate your lack of faith in the sources if you need to. But since it is a <u>web</u>comic, merely looking at the comic to verify its continued existence over a period of time, and seeing the public response to it satisfies some degree of verifiability. Inclusion in a known syndicate adds more. I think we have enough here primariliy because as long as they're working in an encyclopedic style, I prefer to offer other editors good faith in pursuit of their own interests, and see what develops.

<dd>That's not actually the case. Academics have a thing called "peer review" which consists not only of discussions amongst themselves, but publishing in reputable (if not widely known) locations. If there do exist topics so obscure that only a handful of people know about them and that do not have a peer-review methodology, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. I've said this above, but I'll say it again: that's what "no original research" says. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 09:46, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
