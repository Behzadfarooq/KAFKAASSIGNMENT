<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 18 "delete" votes, 6 "keep as is" votes, 3 "keep but move" or "merge" votes and 3 votes too ambiguous to call. Most of the delete votes very clearly objected to the early content. The article was extensively rewritten on 12 May. Voters after the rewrite remained split with (my count) 3 "deletes" to 2 "keeps". Only one person appeared to return to change his/her vote. (I'm not sure whether this was because they reviewed the revised article and were unswayed by the changes or whether this is a result of the recent decision to chop up the VfD page, making it more cumbersome to review previous discussions.)</p>
<p>I am going to call this one as a "no concensus" (which defaults to keep for now). If, after a reasonable period of time (and potentially a name change), this article still has not fully resolved the issues discussed below, it may become appropriate to renominate this article for deletion.</p>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike>. Yes, it's POV. But it could be made NPOV. Certainly pedophilia and homosexuality have been linked both by homophobes and pedophiles often enough so that it's a reasonable topic of research.

<dd>Irrelevant. Metaphysically, morality is much more susceptible to POV-only speech than pedophilia is. You can point to "pedophilia", out there in the real world, and talk about it in NPOV terms (even though, I'll admit, it's hard to do so and it's very easy to switch into POV language). It's much harder to point to "morality" in the real world and talk about it in the same way. (Pragmatically, it's probably <i>easier</i> to talk about "morality" without getting tempers flaring, but that's not my pointâ€”my point is that pedophilia <i>can</i> be discussed in an NPOV way.) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 23:20, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep pending re-write</b> - While, doubtlessly, this article would become as controversial/argued over/vandalized as much as the NAMBLA article (ick *shudder*), there is a fair handful of information that could be put here... though ensuring it is NPOV would take significant effort on the behalf of several individuals. If nothing more, it could look at (as already included) the history of pedophilia advocates trying to piggyback upon LGBT organizations back during the fledgling stages of the gay pride/rights movement, as well as address more current events, such as Texas' most recent legislation preventing GLBT Americans from adopting children - even to the point of allowing the state to investigate foster parent hopefuls to make sure they aren't hiding their sexual orientation - due to the legislator's reliance upon the trumped up "research" of Dr. Cameron.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. A lot of people who haven't paid much attention to the subject wonder if there is a link between pedophilia &amp; homosexuality, and Wikipedia should provide an article to straighten them out (so to speak).

<li>No vote. I disagree with the nominators attitude of equating pedophilia with child abuse; take a look at <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a>. In particular, "pedophilia can be diagnosed solely in the presence of fantasies or sexual urges on the subject's part â€” it need not involve sexual acts with children". It also discusses the media's misuse of the term. This article isn't terrible, and in fact it doesn't even appear to directly connect homosexuality to pedophilia (it only claims that certain activists act on behalf of both groups). However, unless verifiable references are given I'm not giving a keep. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 04:50, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> there has been historically a strong tendency to validate pederasty as the only acceptable version of homosexuality. It is also just a political maneuver, albeit a common and useful one, to say, "people exclusively attracted to the same sex who are also primarily attracted to underage people aren't gay". The gay rights movement was also allied for a time with groups like NAMBLA. Finally, there is a strong tendency in modern society to connect homosexuality to pedophilia. These are all valid topics for an article with the title <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_homosexuality.html" title="Pedophilia and homosexuality">Pedophilia and homosexuality</a>. The article as it stands reads to me not so much like an anti-gay POV as an anti-linking-pedophilia-with-homosexuality-in-any-way POV. It needs to be rewritten, but a useful article could have this title. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 08:46, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: Women and pedophilia aren't seen as connected in our society, and neither are heterosexuality and pedophilia. Men and pedophilia might be a valid article title, because there is a perceived connection. Look, the purpose of an article with a title like <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_homosexuality.html" title="Pedophilia and homosexuality">Pedophilia and homosexuality</a> doesn't have to be to reinforce that connection (though it would be POV to insist the two never intersect). It can just as well be used to dispel the myth of a necessary connection while at the same time noting that, like heterosexual relationships, throughout much of history the kind of gay relationships people were most likely to see were intergenerational. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:04, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I dispute that <i>"Women and pedophilia aren't seen as connected in our society, and neither are heterosexuality and pedophilia"</i>: there are many incidents reported in the popular press of women pedophiles. Similarly, there are many incidents of "heterosexual" pedophillia. I agree in principal that the subject can be discussed neutrally with the above but I don't think this page title is the place to have such an article. Too many editors in Wikipedia use article titles as POV and make dubious connections between things explicit. The defence is always that it's just a title! A policy of neutrality should not only apply to article content, but also to article title's. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 10:19, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is a huge difference between knowing that something happens and believing that there is a connection between two things. Of course people know that straight people molest children. I don't think, though, that most people, on the news or not, believe that women molest children. Regardless, if you want to find out, go out and ask 50 people to rate in order who they would feel most comfortable leaving their child alone with: a straight woman they don't know, a straight man they don't know, a lesbian they don't know, or a gay man they don't know. Gay men will come out on the bottom, straight women on the top. Whether or not they're willing to admit it, a lot of people believe at some level that gay men are after children in one way or another. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 05:01, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_common_consent.html" title="Argument from common consent">argument from common consent</a> is fallacious here - no-one disputes that some people link pedophillia with homosexuality (although I dispute your hypothetical example - evidence?). The point is irrelevant in a discussion on how to present such discussion neutrally without making explicit a controversial link and creating a non-neutral title for an article. This also does not negate my point that there have been high-profile cases of alleged straight-female pedophiles and yet this does not warrent a page on women and pedophillia, for example. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 11:08, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The topic is clearly of note, moreso than any other "foosexuality and pedophilia" (Google searches can easily confirm this). The article as it currently stands is not that bad, and has some useful information. I'm sure in time it will be even better. Yes it will be difficult to keep it NPOV, but that's no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 09:19, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're exactly right, IMO. As <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> said, "A useful article could have this title." The connection (if any) between pedophilia and homosexuality has been famously and heatedly debated in society; it's a natural (if contentious) topic for an article. I would urge people who vote to delete to consider two other points: 1) just because an article is POV is not a valid reason to delete it -- the preferred approach is to fix it (see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>); and 2) if you google "pedophilia" and "homosexuality" you get about 85,000 hits. I don't think most of these hits get you to NPOV articles -- Wikipedia could provide one of the few. I would think that in particular those people interested in gay-related issues would want an accurate article widely available, rather than abandon the issue to polemicists on the Internet. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 09:23, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aside: This points to an interesting issue. The topic of "Pedophilia and homosexuality" is an extremely well known one. If this article is deleted (or watered down via renaming and the like in order to palliate the actual issue), it automatically goes to the top of the list of "Well-known topics that are <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a> on Wikipedia." That's pretty fascinating, considering that Wikipedia covers (in theory) pretty much everything of significance; those interested in Wikipedia as a sociological/cultural phenomenon will want to take note. Are there are other well-known topics that are taboo as the subject of an article? Drop me a note on <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">my talk page</a> if you know of any. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 00:33, May 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Astounding revelation. Not. Heterosexuality and pedophilia have not been historically linked in public opinion. Society does not have a NPOV. In covering what exists in the real, biased world we may seem biased if all you look at is parallelism of article titles, but we're not. If you insist we can make a Pedophilia and heterosexuality article that says "there are no interesting intersections between pedophilia and heterosexuality." <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 04:22, May 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're both very amusing. And you're both missing the point, which is that there's no need for a "paedophilia and homosexuality" or a "paedophilia and heterosexuality" article.

<li>I don't mean to be pedantic here, but saying something doesn't make it true. The fact <i>is</i> that, whether or not they're true, there are popular links between pedophilia and especially gay male homosexuality. Discussion of these links, where they come from (there is some great literature on the topic), and so on, is important, and worthwhile. I, of course, think this article should stay, but if it is deleted, any relevant points should be moved to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>, not just <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a>, since the focus of the beliefs is on what <i>gay people</i> do, not what all pedophiles do. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 19:42, May 11, 2005 (UTC)'

<li>I don't think anyone arguing to keep actually believes that homosexuals are much more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals.

<li>I'll just cut and paste from a previous comment that covers this complaint as well: <i>There is a huge difference between knowing that something happens and believing that there is a connection between two things. Of course people know that straight people molest children. I don't think, though, that most people, on the news or not, believe that women molest children. Regardless, if you want to find out, go out and ask 50 people to rate in order who they would feel most comfortable leaving their child alone with: a straight woman they don't know, a straight man they don't know, a lesbian they don't know, or a gay man they don't know. Gay men will come out on the bottom, straight women on the top. Whether or not they're willing to admit it, a lot of people believe at some level that gay men are after children in one way or another.</i> -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 03:45, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are far too many statements that are put forth as fact (without reference) that are completely *FALSE* based on what (at least I) consider to be the definitive opinion - that of mental health professionals. It was unanimously declared by mental health professionals that homosexuality is not a disorder and that homosexuals can live normal, healthy lives; this has never been asserted about practicing pedophiles. Thus the comment "Of course, homosexuality was once considered (and is still considered by some) to be a psychological affliction" would seem to me to be <i>original research</i> in that it states the <b>complete opposite</b> of what is believed by the world of mental health professionals. I don't care if those "some" that still believe it are millions of people worldwide; millions of people also believe that other people should be property based on skin color. This article is littered with non-factual comments and that is just so; my (or anyone's) opinion on the content is not relevant. So, in this vein, it has also been asserted that there is *NO* association between pedophilia and homosexuality by these same mental health professionals. Not *SOME*, not *MAYBE,* but *NONE.* To use analogy, saying there is a connection because SOME pedophiles are also homosexuals is like saying that because *SOME* heterosexuals practice S&amp;M, there is a connection between S&amp;M and heterosexuality. And this is quickly dissolving into a rant, so if you haven't gotten the point by now, you never will... <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 05:36, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Perhaps the problem here is that we're viewing the article in different ways. I see it as a sociology article, chronicalling why homosexuality and pedophilia have been historically linked despite the complete lack of scientific correlation. You seem concerned that it is a psychology/biology article that will condemn homosexuality as related to pedophilia. I would ask that you consider the article as sociology - not having it would be comparable to having no article explaining that "millions of people also believe that other people should be property based on skin color" (which is clearly of note). <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 08:46, May 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The article doesn't state that some <i>mental health professionals</i> believe homosexuality is a disease. It states that some <i>people</i> do, which is undoubtedly true.

<dd>I think that's right on target with what he/she is saying though. Just because some people think there is a link between pedephilia and homosexuality doesn't make it so. I don't know how I can stress this point more clearly than I did above. It is a false conclusion based on non-logic! Look at it analogously: All scissors are used for cutting. Some scissors are used to cut bananas. Therefore all scissors are used to cut bananas. Does that make sense? No! You're jumping to a conclusion that has not been proven. Just because SOME pedophiles happen to <b>ALSO BE HOMOSEXUALS</b> does not link the two. If that was the case we would have an article called "Pedophilia and Blonde Hair" or "Pedophilia and Left-Handed-People", using the exact same kind of logic. Why not have an article called "Pedophilia and Molestation Survivors?"...since it far more likely that a pedophile was abused themself than it is that they are a genuine homosexual person. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 21:19, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm so with what you're saying, but I don't think that an article called <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia_and_homosexuality.html" title="Pedophilia and homosexuality">Pedophilia and homosexuality</a> has to posit that there is an actual connection. A discussion of the fact that people think there is a necessary connection, that at certain periods in the past pederasty, at least, has been thought to be the only acceptable form of homosexuality, and so on, would make for a perfectly acceptable article. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 21:47, May 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Erm, no-one is suggesting that anyone ignore anything, but stating the above is "true" ignores the controversy of the statements made and the complexity. For example, the link you suggest is between pedophillia advocacy and gay rights, not homosexuality and pedophillia!

I don't think you have a very strong case for making that distinction, but fine. Granted. There are still two more links which you don't address - that, in fact, you ignore. It seems that an article with this title (or at least the debate about its deletion) attracts people who aren't interested in NPOV on both sides.

The fact is that the practices predate the <i>modern</i> concept of pedophilia itself (though the term is encountered in antiquity). As a matter of fact, we should think about making some distinction between pedophilia as a psychological dysfunction, with its constellation of social and sexual disabilities, and pedophilia as a cultural practice engaged in by healthy members of societies with other standards than our own (see <a href="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/MIDDLEEAST.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/MIDDLEEAST.HTM" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on the Talmudic view of the betrothal of three-year-old girl children, and Gilbert Herdt on the Melanesian boy-insemination rites, for example.</li>

<p>So, what's the verdict? A lot of people have voted for deletion. To reach consensus, I'd like to try to summarize the points made so far:</p>

<li>The article is inherently POV, as its name is POV. At the least, the name should be changed. Proposed names: 1) 'Pedophilia and sexuality'</li>
<li>The article itself is inherently POV, as no link exists between homosexuality as a sexual orientation and pedophilia as a 'sexual orientation' or mental affliction. Deletion is the only remedy. The content of this article should be moved to other articles.</li>
<li>Though the article may be biased now, it could be edited to be NPOV. Criticism of the article should be put tp use, to remove bias.</li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">pedophilia</a></li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">childlove movement</a></li>
<li>This content should be merged with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a>; as the percieved link is often used as a slur.</li>
<li>The article shouldn't be removed, regardless of bias. Wikipedia needs an article like this, and removing it would be biased and would suggest a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may have missed a few points. In my opinion, the article should remain. I would not object to a rename, provided the new name was fitting.
