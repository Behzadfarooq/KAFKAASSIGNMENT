<li><b>Comment</b>: And who do we know from Sussex??? Don't be such a drama queen, Smith's entry is up for deletion because he is a nobody in respectable British politics, he is an attention seeking right winger who spends most of his time posting a variety of rude and obscene messages about the Conservative Party and its leadership on his own message boards. If he was well known in respectable Conservative Circles as you put it, he would be listed in the search engines as being 'A well known respectable Conservative, but he is not. Most entries deal with the Conservative party dumping the right wing Monday Club to shake off its racist image, and Mike Smith setting up the CDA in an attack on the Conservatives's cleaner and respectable image.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I would support deletion not of Smith's article, but of unsigned comments as above which have been made by those who lost a recent libel action to him and supporters of the loser. Hundreds of thousands of people live in Sussex. I know a few. How many do you know? What a stupid comment. 81.131.91.205 13:25, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes I am sure you would support the deletion of all comments not just mine that is the trouble with you right wingers, your fascist agendas are becoming so predictable. If you know who I am then it is not anonymous is it! I did not lose a recent libel action where did you get that ridiculous idea from? If I had lost then surely I would not be posting on here because of an alleged injunction that is supposed to have come my way as a result of Michael Keith-Smith's action. Also I would be £17,500 down in my bank balance. Of course I am not but I know a certain Sussex man that is. He may have got the ruling, but that means nothing if you can't act on any part of it: As he shut me up? has he got lvl9.org shut down? As he got a penny out of me? You know the answer to all three is a resounding 'NO' so just what has Smith won? Do tell.. and I always knew it would mean nothing which, is why I didn't bother filing a defence in the first place.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well Tracy, since you have been an enthusiastic supporter of the BNP and currently describe yourself as a 'Neocon' perhaps you should say 'We right-wingers'. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I'm afraid you did indeed lose a major libel action and although I haven't received any money from you, for the simple reason that you have no job, no money, and live in rented property, I'm not out of pocket at all. In fact I'm in profit thanks to £40,000 gratefully received from a good friend of yours, also sued by me. Do thank him for his generosity.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I lost nothing, but I have gained so much and you will never stand as a political candidate again and you know that, even if you won't admit it. I am working as an agency lecturer at the moment, I have been since November 2005. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to find out where, although it might cost a bit. Go on it has been a bit quiet of late and I love it when you spend money on me. BTW what happened to your invisible injunction? I had some advice off a solicitor friend of mine about that (I developed a web site for him, he was very pleased, much better than osmond and osmond's) and he informed me you would have to pay alot of money to have a PI track me down and even then, the PI would find it difficult to find out who I am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, unless MI5 has created a new identity for you, I think we know exactly who you are already. What a pity your supposed IT skills didn't extend to concealing your own name and address. And just think; if you had helped your buddy Septic to do the same he would be a much happier bunny this year, so maybe we should lay the blame for his misfortune at your door <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Maybe you would like to tell us just what you have won? I hid my IP on the Yahoo, I didn't know a desperate, vindictive individual would be stupoid enough to pay thousands to get it from Yahoo.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Oh, and as it seems to have slipped your memory, you twice attempted to file a defence, and the Court refused to accept your incoherent ramblings on both occasions.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> it was rejected because I was taking the P**s. As were my letters to your solicitors, nobody takes you seriously least of all me.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>As for 'Sussexman, I have never lived in Sussex, and if I were posting under multiple IDs I would not be sending you coded messages advertising the fact. Despite the proximity of Sussex, a Hampshireman is no more likely to describe himself as a 'Sussexman' than a Yorkshire woman would call herself a Lancastrian. Very understandable considering that you reside in Lancashire.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah I already figured out it is Dormant Denny aka Maggieforever 2003</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Are you referring to Douglas Denny who is National Secretary of UKIP and Chairman of the disciplinary committee? Not for the first time you have taken leave of whatever senses you possessed.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: We have quite a few names for him over on Level 9, Dormant Denny is the least offensive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm glad 'Level 9' continues to give you pleasure. Sadly, as your software will have informed you, I have not visited it since very shortly after my High Court victory.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>I understand that Mike, you're afraid of what you might discover about yourself. Level 9 has become very popular, and any search engine research of your name in a veriety of forms pops up with Level 9 stuff. I know you're not very well liked but I didn't know you had so many enemies. You stay away when you have been beat, like you stay away from Ed, because when you reported him to the police the tables were turned and your were labelled officially a racist because of the evidence Ed gave them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Oh? Seems I really am famous. Perhaps I had better pay another visit, after all. If any of these 'enemies' are genuine, and identifiable, we wouldn't want to deny them a share of the action, would we?<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: They won't be identifiable, that is one thing they are guranteed on my forum. I wouldn't say you were famous but you are the butt of Jokes and satire. The material never stops coming in.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well Tracy, I would sooner be a political failure with a brand-new BMW delivered yesterday than a miserable failure full stop like yourself. Never mind. Keith-Smith v Williams has ensured you a minor place in history - as an all-time loser bereft of £17,500. As for Wiki. Oh well I'm sure I'll lose a lot of sleep over that, but I must say it has suddenly become quite entertaining <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Keith_Smith_e59e.html" title="User:Mike Keith Smith">Mike Keith Smith</a> 07:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Oh dear, sounds like you're desperate to make yourself a winner one way or another. I couldn't care less if you had a sherman tank delivered yesterday, is that how you see status, material luxuries, you're much sadder than ever Mike, will you ever grow up!</li>
