	    <p>Good article. I found it amusing yet respectful of Mr. Bell. At times the show is utterly whacky without trying to be, yet Mr. Bell maintains a cool seriousness with whomever may call it. He is truly a radio icon and his show does indeed make for entertaining listening. Now George Noory and Ian Punnitt are entirely another matter. Art Bell could be talking paint drying and I'd probably listen. FDM</p>

<p>Just reverted edit from anonymous IP (4.228.255.239). Art's first retirement date was set from 2001 to 1998 - is this true? Refs please. Richard Hoaglan was added to famous guest lists - this paragraph explicitly mentions "non-paranormal"-oriented guests.

Regarding Art's decision to move to the Philippines. With all the bad blood as a result of the circulated hoax Filipino letter, Art is moving to the Philippines in separatist territory controlled by the muslim terrorist group Abu Sayyaf to host a nationally broadcast radio show. Only a matter of time before Art is kidnapped and held hostage by Abu Sayyaf. I for sure will place a bet on (online betting site removed) in regard to Art's latest publicity stunt to get himself killed. The FCC should investigate Clear Channel Radio as willing coconspirators to a bunch of terrorists. Hal</p>
<p>Regarding Heaven's Gate an academic named Courtney Brown Associate Professor of Political Science at Emory University told Art Bell that a scientist dicovered the companion to Hale Bopp. Courtney Brown also explained that he remote viewed the passangers and that the aliens are good natured as opposed to the other kind.</p>
<p>Article states: "Bell is one of only a few talk show hosts who do not screen calls." I'm pretty sure that he does now screen calls. I seem to recall hearing callers refer to the screener lately.

<p>I removed this edit by <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">User:Kaibabsquirrel</a>&#160;:</p>
<p>Indeed, there has been some speculation whether Art Bell was the pseudonymous "Dave Rabbit" who operated the infamous <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_First_Termer_ad6a.html" title="Radio First Termer">Radio First Termer</a> pirate station <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/rft/rft.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/rft/rft.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saigon.html" title="Saigon">Saigon</a>, but there has been no confirmation of this from Bell nor anyone else.)</p>
<p>Speculation from who? A personal home page isn't enough. And since there's been no confirmation, then there's no reason for it to be in an encyclopedia. Sorry. If credible sources are found, then we can Talk about it here. --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightMonkey_f586.html" title="User:NightMonkey">NightMonkey</a> 04:18, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The speculation was from the Radio First Termer home page at <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/rft/dave.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibiblio.org/jwsnyder/rft/dave.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which I guess is just somebody's personal page and doesn't count as speculation. Several other web sites echo the speculation (example, <a href="http://www.frn.net/scripts/john/vines/postings.cgi?action=reply&amp;forum=The+Grapevine+Pirate+Shortwave&amp;number=1&amp;topic=000764.cgi&amp;TopicSubject=Art+Bell+&amp;replyto=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frn.net/scripts/john/vines/postings.cgi?action=reply&amp;forum=The+Grapevine+Pirate+Shortwave&amp;number=1&amp;topic=000764.cgi&amp;TopicSubject=Art+Bell+&amp;replyto=18" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, most of which cite the Radio First Termer home page as their source and so I guess aren't really speculation.

<p>As a person who never heard of this guy till now, may I ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramona's death is discussed twice in the article, in separate places. Is there a good reason for this?</li>
<li>But why is she mentioned in his article at all? She is not stated as having contributed to his work. Lots of celebrities have spouses, but unless the spouse does something worthy of note, they do not usually merit any mention in Wikipedia articles.</li>
<li>And why does she deserve yet another mention, in <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If she's notable, let's hear all about it. Otherwise, I suggest removing all references to her. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 12:18, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the mention is a rote duplicate, then it should be removed.</li>
<li>She co-owned with Art their radio station in Parump, NV. She occasionaly was heard on the air with him. She is the stated reason for his latest retirement (to spend more time with her).</li>
<li>I dunno if her death should be mentioned in <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deaths_in_2006.html" title="Deaths in 2006">Deaths in 2006</a>, but her death will most certainly call into question whether Art Bell will take a haitus from his show, and how long that might be.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Art often kept his listeners up-to-date on his household doings, and that means many of his listeners (including those in my household) are deeply saddened for his loss, especially as it appears to be so sudden and unexpected. That being said, I don't know, in this case, if there is a good rejoiner to the question of her "noteability", at least from me. Perhaps someone else can make a grander case? --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightMonkey_f586.html" title="User:NightMonkey">NightMonkey</a> 17:12, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But that is not stated in our article. There is no connection in the article between Art Bell's work and anything to do with his wife. Either the connection needs to be made, or remove references to her. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 23:05, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ramona Bell was a radio executive (management/producer) and was instrumental in helping Art conceive and develop his show until it's being picked up by Premier Radio, and then later being purchased by Premier. Her contributions behind the scenes are as formitible as Art's are "out there" where we hear it all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Great. Then please put that information into the article. That will stop people like me asking questions about why her death is mentioned all over the place when there's no other information about her.

<p>I'm not sure if it's appropriate for Airyn's name to have "Irene", including quotes, preceeding it. Not to be pedantic, but Art pointed out in his show that her name, Airyn, is pronounced as "Irene" in the Phillipines which would make the addition homonymly redundant. He further pointed out however, that to his mind her name seemed like it should be pronounced as "Erin" which I think is a reasonable assumption to make. Perhaps rather than placing "Irene" before her name (pronounced Irene), including parenthesis would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Typical biographies do not have such a section. Here it does not add any usful information about Bell. The only marriages that had any impact on Bell's career are the last two. And they are talked about plenty elsewhere in the article. Could the Marriages section just be removed? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarenAnn_2b02.html" title="User:KarenAnn">KarenAnn</a> 13:36, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are incorrect when you state that typical biographies do not have such a section. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Taylor_fff3.html" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> come to mind. I see no problem with the "marriages" section in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Bell_b332.html" title="Art Bell">Art Bell</a> article, especially since, as you noted yourself, the last two have had an impact on his career. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>O.K., but the relevant marriages are covered aplenty in other sections, and it is usually (from on editing standpoint) best to move through an article as smoothly as possible, avoiding redundant material. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarenAnn_2b02.html" title="User:KarenAnn">KarenAnn</a> 03:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Art did voice work on the new video game Prey, as himself on a radio broadcast, much like CtC. He even says "Good even ing from the High Desert," and the audio segments featuring his voice work is done in his signature radio host style.</li>

<p>The article state Bell's father as "Arthur Bell, Jr II". Isn't that redundant? Aren't most Juniors only called 'Junior' until they have a son of their own with a shared name, at which time, they re-name themselves 'the Second'? (Likewise, 'Senior' would be just plain 'Arthur Bell', until his son is born, when he becomes 'Senior', then when his identically named grandson is born, he would become 'the First'...) So is his dad 'Junior', or 'the Second'? (I would guess 'the Second', since the subject of this article is 'the Third'.) <a href="../../../e/h/u/User%7EEhurtley_1062.html" title="User:Ehurtley">Ehurtley</a> 20:05, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
