<li>This article is about a man who was instrumental in building up an elite military unit. Given the sensitive topic nature, and contemporary security situation we have now, it is unlikely that there will be many publications on these elite units, let alone the key people behind them.

<li>Article does not show how he was instrumental in 'building up an elite military unit'. Four of those voted have already indicated that, from their reading of the article. The onus is now on the article writer, not the nominator/voters. We obviously can't explain why, not knowing the guy.

<li>I was commenting on your comments, nothing personal, take it easy. He was the CO from 71 to 78, Commandant 81 to 88, he was thus involving in recruiting, training, and establishing the doctrine of the formation. Clearly, he is a founding pioneer. I think there is some misunderstanding over the word "recruit", it does not mean handing out application forms and conducting desk interviews. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 16:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I fail to comprehend your arguments on his non-notability, a man who was largely responsible for helping to setup an elite military formation for an entire country. A man who was one of the first two Commando-trained soldiers in the country. A man who came up with the first training programme for the Commando formation. If being the first man to be trained to be an elite soldier isnt "doing something extra or special beyond his job" (at least during his time), then just how do you justify articles like <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>, when all he did as a Computer programme company founder is to, well, sell computer software?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>'Telling someone off'? I was asked by a fellow Wikipedian Huaiwei for my opinion and I merely gave it. As nominator I explain myself. I was telling off someone for ad hominem attacks, which disrupts VfD. A valid point is never retorted. The discussion topic revolves around the article subject, not the nominator.

<p><b>Metacomment</b>: I previously closed this debate as "delete" on grounds of lacking reliable sources, esp based on Huaiwei's comment <i>it is unlikely that there will be many publications on these elite units, let alone the key people behind them. It is difficult to find good sources, but notability isnt based on how many good sources there are in cases like this</i>. But I'm willing to entertain more input on the issue of sources so I'm re-opening debate. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-02-12 05:14Z</small></i></span></p>

<li>As nominator, I agree. I think my main purpose for throwing this out is to get some directives on army personnel. At present Wikipedia is pretty blurry over their inclusion/deletion. I'm not so concerned about this one particular officer. As a LTC, he is right smacked in the middle of the Singapore officer hierarchy - though I'm less concerned about rank than with genuine contributions. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 16:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Maybe I've missed something, but I am curious as to how these editors know about the man if there are no publications - word of mouth and reputation?

<li>Thank you very much for allowing more air time on the above matter.</li>
<li>I believe my statement has caused some misunderstanding there. I was actually refering to the lack of a high number of courses, but not on the non-existance of any source. The book in question was published by the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Armed_Forces_4830.html" title="Singapore Armed Forces">Singapore Armed Forces</a> in 1995, and available from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library%2C_Singapore_a18c.html" title="National Library, Singapore">National Library, Singapore</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/f/SAFTI_c735.html" title="SAFTI">SAFTI</a> library. I am not sure if this link will work, but here is the book's entry on its catalogue <a href="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+14276+3031+7674336+1+0" class="external autonumber" title="http://vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/cw_cgi?fullRecord+14276+3031+7674336+1+0" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The book was a special commemorative volume produced to mark the formation's 35th anniversary, and was previously not readily available for public viewing until the tie-up between the military and national libraries. Such is the difficulty of obtaining information on otherwise "classified" information, and the difficulty in looking for sources as I earlier alluded to. Hence, it is not always feasible to use google searches to establish notability on certain topics.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 07:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per some of the points mentioned above. The article at least claims notability. And he is a Lieutenant Colonel, which is not super high up the ranks it is still nothing to sneeze at! That is staff level. Hmmm... arguably all staff level officers are notable? Heh, perhaps not. But still, it does make it more likely. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 10:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Assuming good faith there is a reference given, but there should be two sources to meet the "multiple" criterion. I think that it should be kept and tagged for more sources which validate notability, which comes from creating the commando group. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:18, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There appears to be only one book describing his work, and that is not suficcient to meet the requirement of multiple independent and relaible sources. He is mentioned in the article on the commando forse, and perhaps that mention could be expanded to a paragraph. Lt. Col. in a small military organization is not inherently notable. Doing your job well, even in the military, does not bypass other requirements for demonstrating that a person has notability per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 22:26, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

As I mentioned earlier, there is little literature on elite military forces in Singapore for obvious security reasons, and hence I do not feel quantity of sources should be used as a primary criterion for deletion.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> This article has merit in that it describes someone important to the Singapore Army, but he did not have much worldly recognition, beyond those who had to study his history for their mandatory service in the Singapore armed services. The US military trains a lot of personnel from other nations, to a variety of degrees; his training would have been sponsored as part of a larger military training program to act as a general counter-point to ongoing cold-war fears at the time. In fact, I am not clear what active duties he participated in. Other military pioneers were usually involved in some active duty.--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakujo_a2c9.html" title="User:Shakujo">Shakujo</a> 05:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you basically agree he is not notable even in Singapore? Okay. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarontay_fcc6.html" title="User:Aarontay">Aarontay</a> 17:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is, the average Singapore Joe/Jane doesn't know that many people outside his or her select band of notables. A person well known to one Singaporean may not be well known to another. You are talking about some who have problems remembering their MPs, the Minister for Environment, the CoA etc, let alone a LTC for a Battalion who seldom hog the news. Ironically, if he murdered or was killed, he'll be remembered. We know <a href="../../../h/u/a/Huang_Na_d278.html" title="Huang Na">Huang Na</a> and Mr <a href="../../../t/t/_/TT_Durai_2548.html" title="TT Durai">TT Durai</a>. Just a general observation. I'm saying notability in Singapore is a very vague notion. No one agrees exactly who is important, other than our PM. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 18:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Notable is a very vague notation <b>anywhere</b>. But there are certainity degrees of it. This fellow is definitely on the very low side even among active military soldiers. I wonder how notable he is if he doesn't even appear in an search of the ST archives for the last 50 years. If I didn't know better, I would have thought your coment about the Average Singapore Joe is meant to be insulting to the rest of us. Anyway I think the fact that the sources aren't independent coupled with the lack of real world notability (even taking into account how ignorant people who aren't wikipedia editors are&#160;:) ), makes me wonder why anyone would support keeping this article. Excuses about military secrets can only go so far. Otherwise people will start creating articles about Joe X that nobody can verify and use the same execuse. .<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarontay_fcc6.html" title="User:Aarontay">Aarontay</a> 18:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>Merge</b> Seems to be the best compromise available.</strike> <b>Delete</b>, I just looked at the Singapore military leaders category, it's pretty amazing to see that this Clarance fellow is listed, when There are probably more relevant leaders than him. Seems a bit strange to list one LTC however accomplished, when most of the past Chief of armies etc are not! To add, I'm Singaporean (though I don't edit the singapore sections at all), to be honest I have not heard of this person. Not that this means the average Singaporean has never heard of him of course.
