<p><b>Nomination withdrawn.</b> I can see I'm not going to get a consensus on all of these, so I guess we'll have to relist them all separately.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I agree that some of the above might not merit an article, but by lumping them all together you lost me. There are some games on this list that simply do not belong here.

<li>Well then where is the notability??? We can remove Old Maid from this list if it need be, but tell me how the rest of these do not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a> item #8. <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:yellow; background-color:maroon; font-weight:bold">Aplomado</span> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">U</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" rel="nofollow">C</a> 01:00, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I fail to see what's indiscriminate about the article on <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Maid_63ce.html" title="Old Maid">Old Maid</a> (for example). By that criterion, you may as well add <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts_%28game%29.html" title="Hearts (game)">Hearts</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge.html" title="Contract bridge">Bridge</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cribbage.html" title="Cribbage">Cribbage</a> to your list (or even <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_%28game%29.html" title="Monopoly (game)">Monopoly</a>), and I'll say <b>Keep</b> on all of them. I agree that this isn't supposed to be a "how to" manual, but it's pretty hard to talk about a game without discussing the rules. Where <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> would apply in an article on a game would be inclusion of an in-depth strategy guide. If you honestly think Old Maid (or other games, that's just my example) isn't notable, put a "{notable}" tag on the entry. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 01:11, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're not getting the point. These pages are not <i>sourced</i> nor do they assert any notability. See: <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>. It is perfectly easy to source that a popular card game is indeed popular. Providing an instruction manual is not an acceptable substitute. You people seem to be suggesting that every card game and every drinking game is ipso facto notable. I don't see how that jives with Wikipedia rules. <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:yellow; background-color:maroon; font-weight:bold">Aplomado</span> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">U</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Aplomado" rel="nofollow">T</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Aplomado" rel="nofollow">C</a> 01:44, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The analogy above doesn't seem to be true. A constitutional monarchy is <i>de jure</i> a monarchy, but <i>de facto</i> a democracy (generally). The current article describes a <i>de jure</i> theocracy in which the officers of government are not part of the theocratic hierarchy. If it were truly analogous to a constitutional monarchy, it might be used to define the later <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince-Bishop_e73a.html" title="Prince-Bishop">Prince-Bishops</a>, or the status of Andorra, where the Bishop of Urgell is co-head of state. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 22:13, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Might I note that there is a real danger of 'Constitutional Theocracy' eventually being absurdly defined in the article as religious political parties operating in a non-religious political system. If used appropriately 'Constitutional Theocracy' would be used to describe a country like <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> or to a lesser extent, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. It is of my opinion that if this article is kept it will simply be used for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> to discredit certain political parties and lobby groups through the pages of wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 12:23, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>, leaning transwiki. It can be applied as a theory, and may have been applied to some regimes, but is it a notable, defined system? The links above (from an academic paper with less than 1000 views, and a baptist news agency) don't really move me too much.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If the article were only going to be about Iran's system of government, that would be a no-brainer to keep ... but judging from the history of the article, it's begging to be an edit war article where anyone to the right of any particular editor will be branded as a Constutional Theocrat. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:59, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not believe that this album should be included on this website. Sweet Alice is not a real album and is not even considered part of Alice in Chains's discography. Allmusicguide does not account for this album, nor does amazon, and when I type "sweet alice" in google the only page it links to is this wikipedia article. Not only that, but on both Alice in Chains DVDs, Their unplugged performance and their video compilation, on their "Discography" section, it does not even list "Sweet Alice" as a release from the band. This page should be removed because people believe that this is the debut release from that band when in fact it was not.</p>

It is true that linda christas theory is not as yet in the popular culture, but I would hope that one doesn't have to be a known item like Chubby Checker for the public to accept the theory as a valid addition to the evoltion of educational thought.</li>

<dd>After all, if we were simply to look at what we've got out there in terms of established theory, we end up with a top-down disaster. The reason that the United States is in such trouble educationally is that anything that doesn't smack of central control doesn't get a hearing. Surely, that is the very reason for Wikipedia, to give the world up-to-the-minute insights in terms of something that might save kids from the trauma of being in a system patterned after the Prussian military of the 19th century. Both John Dewey and William Harris loved Prussian military manuals. Therefore, most of the educational systems in the world depend on klaxons, bells and whistles, and, of course, punishment to force children to bow their heads. That may have been great for the 19th century, but Linda Christas and its current theories need to be established by definition. I mean why go out of our way to keep only the status quo. If we follow the advice of the previous writers, we will be capping the availability of information necessary for educational progress. I mean linda christas theory has been championed by many well know professionals. For example, a Pulitzer Prize winner, Efrem Zimbalist, endorses linda christas theory wholeheartedly. That is the system that is used at the Curtis institute. Come on fellas, give this theory a break. Sounds like you guys wouldn't have liked Copernicus either, until the gentleman was listed by google of course.</dd>

<li>Personally, my vote for deletion has nothing to do with my belief (pro or con) in a subject, only in whether keeping an article <i><b>improves Wikipedia as an encyclopedia</b></i>. By all means, if you can craft Linda christas into an encyclopedic article with a neutral point-of-view, please do - I would enjoy reading it. As it stands, however, the entry is confusing, un-sourced, and makes little or no verifiable claims of notability. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 04:33, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm really not sure what you mean. When I go to an encyclopedia I want a general reference, a definition for general discussion purposes. For me, the kind of thing I'm hearing that is "best" for Wikipedia I wouldn't understand, and, therefore such an encycolpedia I wouldn't use, and voila, therefore whatever "wisdom" was to be found within the machinations of higher level thought would be lost on me. I say that simple and direct is good. I certainly understand the entry as it has been presented. But, I have no idea what you mean by "un-sourced." Stated differently, I can understand the encyclopedic entry for "boron" without having to have an explanation of quark spin theory. I suppose that would be more complete, but it wouldn't be neutral. Just ask Hawking. His best seller is a best seller because he doesn't confuse the issues with "sourcing." He just gives us the simple definition of the terms like "singularity" and everyone loves his material....for the layman you know. Isn't that really what Widipedia is for. If we are going to make this encyclopedia unreachable to the masses, me included in that bunch, I cry foul........I say foul! and for shame gentlemen. Lily (Parent Volunteer.

<li>'<b>Keep'</b> Being somewhat familiar with the well-known authors of which the Linda Christas theory is a blend, I find this to be a worthy addition. Several thousand people worldwide appear to be very familiar with this theory, therefore it is important to include in order to have an 'unabridged' encyclopedia. Google is not the final authority, imo.... it often comes up very short for me when doing research (admittedly specialized).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tech27 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tech27_df2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tech27">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Just dropped into the Help Desk. What in the world is "notability?" If we consider children notable, then linda christas theory is notable. In other words, as another parent of a child subject to linda christas theory, I understand and like what I've read here. I was an early Waldorff school convert. But, there were some additions that I would have liked to see in Steiner's thinking. And, linda christas theory is my answer. Please keep this entry. I will volunteer to improve it over time, but we need to have a seed around which to work, and this article works for me.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.143.9.144 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.143.9.144.html" title="User talk:71.143.9.144">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.143.9.144_787b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.143.9.144">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>It is not clear to me what this article is about. The text that is there contains many POV statements, and despite the numerous links, the way that the text is put together seems all too much like original research. There is some good stuff, but pretty much all of it already exists in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> and related articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> First, I really think the fact that Notorious finding the league not notable is not a valid point for deletion. I, as well, believe the league is important enough to be documented, the struggles of the WHA should are important enough in the hockey community to be covered on Wikipedia. My issue is that it has already been covered, as stated by Traynor, making the article unnecessary. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDMighton_5f64.html" title="User:DMighton">DMighton</a> 07:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For starters, this isn't a vanity article; I know the person who wrote it and can vouch for the fact that they aren't Audra and don't know her personally. But the bottom line for me is that I genuinely don't see how she can be deemed any less notable than Connie Wilkins, who's had an article for months whose notability nobody has ever challenged. The justification given on Audra's talk page so far is that Connie has been a candidate for the Conservative Party nomination in Kingston (except that AFD consensus has already made clear that unsuccessfully contesting a party nomination <i>isn't</i> a valid criterion of WP notability) and that she's organized political campaigns (which, as Audra's article makes clear, Audra has too, so it doesn't constitute a <i>difference</i> between them.) I think they're both <b>keep</b>able, personally, but my bottom line is that <i>whatever</i> happens, Connie and Audra need to be treated equivalently; there's absolutely no valid claim to be made that Connie is <i>more</i> notable than Audra is. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> AfD debates are considered on their own merits. It's better to resist the "If A is OK, why not B?" argument because no two people are the same, unless we're talking 5 year old twins who play the same character on a soap opera. If you believe another individual to be non-notable, that's a separate matter. WP:Relative notability to Connie Wilkins isn't a widely accepted guideline, hence Audra Williams notability would be better considered with respect to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 22:33, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There <i>is</i> a WP guideline regarding <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">bias</a>, and it <i>does</i> constitute bias by inclusion to deem Audra somehow less notable than a person whose only real claim to notability is performing an identical role on the other side of the political spectrum. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wilkins role is not identical to Williams, however. Wilkins is the owner of Free Dominion whilst Williams was a staffer at rabble; one of several moderators of its forum "babble". As I said on the Williams talk page, if you are looking for an equivalent figure to Wilkins it would be <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Rebick_748c.html" title="Judy Rebick">Judy Rebick</a>, not Audra Williams.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <i>tone</i> of the article is definitely unencyclopedic, but its main problem is that it is totally undocumented. However, basing myself on various news reports I've read about this, what is written here is not an exaggeration of the situation. I'm convinced this can be documented with reputable sources – if anyone cares enough to look into it – which should yield enough material to wikify this in a proper way. We can then ascribe the statements presented and add some obligatory neutralizing statements like that the Indonesian authorities deny the allegations or whatever. (Don't look my direction; I'm not gonna do it.) <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:34, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Puya is a welcoming club that draws people in with open arms and discriminates against none. Local events promote networking, unity, and everything else that The Puya embodies.

<li><b>Comment</b> As a member of The Puya, I object strongly to this deletion.

The Puya is an inspiration to all of us, and should remain on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As a member of UCLA's The Puya and a counselor as a student and alumnus at UCLA Unicamp, I started The Puya club at Tulane University as a graduate student. During Spring Break 2006, I hosted USC law and Loyola Law The Puya students at my apartment who came to New Orleans for their Legal Aid Projects.<a href="http://lawweb.usc.edu/sconnect/KatrinaPresentation.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lawweb.usc.edu/sconnect/KatrinaPresentation.htm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> additionally, I organized the New Orleans version of Puyapalooza, whose proceeds were of course donated to UCLA Unicamp.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>I am the founder and president of the Computer Recycling Club at Diamond Bar High School. I have worked with the The Puya on several occasions, and the club has helped our club with finding and restoring dozens of computers. All of the members of The Puya have been very generous and helpful, and all of us at the Computer Recycling Club would like to thank The Puya members for their hard work and dedication. I would object strongly to the deletion of The Puya from Wikipedia because it is a great club which inspires many to help others. --Rishi Kumar</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am appealing to the good will of the Wikipedians. Yes, it is true that 7 years ago, this whole The Puya thing started off as a joke. It was complete nonsense, two guys getting together to hang out, became three guys, four members, eight, and so on. But pretty soon, we had enough people where we formed a club. It was something like <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_club.html" title="Fight club">fight club</a>, or a fraternity. Our goal was not to just hang out and drink, but we planned events like block parties, tailgates, etc.. it was what you would expect from undergrads.</li>
</ul>
<p>As our members graduated and went on to either the working class or grad school, they started the group on their own campuses or workplaces.</p>
<p>As we grew and matured, we found ourselves involved in many activities. For example, people at Cal helped join a protest against the Armenian genocide, some at UCLA volunteered for UniCamp, while others were inspired to start their own groups. Nevertheless, the whole project and spirit of the group has been marred by never having any legitimacy. Sure we had t-shirts, but that's not enough. Our goal is to legitimize the group so that when we have an activity or event, we will be recognized. Because up until now, whenever we mentioned our group, everyone thought it was a joke. But it isnt. For example, during the Armenian genocide protest at Cal, when asked what group the members where from, and they said "The Puya," the writer laughed and refused to name our group. It has been an uphill battle to gain our legitimacy. Just because we are not mentioned in an article, does not meen our members did not participate.</p>
<p>Yes it is true that if you google "The Puya" you might find articles about the founder, puya. But that does not mean the group does not exist. We have set up a myspace group, and will be setting up groups on friendster and facebook to show our membership.</p>
<p>We are not a local college club, unless your definition of local includes <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Fransico_fcab.html" title="San Fransico">San Fransico</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Barbara_58f3.html" title="Santa Barbara">Santa Barbara</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>.--65.88.178.10 19:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC) --Thepuya 19:28, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8?

<li><b>Keep</b> I am a college student (of age, no less!), but I do not drink. With that said, all of my friends at my school play Kings. When I visit friends at other schools, their friends play Kings. When I went to parties in high school (which was quite rare), everyone played Kings. For those without the coordination for Beer Pong, Kings is the game of choice; based on popularity alone, if any drinking game deserves an article on WP, it's this one.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on "Hi-Lo" has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:55, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> The band's name gets zero Google hits. The article makes no attempt to even assert notability, and can thus be speedied.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on "Horserace" has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:57, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on this drinking game has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:58, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a verifiable board game played by a vast number of people.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> for two reasons: There is a commercially published game with the same title and similar rules (biggest difference being the lack of reference to drinking), so describing this as a public domain game may present copyright problems; and, really, the contents of one book about drinking games are not encyclopedic content for one article, let alone a hundred. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:52, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With over 250+ drinking game books, noting that one book lists it and it ISN'T the msost complete guide suggests wider acceptance. Besides, the nom claimed it was unsourced - we now have a source. He claimed it was unverifiable - that is false. Thus... --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 15:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Instead of "suggesting wider acceptance", why not tell us how many of those hundreds of books actually lists this game? Thousands of topics, maybe hundreds of thousands, are mentioned in a few non-authoritative books but are not important enough for encyclopedia entries. What makes this book worth citing as a reference, and not just a case for <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> or Wikipedia is not for things made up in a prison cell? So far you've only verified that this game (and all these other nominated ones) appear in one book whose importance I don't see. You also haven't addressed the Milton Bradley copyrighted game. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:07, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I know nothing about the Milton Bradley game, but if the game exists, more strength behind keeping this article. The nomination said unsourced and unverifiiable. Published third-party sources easily solve this problem. Why is this book worth citing? It's a book published by a noted publisher dealing with drinking games. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 18:09, 3 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know anything about a Milton Bradley game either, but this was a popular game thirty years ago (we played without booze, come to that, and I still have the old cigar box with which we played, too). That MB decided to cash in on a popular game by writing one with the same name is understandable, but readily enough distinguishable by Liar's Dice (Milton Bradley), if need be. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:42, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on "Mr Three" has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:59, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on Land Mine has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 11:05, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Adding a request for verifiable sources to this article page would be a good way to start this process. Not having verification isn't an automatic deletion criterion, being <i>unverifiable</i> is - an important distinction. Before nominating an article for deletion, shouldn't the nominator at least research the article themselves, adding the sources if possible? I haven't tackled notability as this is not the reason given for nomination, but all drinking game are cultural memes that have lasted in many cases for centuries and appear in various places in popular literature etc. Also, the category listing didn't work because this sort of leg-work needs to be done on each drinking game article in turn.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've heard of this game from several sources, and it's beyond any doubt that it exists. I searched for it on Wikipedia to learn more about it's origins, and I found the article interesting, though it would be even better with more background information. The problem with social games of this type, is that it's in their nature to be hard to verify, because they are spread by word of mouth - but that doesn't make them any less real. 83.250.218.159 16:26, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Adding a request for verifiable sources to this article page would be a good way to start this process. Not having verification isn't an automatic deletion criterion, being <i>unverifiable</i> is - an important distinction. Before nominating an article for deletion, shouldn't the nominator at least research the article themselves, adding the sources if possible? I haven't tackled notability as this is not the reason given for nomination, but all drinking game are cultural memes that have lasted in many cases for centuries and appear in various places in popular literature etc. Also, the category listing didn't work because this sort of leg-work needs to be done on each drinking game article in turn. If some are verifiable and considered encyclopedic material by other editors, then the category delete is null and void. And nominating all at once means I have to do this boring cut-and-paste job over, and over, and over again. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 11:50, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fact that you are cutting and pasting again and again suggests that you have very little to offer in these discussions except an objection based on process. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G._Crawford_f5ef.html" title="User:Brian G.

<ul>
<li>My objection is, yes, based mainly on process, as I think is clear from the above. There are lots of separate nominations, made on the same day, to which I have the same objection, hence the cut-and-paste. This is why first of all trying to clean up the articles (if the objection is actually based, as it say it is, on lack of verifiable sources), then listing ONE of them for deletion, would have produced a fairer result. As it is, this looks suspiciously like trying to get the desired result by flooding AfD. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 10:35, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on this drinking game has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted? <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 11:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looking purely at the article, I have to agree with Brian.

<li>Would you kindly suggest how I can fix the article to demonstrate notability, when a Google search for ["Disassociation/Association" drinking -wikipedia] comes up with 9 <i>total</i> results, six of which are copied from Wikipedia articles where the game is wikilinked. The other three mention an "oxygen disassociation/association curve" (2 results, the context doesn't sound much like a drinking game), and the other mentions homeopatich remedies. I have no sources by which to improve the article. And, if I have access to no sources, how am I supposed to say if the optional inclusion of a certain rule is a borrowing from another game, or makes this a subtype of the aforementioned other game? -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 10:28, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> is my vote, however. Not resourceful, not notable enough, and completely unencyclopedic. Do we care about drinking games from the 50s? No. Will we care about this game in 2050?

Not having verification isn't an automatic deletion criterion, being <i>unverifiable</i> is - an important distinction.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I presume that in referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> you are specifically talking about "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", point 8? This says, I quote - <i>Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</i> An article on this drinking game has the obvious potential to contain a) history and evolution of the game, b) its cultural significance, c) appearances in books, on TV shows, in films etc, and thus is more than simply a collection of rules (it doesn't matter if these things are not there or haven't been completed: the fact is, they could be inserted). However, the rules need to be included as otherwise it would be impossible to give a clear idea of the game - and I presume you are not arguing that the entries for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> should be deleted?

<p>This page was deleted before for failing to meet WP:CORP - notability was not established.

<li>I am the original author of the article. Please pardon me if my comment does not follow approved format. I read everything I could find on the deletion policy and related discussions and could not find a way to ask for clarification, so this is my clumsy attempt. The nomination for deletion (from <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">User:PaulHanson</a>) stated that, as a company or organization, it has very little claim to notability, and any relevant information can be incorporated into the Quixtar or IBO article (which Paul originally wrote, and I recently restored). What are the grounds for "very little claim to notability"? If <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manaan.html" title="Manaan">Manaan</a> (an obscure planet in the fictional Star Wars universe) gets its own article, and individual episodes of TV shows get their own articles, why does an article about a business organization with an estimated 1,000,000+ members not? Also, where can I find the original deletion discussion, from the last time the article was deleted? <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_honest_quixtar_ibo_fb89.html" title="User:An honest quixtar ibo">An honest quixtar ibo</a> 20:20, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good point raised by our friend, the Honest IBO - many stupid topics get their own article, so why shouldn't (xyz) have its own? If it were up to me, several tens of thousands of articles would be deleted immediately, but that's irrelevant to this discussion. This article should be deleted because WP:NOT a directory, which is what this article would inevitably be; it currently lists the people associated with "World Wide Dream Builders," and does little else. The "estimated 1,000,000 members" you mention does not automatically make this orgaization notable, partially because that number may or may not be accurate/verifiable, partially because the meaning of "members" is unclear, and partially for other reasons.</dd>
<dd>In a somewhat related vein, it is important to delete this article becasue Amwaycruft could easily become rampant on Wikipedia, and we ought to hold the line wherever possible. Amway-related articles on topics such as this should be nipped in the bud. I do not say this to offend the people involved with Amway/Quixtar - I have nothing against them personally, or their organization - but considering the history of Amwaycruft and abuse of Wikipedia on Amway-related pages, immediate deletion is in order. If my vote has not been made clear, then here it is: <b>delete</b>, again. Incidentally, why was this article even restored? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 20:57, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Holding my nose, I'll vote <b>Keep</b>. Adding a request for verifiable sources to this article page would be a good way to start this process. Not having verification isn't an automatic deletion criterion, being <i>unverifiable</i> is - an important distinction. Before nominating an article for deletion, shouldn't the nominator at least research the article themselves, adding the sources if possible? I haven't tackled notability as this is not the reason given for nomination, but all drinking game are cultural memes that have lasted in many cases for centuries and appear in various places in popular literature etc. Also, the category listing didn't work because this sort of leg-work needs to be done on each drinking game article in turn.

<p>Do we really need a specific page for certain days/months in one country? Couldn't these things better be kept in the regular day/month entries or the articles about Bangladesh? <span style="border: 0px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:#5B92E5; font-weight:bold"><a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadren_9a46.html" title="User:Gadren">Gadren</a></span> 11:21, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>'<i><b>Save'</b></i> The article shows what the senior team at NLL fail to look at... the students view! As well as informing individuals about what is happening in a school that was very good in Mr Woods time, the previous head. Fair enough discipline may have gone down during that time but from what I see its become worse and all Gerry seems interested in doing is window dressing - just trying to make it look good.... was this one of the reasons for giving all year 7's a tablet laptop? Come to this school we will give you a tablet! Not only has Gerry done all that is outlined in the article but he has also reduced the library to practically nothing, something that used to be a good source of information for students now stands as a couple of book shelves, tucked away in a room becuase where it used to be are now computers. Anyone in their right mind knows not all information on the Internet can be trusted and books are a valuable source of information and at least through using books students have to find the information instead of just going to the first website they find and clicking print! - NLL Mafia <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.25.194.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.25.194.69_eb7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.25.194.69">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>As an ex-employee of the Cornwallis School. I took voluntary redundancy recently. I know there is a lot wrong with the Management style of NNL.

<p>As a student at that so-called school, i believe that the article is 100 percent fact. And this view is held by most of the older students in the school. I wish I'd written it first. Problem is, noone takes notice of students, just the staff, and they're paid to agree with Gerry. This article should be kept because it is the only way that anyone will ever listen to our opinions. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.174.241.66 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.174.241.66_b4e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.174.241.66">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a parent I totally agree with what the article states. Perhaps this isn't the right place for the students to publisise their views but as Dr Gerry's answer to parents who express concern over what he is doing is 'if you don't like it remove your child', what hope have students got of being heard, execpt through mediums like this.

<li><b>Keep</b> This may seem very repetitive as again I am another ex-student, during the my years at the school which was from infact yr7 - 13 only having just left, i feel this article is complete truth, throughout yr 7 - 11 under Mr Wood the school was the one to join the one that everyone wanted to go to, I even remember when tryin to join the school people gettin turned away! Now through the years i have noticed discipline waivering a bit but i put that down to certain students joining the school whom would be better off doing some sort of Tarmacing or Roofing job! The school came under Gerry's control when i joined yr 12 and has been goin downhill since then like many have said before he is tryin to make it look good while inside it is collapsing! From previous experience it is not only the students who moan and groan about it the school the staff are taking it hard too, although not publically displaying this, it is not hard to tell! I feel that the school is spending too much on posters, signs, logos and brand new tablets and forgettin about the realy things, like classrooms and chairs! Now this is not a dig at any teachers as they try their very best day in day out and they do a good job, some of them have been there all my school life, they dnt need some new bloke coming and ruining it! (What is he a doctor of anyway?) Like trying to bring in the idea of calling teachers by their first names?!? yeh great dicipline there sir! - I have also noticed in previious comments people saying this should not be included it is only an attack, well i apologise but it does need ot be said and it seems that this is the only way or gettin this out! The students who made this article are gettin punished for it by Dr Gerry, is that fair? Everyone has a right to an opinion and plus what is he so worried bout a few students making a little article about the school? hmm he has something to hide!!! My suggestion is dnt send your child here, there are plenty of good schools in maidstone, that are gettin better and your child will gain much from, and yes the media need to get behind this and show the school for what its really for! I dnt say just bring back the Stag i say bring back Mr Wood but i dnt think that will be possible!

<p>Squedd's (species that lays the egg) have been sighted around 10 times this year already. The UK Squedd Protection agency provides a shelter and attempts to find homes for wayward and stray Squedds that have somehow managed to leave either Hyde or Regent's Park. The excavation of Squeggs is punishable with an unlimited fine and up to 15 years imprisonment and those caught selling the Squeggs can be dealt greater penalties. This is a valid entry: knowledge of Squedds and their plight must be exhibited to ensure the survival of this beautiful and most noble creature.</p>

<p>This article was already speedied once by Luigi30 as non-encyclopedic. However, since the page's creator disagrees with the its deletion and has just recreated the page, I am bringing it here for greater community discussion. The article is about a 19 year old who owns Wrongplanet.net (Alexa rank 167,052}. The article deals mostly with the minutiae of this teenager's website. As both the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">website</a> and the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">person</a> seem to have notability problems (as well as problems with reliable third party sources) I am recommending <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 17:29, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I would also like to argue that the page should not be deleted. The website in question is controversial within the online AS/autism community, and the individual concerned has had a significant impact on how the community is viewed through his actions - he has a high level of visibility and some notoriety within the AS/autism community. Leaving the article online to be edited and improved would be providing a source of information about the affair which is not otherwise available online, and would allow the author the opportunity to verify his research. I urge you to recategorise the article accordingly. --Duncvis 18:42, 3 May 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.47.173.194 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.47.173.194_8fdd.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.47.173.194">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Alex is the fulcrum of much of the online asperger's community. He's had a great deal of influence in shaping the community since 2004, but lately, his influence has changed from constructive to destructive, and since he's taken to manipulating information on his site and taking advantage of the generosity and gullability of many people with AS, it's important to have a independent source on him, to which the entire community can contribute.</p>
<p>The people contributing annonymously at the moment are from that community, and are contributing soley because it's an Alex Plank article, rather than due to any experience with wikipedia, thus the problems with their signitures and the newness of their accounts. They are not sockpuppets, and each one has their own identity on those sites, with long posting histories. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterMacKenzie_f1ef.html" title="User:PeterMacKenzie">PeterMacKenzie</a> 19:06, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I can 100% guarantee you that no one here is going to spend hours combing through a bunch of forums that we've never heard of, trying to find it. Second comment: Basically your second paragraph above sounds a lot like "We need this article so we have a place to attack him."

Although Alex has done alot of things to upset the members of WP.net however I think writing a wiki article about is going a little overboard in my honest opinion. This whole thing has been blown way out of porpotion. WP.net is not as well known as people may think. Whoever wrote this article did so with the sole purpose of attacking Alex. I realize alex has done alot of things to upset the community, everyone needs to keep in mind that he is just a 19 year old kid who made a website. The website just happened to get its 15 minutes of fame due to the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Freund_91a1.html" title="William Freund">William Freund</a> incident. I don't see this article relevant enough to be a wikipedia article.

<p>Clean up and keep, if only to allow for substantial rewriting. Some of the content may well be unencyclopedic, and it needs some editing, but WrongPlanet.net IS a big fish in the online AS/autism community, and Alexander Plank highly visible and notable within it - it is a site which generates several million hits a month and is often surfers first contact with the AS/autism community. As such, I would like to see the article remain to allow time for notability to be demonstrated. I made an anonymous comment yesterday as Duncvis, my nick on those forums - I believed I had already set up a wikipedia account in that name, sorry for any confusion. I am not a sock puppet.

<p>Delete - Wikipedia is for encyclopediac knowledge, not personal opinions, and I'm going contrary to the majority of the people who are here and actually know Alex...

<p><b>Keep and Edit</b> (author open to editing suggestions). I am the person who submitted this article and i would like to apologize for not signing my name to it. Also, not well versed with your guidelines. But i have been studying them and hope to one day be a positive contributer to your informational resource. My user name is Freedom of Information and i firmly believe that all information should be freely readable and acquired. The reason for this article satisfies that right to information. I believe that the actions of A Plank is detrimental to people with disabilities on the autism spectrum. Evidenced by the people that he has hurt. One of the main issues with Asperger's syndrome is that those who are afflicted do not possess the same social skills as 'normal' people. As a result many have been bullied their whole lives. Forcing them into a life of recluse, and quite saddened lonliness. A Plank is not doing a service to the Autistic community for he is a bully as well. However he has numerous sockpuppets on his own site (which claims to be a support forum for AS/HFA, and uses them to spin his POV. Using members to make money through ads and donations. Eventually he will certainly disenfranchise more people, people who have already had enough bullying and dared to reach out to the world again, but unfortunately found his website. The reason that they find him is because he controls all the information lines. I feel that a deletion of this article would do a disservice to the thousands who visit his website. His PR person actually predicted 10-20 members in the next few years. Being an information resource i would think that Wikipedia would be pro information, and especially when it might do others a valuable service. I would like a chance to edit it and the opportunity to keep it available as an information resource. if we could please move the discussion towards editing suggestions, it would be a true service to the freedom of information.Freedom of information 10:06, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>response to comment</b> Never has it been stated that wikipedia is needed as a vehicle to warn people. It has been argued that Wikipedia is a valuable information resource. This is not an attack blog, it is an informational blog. It would also seem like you, the administrators of Wikipedia would also want to know what type of person has an obsession with administatorship on your website. The person who has made repeated attemts under several different aliases to gain power here because of his lust for suppressing information. DO YOU ADMINISTRATORS REALIZE WHAT TYPE OF POWER WIKIPEDIA HAS. I thought that you might take a persons right to know the facts and have freedom to acquire honest information. The article was and remains a strong case of untried internet law. Read it again and look at the facts, you will certainly rue the day that you chose to opt out of internet precidence: copyright issues, internet users personal liberties, money making sites, asking for donations and claiming poverty in doing so (fraud), supressing of information, and bottom line ownership. I have asked and i will reiterate <b>I would like the opportunity to edit the document, not for content, but for perception</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is a Stub and wikipedia supports stub entries so that they may be expanded at a later time. We fully intend to expand this page to incude much data about what metal backed currencies are in general. We are now working on getting this done and we ask that you allow us enough space to improve the listing to be informative in a general way rather than just a stub as it stands now. The thoughts put forth above are not valid points. The Phoenix does not intend to replace the US Dollar and has never stated such a thing. That is a bold faced lie with the intent to harm the reputation of a solid private silver currency with thousands of clients. Also, noting that the currency is small is no reason not to allow a page for such a service. If the page is spam then I concede, but there is nothing wrong with having a page for a currency that is issued by private parties and wikipedia should support free market money. I also note that searching google pulls many results. You said google news which has no bearing on the merit of a business. Google does not determine a companies future and also is not a basis for judging a business or idea. It should be able to stand on facts and not search results. I suggest keeping the entry but expand it to include more data about what a private silver backed currency actually is and make it more informative. I would be happy to do that and will add to this article shortly.Fredhandlive 16:03, 5 May 2006 (GMT)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think it would be a good precedent to decide whether something should be included in Wikipedia based upon whether it has a high Google news position! That is a really disturbing idea to me--that one group could on wikipedia could decide that another group's interests aren't important enough because they don't make the news! This is a stub, and isn't particularly helpful yet, but it's not advertising anything, and as the poster above pointed out, stubs are supported by wikipedia. Also, the argument against this entry sounds a lot more like editorializing than the stub itself. I think perhaps this person has a vested interest? Also, there doesn't seem to be anything in the article about replacing US currency. Has that been removed already--because I tend to agree that the critique is a bit over the top. Anyway, just looks like a stub to me--why not see if those interested in it can expand it into something useful, then revisit this issue? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.35.13.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.35.13.130_edbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.35.13.130">contribs</a>).</small></li>

That's the gamble we all take. That's the risk of liberty." Who are these people to dictate deletion, that the community i feel at liberty with are crafty nonsense, non-notable currency. If it is a non-notable then i am a non-notable entity who uses this currency for my own personal dealings with other community members. i noticed they give to children's charities, i do not see other non-notable companies doing the same. They have every right at having a mark on history in my opinion, every entity in this life makes up a whole for history. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.9.16.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.9.16.77_b70c.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.9.16.77">contribs</a>).</small></li>

The Oxygenstartank (Startank for short) is arguably one of the web's few precious gems. As distinct from other personal webpages, it is not concerned with a central message or theme. Rather, the phenomenon exists solely in the site's guestbook-turned-Bulletin Board. The board is one of those rare occurences, directly influenced by the world of mass communication exchange, which allows for the intimacy and idiosyncrasies of everyday life to seep into the digital diaspora, uncensored, and unapologetically plain-view for all to see. For this reason, the board should not be casually dismissed as unimportant, for it's all too easy to ignore the diverse and wondrous contribution to the board over the years by various different members. Each of whom holds the board in high esteem, and sincerely recommends the perusal of the board by anyone who chooses to do so.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If this company meets WP:CORP, it may be due more to criticism of labor practices and a lawsuit over a workplace injury (actually this incident has received a fair amount of coverage). What's interesting about this article is that half of it is about a labor activist who is critical of the company's practices. If it's intended to be promotional, I doubt the company would include this information, and certainly not a link to the Web site of the critic <a href="http://www.ctfirst.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ctfirst.com/" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.

<p>A series of tables listing the tracks included on free CDs issued by the <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a>. I have many of these CDs myself, but nonetheless I don't think magazine covermount albums are notable per se. I'm also of the opinion that any NME compilations which are notable - <i>In A Field of Their Own</i> and <i>Ruby Trax</i> might be - should have standalone articles with infoboxes and commentary, not a mess like this. The bottom line here is that the only people who could be remotely interested in the tracklistings of some old freebie compilations are... well, nobody really because those who own the discs presumably have the covers too! <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:50, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - which is a pity as there's obviously been a bit of work in this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly the <i>issuance</i> of these sampler discs by the magazine is a noteworthy fact, and the background paragraph should be expanded.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Is this opening the floodgates? Nowadays there are UK music magazines who have a CD on the front of every issue (and I mean EVERY issue). In the days of the 7" EPs the NME included (of which I have a small pile too...), such giveaways were a rarity but things have changed and it's now more surprising if a music magazine doesn't have a CD glued to the front. I don't feel they represent a notable event in the life of the magazine but I suppose the question is whether or not these discs are notable <b>purely</b> because they were issued by the NME (etc..). <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:20, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the earlier releases are more notable than the later. Back then the NME was considered the arbiter of cool, and those tapes/discs were a rarity. Hell <a href="../../../c/8/6/C86.html" title="C86">C86</a> even spawned a genre. These days ... not so much. I think the worry is the slippery slope that says NME discs are notable, therefore Uncut discs musts be too. It's the same thought that says <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> minor characters are in, therefore every minor character in Anime du jour should have its own article. That argument is so monstrously wrong-headed that its hard to know where to begin, but is does seem convincing to many editors. -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I would try to hit the brakes on the slippery slope if individual issues of the magazine or its accompanying disc got individual articles. NME was perhaps something of an industry leader in adding this content; but that in itself does not mean that they should get an article while its imitators do not. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and people write about what interests them. If someone else decides to compile an equally comprehensive list of a competitor magazine's gimmie discs, I'd be inclined to keep that too. To me, in a nutshell, this is a compilation of verifiable information about a noteworthy publication. Someone has taken the trouble to compile it and write an article for us. The text should be expanded. The info which someone has taken the trouble to compile should not disappear. I know it's a logical fallacy to point out that we have an article about <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_disk_collecting_3ac0.html" title="AOL disk collecting">AOL disk collecting</a>, but if AOL discs are worthy of an article so are these. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Merge? No, indeed not. I do however think the important compilations should be in individual articles, where they get an infobox, a bigger picture, and commentary. <a href="../../../c/8/6/C86.html" title="C86">C86</a> is clearly a case in point! (and I didn't know it was an NME tape until I read it here). <i>Ruby Trax</i> is pretty notable too I reckon. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 03:34, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, for now at least. A cursory glance over Talk:Regular Grand Lodge of England shows this nom to be a backdoor attempt to cut off debate before consensus is reached there. (The insertion of the afdanons box, <i>before a single vote was made</i>, shows the current tone of the debate.)

<dd>Exactly. Rui Gabirro's one claim to notability is the RGLE thing. If RGLE is notable, then Rui Gabirro is notable. If it isn't, then he isn't. So why are arguments about verifiability being made here, rather than there? This AfD is only superficially about Rui Gabirro. It's really an attempt to build up a head of steam for getting rid of the RGLE stuff. --Sneftel 02:37, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>They are not exclusive to each other as you suggest. RGLE may be notable, (and I'm not saying it is) but this dude may not be. Nothing in the article verifies who he is, and nothing in the article explains why he deserves an encyclopedic article. <span style="border: 1px solid green;"><a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdenn_1d2f.html" title="User talk:Ardenn"><font style="background: green" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Ardenn</font></a></span> 02:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article says he's the founder of RLGE. That would make him notable, at least in the context of RLGE. Yet you didn't propose this as a merge, did you? I agree that the lack of sources is a problem, but things are deleted for being unverifiable, not for being unverified. --Sneftel 02:49, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Being the founder of RGLE <i>is not</i> notable. That's one minor diddly thing he's done for a barely notable organization. If he were <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_II_e338.html" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> or one of her children, then he would be notable. Do you see the difference?

<dl>
<dd>"Barely notable organization" is exactly the point of contention. The RGLE claims to be extremely notable. You claim that it's non-notable. Whether this article should be deleted or not is entirely dependent on what consensus on RGLE's notability is reached. You seem to be quite active in that discussion, but haven't participated in the Rui Gabirro article at all (other than to add the AfD tag). So why jump the gun? --Sneftel 03:11, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>RGLE can stand alone as an article, without this one. THE TWO DISCUSSIONS ARE NOT RELATED. This afd has to do with this article, and it's lack of notability. It's about seeking consensus, not just what you want. <span style="border: 1px solid green;"><a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdenn_1d2f.html" title="User talk:Ardenn"><font style="background: green" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Ardenn</font></a></span> 03:39, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As per the RGLE link given above, at worst Rui is an online hoaxster, which means we should not be giving him publicity on Wikipedia, and at best, he's the founder of a very small organization with no real notability (no matter which RGLE lodge you wish to contact, he is the only contact listed - which is an impossible task to keep up with if the org was of any notable size).

<li>I request as the author this article not be deleted. Alot of fans of the series need information on the topic, I plan to add more quotations and concept art of the series, information on the authors and writers.

<li><b>Bye-Bye</b> This is nothing but an attempt to publicise a piece of work, and one that is not even finished, for that matter. The author is attempting to drum up support for this project before it is ready.
