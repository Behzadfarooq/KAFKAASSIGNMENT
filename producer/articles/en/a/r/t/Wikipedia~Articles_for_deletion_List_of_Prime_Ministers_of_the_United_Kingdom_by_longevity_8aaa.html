<li><b>Comment</b>. My opinion is mainly based on the fact that, whenever a Chief Executive (for want of a more appropriate term) dies, is elected, or has a birthday, one of the first things the newspapers will point out is that he (or she) is the n'th longest-lived Chief Executive. I'll grant you the Nobel Prizewinners, but the relative ages of Chief Executives is something that's of general interest to the media, and (one assumes) to the general public. However, if the general consensus is to delete these lists, the corresponding lists of monarchs should go too - if longevity is generally _uninteresting_, then why should we acknowledge it at all?</li>

<dd>I have never heard of that. Newspapers mention that a given ruler was the n'th longest-lived president?

<dd>This seems odd to me, but I wouldn't have noticed this sort of fact, so I decided to look around a bit. I picked the death of Ronald Reagan, as I figured that'd be major and recent enough to have some reliable sites still available. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/05/reagan.health/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/05/reagan.health/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a CNN.com story.

I don't mean this proves that no news source ever makes reference to this sort of thing, but I don't believe it is a common practice. GassyGuy 23:20, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> as trivial.

<dd>I would note that every single Pope except one has held office until they have died, so the end of term of their office coincides with their death. That's why age is non-trivially significant for the Pope - because people expect them to serve until they die. The modern US Presidency is limited to 2 terms (8 years) and they cannot serve again. The age of former Presidents is irrelevant to the US political system. The media talks about the age of former presidents, because - bluntly - its a game (for the news commentators) of wondering when they're going to die (especially in the case of Reagan, who had Alzheimer's) because when they die, it means a big media event and a state funeral. The <i>comparative longevity</i> as opposed to <i>the anticipated deaths</i> of former Presidents is marginal and trivial compared to that main consideration. The House resolutions are celebrating Reagan not-dying-yet not his winning-the-race-of-longevity-against-every-other-President-which-will-prove-his-ultimate-superiority. It's the same when we talk about our own elderly relatives. We're glad they've not passed on yet, but we're not expressing the hope that they "beat" everyone else in the longevity "contest". The WSJ column you cite is a humorous trivia piece about a humourous interview exchange. And in that specific Washington Post example you gave, they're emphasizing his age not his comparative longevity (if they were, there'd be a silly discussion of why Reagan is living longer than other Presidents blahblahblah)<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting points, certainly more insightful than "<i>ridiculous listcruft</i>". Thanks for the discussion of the Pope, although you might have noted that I mentioned that in passing, not unlike your more appropriate French tennis player and Mexican poet examples. You are certainly entitled to view the longetivity of the Presidents as "humorous trivia". However, I would beg to differ, not the least because comparative longevity has long obsessed the ex-Presidents themselves, for example <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, whose famous last words were "<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> survives" <a href="http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnadams/biography/LifeAfterPresidency.common.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnadams/biography/LifeAfterPresidency.common.shtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

Does anyone really envision someone waking up in a cold sweat wondering, "Holy crap, <i>who</i> was the 4th-longest-lived Austrian chancellor again?" As Kjkolb notes, the recordholders for longest and shortest lifespan, and maybe even longest among living presidents, warrant mention in their respective articles, but the comparative ages of all or a good number of them strikes me as, yes, listcruft. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 03:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Newspapers are perfectly valid sources at wikipedia and the WSJ is better than most. According to our article, the WSJ has a circulation of 2.6 million and serves a global elite (<i>a readership profile of about 60% top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million</i>).

<dd>I have already placed a number of links into this discussion showing that Presidential longetivity is frequently mentioned in the media. I have further pointed out how the issue of longetivity has been an issue for the presidents going back to Jefferson and Adams. I understand how some might find that trivial. However, I consider it just as valid as any other aspect of presidential scholarship. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What's the first thing you do when a president dies? You mention how old he was. Of course the relative age of presidents comes up often, but that does not mean it is notable, and that does not make it more than trivia. I also cringe at the fact at such justifications being used for "List of Wimbledon champions by longevity" or something of the like. Lists arranged as such should have some value in their arrangement, i.e. why does it matter that Dwight Eisenhower(#13) lived longer than Andrew Jackson(#14)? Also, what about the other nominations up for deletion? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 04:00, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it comes up often it is "notable". Otherwise, it would not come up at all. Regarding "trivia", one man's trivia is another man's vital nugget of information. Every article here contains some element of trivia. If I looked at the articles you created, I would probably consider some to be trivial. I might also think that someone would have some use for the information. I didn't know that Andrew Jackson lived almost as long as Dwight Eisenhower. I think that is an amazing bit of information considering that Jackson was born in 1767, fought in a bunch of wars (like Ike) and was sick most of the time with TB. The ramifications of this type of thing for historians and president buffs are endless. Regarding the other nominations, I already pointed out that this is a global encyclopedia so we need the same lists for foreign heads of state. I can tell you that the same issues of longetivity are frequently raised in other countries (Churchill and Mitterrand immediately spring to mind). I will say that as a general rule group noms are a bad idea. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dearest Kevin- It is not a quest to change the rules, but a quest to <i>create</i> rules when there aren't any. A clear violation in the absence of a specific ruling against it is not grounds for inclusion. But I suppose that this call for change is a foolish venture and we should simply live with the status quo. Remember that we are not mindless rule-followers, and we do what we believe is best for the encyclopedia. Remember the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>?
