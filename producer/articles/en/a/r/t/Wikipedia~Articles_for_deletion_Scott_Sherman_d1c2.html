<p>I feel the admin (GWERNOL) who posted the article AGAIN for deletion, is, per his page, a self proclaimed Welsh trainspotter; so his interest in this genre: The Amercian Dance &amp; Pop genre may not be best to qualify this Subjects contributions as Scott Shermans industry does not seem to be of the admins interests; just as i would know nothing of British industrial narrow gauge railways, a history of narrow gauge railways in the UK, comprehensive listing of same, Minimum gauge railways.</p>
<p>Also that the <i>SAME</i> admin felt it necessary to tag <i>this</i> page, and renom it for deletion seems to indicate some personal malice, as he was overturned, rather than through objectivity, I hope i am mistaken and its a coincidence he found this page.</p>
<p>while perhaps someone with no knowledge may be of use in establishing <i>some</i> merit, it is EXACTLY THAT person, who may be the one needing at some point to find more information on the Subject in which they're not familiar; We personally source wiki on what we do not know&#160;;-)</p>
<p>Defaulted to more generic term Talent Executive at one point,as the listing of titles seemed excessive though thorough and more accurate note:previous versions included a DJ who is in no way related, also a fortune 500 member, fairly common name.</p>
<p>Subject is a well known industry Producer, Manager, philanthropist and Agent; Artists include Celine Dion, Jennifer Holliday C+C music Factory (most #1 dance hits guiness book world records) Amber, Ultra Nate, Currently President Atlantic Entertainment Group Clients include: Trump organozation, Paris Casino, Hilton Organization Created and initiated a common industry practiced known as "Shermanated" when you cross over acts regardless of who represents them to increase the turnout which has had marquees with Rock , impersonators, and jazz.</p>
<p>increased awareness to aids benefits by signing top entertainment legends to benefits</p>
<p>Involved in bringing Tony Bennett to MTV recharging Bennetts career brought the first pop and dance tour to Russia including boy bands, pop stars, and not only large venues, but to the "people' club tours.</p>
<p>Duke University graduate several industry awards, Grammy Award voter</p>
<p><br />
Seems a significant pedigree and anyone researching the industry, events, dance or pop music would run across his name,</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> No, respectfully, <i>YOU</i> have confused yourself with the subject of that posting: GWERNOL posted the article for deletion in the manner stated above, so the defensive posture was completely unwarranted. Your personal page identifies with "nada" except spanish language and is completely void of any information, combined with the intense knee jerk "research" below ( ie. using the info to attack and dismiss rather than verify, very telling.

<dd>I think the confusion is partially yours, <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarburster_7a2a.html" title="User:Starburster">Starburster</a> - looking at the article history, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> never tried to delete your article. He did some work on it, and then tagged it with the "notability" tag - which is certainly an expression of doubt in the article's notability, but doesn't lead directly to deletion. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 16:34, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think things are as bad as <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> says - I found small references to Sherman in the links provided - but I'm not seeing much about this guy online. Searching on "Tony Bennett" and "Scott Sherman", for instance, doesn't bring up anything about Sherman reviving Bennett's career, and I would have thought that would be big news. This guy may be a legend in the industry, but he doesn't seem to have any buzz outside it. Trivia: looking back in the history, it is obvious that this article started out as an article on an <i>entirely different</i> Scott Sherman, and then was hijacked at some point. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 08:03, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Note I said "is about" not "mentions". Generally speaking notability in Wikipedia policy requires being the <i>subject</i> of the article. I do not dispute Sherman was mentioned. I assert those mentions are an aside and essentially of no import. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 14:14, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment:</b> Something very telling.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think he actually does represent Deborah Cooper; the other celebrities... I suspect he either worked for an agency as an underling, or just goes to Those Sorts of Parties; if you are in the entertainment industry and are willing to pony up money to go to a charity bash, you <i>can</i> get your picture taken with people.

<li><b>Comment</b>* looking at the myspace page which is indentified as his personal page; plus the record labels page centaurmusic.com does confirm his identity and relationship to C&amp;C Music factory &amp; Deborah Cooper. some refs were not specific, centaur was, society singers, was, Brianyoumans comments: idk just ponying up money will get those kinda pix..lol but even then. Maybe it just the lack of contributers or poor referencing.
