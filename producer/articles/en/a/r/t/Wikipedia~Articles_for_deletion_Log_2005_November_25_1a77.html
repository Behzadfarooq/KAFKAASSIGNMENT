<li>Of course radio stations are allowed. But the question here is if ThereIsNoRadio notable. What makes it any different from the thousands of other internet radio stations? In my opinion, being plugged by another radio show (albiet a non-internet show) is not a claim to notabilty. At the very least this should all be merged into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hideout_3443.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 21:32, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First you say they've had no major media attention, then when major media attention is pointed out you call it just a "plug". Is the station notable? The station is ranked #13 in talk on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live365.html" title="Live365">Live365</a> and rapidly climbing due to it's 100% original and exclusive programming. It's not a jukebox or playlist, it's a radio station with talk and music shows, most of which are <b>live</b>. There are DJ's that either are involved with or have been involved with terrestrial radio shows, some of which are now on <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_202_36b2.html" title="XM 202">XM 202</a>. Why would this be merged into <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hideout_3443.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>? That doesn't make any sense at all. They may be somewhat related, but The Hideout and ThereIsNoRadio are entirely different things. Should we now also note that none of your contributions have anything to do with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_radio.html" title="Internet radio">internet radio</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hideout_3443.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>, <a href="../../../x/m/_/XM_202_36b2.html" title="XM 202">XM 202</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_and_Fez_bce9.html" title="Ron and Fez">Ron and Fez</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opie_and_Anthony_2c23.html" title="Opie and Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a>, or anything else related to this discussion and that you might not be knowledgeable enough on the subjects to judge notability? I could understand a request to merge the show entries with the station entry, but deletion for all seems excessive when based entirely on the number of internet radio stations out there. The lack of notability <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">alexa</a> has with ThereIsNoRadio listeners shouldn't count against it. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 22:07, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I understand it the man who founded ThereIsNoRadio works on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hideout_3443.html" title="The Hideout">The Hideout</a>, so it certainly sounds like a plug. If this is not the case could you please elaborate on the nature of it? The kind of media attention I was thinking of was an article about it in a national media publication or respected music journal - Something we can cite as a reference in the article.
<ul>
<li>Badmonkey does not work for the Hideout. He worked for the Hideout in Washington, DC for over a year. ThereIsNoRadio is kind of a continuation of <a href="http://www.radiobbq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.radiobbq.net" rel="nofollow">RadioBBQ</a>, which has been written about at <a href="http://www.dcrtv.org" class="external text" title="http://www.dcrtv.org" rel="nofollow">DCRTV</a>, a well known and respected website for radio and tv information in the Washington, DC area. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 19:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>You say that it is currently ranked #13 on <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live365.html" title="Live365">Live365</a>. That's a good start, it should be added to the article. Although, I should point out that neither the #1, #2 or #3 ranked station on Live365 has an article here.</li>
<li>As for my ability to rate the notability of the station; I should point about that although I nominated these articles, <i>I haven't voted on this yet</i> and I shall continue to abstain for the moment. I am however extremely wary of the notability of ThereIsNoRadio, considering we normally delete Internet Radio stations. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 22:35, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is a valid and well-established internet radio station. Certainly Wikipedia recognizes the importance of the INTERNET and it's future in broadcasting. 67.185.71.34
<ul>
<li>Please, where is the evidence it is well-established? I would rather see this article fixed, but so far the only claim to importance is the affiliation with another radio show. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 13:18, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you actually read any of this, you'd realize that ThereIsNoRadio is not important because of affiliation with one show. The station is important enough that other radio shows and stations talk about it. One of the DJ's was removed from the station a few months back and it was discussed for over 45 minutes on <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_and_Fez_bce9.html" title="Ron and Fez">Ron and Fez</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomgenius_aa15.html" title="User:Randomgenius">Randomgenius</a> 19:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete.</b> If in fact he exists, this is a street musician who makes his living by selling cassettes of his music on the streets. AllMusic never heard of him. 412 Google hits for “Mariano Velasquez” but they all seem to refer to a Portuguese sportsman or the author of a dictionary. Many of the links are in Spanish or Portuguese so it’s not easy to understand many of them. The link to the picture in the article seems to be a picture of the Portuguese sports person. The list of songs provided has the note: “This will be very helpful when illegally downloading bootleg Mariano songs.” •<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 06:56, 25 November 2005 (UTC) <b>Speedy Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 07:24, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). After the translation, the reason for deleting based on the article being in German is now mute. Apart from that there is a notability discussion between two people.

<p>Foreign language article; looks like German. I ran it through an online translator, and it doesn't appear to be *that* significant.

<li>It is German, and although I haven't got time to translate it word-for-word right now, it's about a Turkish driver who was supposedly shot in Iraq for not being a good Muslim (he couldn't read Arabic).

<li><b>Translation</b>:Drmus Kmdereli (sic) was a Turkish HGV driver who transported goods to Americans working in Iraq for his firm. He fell into an ambush, however, and was kidnapped. The fact that he was of Turkish origin and of the same religion as his abductors was at first an advantage. The abductors gave Durmus the possibility to prove that he was a good Muslim, by putting a Koran in front of him and asking him to read a few verses. Durmus, however, was unable to do this, as he came from Turkey and Arabic script was completely strange to him. In Turkey only religious people learn this writing technique, which nowadays is only useful in mosques. This led the abductors to believe that Durmus was a 'bad Muslim', because he couldn't read Arabic. In good humour they fatally shot him instead of decapitating him. Durmus was married with two children.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've replaced the original text with this translation, but I still think it should be deleted. Sadly, foreigners being kidnapped and murdered in Iraq are too thick on the ground (or under it) to be notable. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:14, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The man apparently existed. There was a video of his death, circulated by the usual suspects, and plenty of news besides, including on the BBC (from September 2004). If it's kept, it's inaccurate; from the Google summaries it seems he was beheaded, but I am most certainly not going to download the video to check. Still don't think he qualifies as notable. I remember one or two hostages who appeared in insurgency videos and made national news, but not this one. Perhaps he was in the news more in Turkey, in which case a transwiki to the Turkish WP would be appropriate, but we'd need a Turk to confirm that. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:29, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If he was much in the news in Turkey, at least if the case caused some significant discussion in Turkish media on the general situation for Turks in Iraq, we should <b>keep</b> the translation in the English Wikipedia, but I can easily see it being merged with a more geneal topic at some point in the future. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:13, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> He doesn't seem to be a particularly high-profile victim. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Bigley_7844.html" title="Kenneth Bigley">Kenneth Bigley</a>, who was on the news a lot, gets 104,000 hits on Google.

<li>Turkey probably can't compare with Western Europe or North America in terms of internet access. We would really need somebody who reads Turkish papers or watches Turkish TV to comment. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 13:24, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Turkey probably has fewer Internet users as a proportion of population, but it's hardly a technological backwater. And it has a bigger population than Britain. So if he was as notable as Ken Bigley I would still expect him to turn up more hits than 1/33rd of Bigley's - I admit I'm combining two extremely inexact sciences here, but there isn't really an alternative. If he was on Turkish news to the same extent that Ken Bigley was on English news, then I would vote to keep, but I've seen no evidence of that. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 02:14, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Sorry about this article, Up in the Corner is my comic-website and Michael and I have been working on the Auto-Refresher Program for a little bit. This is not a prank, just an experiment. We wanted to test it out on something, but didn't want to choose a good, legitimate website, so we used my site as the subject. You can delete this article, as we should probably make one on the actual program, instead of Michael. We thought we were going somewhere with his article, but it just turned into the Auto-Refresher</p>

<p>It's a guild in World of Warcraft. Not a part of the game itself, but a group of players who organize events for their members.

<dd>There's no 1st amendment rights here. Wiki is a privately owned enterprise. It's like being in someone's house--if they don't like what you're saying, they can boot you out. Wiki is under no obligation to keep pages. A claim to 1st amendment rights is ignorant. And as for the comparison to scientific theories, it's just a little bit different. This isn't a theory by a reputable scientist. It's a joke theory cooked up by a couple of college kids. Sarah Ewart 05:05, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> expertise in African music would be of little avail as he is Indian. As he was described as the leading violinist in an Indian state with a population similar to France, I didn't share your feeling that he was non-notable so I looked him up. He was actually called Mysore T Chowdaiah and he really does have a music hall named after him in the 4th or 5th largest city in India, as well as a road and an Indian national music award. He's been dead for 40 years but his recordings are still available. His google hits are lower than for a minor current U.S. pop starlet, but I don't think his notability is in any doubt. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 17:30, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is really two articles: an article on unaccredited higher education, mainly in the US and Canada, which is a useful adjunct to <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_accreditation.html" title="School accreditation">School accreditation</a> and the like, and a more questionable list of red Wikilinks inviting creation of these. In my view the few blue ones could be handled through a category, the encyclopaedic content moved to Unaccredited institutions of tertiary education or some such, and the list (which the article acknowledges has issues of verifiability) is of no encyclopaedic value. That is my view, anyway. But I don't want to just hack at it, and once the article is split I don't think the redirect is required. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 15:46, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Watching for links here turning blue is actually a useful way to monitor the creation of new articles on diploma mills, provided they are in the list to begin with; if the creator is particularly clumsy, he will also try to remove the name from the list. I have a few articles on diploma mills on my watchlist and revert them whenever somebody tries to turn the text into an ad blurb or just blank a too critical text; as Wikipedia articles usually get decent placement in a Google search, this happens quite frequently. Some of the degree mills in the list are or have been notorious frauds with press coverage; I added a couple of new names and links to articles on the BBC website just the other day.

<li>On the surface what you are saying is accurate. However, is supporting terrorism terrorism? For example, funding insurgents in foreign countries, as the US has done, or let's say we had concrete proof that a foreign goverment aided the people who carried out the Sept.11 actack. Would the support of the terrorists be terrorism? I don't know! There are a lot of definitions of terrorism, one being: acts of violence against civiliians for the purpose of creating social change. How does funding/training people to do the acts of violence to that create the chang YOU want fit in?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I put up the initial NPOV tag; this is more a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemic.html" title="Polemic">polemic</a> than an article. The factual content is covered by <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html#United_States" title="State terrorism">State terrorism#United States</a>. (Click on the "Israeli terrorism" link above and see where that goes.) With regards to the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, see that article for an encapsulation of criticism, plus the seven or so other articles it Wikilinks to which are dedicated to criticism in and of themselves. The source of the term itself is spurious--a lone column on CNN. If you bother to read the CNN column, you'll discover that it actually discusses acts of <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism.html" title="Domestic terrorism">Domestic terrorism</a>. As for <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>, those generally are not considered to be terrorist acts. (See the UN definition of terrorism, for instance.) <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a> does not fall under the auspices of terrorism. The author seems to have unilaterally decided that there is no difference between <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> and terrorism. (The UN sees a difference!) The use of weapons of mass destruction is not automatically a terrorist action. (And as for the U.S. being the only country to use WMDs: not by a long shot. The author doesn't seem to understand what constitutes a weapon of mass destruction; the definition changes every time the guns get bigger, so to speak.)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though it certainly needs cleanup. Not yet NPOV, but that's not the issue. Whether an idea offends us or seems (in some subjective way) inherently contradictory is not the point. People are using this term, including [<a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com/american_terrorism.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.robert-fisk.com/american_terrorism.htm" rel="nofollow">prominent journalists</a>].

<ul>
<li>Could a NPOV article be written on American terrorism? Sure. The issue here is that this article needs so much work that it's just easier to start over. If someone wants to write <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_the_United_States_461d.html" title="Terrorism in the United States">Terrorism in the United States</a> or Terrorism by Americans, no one is stopping them. Keeping this specific article doesn't make any sense because it needs a complete overhaul. Deleting this article doesn't mean that a substantially different and much better article can't exist. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:16, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid I have to disagree. We're talking about the term, and this locution wouldn't be covered by Terrorism by Americans. It looks like some people with ideological motives wish to whitewash the term, despite the fact that this phrase is manifestly notable in usage. That's not the way we do things here. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 17:20, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In addition, it appears that this article was made in bad faith. The author (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a>) created the article with the edit summary "<i>So, now im just waiting for the VFD, POV tag and such...)</i>". He removed a NPOV tag placed by another user and stopped editing completely after it was put up for deletion. There's no sign at all that he's interested in making this a good article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:21, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, so delete the article and rewrite it, starting fresh. How can anything in the current article be of help to other editors? Remember, another article created with the same title can <i>not</i> be speedily deleted if the content is substantially different (which any good article on the subject would be). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, we disagree. The principle here is important. If the article needs revision to get to basic NPOV standards, other editors, including me, can help to do that. The fact that you believe nothing on the current article is salvageable is subjective and (if I may) only tangentially relevant to the question of whether this <b>title</b> for an article should be rejected here. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 17:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The Google test is a wee bit skewed here. A search for "American terrorism" yields 77,000 results, sure. Remove "Latin," "South American," and "Anti-American" from the search, and it drops to 14,000. If you cut "expert" (as in "American terrorism expert"), it gets even lower. At that point, an astonishing number of the results are, in fact, copies of that article by Robert Fisk and many more are articles directly relating to the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attacks_of_September_11%2C_2001_7060.html" title="Attacks of September 11, 2001">Attacks of September 11, 2001</a>. The duplication is vast. Google test, therefore, is something of a canard and hard to apply in this case.. (Google for "Presidential blowjob"; I bet that'll meet the standards for a notable term, too.) Additionally, I second the on the article's creation being in bad faith on the grounds previously stated: it might as well be titled "Things the Original Author Does Not Like About the United States, So Come and Argue With Him About It." The argument that this article is validated by the fact that it is Wikilinked to on the State terrorism article and therefore is an expansion on the topic is ridiculous; I think we can all agree on that. The issues, as I see them, are then: 1.) The article is fairly clearly advocating a certain point of view. 2.) The article contains a very large amount of original research. 3.) The factual material present is listed elsewhere without the rampant POV. 4.) Personal opinion: <i>We don't want to promote this article model.</i> If we let this one go for whatever reason (be it belief that the article is suitable or personally held anti-American sentiment), we'll shortly have other articles like it for dozens of other countries. For instance: French Terrorism (They colonized Vietnam and oppress Muslim citizens.) German terrorism. (Battle of Britain, the Holocaust, et cetera.) Japanese terrorism. (The occupation of Korea, perhaps.) These examples are more or less in line with the material presented here. I have no doubt that a.) we don't want this kind of deliberately inflammatory rhetoric on Wikipedia and b.) that if we used the arguments against deletion being put forth here, the existence of these hypothetical articles could be justified.

If this one gets by, a weak <i>de facto</i> policy decision has been made saying that this sort of article is okay, and it opens the door for the retaliatory creation of a mass of other pages in its vein.</dd>

<dd>It does. For the record, I have had my own (amply documented) problems with Striver in the past. Neither those problems nor the points you raise above, however, demonstrate for me that there should <i>never</i> be an article about this term's usage. In this case, we may well have an example of bad faith editing that has resulted in an article title that does not merit deletion, but rather rewrite and/or redirect. For now, I'm leaning toward rewrite, though I certainly respect other opinions on the matter. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 20:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's a poltically loaded neologism and a carefully conducted Google search will, as noted above, reveal a rather low count of usages in the context primarily being advocated here.</dd>

<dd>If, as has been proposed above, the article is about "acts of terrorism committed by the United States government," then we have a legitimate extension of the State terrorism article, which would more properly be termed "Terrorism Sponsored by the United States." To maintain NPOV, however, actions taken by the United States would have to be judged as terroristic or conventional by the standards used to judge other countries discussed in State Sponsored terrorism. Neither the current article's title nor its content serve that purpose or meet those (reasonable) conditions.</dd>

<dd>If the article is to discuss domestic terrorism in the United States (which has also been suggested above), then the article would rightly be named "Domestic Terrorism in the United States." (Incidentally, that would be more in line with the CNN article currently being used as a source for the term "American terrorism.") As it stands, the article almost seems to suggest that the Ku Klux Klan and the Beltway Sniper were inventions of the U.S. Government.</dd>

Operation Northwoods was a suggested idea that never went anywhere. The CIA's experiments with LSD were unethical, but I have never heard them referred to as terroristic. I suppose they more rightly belong with a list of proven conspiracy theories, but certainly not here.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I guess I don't fully understand. Is the page to be about the term <i>american terrorism</i>, who's using it, et cetra? Or is it to be about domestic terrorism in the U.S.? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 23:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I'm confused</b> as per Tom harrison. As an article about <i>the term</i>, it is largely devoid of content, so if that was the intention of the article, then delete. As an article about the thing the term refers to <i>only</i>, it needs to be renamed as per the above suggestions (state terrorism enacted by the united states etc.). Really, it can and should be about both, but then needs to be much more informative about the reference, as a bare minimum for achieving NPOV about the referent. In its present form, whatever the intention, I vote <b>delete</b>. Also, this may full under "don't disrupt WP to make a point." <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 00:25, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - On second thought, I guess it's not "supposed" to be anything other than what we the editors make it. The article was written to prove a point, and the present content reflects that. But <i>American terrorism</i>, as terrorism by Americans directed at other Americans, is a reasonable title and topic for an encyclopedia article. I'm thinking of Oklahoma City, the Klan, the abolitionists, maybe tar-and-feathering loyalists during the Revolution. Hmm...What about native American raiding parties? That could get interesting. <i>American terrorism</i> as a term is also legitimate. Obviously all the content there now has to go; Whatever appears under the title has to fit the title. It should be an encyclopedia article, not a place to spew anti-American venom. I think the title is legitimate as long as the content matches it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 00:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Since all the content there now has to go, isn't that essentially a deletion? Wouldn't it be easier to start from scratch? I fully agree that an article can, and probably should, exist there, but this is a complete tear-down job. Why not delete until such time that someone decides to write a real article? It's not as if anything in the history is going to be helpful to future editors of the article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 00:52, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Could some minimal stub go up, or a redirect to <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism.html" title="Domestic terrorism">domestic terrorism</a>? Would it accomplish anything to make a new page now and redirect the present page there?

<li>This sounds vaguely like a suggestion that I am an unworldly idiot. Once more, with feeling: as an article on the term in and of itself, I don't feel that the TERM is widespread enough to merit an individual article. (Mr. Toropov and I have gone up and down and left and right on this issue; it's covered quite thorougly elsewhere in the discussion.) <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. Rehashing facts about American transgressions that are covered in detail elsewhere on Wikipedia then and terming these transgressions as "American terrorism" because classifying actions as terroristic is trendy is merit enough for a new article. I'm not some flag-waving boob <i>who doesn't see what happens in the broader world</i>. When politicians, newsmakers, journalists, and academics begin to trot out this term with enough regularity to make it a concretely-definable neologism and for it to pass a reasonable notability test, I'll start the bloody article myself. But as for now, it is nothing more than a soapbox with which to say "I don't like the United States and this is an eye-catching way to make that known." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 03:49, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>"American terrorism" is more than a trendy term. It's a term that encompases modern American foreign policy, U.S. war policy, U.S. influence on other nations, and increasingly, the relationship between civilians and government officials inside the United States. It's all terrorism. It's all the American government saying, "Be good, or bad things will happen to you," and then backing that up by making all manner of bad things happen. Those inside the box have no idea what I'm talking about, but most of the world lives outside of the U.S./U.K. punishment box and will do anything to keep it that way. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 04:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Sigh</i>. Yes. Domestically, I like to call that "American fascism." The laugh-out-loud absurdity of this whole thing is beginning to drive me batty. You and I would probably end up at the same damned protest parade, I think. The problem is that here on Wikipedia, we have to have our discourse within the consensus-derived policies and guidelines. This article doesn't mesh with those rules because it simply isn't encyclopedic. It's the soapboxy discussion of a term that doesn't meet notability guidelines.

<dd>Dozens, perhaps. You have to massage Google to get at what you're after. I get 119 references in 58 books looking for mentions where American terrorism isn't prefixed with "anti." I couldn't cut out other limiting factors because of a risk of culling legitimate results in the process. I question the standard of notability you are employing: broadly speaking, I think this is a fairly paltry result. Perhaps some effort should be put into developing a consensus on notability rules? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 21:48, 29 November 2005 (UTC) Wee addendum: I think you're slightly confused about delete policies. The rules do not say "forever." And a discussion about the content of the article in question is valid: determining notability is largely guided by determining definition and intent.</dd>

<dd>That's through Google Books. There are other resources with much bigger universes of references -- academic journals, for instance -- and it was those to which I was referring.

Using JStor and excluding "anti-American terrorism" (retaining mentions of experts, as that would be sort of an idiotic term to exclude in a journal search), I came up with three journal items.

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. I don't necessarily dispute the idea of the article (anymore than I'd dispute Soviet Terrorism), but this is lacking in objectivity and scholarly references. Moreover, the term <b>American Terrorism</b> is linguistically broad. "American" can refer to much of the Western Hemisphere, not just the United States of America. Moreover, the term does not distinguish between foreign and domestic terrorism, or the nationality of the perpetrators of domestic terrorism. Finally, the term "terrorist" is inherently POV especially when applied to a sovereign entity. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:16, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This poorly written article attempts to give more credibility to certain conspiracy theories by labeling them "mainstream". The article is full of original research and is highly POV. There are already numerous conspiracy theory articles, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_alleged_conspiracy_theories.html" title="List of alleged conspiracy theories">List of alleged conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theories_%28a_collection%29.html" title="Conspiracy theories (a collection)">Conspiracy theories (a collection)</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs improving, yes. And it does not "attempt" to give more credibility, it reports on conspiracy theories that are talked about in mainstream media. The Bush ploting to bomb Aljazeera is certanly a mainstream theory, and does not deserve to be bundled with the goofy "elvis is alive", "The earth is flat", "Moon hoax theory" and "Hitler is alive" thereories. By the way, how is it pov? It does nothing more that cite Newspapers, how could that possibly be POV? Also, is citing newspapers original research? really? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:39, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's inherently POV because it asserts that certain conspiracy theories are "mainstream", while others are not (by their exclusion). Linking to an article or two doesn't show that a theory is mainstream. There's no reason to create an entirely new article when we already have several conspiracies theory lists (see above). Also, I fail to see how several of these are even conspiracy theories. How is "<i>is bin Laden dead?</i>" or "<i>is al-Zarqawi dead?</i>" a conspiracy theory? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:44, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>"<i>The Bush ploting to bomb Aljazeera is certanly a mainstream theory, and does not deserve to be bundled with the goofy...</i>" That statement right there is why this article shouldn't exist. Everyone has a different POV on what theories are goofy and which ones are "legitimate". If you want to better source conspiracy theories in other article, go right ahead, but there's no need to have this one. How many mentions does it take to become mainstream? 1? 10? 100? By which news agencies? It's simply not an encyclopedic topic and shouldn't have its own article. Why not work on improving other conspiracy theory articles? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 18:48, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>What is mainstream or not follows the same paterns as anyting else. It depends on how reputable a source is. You know, simple source evaluation. I dont care about POVs, we are talking about wheather its mainstream or not. And that is easy to evalate. Something like CNN = Mainstream, Blogs = Not mainstream.

<p>This design community is quite small, there is nothing notable about it, and the only source of "history" I can find is from their own website.

That said, the real reason this should go is that there is nothing special about it, it's just another design community and there isn't much mention of it elsewhere on the internet.

<p>A google search for "Alexander Leborg" with the language set to English reveals twelve articles, none of which are in English.

<p><b>Comment</b> This seems to be part of a larger national movement and therefore notable--maybe not notable enough to have its own page, but can't we find some other page to merge it into? (preferably not an afd). And its status as a non-profit argues against the claim that it's simply advertising. I think this article just needs to be cleaned up (which I already started after finding this article last night... it had some definite POV issues) and properly categorized. I don't like the moral/ political stance very much, but that's no reason to delete something.--<a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHraefen_512a.html" title="User:Hraefen">Hraefen</a> 22:35, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Correct. Original thought. Not sure why that is a problem. The professor of physics at the University of Arizona wasn't sure whether the notion had merit or not and I haven't the time to do the research or the math. Looking for comment.</p>
<p>When I envisioned the Bussard Ramjet, I wondered what could go wrong beyond the obvious. That's when I thought of the possibility of swirling or a vortex forming interrupting the normal flow of interstellar gas. What might be the implications of this.</p>
<p>So, you won't find anything on Google. Not until someone does the math and can yeah/nay the concept. Is this grounds for deletion?</p>

Ideas belong here <i>after</i> they have been conceived, refined, published, fact checked, subjected to the praise and lambasting of the community, and finally (if they make it this far) accepted into the corpus of human knowledge.

<p>There is no sourcing of the information in this article. I'm a lifelong Dallas-area resident, and I've never heard anyone, elderly or not, use language like "hockey disk" or "waint." "Y'all" is more widespread in the Southern US, rather than just in Dallas.

<p>This dab page was marked for cleanup. In attempting to perform said cleanup, I realized that not a single entry on the page meets the requirements of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)</a>, so by the time I was done cleaning it up, there would be nothing left. Therefore, I bring it here for consideration of deletion. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 23:55, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
