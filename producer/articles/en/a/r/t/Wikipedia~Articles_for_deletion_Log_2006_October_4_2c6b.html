<li>It's impossible to prove a negative. Look at the example you give above about the patch of grassland next to your house. You give a "bare assertion of non-notability" about it.

<ul>
<li>You are being asked to replace your bare assertion that something is non-notable with a proper rationale that actually addresses the article subject, states what research you did on it, and how you determined that the subject was non-notable; not to prove a negative. And my statement above is <i>an example of</i> a non-notable real place, and not <i>an argument for</i> that place being non-notable, as your rationale is supposed to be. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:51, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being non-notable is not a positive feature, it is a lack of one. It is inherently an unprovable negative. It can, however, be disproved by simply asserting the positive - i.e notability (since it is a simple binary value). One of the most frequently raised issues of whether an article merits existence or not (after simple verifiability, which I never questioned in the momination) is notability. In abstract an entity's mere existence is not generally accepted as sufficient for it to warrant encyclopaedic inclusion. There has to be some facet of that entity's existence which makes it worthy of note above the everyday noise. Common consensus appears to be that notability (or rather lack of) is every bit as good a rationale for questioning the merit of an article. Equally, given the expressed oinion here, it would seem that common consensus is that the mere existence of a named settlement is notability enough to merit an article. That being the case, I expect an admin to close this quickly as a keep under <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>, although I personally disagree with the general course of opinion here, and would expect a place to require cultural, historical, political or economic significance. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 01:16, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are entirely missing the clearly stated point, which is that the rationale was, and is, no rationale at all. A bare assertion of non-notability, unaccompanied by any explanation of what criteria are being applied, what research was done, and how the research led tothe conclusion, is not a rationale. See <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Giving_rationales_at_AFD" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability#Giving_rationales_at_AFD</a>.
<p>You are also erroneously conflating notability with exception. Being exceptional is not the basis upon which things are included. Once again, see <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:06, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Uncle G- My "proper rationale" for saying that this article should be deleted is that it is not notable-- in other words, there is nothing in the article that suggests that it is notable, which is a requisite (in my opinion) for keeping articles. In that vein, I'm not quite sure you understand what "disproving a negative means." Cain Mosni explains the concept in the preceding comment.
<p>As for your example, your very use of it contradicts your point. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoldek_fada.html" title="User:Holdek">Holdek</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHoldek_c7a9.html" title="User talk:Holdek"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:23, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Simply having a name isn't enough. That just gets one an article title with no content. There has to be content to write about the place, to fill the article in with, which in turn means that there have to be sources to work from. These can include census reports, history books, geography articles, geology studies, and all kinds of other things. But they have to exist.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First, as to notability, I would say that all real, named, isolated human settlements are notable (I add "isolated" to <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">JIP</a>'s criteria so as to exclude neighborhoods and such--by "isolated" I mean separate, not far away). If pressed (as I know I would be by <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>) to give a reason for my mere instinct, I think I'd say that real, named, isolated settlements are the basic political units in a society. Why that should be a reason for notability, I don't know. Just thinking out loud. Second, as to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> (which I believe is distinct from notability), the article is sourced, and as per Uncle G, there is reason to believe that there are even more sources out there. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> real place. Also I agree with Pan Dan and disagree with Uncle G's unduly high standards for notability.

<li>"Having something to write" based upon census reports, history books, studies, and "all kinds of other things" is <i>not</i> an "unduly high standard".

<li>(Comment) I agree with Uncle G that both (1) <i>having sources with nontrivial content</i> and (2) <i>notability</i>, are necessary for keeping any WP article. I disagree with Uncle G that #1 automatically implies #2. They are distinct. Re: the subject of the article under discussion here, Uncle G has established #1 in his keep comment above, but #2 is established, I believe, simply by being a real, named, isolated settlement. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:37, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> 1) The Andrew Lenahan page is a user page. When you click on the page, it clearly says User:Starblind, indicating such. Users are allowed to have a page pertaining to their Wikipedia edits in Wikipedia. 2) I realize that the nomination was very poor in spelling this out, but there are many <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">policies and guidelines</a> regarding Wikipedia, even though to allow access to the greatest number you can start editing without reading them (however, don't be surprised when somebody reverses your edits if they do violate policy). <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> is a guideline for people writing about themselves on Wikipedia. In general, the answer is "please don't", as you are not an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> source about yourself (you will naturally bias things towards yourself, no matter how neutral you claim you are.). In fact, the issue isn't about hard disk space, as most deleted material is in the database, just not accessible to the general public. The problem here is the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, which is the central tenet of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Eh</b> While the generality of the article does not help it out any, I am a member of this team and I have to agree with lightingdude that I would like to see it stay. As I think it needs much editing, I see the point lightingdude is trying to make. We are a good team, however, I can also see the point the Wikipedia editors are trying to make. This is basically a vanity article about a FIRST team. After doing some research I haven't found any other articles about other FIRST teams, although a nice section of Wikipedia to do so would be a great contribution to FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). Lightingdude, I like the thought, but I am afraid Wikipedia cannot keep the article...At least we have a great team website.&#160;:-) -croutzahn 16:23, 4 October, 2006</li>

<p><b>Opinion</b> As a member of this team and the student president, along with the webmaster, i can see the points for NOT deleting i, but i can also see the points for deleting it. If you need proof of the 4-H issue i can get that provided by the 4-H Office here in our county. As far as monocoque goes we are the first team to ever make a robot using true monocoque and not something simular. Not to mention our whole robot is monocoque. I was thinking if this article is such a big deal, could we just add information about us to Hungtington, IN page and the Monocoque page? Obviously many people want to see this on here and many don't and some are split between, they want to see it here but not as a single page by itself. --signed roboticsguy1988. 17:35, 5 October 2006.</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I also should add that as this teams webmaster i can update this as i do with the website, that is not a problem, i just need to know if this is going to be solved or we are going to keep going back and forth. --signed roboticsguy1988. 17:41, 5 October 2006.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> FAN-1967, first of all it takes a while for pages to be found, second of all, it seems its wikipedia members who are coming in here. Now don't get me wrong but it seems we should give the public a chance to decide for themselves. As i stated above i can go BOTH ways. I guess i would like to see this team somewhere on Wikipedia, wether (as i also stated above)it is on our towns page, or the monocoque page. ~roboticsguy1988 18:00, 5 October 2006</p>
<p><b>Comment 2</b> I personally think that all the teams in FIRST should have a sub page, you wouldn't believe the amount of research other teams do, and wikipedia is a great source for information, so why not make it a great source for FIRST Team Information also. ~roboticsguy1988 18:00, 5 October 2006</p>
<p><b>Comment 3</b> In response to Sam Clark up there, as the teams webmaster i can say that we get more hits than that, i cannot give an exact figure at this time. If anyone needs proof that this is an real organiztion i can give you all the phone numbers in the world to call, and you can even verify it at the FIRST website www.usfirst.org This is more than a FIRST team this is the Huntington County Robotics team, FIRST just happens to be our main concentration. As far as the search goes you can search multiple phrases and we are the first result. You don't think that you get other non related websites for other organizations too, then obviously you do not know google. ~roboticsguy1988 18:10, 5 October 2006</p>

Team THRUST is a part of FIRST, which is a national organization. Perhaps this article should be in a WikiFIRST type of resource rather than in Wikipedia itself directly. This article is worthy of staying, but I agree now and see how it should be. FIRST is an excellent organization. You should really do some reading up on it if you haven't because it provides many high school students with excellent opportunities.

<p>My article, as of Thursday, October 4, 2006, includes seven external links (now nine) and five references. The summary of the ValuJet crash is rock solid, as is the summary of the Space Shuttle Columbia.</p>
<p>I have experience in business management. I am not an engineer. I ask you to consider how that might be advantageous. An engineer can tell you that the cause of the ValuJet crash was that the oxygen generators were poorly labeled. I can tell you how that can happen in an organization. Of course, if the engineer also has managerial experience, or is merely an astute observer, he or she could also tell you.</p>
<p>And most of all, I invite your help. Help make this article better. Include even more references. Specifically, I ask for someone, with technical experience in nuclear power, to help write the section on Three Mile Island.</p>
<p>I am aware that the writing style is different. But is different bad, or merely different? Must every sentence have three words in blue? I think not. And the irony is that many of these accidents have as a contributing cause a formalistic style of communication!</p>
<p>I would cite Carl Sagan as a writer who is accurate but who also allows his own voice to come through. I'm sure you can think of other writers like this. The point is not to imitate Carl Sagan, or anyone else. But try and produce as good an intellectual work as we can, that is, in Wikipedia's words, to Be Bold.</p>
<p>I have split the ValuJet section, into the ValuJet crash itself, and "Discussion of ValuJet." I have similarly split the section on Space Shuttle Columbia. I ask you to consider that that may be enough, and to consider that this is a work in progress. I ask for your vote to keep this article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>"System accident" is a term in use for many years in scholarly publications, dating back at least to Perrow (1984). It is simply false to assert it is or or a neologism. The article is important in relation to many notable disasters, where it is simplistic to blame "operator error." A Google search shows several scholarly uses of the term in the exact sense of the article in the first page of results:"Chernobyl - System Accident or Human Error?" (1996);"Anatomy of a System accident: The Crash of Avianca Flight 052 "(1994). NASA and IEEE use the term in many publications in the sense of the article title. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Coment</b>Au contraire, the term "system accident" as defined by Perrow in the work cited is commonly used in scholarly analysis of system failures.

<dd><b>Comment</b>The article discusses accidents per Perrow's term of art "system accident" which is an accident which involves "the unanticipated interaction of multiple failures" in a complex system. There is more to the concept than is seen by looking at several accidents individually. It is a concept used in failure analysis. If this article is deleted, I will add it to my personal Deleteopedia. Maybe there could be an article on Perrow's book, or his ideas could be added to the rather sparse article on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failure_analysis.html" title="Failure analysis">Failure analysis</a>. Any claim of OR might not be taking into consideration the 1984 book. As for post-1984 accidents, accusations of OR could be disproved by citing verifiable publications wherein the accidents are described as "system accidents."<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok, I've read through the policies gadfium suggested; "No Original Research" - I agree this article constitutes original research, but in a cross-cutting manner. Each of the chemical pages already lists common sources, this article cross-references them (I plan to use transclusion from each of the parent articles into this one, so no duplication will occur). "Reliable Sources" - I also agree the Citizen Scientist is not a peer-reviewed source. I believe the transclusion idea would eliminate this issue, as the source would no longer depend on the original article, but fully reference Wikipedia intelectual property. Opinions?

<li>There's certainly stuff to write on the subject of performing chemistry using common household/kitchen chemicals, and on the subject of the science of cooking, as can be seen by <a href="http://www.chatham.edu/pti/Kitchen_Chem/abstract_page.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chatham.edu/pti/Kitchen_Chem/abstract_page.htm" rel="nofollow">what</a> <a href="http://www.discoveryeurope2.com/kitchen/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.discoveryeurope2.com/kitchen/index.php" rel="nofollow">people</a> <a href="http://home.ntelos.net/~rollinso/SciFood.html" class="external text" title="http://home.ntelos.net/~rollinso/SciFood.html" rel="nofollow">have</a> written on the two subjects.

<p>The result was arrived at after a debate that was uglier than it needed to be.</p>
<p>The nomination was a very poor one. The use of the word <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">cruft</a> in a debate of this nature is always ill-advised, and to state that as the reason for deletion means that the vast majority of the debate descends into argument by assertion. One man's "cruft" is another man's priceless tidbit on information, and regardless of anything else it's incredibly rude to the individuals who have volounteered their time creating the article to use a belitteling and pejorative term. Moving on...</p>
<p>It's standard practice to list all previous deletion debates, so everyone knows the history. Not required <i>per se</i> but always a good idea.</p>

<li>The page at that time was "substantially identical" to the deleted article, and thus a candidate for speedy deletion... but it slipped the net.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_One_Piece_Games_74f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece Games">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/One Piece Games</a>, a group nomination where all were kept, closed 31 July 2006.</li>
<li>A strong argument could be made that the <i>existing</i> article is also a candidate for speedy deletion, as while a lot more detail has been added (extra attacks, descriptions, etc.) nothing to indicate either why this is signifigant not any reliable sources have been added.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the reliable sources are the problem with this article. Although it took until the fourth of October for it to come out, "Its [sic] completed unsourced." The website linked is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Due to the requirement that all articles be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">unbiased</a> there must be the ability for articles to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. <b>Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources.</b></p>
<p>This is, to some degree, a rip-off <sup><b>1</b></sup> for the "defenders" of the article. Since this point was lost in the morass of circular discussion, they never focused their energy on <i>finding</i> sources to it. The debate from 5 October onwards about items of fiction serving as their own source is an interesting one, but is not sufficient to eclipse both the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">foundational principles</a> of Wikipedia and long-established collective consensus.</p>

<p><small><sup><b>1</b></sup> Yes, this does say "rip-off."

What does the one page attacks page consist of&#160;? Well when you break it down, it's a list of the different ways <i>one character can punch another in the face</i>. Using this logic, we should create a page for <b>DC universe offensive use of superpowers</b> - Superman has quite a few and using them in combination he can work up more than 5 "attacks". Once we have done this, we can move onto the same for the Marvel Universe etc. When you consider that minor <i>characters</i> should not have their own articles unless there is good reason.... attacks? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 20:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Except it's not different ways a character punches someone in the face. In case you haven't watched much anime, the characters tend to have "named attacks" that are different from their normal ones, which is different from the way American comics tend to do things. If Superman had, say, an attack called "Fury of Krypton" where he did a bunch of attacks using his powers, I could see your point. But he doesn't. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 04:42, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small><b>Neutral for the moment</b>: I am neither for or against deletion, though I have disagreed with the need for this page since its creatation I have come to understand why it was created in the first place. Some of these attacks are listed for support on the main characters pages. Sometimes we reference a move on the pages, its nice to have something up explaining how that move works. When they were on the pages, they took up a lot of space and made it look sloppy which displeased many editors of the said pages who had to work around them. They were given their own pages to solved this problem, allowing room for expansion on details (which hasn't happened too much it seems). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 19:42, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay seriously am getting sick of this, we've stated our case more then once to you people. We've told you more the once that this is not the only attack guide for an anime series (check Naruto, Bleach and DBZ for example) and it IS vital to the articule, this is not fancruft. We've been professional about it despite a few immature people puttng down useless information and even tried to compromise by giving it its own page and rules to follow but once again you people keep coming back trying to delete it. What is it that we have to do to prove this is nessercary, hmmm? Please tell me cause all am hearing is very useless claims. Oh and in case you haven't noticed this whole article, each and every page, is written from fans of the series, shall we delete this too?-<a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetro7_f882.html" title="User:Retro7">User:Retro7</a></li>

<li>This is fan material, in Games we have a consensus that strategy guide material gets moved to the game wiki. I think the same should hold true for anime episode and series guide material. This is simply not encyclopedic. An encyclopedia is for people to reference unknown information, a good article would tell them what they need to know about the series and where to find more info. The One Piece article and associated pages however, have become a dumping spot for fan research/listmaking and fan club activities. We need to find a better wiki for this info, drive it there and kick it out the door without stopping. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkfred_e4f9.html" title="User:Darkfred"><strong>Dark</strong>fred</a> <a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDarkfred_d9f4.html" title="User talk:Darkfred"><sup><strong>Talk to me</strong></sup></a> 18:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can give examples of many cases where fans have expanded upon wikipedia articles in this such way. These pages tend to be the most informative pages on wikipedia despite being questionable as to whether they are true encyclopedic anymore. Fans care about the areas they are intereasted in, you can't change that... Its no different to the Star Trek, Doctor Who, Home and Away, Mortal Kombat pages and so forth. Sine they are fans, they pay more attention to the series and have a lot of info they wanted to put up, odd bits they've noticed... Things like that. All I can say is every Wikipedia One Piece page is a 'working in progress' so to speak and we're trying to improve them. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 16:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Commenting with a <i>DON</i></b>.</p>
<p>First: I must comment on something, you caught the One Piece section at a major crossroads, we are at the tail end of choosing, once and for all, what names should be dominent; the names used by Viz and 4kids, or the original names. We chose the original names for the most part, and now we are starting to actualy bring the articles up to speed. We are just <i>now</i> begining to rewrite stub articals, add references, and all the other things neccisary to bring these pages to Wikipedia's standards. We are working to get the character pages nice and tidy, this would be a massive setback.</p>
<p>And, there are very few frequent editors of the One Piece section, if any of <i>you</i> want to help you MORE then welcome to, we need the help, please, if you know a large amount about One Piece, <i>please</i> help bring these pages to par.</p>
<p>Second: There is no actual guidelines for fancruft, and being fancruft is not a reason for deletion in and of itself. This is not a "indiscriminate collection of information" and as Wikipedia defines that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b><br /></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not simply:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lists of Frequently Asked Questions. Wikipedia articles should not list FAQs. Instead, format the information provided as neutral prose within the appropriate article(s).</dd>
<dd>Travel guides. An article on Paris should mention landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, but not the telephone number or street address of your favorite hotel or the price of a café au lait on the Champs-Élysées. Such details are, however, very welcome at Wikitravel, but note that due to license incompatibility you cannot copy content wholesale unless you are the copyright holder.</dd>
<dd>Memorials. Wikipedia is not the place to honor departed friends and relatives. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered.</dd>
<dd>Instruction manuals. While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at Wikihow or our sister project Wikibooks.</dd>
<dd>Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples.</dd>
<dd>Textbooks and annotated texts. These belong on our sister project, Wikibooks.</dd>
<dd>Plot summaries. Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles per Wikipedia:Article series."</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>This catagory fits into NONE of those, in other words: <b>not an indiscriminate collection of information</b>. Don't bring this up again, you would just be making an ass out of yourself.</p>
<p>And as I said: we are working on bringing all of the One Piece pages up to par, and I will bring up that this page should be our top priority. And another thing: The pages under <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjutsu_%28Naruto%29_8413.html" title="Ninjutsu (Naruto)">Ninjutsu (Naruto)</a> are not currently up for deletion. Why is that? The Naruto Ninjutsu are just as much "fancruft" and "indiscriminate collection of information" as the ones for One Piece, and there are <i><b>SIX PAGES</b></i> of them, and only ONE for One Piece. And this is very important as well: the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f257.html" title="Kamehameha (Dragon Ball)">Kamehameha Attack</a> HAS IT'S OWN PAGE. If giving ONE ATTACK it's own page is not fancruft, then this is not fancruft either. <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a> is the same thing as this; for one character.</p>
<p>Now, it looks to me like I just nuked your grounds for deleting this page.</p>
<p>Now that I have stated as to why this is NOT fancruft, anyone who still thinks that this should be deleted, post a goddamned good reason that is "indiscriminate collection of information", or "Fancruft" or "Listcruft", or I will notify some Admins that this was dicided to be kept due to no ground for deletion.</p>
<p>I think that all of you that just said "indiscriminate collection of information", "Fancruft" or "Listcruft" should alter your post to give more exact reasons, or I don't think that your votes should be counted, or should just be removed.</p>
<p>You will notice that I used swearwords in my post, this was not to insult the people on the side of deleting; this was to enphisize my point; I said that I would be commenting with a <i>DON</i>.

<dd>Those categories aren't the only possible indiscriminate collections of information. Indiscriminate lists of things like every gun in every video game ever, or every song about love, or every female fictional character, have all shown strong support for deletion.

<dd>JIP: And if Superman alone deserves this honor, why does the entirety of One Piece not deserve it? One Piece is the fourth best selling Manga in the history of Shōnin Jump, the second current best selling, and is Japan's most popular series currently.
<dl>
<dd>First, I think Superman is known in more countries than One Piece. And second, more importantly, if you actually read <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>, you can see that each power and ability is described in detail, to explain why it is important.

<dd>Like I said already, we <i>are</i> bringing the articles up to par. And in the more then half a century that Superman has been around, they have found the time to put a lot of details into his powers. And as you pointed out, Superman is more well known, I would not doubt everyone knows who he is. And One Piece has only been out for nine years, versus half a century for Superman, who has had HOW many <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcons.html" title="Retcons">retcons</a>?

<p>Oh, and let me add another big one that noone has mentioned, verifiability. What verifies that this information belongs here? The series? That's self-referential in nature. Why would bringing up pages related to this series neccessitate this page? Why does a translation effort need this page? Do you not have any sources for the list to verify that all your translations are completely correct? This page has almost no use to an encyclopedia.

<dd>I was simply trying to bring up something that was already mentioned; I just worded it wrong. What I ment was that if one character can have a page devoted to his abilities that have been tweeked, added, removed, increased, decreased, for sixty years; why must an entire series, who's pages are still being fixed up mind you, have facts split up over a large number of pages as opposed to having them all gathered for easy reference?</dd>

<dd>So what usefulness does it have in an encyclopedic aspect? "Wikipedia is an out-of-universe source, and all articles about fiction and elements of fiction should take an out-of-universe perspective." As I've said, this has no real usefulness unless you are a fan of the series. In fact, the average person doesn't care about every last translation into japanese, because most of the english speaking population doesn't know it. I'm also looking at the talk page, several of these 'attacks' have only been used <b>once</b>. What good is a one-oft list of actions? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 06:55, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article was originaly written in an a in-univerce style, and honestly, the majority of the editors would rather get all the facts streight, then do the re-wording, and I know someone who can start working on re-wording the pages and I myself can help with re-wording. And this page serves the perpose of consolidation; why should this information take up space and make the character pages look bad, when the information can be in one place for easy reference, and as I have said, many times, the pages are not done. And if the Kamehameha attack is not fancruft, then why is this?.</dd>

<dd>How is it "Hopelessly in-universe"? Nothing that actualy be edited from scratch is hopeless.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think whether it's a work in progress or not is to the point. This is never going to be an appropriate article, because it's a list of material which is only of interest to fans (=non-encyclopedic) and which can only be sourced from direct observation of its subject (=no verification). This is a shame, since a lot of work has apparently gone into it. But an encyclopedia should provide an external overview, not an obsessive list of detail for insiders.

<dd>Sure, you already 'went over this', but you didn't address the concerns raised. Again: this is not a court of law. No-one needs to cite precedent or statute. What we need to do is give reasons for a judgement about whether this belongs in the encyclopedia or not. Of course <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> is an opinion essay - I said so above - but that doesn't mean it can be discounted as a reason. 'WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information' very obviously does not entail that any article with an inclusion policy is automatically encyclopedic: 'indiscriminate collection' refers to WP as a whole, not to particular articles. As I've already said, there are boundaries set by the task of writing an encyclopedia. Those boundaries are fuzzy, and identifying which side of them a particular article lies isn't automatic or easy. Insisting on reading guidelines as if they were statute law, and insisting on the letter rather than the spirit, doesn't help with that task. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Clark_9084.html" title="User:Sam Clark">Sam Clark</a> 10:52, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Quoting from the intro paragraph to the list, "Characters are only listed here if they have five or more attacks [which] would take up too much space on their normal page. If a character with named attacks is not here, than the attacks may be found under their article." To me this says that this is a break-out article, designed to relieve pressure on the character and series articles by moving detailed information which is essential to an understanding of the topic out of the main article in order to avoid giving it undue weight. The nom said, "..if a character is important enough to have their own article, then surely the attack can be listed there.." and yet I see that most of the characters do have their own articles, and listing all of their attacks in those articles would be giving the attacks undue weight. Therefore this list is referenced by statements such as, "See Attack List for detailed descriptions of Luffy's attacks." Darkfred suggested "...at least rename to One Piece/Attacks so that it is obviously a sub-page," which I think is a good idea. I find a lot of statements to the effect that, this information "couldn't possibly be of interest to non-fans." Yet I disagree. When I am talking to someone, and they mention a tv show I don't know anything about, Wikipedia is usually one of the first places I go to find out what the heck they are talking about. There are situations where someone who's never heard of One Piece before would want or need to know what the Eight Flower Clutch is. I would think, however, that attacks that are "only used once in a single episode," should not be included on this list. However, the fact that a group of editors has recently gotten together to work on improving the quality of the One Piece articles is a good sign. If we give them time to work, before too long this list won't include the one-off attacks. Look at the changes that have been wrought in this article just since it was nominated for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_Piece_attacks&amp;diff=79822012&amp;oldid=76206089" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=One_Piece_attacks&amp;diff=79822012&amp;oldid=76206089" rel="nofollow">(diff showing differences between version that was nominated, and current version as of my comment)</a>! The only real problem I can see with this list is the fact that there are absolutely no sources listed at all, and I'm not sure there ever will be (except the show itself). Other than that, however, I see no grounds for deletion of this article. (P.S.

<p>It looks like this piece of fancruft is going to be deleted! Great, I was hoping for that! Unfortunately, Wikipedia is still infested by other attack lists. Once this ordeal is over, let's move onto the others. I'm not sure if I can delete articles (I just created this account), so can others do it for me?

<dd>Fancruft is not a reason for deletion, and I have proven that this is not fancruft anyway, so I want an apolgy for calling the page that. There is also no CONCENSUS for the deletion, meaning that it cannot be deleted. And I will now strike all of the people who said "delete" because they thought that it was fancruft and never gave a good reason. When they post a goddamn good reason for deletion that I already did not nuke (with a <i>DON</i>!) they can un-strike the post. Oh yeah, I broke the page up to make it easyer to read.(<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 00:49, 7 October 2006 (UTC))

<li><b>Suggestion</b>: It won't matter to anyone when this fancruft is deleted from WP (as I have warmly recommended above): its authors can quickly turn it into one or more articles (maybe dozens of articles!) suitable either for one of <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Wikia" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Wikia" rel="nofollow">a large pile of existing Wikia wikis</a> or for <a href="http://wikia.com/wiki/Start_a_new_Wikia" class="external text" title="http://wikia.com/wiki/Start_a_new_Wikia" rel="nofollow">a new Wikia wiki</a> for fans of this particular kind of thing. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:34, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do you people not listen when I proove that this not Fancruft, not to mention the fact that: <i><b>FANCRUFT IS NOT A REASON FOR DELETION!</b></i> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 05:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>I can't speak for people other than myself, but I'd regard a "proof" that this list is not <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a> rather like a "proof" that apples don't come from trees. Also, I'm deterred from looking for the "proof" by the bulk and repetitiveness of what's above. Since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP is not an indiscriminate collection of plot summaries</a>, it's hard to believe that it's an indiscriminate collection of story elements. Meanwhile, what's wrong with Wikia as your repository for this kind of thing? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:36, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>First: It's repetitive because the delete-supporters kept saying the same thing, I had to post the same evidence over and over again.</p>
<p>Second: How often do you go to Wikia? The only Wikia reguarding One Piece is completely dub oriented, is years behind, is pretty dead, and the last time I checked, it was closed.</p>
<p>Third: There is nothing indiscriminate about this, and as ONUnicorn said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I am talking to someone, and they mention a tv show I don't know anything about, Wikipedia is usually one of the first places I go to find out what the heck they are talking about."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you don't find something on Wikipedia, is the first thought that goes through your head "I'll check Wikia"? Plus, you said yourself: "it's hard to believe that it's an indiscriminate collection of story elements"</p>
<p>Fourth: FANCRUFT IS NOT A REASON FOR DELETION! How many times does this need to be said in order for people to get it through their heads? (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustyn_4e66.html" title="User:Justyn">Justyn</a> 06:46, 8 October 2006 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>If people repeat the same foolish (in your opinion) objection, write a single refutation of that objection, improve it, and link to or point to it clearly. No, I don't go to Wikia; and this is simply because my interests are pretty much catered for by WP and one other wiki (Camerapedia). The people who contribute to and read the latter don't delude themselves that their interests are shared by many in the world at large <i>or even touch upon widely held interests,</i> and I think most would be quite happy if their articles were described as camerafancruft. WP articles on more general aspects of some manga, game, kind of camera or whatever can easily be, and commonly are, supplemented with external links. These external links can point to other wikis. Lastly, the idea that fancruft is not a reason for deletion only has to be said a single time, persuasively, and without typographic SHOUTING in order to get into people's heads. It has already got into my head. I know full well that there is no fixed policy that fancruft isn't a reason for deletion (if it were, thousands of articles would go); I also know about guidelines, and I know that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> -- but I shan't repeat myself. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:07, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Okay, the reason that I SHOUTED, was that people kept saying "Delete it, it's fancruft" so many times, I snapped. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> says: "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_series_3a8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Article series">Wikipedia:Article series</a>." This aritical can be called in some way, a plot summary. More accurately, a combined summery of a series of small parts of the plot, but a plot summery none the less.

<li><b>Reply</b> Let me rephrase this. Lines 3, 6, and 9 do not have prime numbers in them because... all numbers in those lines are divisible by 3. This is because 3 evenly divides the number of lines in the spiral (9). So all this spiral is saying is that prime numbers are not divisible by 3.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't understand the point of this discussion. The spiral described in the article is as conventional and ugly as it gets. It shows no new mathematical property, it is a highly unefficient way to search for prime numbers, it has a terrible presentation, it is original research, its creator shows ostentation in the article, and the supposed mystic properties of the drawing are against the neutral point of view requirement. The article should have been deleted without discussion. It resembles the job of a 5-year-old kid who wants to make an encyclopedic article about a drawing he made in kindergarten.

You seem to be familiar with the academic sources. They are not NPOV but wikipedia is supposed to be (for example, they say 'prophet Muhammad', 'Jesus christ'). Academic sources are written for a particular class of reader but wikipedia is written for general readers. In a nutshell, it is the notability of people that determines whether they have a place in wikipedia rather than the respect western academics have for them.

<dd>Well, the source is notable. The word of "Itmam-i-Hujjat" like the word "Insha'allah (God wills)" is an arabic word mixed with persian language. I am not however aware as to how the religous meaning of the term has been developed. I personally didn't find this concept to be in contradiction with what I knew before, but on the other hand consistent with that. This is an article on the term itself. If it wanted to be used in other articles, the only issue with that *may* be the undue weight given to it, NOT its POV or notability. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This looks like a simple case of a vanity article. As far as possible notability due to any awards, I can't find evidence that he's actually won any. He's claiming to have won the "Lebanon Photo Exhibition". I've found no evidence that such an exhibition exists. (I've tried searching in Arabic and French as well.) He also claims to have won an award at the <a href="http://www.lebanonwebawards.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.lebanonwebawards.org/" rel="nofollow">Lebanon Web Awards</a> in 2002. I've been unable to find any evidence that there were awards handed out in 2002, much less to him. In fact, according to <a href="http://www.leebosoft.com/EN/awards.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.leebosoft.com/EN/awards.htm" rel="nofollow">this website</a>, the Lebanon Web Awards didn't start until 2003. Searching for his name on Google, I've been hard pressed to find anything that wasn't directly created or posted by him. (Note that he uses many pseudonyms to register domains, but they all trace back to him in one way or another.) He seems to be a very talented self-promoter, but I don't think meets the notability test here.&#160;;) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadratic_9bf1.html" title="User talk:Quadratic"><b>f(x)=ax</b></a><sup><a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadratic_e732.html" title="User:Quadratic"><b>2</b></a></sup><a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadratic_9bf1.html" title="User talk:Quadratic"><b>+bx+c</b></a> 06:36, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think this person is particularly notable as an artist. She (i'm assuming that's the preferred pronoun) has had several exhibitions of her work, but nothing big, and no awards or anything. Not only that, but there appears to be no other information available on her. No biography on her site, there's nothing that could be said about her aside from a few brief statements on where she lives, what her medium is, and maybe where she's had her (non-notable) exhibitions held. Lastly, the user name of the page's creator suggests vanity.&#160;:p ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 08:58, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An article about a photographer. Virtually none of the content is verifiable; the very little that is verifiable is trivial.</p>
<p>The article presents a lot of text, a photo of the man, and, inscrutably, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Image%7ELondon_This_Week_Mayor_DiCicco.jpg_5072.html" title="Image:London This Week Mayor DiCicco.jpg">a scan of a newspaper</a>.

Since then, <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeenaPix_4652.html" title="User:LeenaPix">User:LeenaPix</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=LeenaPix" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=LeenaPix" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>) and <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngelbert_8f98.html" title="User:Ingelbert">User:Ingelbert</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Ingelbert" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Ingelbert" rel="nofollow">contributions</a>) have been busily working away at the article. The result may give the first impression of being well sourced. This impression would be mistaken.</p>
<p>There are two lists of links. The first is of the photographic associations of which he is a member. Here it is, with my annotations:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.photoshelter.com" class="external text" title="http://www.photoshelter.com" rel="nofollow">PhotoShelter Network</a> There's no mention of Lievaart in the linked page. <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/signup/signup" class="external text" title="http://www.photoshelter.com/signup/signup" rel="nofollow">Signing up is easy.</a></li>

You too can join.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not these are easy to join, none of them says anything about Lievaart that does not seem to be by Lievaart. Whatever else they may be, they're not sources.</p>
<p>The second is of "External Links". Again, with my annotations:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://london.ca/Mapphoto/PhotoGallery/westernfair.htm" class="external text" title="http://london.ca/Mapphoto/PhotoGallery/westernfair.htm" rel="nofollow">Western Fair</a> Presents some rather humdrum photos that for all I know are by Lievaart (we aren't told).</li>

</ul>
<p>Thus the only thing I see independently confirmed is that Lievaart at least occasionally takes photos for London (Ont.).</p>
<p>I might also point out that if there's a question of notability, there is little or no suggestion that Lievaart is among "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work</a>" ... though of course that's a mere guideline. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b>: Er, how "notable"? There's now a link to IMDB, but this says next to nothing about him (and certainly doesn't verify much of what's in this article). It does however link to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279409/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279409/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, which (perhaps unfairly) tells us that one of his movies is quite outstandingly bad. Is it the single unfavorable review that brings notability?

<li><b>Comment</b> Is every film director automatically notable? I could only find one review of one of his films. In that critic's opinion, the film was abysmal.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Very notable products. As of mid-2003, both the first two seasons were among the top 5 DVD box sets of alltime in terms of sales, having sold well more than a million copies (<a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/newswire.aspx?id=5806" class="external text" title="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/newswire.aspx?id=5806" rel="nofollow">source</a>). By the end of 2004, the sets had generated $200 million in sales (<a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117924980?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1" class="external text" title="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117924980?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">source</a>), making them the equivalent of a blockbuster movie. In fact, to put that in movie terms, that's roughly the equal (in terms of domestic box office) of <i><a href="../../../j/u/d/Terminator_2%7E_Judgment_Day_6dc9.html" title="Terminator 2: Judgment Day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_d4da.html" title="Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a></i> (<a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a>). We would never delete an article on a blockbuster movie or a platinum-selling CD, so why on earth would we delete one of the bestselling DVD series in history? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 12:18, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is a DVD set which I am assuming must have had decent sales. How does it not qualify? What attribute would exclude it? As per the responses above, this set would be equivalent to a movie blockbister or a famous book. Alex11121 has made a very bad nomination here.

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Deleting it would be a suicidial move for The Simpsons articles on Wikipedia; it would be like removing a bridge that crosses a highway when traffic is driving over the bridge! Removing crucial articles (like the article in question) creates confusion for the readers of the encyclopedia, as the article contains information that helps the topic be understood; without the article, it is dificult to completely understand that topic. This article's deletion should not (and hopefully will not) occur.--<b><a href="../../../m/_/j/User%7EM_Johnson_9bc0.html" title="User:M Johnson"><font color="darkblue">M</font></a> <a href="../../../m/_/j/User_talk%7EM_Johnson_36d1.html" title="User talk:M Johnson"><font color="darkgreen">W</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_M_Johnson_bf0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/M Johnson"><font color="darkyellow">Johnson</font></a></b> 08:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think it is an excellent resource and extremely handy. Also - it is far too detailed to include in the main Simpsons article. I've come to use this site numerous times and don't know what I would do without it! <a href="../../../e/h/m/User%7EEhmjay_f96c.html" title="User:Ehmjay">:: ehmjay</a> 00:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry for the 'vanity' entry. I also apologise for not knowing how to edit this talk page, or my addition to it. Anyway, you're welcome to delete the entry if you want - we have been featured on radio, magazines etc, but only in New Zealand so I'm sure that that isn't enough to permit an entry.</p>

But I think that both roguelikes and 21st century IF are signficant minor genres of computer gaming where major figures and titles are hardly ever going to get widespread recognition, so a little leeway should be given. However, the game <i>is</i> still in alpha, so we should not be premature about allowing it its own article.

<li>If the game is still in alpha, it's riding the edge of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> already.

<li>As much of a fan of the game as I am, I have to agree that being an alpha with little enough mainstream notability makes it mainly uneligible for its own article. But I also agree that it should be mentioned somewhere--as suggested, perhaps <b>mention/link the game in <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">Roguelike</a> or merge the article into <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">Roguelike</a> completely</b>, whichever makes more sense in general.

<li>Merging this article into the Rougelike article make no sense, because Dwarf Fortress isn't a Rougelike. The primary mode of play, Dwarf Fortress mode, consists of an economic simulation which has no relation to Rougelikes beyond the fact that the tileset used uses images from <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_d2cd.html" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters. While there's also an adventure mode, there's nothing notable about it currently due to the fact it's in bare-bones development and was just introduced recently. Dwarf Fortress is in no way a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rougelike.html" title="Rougelike">superficially two-dimensional dungeon crawling computer game</a>, it's a actual two-dimensional dugeon building/economic simulation, and as such doesn't merit a metion in <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rougelike.html" title="Rougelike">Rougelike</a>. --65.185.222.223 21:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC) AC2012</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I disagree, the fact that people are actually making fansites (not just posting on their personal blogs) about this game, shows that there is an active community, and that it's notable enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 01:22, 9 October 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (disclosure: I'm the main author (so far) of this version of the article.) I think the reason the amount of "buzz" DF has received is significant here is: when was the last time a "roguelike" actually got any buzz <i>among people who don't play roguelikes</i>? The typical pattern is that every new game in the genre creates a core group of about 25 people who post about it obsessively on rec.games.roguelike.misc, and then that's it, forever. I'd like to see this article be given time to grow, but I promise not go wander around on policy pages shouting about CENSORSHIP and FASCISM if it ends up being deleted.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:07, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On another note, I thoroughly disagree with Gwernol's assessment of the article as a "game guide." A minimum of information is given to describe <i>what the game is</i>. This is necessary because the game <i>isn't</i> actually a roguelike, it just <i>looks like one</i>. A game guide, on the other hand, describes <i>how to play</i> or <i>how to win</i>. The difference, at least to me, is clear. No one could use the Wikipedia article to do well at Dwarf Fortress. The goal was to describe it well enough that they would understand what it is. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 12:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, if I have a vote as an unregistered infrequent editor, and otherwise I'll just give my opinion. Dwarf Fortress is a notable example of freeware rougelike development, and while it's technically an alpha, I've seen games that are far less complete that call themselves a beta. While Dward Fortress hasn't garnered a whole lot of news coverage yet, as many have already pointed out it's getting a whole lot of person-to-person "buzz". At the same time, I'm faced with the reality that technically, this article doesn't meet a hard standard for "notability," aside from the Eurogamer article. I just think that we shouldn't apply notability here, even if we can't find media coverage of Dwarf Fortress, when we can consider the community around it. As for the article consisting mainly of a "game guide," virtually every article on video games in Wikipedia descibes how the game is played. How could one write an article on a game without describing its content? --65.185.222.223 03:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC), Anonymous Coward #2012</li>

<p>This is a biography case where "non-notable" directly translates into "unverifiable", and from there leads to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problems. This article on a controversial/fringe scholar was first created as a totally uncritical glorifying text more or less plagiarised from this person's own vanity website. Then, other editors cut back on the vanity elements and added some critical material: apparently, a conference organised by this scholar was once boycotted by most of his colleages; he is engaged in continuous legal controversy over the licensing of his excavations; he has hardly been publishing anything except in his own self-published, non-peer-reviewed journal, etc. Problem is, the source for these critical elements is again just hints drawn from his own web material, and as such probably not reliable enough to stand up to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> criteria. No verification of either the positive or the negative material has been found from reliable external sources. As the choice seems to be that between unverified glorification and unverified criticism, I opt for delete as the cleanest solution. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 07:38, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Google Books search shows a number of references to him in published books, including a Lonely Planet guide and a number of other publishers.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hm, good find. But the Lonely Planet quote just shows that Poulianos is visible enough through his local museum and his dominance over the excavation (somewhat of a tourist attraction) that popular tourist guide authors may become aware of him. But that still doesn't answer our fundamental problem: We sort of know he's controversial, but we have no <i>reliable sources</i> from the actual scholarly community actually describing what the controversy is. Of the other books Google brings up, one is evidently not from the same discipline (anthropology), another is simply a bibliography of work in the field listing him. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Might be worth keeping a little longer, to see if more info turns up. This is a pretty good example of an edge case where Wikipeida might be helpful for documenting that there is a hard to document controversy. Controversial/fringe scholars are usually difficult to find mentioned in secondary sources for much the same reason that literary scammers are - reputable journals avoid mentioning "unusual" behavior for liablity/credibility reasons. Persons working in the field might be usefully consulted regarding this individual, but information provided would fail under the No Original Research clause. Until this fellow manages to get himself into a neutral source (like a legal transcript) it is going to be very difficult to source properly. That said, the existence of the article may be usful in and of itself. 68.250.41.142 17:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Greek Anthropology is about as far away from my own fields of expertise as one can get, but based on what I can see, a verifiable article seems possible. Google News Archive <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=Aris+Poulianos&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=Aris+Poulianos&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">shows</a> a discovery of his being documented by the international press 30 years ago, and a Google Scholar search <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Aris+Poulianos&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Aris+Poulianos&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">brings</a> 21 results. Remember that Wikipedia articles do not necessarily need to be based on <i>scholarly</i> sources (although these are preffered), just <i>reliable</i> sources. I'm sure a great deal of newspaper and magazine coverage exists which isn't on Google. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 17:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I can easily see why one would want for this to be deleted, but also I am remidned that Greek Anthropology is not likely to summon up many Google hits or many sources outside of a specialized library. This does not mean he is not notable, though. As Fut. Perf noted, it would be difficult to verify much of this information, but I'm not sure if that is reason enough for deletion. It seems to be more of our own insufficiency rather than his. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">professor test</a> comes to mind here. This guy is an academian, and if he stood in a lecture hall and spoke for 1 hour per week, he would otherwise prove to be more notable than the average professor. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 17:37, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The pages you found are exactly what the original glorifying version of the article was based on - and it's still the <i>only</i> information we have about the guy. All the critical elements in the article were derived from reading 'between the lines' of just these same pages, which means they are just as unreliable as the rest. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 15:48, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That seems enough, though.

As a result of this controversial theory, blah blah happened." We don't need to pen a FA here, but if we're happy that he meets the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability requirements</a>, I don't think we should exorcise the whole article. <i>--<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeLarge_49dd.html" title="User:DeLarge">DeLarge</a> 20:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</i>

<li>So you're disputing his birthdate and birthplace, for example, or the fact that he established the Anthropological Association of Greece?

<li>Well, sorry for being obstinate&#160;:-) but... Of course the basic bio details aren't the issue. The issue is we lack reliable information about exactly the only thing that makes him notable, i.e. his controversial findings. Everything we have about that is in fact either "unduly self-serving", or in danger of being defamatory if not <i>extremely</i> well sourced. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 08:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, actually, that second page is part of exactly the same walled garden of extreme fringe, national-mysticism pseudo-scholarly websites and journals (grecoreport.com, "Davlos" etc.) that are the *only* witnesses to his work.

The first page is an amateur tourist description. All links from it are again into the walled garden. The only sign of light is that it lists some academic bibliography, some of which <i>may</i> represent the critical evaluation of Poulianos' claims.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - <s>This mod is not notable, and will not be notable. I've been playing it for a year and it's almost dead as it is. It's nearly a year late for it next (and final) release. It looks likely they wont even make that. There are two servers which no-one plays on. There are more reasons, but these are most relevent to wiki.</s> This was too harsh, and unfair, but I still stand by the original vote. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm glad you struck that out; there are fallacies both in the statement here and in edits you have made to the article in the past that are completely untrue: There was never a release date posted, and it has been said on numerous occasions (as well on the main page) that this was the case. Nor are you in the position to decide the status of game, as someone outside the creative and development process, your opinion is merely speculation. Your move for deletion no-doubt came off as spiteful and completely misjudged based on your comment, but as to Wikipedia policy I agree with the deletion. Perhaps in the future you will not let your personal emotions get in the way of your decision, as correct or false as it may be? --Termynuss 18:55, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Also fail the criteria wickethewok stated. On top of all this, it also reads more like a game guide/advertisement than an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 08:11, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>I disagree</b> - As Developer sitting directly at the source of this mod i can assure you there will be a release. Plus we have never mentioned any release date tending to Winter 2005, which makes your comment implausible. As for the lack of Servers, the Team decided to decrease the PR-work until TT1.1 is released, i'm pretty sure there will be more server once the new version is out. Right now I'm in contact with two server owners who assured me to provide TT1.1 Servers. That no-one plays this mod is pure speculation or do you check the servers 24/7 for players? Community members often report crowded servers on week-ends.</li>

<p>The Trenches is not just a "mod" or "hack" it's a Total Conversion. It has nothing in common with the original Black Mesa Half-Life 1 except the GoldSRC Engine on which both games The Trenches &amp; Half-Life 1 are based on. Nearly every Half-Life related content (textures, sounds, maps, models, sprites) is deleted. The Trenches is mostly based on it's own Models, Textures, Sounds, Sprites just like every other Total Conversion Mod----Hawk-- 17:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)<br />
::<b>Comment</b> As one of the Developers, you would naturally oppose the deletion of this article. The same goes for JJ45. Your reply sounds like it would be more suited to a message board to answer questions as to whether the mod is folding, as it contains absolutely nothing to justify having it's own article on Wikipedia, and merely reads like a summary of the game on ModDB or similar sites. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:20, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't know if you have checked the external sources well enough, but...if an article in the PC Gamer (a international prestigious Gaming Magazine) isn't enough to serve as reliable source for a GAME i wouldn't know why any Game has any right to exist at wikipedia.

<li>That's perfectly acceptable, but it doesn't do a hell of a lot of good if it hasn't been included in the article does it? As I said previously, the article as it is now fails policies and guidelines. All I see in the links are 5 non-reliable sources.

<li><b>Reply</b> It's quite simple. I haven't looked at those articles, simple as that. This came up for deletion, so I checked it out, and guess what, it meets the requirements for deletion in my opinion. And I already said the PC Gamer article was a fine reliable source, but if it's not been added to the article, how is anyone supposed to know about it? You can't expect everyone to google The Trenches and PC Gamer just on the off chance there WAS a review. As wiki says, providing evidence of a source is up to the person wishing to include the source, not the person wishing to delete the article because there are no sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 17:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - If the article was edited to address the stated problems with it, I'm sure wicket would drop the AfD. He's not unreasonable. I can't see why people have trouble understanding that the article as it is now does indeed warrant deletion. Yes I know about PC Gamer, but it's not doing much good if it's not been noted in the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 17:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - As a developer of the mod itself, I actually support the deletion of the article. As it stands, the article is certainly not NPOV, contains a large amount of speculative info, provides weak source material, and makes use of weasel words. There are certainly notable features of The Trenches, but none of them are properly presented here; the article reads like a simple summary of the gameplay and specifically the segment of "Future of The Trenches" comes off as NPOV (as well as the PC Gamer UK citation). I'd advise our fans to not argue with the issue based on the simple fact you like the mod. Whether or not you like the mod is of no consequence here; the issue at hand is if the article itself is notable-- I don't believe it is. I don't necessarily agree with some of the reasons for deletion (NP:V), but there are other more important holes here. Trust me, as a dev I'd like to see our mod on this page, but the article leaves a lot to be desired. Until something better can be written in accordance with Wikipedia's policies, I support the move for deletion. Termynuss</li>

<p>This is an article about a band which released, according to the article, one LP, one single and one 12"; a CD of their back catalogue has since been produced. It does not appear that their releases were on a major label, as failure to be signed by a major label was cited as the reason for the band folding. The article was very spammy, I cleaned it a bit. I do not see any credible assertion of notability, but it may be that Someone Out There knows of some additional data which will establish the importance of the group.</p>

<li>Jimbo cautions against name-dropping the TV shows without something (a transcript, etc.) to prove they mentioned the practice; I suspect that can be done. He also suggests that we should find newspaper or magazine articles to verify the practice, and we can verify that Andrea Nemerson of the SFBG has written about the practice several times: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.sfbg.com+Nemerson+%22Donkey+punch%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.sfbg.com+Nemerson+%22Donkey+punch%22" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

At any rate, it doesn't seem that deletion is the correct remedy for this article being, as Jimbo says, "terrible."

<li>Once again we have the error of pointing to a Google search as if it constitutes research, rather than reading what the Google search turns up.

There's no such thing as a 'donkey punch'.". In other articles, xe writes that this is "an imaginary icky sex act". Similarly, upon actually reading the Vue Weekly article one discovers a set of reader-contributed slang terms, which <i>doesn't even include "donkey punch"</i>. It merely mentions a donkey punch, without any explanation of what it is. There's no evidence that the list of reader contributions has been fact checked, and as a potential source the article is on the same level as Urban Dictionary — i.e. it's not a source at all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The central tenet of the AfD nom, that any notability for the term is inherently unverifiable, in my opinion has yet to be proven. Jimbo's comments were for the article as written (then), not the topic in general. That Hyperbole seems to have found a perfectly fine reference for the term (from Nemerson) solidifies my opinion. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 22:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly suggest actually reading the sources that you declare to be "perfectly fine". They aren't. In fact, they clearly state outright that this sex act does not exist. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You've missed the point, or you're being deliberately obtuse. Whether or not this act is ever practiced is largely irrelevent. Notability is derived from the use of the term as a cultural reference. The fact that so many sources mention the term (<i>especially</i> since they mention it without feeling the need to provide an actual definition) is in itself ample evidence that it is well known in popular culture. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 15:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. Evidence that something is well known in popular culture is <i>some source saying that</i>. Counting mentions of a term and deducing (a) that the sexual act that is the subject of this article is therefore well known, and (b) that that sexual act is what those people are even referring to in the first place (rather than, say, the act of punching a donkey, or perhaps a cocktail) is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. Please stop trying to build this article from vapour and "cultural references" (which is apparently synonymous with "people naming various things Donkey Punch and characters in works of television fiction talking about donkey punches"). That bad approach to article construction is what has got us here in the first place. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> is setting a good example to follow. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"the act of punching a donkey"? Sheesh. I am well aware of what a primary source is and what a secondary source is, and I have stated repeatedly the need for better sourcing of this and almost all other Wikipedia articles. My comment was aimed at your contention that because the act may not exist it somehow should not be in here, ignoring the fact that the notability of the term is derived from its propagation as a meme, not from its existence per se. Vampires do not exist- we still have an article. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 23:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle G is right. To cite an example, consider <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Burning_of_the_School_bc9b.html" title="The Burning of the School">The Burning of the School</a>, a song that's part of playground culture in the US and UK. That article is referenced, not because there are lots of "references" to the song it TV shows and whatnot, but because someone actually did some research and wrote books documenting the folklore of children. Those books are cited in the article, and they're what makes the topic verifiable, and not original research. When someone publishes a book in which they chronicle joke sex moves as a cultural phenomenon, and they talk about the Donkey Punch in that book, which they'd better if their book is any good, then we'll have something to work with. Surely you can see the difference between that and a Southpark episode in which Cartman makes a Donkey Punch joke. The book may cite the Southpark episode as an example; it's our job to find and cite the book.

<dd>Agreed, but removed the bold to be clear. I am reaffirming my opinion after viewing the new text with its alleged "references" which include a book that claims that it made up the sex move to fill space, and the other saying the entire book is not to be taken seriously and is full of irony; thus, it still isn't well refernced, nor do I think it can be. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 03:25, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It <i>is</i> a vote - but simply one in which a simple majority (or indeed a supermajority) need not carry the motion. Anyone who presents a possible resolution or expresses their will is "voting". There is in any case a difference between "a vote" (as a collective noun) and "a vote" singular. In the case above, I was obviously referring to the latter. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 04:10, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I was simply repeating the usual mantra that effectively says "let's not refer to these as "votes", as much as we can avoid it, because we don't want to reinforce the impression that these discussions should be thought of as votes." In the sense that a "vote" is nothing more than a formal expression of will, these recommendations we're making are "votes", but it's really better not to call them that, IMO. The word way too easily brings a whole raft of expectations with it that we'd like to avoid. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 05:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the average editor is likely to be clever enough to distinguish between a vote (which this is) and a <i>majority</i> vote (which this is not).

<dd>"Shout people down"? I thought I was very polite and calm about it? What does one have to do to suggest a different way of speaking around here and not be thought a belligerent asshole? I'm not trying to have an argument with you, nor to belittle "the average editor". I sincerely believe there are good reasons for choosing words carefully - I've seen way too many people treat these discussions as majority votes to think that nobody makes that mistake, or that we needn't be vigilant about guarding against that misperception. But honestly, "shout people down"? I apologize for offending your sensibilities, and beg your forgiveness for any inadvertent offense I caused. I shall continue to refer to my recommendations in AfDs as "recommendations", and I promise I won't bother you about it again. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 20:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There's a difference between verifying this is a real sex act and verifying this is a notable joke. The article has sources now, including books describing the act and columnists talking about it (much better than before, when all we had was a long obnoxious list of pop culture references.) It seems that the real issue is whether or not those sources are good enough the establish the encyclopedic value of the article. If not, it implies sufficient sources are unlikely to be found at all, considering this is the best anyone's been able to do. Either way, this has implications for many other articles we have about even less notable fake sex acts and internet urban legends.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 23:09, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

As soon as I'm done with the directory, I'll be adding the names to the various lists of notable residents, in the pages if the lists are small enough, in separate pages, like this one, if the lists are expected to get so long that they'll require a page of their own. And I just added the names of the people already listed in the various suburban areas of Washington, to indicate that work had continued. You are, of course, free to do as you will. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> isn't this why we have categories? If it's kept (seems likely), I would expect that a list with this title to not include the DC equivalent of the "bridge and tunnel crowd"; if someone wanted a List of people from the Washington, D.C., Metro Area they could look it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 02:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In response to <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Calossuarez46</a>, the convention at the time the list was created was to not separate the residents of the "suburbs" out from the major city in such lists. I received a rather pointed comment to that effect (probably justifiably) in regards to one such existing list. I would have no objections to either the creation of a separate page detailing the composition of each MSA, or to explicitly retitling many of these pages for the MSA's rather than the cities. As indicated before, I had more recently been adding the name of each individual to the list of people from the city, town, or other specific location of their residence, intending to collect them all in lists such as this MSA list later, if at all. This page and others like it could alternately eventually become simply a list of people from the central community with links to the various lists of people from the individual suburbs. In some cases, such activity has already been started. Also, there is a real question as to which such listing someone who lives in or was born in, say, Alexandria, Virginia, because their job or that of their parents was in Washington, D.C., should be placed in. I would tend to think that for such people as that lists of this kind are probably the best reasonable alternative. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I can't find a reliable source that mentions this, and therefore I have no way of cleaning this.

<li><b>Comment</b> The page is greatly improved, but it is still hard to see which bits are original and which are sourced. The argument in the logical fallacy section, for instance: is that an argument found in one of the listed sources or is it OR? Also, I still cannot see how using a "+" to denote something "addition-like" in a programming language is an instance of the ELIZA effect. It does not seem to have anything much to do with computer behavior so much. When I write "x=1+1", I don't see how I could mistakenly infer that the computer is behaving like a human. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 13:08, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll work more later on detailed sourcing, but I didn't realize that FA-quality sourcing was required to pass AfD, nor that description constituted OR. You asked for a better description of the effect and more explicit sourcing -- I have provided these. As for the addition explanation, it may be too confusing to keep... <b>"x=1+1"</b> is <i>not</i> an instance of the ELIZA effect. <b>"x=a+b"</b>, while not caring if <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are strings or numbers, <i>is</i> an example of the ELIZA effect.

<p>This entire article only links back to a blog, and I'm not sure some guy's blog is article worthy. I hesitate to call this a vanity page, but there's not proof this 'zine even exists except for the blog. Even if the 'zine does exist, does every photocopied leaflet put out in the world deserve an article? The talk page leads me to think that this article is largely the work of one annonymus user, perhaps the blogger himself. BoosterBronze 19:08, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> But I may be a bit biased (at least according to the anonymous editors who are obvious Plazoid supporters). Some history: I actually created the Plazoid page, because a set of anonymous editors (who I believe are the creators or close associates of the Plazoid blog and zine) kept manipulating Arcata Eye related material in order to push the Plazoid. I figured they would be happier with their own entry. In any case, this "edit war" hasn't been active since early spring, since the anonymous editors who are pushing the Plazoid seem to have disappeared, at least for the moment. So that may not be an issue any longer. Also, the blog itself has severely tanked recently and I think the few people in Arcata who actually read it have turned elsewhere. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetatree_2501.html" title="User:Metatree">Metatree</a> 21:41, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Several problems. Regardless of what you were told, Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Also, all articles are required to be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> and cite <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. This article satisfies none of the above. It also strikes me as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, which is also forbidden. It is not enough for you personally to believe in the importance of the article or concept, a significant number of other people must also believe in it and write about it in reliable publications. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichfife_4acd.html" title="User:Richfife">Richfife</a> 00:30, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is a significant essential claim to notability possessed by any individual school that any individual corner store (or individual human or individual roach) will never have. While I agree that this does not mean that every school merits a Wikipedia article, this article is reasonably well-crafted and verifiably sourced (in its current state after <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor's</a> rewrite), and the fact that this school has a notable alumnus convinces me that it justifies being kept. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 00:46, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Silensor does generally only edit school articles, however, the majority of those edits have been of a high caliber and often to schools which are prominent and would be agreed keeps anyways. In any event, the special interest of his editing is something which closing admins are aware of and will presumably weigh when considering his comments.

<li><b>Comment:</b> - I often complain that people vote to delete (or keep) without having seen -- let alone read -- the actual article in question.

A lot are in (probably) Serbian, but still, so far as "serbian folk songs from WWI" go, I'd hazard that this one might be the most notable. Let's do the work on the article, but I don't think deleting is necessary. I'll defer to anyone who knows more about it. The article appears to be a bit POV pushing -- some controversy about the song referenced by the link at the bottom.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is <i>the</i> Serbian song of WWI. It's the kind of song that everyone in Serbia knows and it would probably be accurate to say that more people know the words to this song than know the words of the national anthem.

<li><b>Keep</b> dont understand why you do not like this beatpick thing. there are many other small record label on wikipedia and most of them are much less worth to be noted. this beatpick guys are doing something OK and truly innovating. many articles can be found on the net. DJMag, creative commons, openbusiness, dogmanet + a number of people have blogged them. they have over 100 artists. it's a new way of doing business in the music industry and should be on wikipedia. i've never written before for wikipedia and I am one of their artists... so..not an impartial opinion but still there are a few facts about beatpick that cannot be said to be untrue. I think you should research better the subject before branding the article as "pure advertising". btw I noticed that last 2 "delete" comes from people that have given very little contribution to wikipedia. take care of yourself.

<li>The word "notable" literally means "worthy to write about", so if you're going by notability, the judging factor is whether secondary sources exist for the phenomenon, so as to satisfy our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policies.

<li><b>Clean Up</b>. This topic falls under a much more broad question. Internet notability, the corresponding and adequate support of reference. Wikipedia has failed to properly analyize, and subquently standardize, the importance in which 'original research', primary sources, and international attention on the internet can be used as legitimate contributing factors. The U.S. and Canada among other European countries such as Britian and the European Union, practice internet legitimacy under the sections of legal documentation and information. For example, in North America in particular, internet content has been the immediate source and evidence used in criminal law and corporate law. (Management Information Systems, Kenneth C. Laudon). The use of internet content now has an informational value to the point of recognition by international law. It cannot be denied as an illegitimate source to a single case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering all sources found on the internet are legal 'factual' documentation, biostudentgirl has over 19,200 hits on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, as per linked pages, cached pages, individual pages, and/or referenced pages pertaining to that single name. <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, the website with the largest contribution to her success, is a $2 billion dollar independant third party corporation (New York Post). This website has accumulated and attracted over 1 million 'views' of her videos. Her association to the website as one of its "Most Discussed" and "Most Viewed" users put her in the top 200 of a website that receives over 100 million views per day. Though her article may as a stand-alone article may not solely fufill notability, her affiliation would. Please note Wikipedia articles of Company CEO's, T.V. celebrities, Movie celebrities, etc. Individually they are all actors or businessmen with no individual notability (different thatn entrepreneurs) but only notable through corporate affliation.</p>
<p>Any persons listed in a recognized ediorial such as in the New York Times or BBC would immediately satisfy Wikipedia's reference guide. Wikipedia lacks clarity under its policies regarding original research and notability of source. Websites such as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a>, and <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> are describing a new form of source credibility. The term "credibility by numbers" (Capital Investment and Valuation, Richard A. Brealey, Stewart C. Myers) describes the power of population on a single 'thing'. The power of voting and seeing versus educational standards. For example in commercial advertising the rule of numbers greatly out influences the valuation of recognition despite product significance. At this stage it is undeniable that biostudentgirl has now an international collection of fanbased websites, hosting sites, and discussion groups as related. More importantly she has the numbers to support that the sources are being made legitimate by numbers alone. This all makes the Wikipedia article the first original research article on biostudentgirl but not the first notable source to her international media attention.</p>
<p>Arguably, internet sources have their own notability; cbc.ca, cnn.com, .gov, .edu, and so on. However, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> ranks its search results by human generated links (Management Accounting in the Digital Economy, Alnoor (EDT) Bhimani). This creates a disillusion to supporting notable sources that compliment an article to meet policy. The search result are diluted by tens of thousands of fan-created websites and thus making the investigation to notable legacy sources almost impossible. Not to mention that by using those links they create a new legitimacy on an individual topic than any single source could. Legacy sources cause a new problem in their own.</p>
<p>The internet and varying communities with in it are esoteric collections of like-minded people as described in The Corporation documentary series. The internet has exceeded the possible resources of our non-internet and notable sources to report on any significant internet phenomena. Furthermore we cannot build our standards on the basis that certain sources have not written about a certain subject and thus makes it un-notable as almost all articles about the internet by legacy sources are side stories.</p>
<p>Unless you challenge these points about using the internet to support notability, you must first challenge Wikipedia policy before you have means to delete this article. Legally this article could be saved, but Wikipedia has a tendancy to be more about a popularity contest over policy decision through past examples. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw">Mkdw</a> 09:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> page? A <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> profile? Some Internet sources do have notability, but not all.</p>
<p>There are just over a 100 <i>unique</i> hits for biostudentgirl when, in Google's words, "entries very similar" are excluded.</p>
<p>The majority of links are from YouTube itself and sites that mirror YouTube. Many are from sites that the videos have been cross-posted to by the subject of this article. A substantial proportion are signed comments biostudentgirl has made on other people's YouTube videos. A smaller proportion of hits come from her "official" site and some come from sites that simply rip YouTube's content.</p>
<p>There are no third party links discussing "biostudentgirl" as a separate phenomenon. There's no review material, no critiques, no independent discussion that's not attached to YouTube or cross-posted videos. There are no fan sites or discussion groups. In other words, even though there's (arguably) quantity, there's no quality.</p>
<p>The question here is not whether Internet notoriety makes one notable. The question is whether popularity on one web site automatically makes one notable. I'd suggest that it does not.</p>
<p>The argument that YouTube is "hot" right now is moot. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geocities.html" title="Geocities">Geocities</a> was a big deal ten years ago - but no one would have argued then that a person with a popular Geocities page deserved listing. The same criteria must be used in this case. No one would argue now that any personal web page, whether it attracted 10,000 hits or 100,000 would make the subject notable. Coincidentally, those are the kinds of numbers (per video) we're looking at.</p>
<p>While ostensibly "popular" in YouTube terms, this subject matches none of the other criteria that have made other YouTube "celebrities" notable; sustained popularity, controversy, crossover to the mainstream media or external reporting.</p>
<p>Finally, this entry appears to be largely autobiographical. Autobiography that paints the subject in a flattering light and censors criticism. Really, it's little more than a vanity page.<a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESoap_On_A_Rope_86a5.html" title="User:Soap On A Rope">Soap On A Rope</a> 19:23, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, because if WP is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a repository for plot summaries, it certainly isn't one for plot ingredients. Plus it's a bizarre sort of article: I gather that there's no English version of this thing, so those people who are interested in those Japanese terms that aren't obviously <i>gairaigo</i> must often (not always, cf "Haridan") guess at an English translation, and then look that up. If these translations are original, this is not "Original Research" but it seems a bit pointless; if they aren't, the translator should be credited but is not.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Japanese corporate structures are a nightmare. I'm not an expert, but as I understand it, until a few years straight-up holding companies were actually <b>illegal</b> (post-war reforms to break up the <i>zaibatsu</i>), and Japanese corporate groups relied upon interlocking boards and swapped stock (as in, Bank A owns 30% of Company B, and Company B owns 30% of Bank A). Don't hold me to this, as it's been years since I paid much attention to Japanese business and I never followed it very closely to begin with. This would take some serious research to set straight, so try posting something at the Japan noticeboard. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 23:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>The result was <b>No consensus</b>. To be honest, this is really more a closure with "no action required", as the concern is that this article requires a lot of cleanup and that any useful content needs to be merged into <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>. As of this time, I note that there are {{cleanup}} and {{mergeto}} tags in this article, so I think it's safe to close it as no consensus at this time. If no further action is taken to address the concerns raised in this AfD, the best course of action would be to simply redirect this article (without merging) to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a> as redirects are cheap and I'm sure some content from this article has already been merged there anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 04:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>Khosrow, in answer to my question if you have any evidence beyond your assertion of past behavior, you have responded with an assertion of past behavior. I'm not an admin, but looking at an item on <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">User:Barefact</a>'s [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact#Mediation_for_Scythian-related_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barefact#Mediation_for_Scythian-related_articles" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>] I see that both you and he entered a process of mediation with administrator <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a> three days ago (Oct 1) regarding "dispute over Ossetian Language, Scythia, and other disputes" (User: Barefact's words and assertion, not mine) which leads me to consider that this AfD is part of an ongoing user dispute between the two of you. I also see that admin <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a> was [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex_Bakharev#Scythians" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Alex_Bakharev#Scythians" rel="nofollow">notified</a>] regarding the creation of this article on that same day.</dd>

<dd>Well, I find it ironic in an AfD arguing about "proper sourcing" that you are a) unwilling to look up said discussion page to prove your point, or far more importantly: b) provide evidence that there is inaccuracy in the current article under AfD. If this user has improperly sourced in the past that is certainly cause for concern, but has nothing to do with the value or contents of THIS article. So far your only clear argument is that the article needs sources, which is certainly true, but suggests a <b>Cleanup</b> vote from AfD. Everything else appears to be a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">Straw man</a> argument (including the argument about poor writing -- this article tends to severe run on sentences, but expresses itself decently), and that fact again suggests a <b>Cleanup</b>, not a Delete.</dd>

<dd>it is simple epmiricism, not a personal attack, to say that Barefact's contributions have been a useless waste of time.

<li>Not to be overly-argumentative dab, but AfD is not to destroy an article because it has some problems or a bad name.

Not being particularly familiar with this subject, I only entered this conversation as the nominating criteria above are NOT generally reasons for deletion, only for improvement and editing, which is generally discussed on the article discussion page.

<li>you seem to be confused. OR is no reason for deletion. An unsalvageable title is. Fwiiw, I <i>have</i> "investigated" this article and opted to move parts to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>. At this point, the deletion debate is about the title and edit history. Since I have copy-pasted some bits over to Scythia, we should not delete this one, strictly speaking, we should keep it for its edit history. I therefore suggest we move it to Scythian kingdoms and make that a redirect to <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a>, and then delete the new redirect at <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian_European_Kingdoms_0ea5.html" title="Scythian European Kingdoms">Scythian European Kingdoms</a>. does that make sense? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:10, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> Although the term was mentioned in CSI and according to Zoe was explicitly called a "cuddle puddle" is an argument towards notability, but does not make the term verifiable or more than a neologism. Furthermore, at best as far as I can tell we would have nothing more than a dicdef. This deletion sets no precedent for an article on the same topic that is more than a dicdef and is well-sourced (presumably with the New York Magazine article). As it is now, the term seems to be too much of a neologism to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:09, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
