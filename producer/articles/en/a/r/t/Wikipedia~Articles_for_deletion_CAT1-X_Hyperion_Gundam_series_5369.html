<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was <b>no consensus on some and delete the rest.</b><br />
This discussion amounted to over 150K. Much of it (too much) was spent debating the merits of an AfD nominating so many related yet distinct articles in a single nomination. The prospect of <s>85</s> 59 separate AfDs containing the same arguments from the same set of editors is even more frightening than the debacle that this AfD nearly became. I find no merit in the arguments against the form of this AfD other than the observation that historically these types of nominations become a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Warcraft_character_articles_84a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warcraft character articles">train wreck</a> with no consensus emerging after day upon day of discussion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some progress has come from this AfD. Reading through this (yes, every word of it) consensus was clear (yes, clear) on several issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>The level of detail, in-universe style and sources of all of the articles fails to meet <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
<li>The information is single sourced with possible copyvio issues from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>.</li>
<li>All of the information has already been transwikied to <a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></li>
<li>While the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> series itself clearly meets the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, the majority of the articles listed in this AfD do not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if this were a vote, then the result would be "no consensus". However, consensus here does not mean consensus that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, but consensus that the material here meets established guidelines and policies that have been developed through consensus. In this regard there were strong arguments in favor of deleting everything, however, I find that there is <b>no consensus</b> whether the following articles meet the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, and are thus kept by default:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Note that among those arguing to keep the articles, there was consensus to merge the above articles in some form. Deciding how to merge these article is left to the <a href="../../../c/e/_/WP%7ECE_41e4.html" title="WP:CE">WP:CE</a> project, of which 4 of its 11 members participated, albeit peripherally, in this discussion. There was no consensus to delete yet consensus among those arguing to keep to <b>merge, delete and redirect</b> the following into a single article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/b/f/MBF-P01_Gundam_Astray_Gold_Frame_4ade.html" title="MBF-P01 Gundam Astray Gold Frame">MBF-P01 Gundam Astray Gold Frame</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../m/b/f/MBF-M1_Astray_d076.html" title="MBF-M1 Astray">MBF-M1 Astray</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There was also consensus that all 14 of the above articles need to be significantly edited to address the issues in points #1 and #2 above.</p>
<p>That leaves the following to be <b>deleted</b> with no prejudice against creating a single (or very limited set of) composite article(s) that discuss all of these elements as a group while addressing concerns #1 and #2 above:</p>

The information appears to be stolen from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>. Deletion is the only option. Before you defend the existence of these articles, please observe how these articles defy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, an official policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought
<dl>
<dd>There are no sources on most of the articles. Therefore the articles break this rule. Until you can come up with a reliable source not <i>dedicated</i> to Gundam, it will violate this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information
<dl>
<dd>The policy states "works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis". None of the articles have this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There we have two policies that the article clearly violates. If that's not enough, here's a violation of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." The main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character.
<dl>
<dd>Seeing as most of the articles contain mostly trivial information, they are minor, and therefore violate the guideline.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on various articles for deletions, these points have been raised to keep:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be nice to keep these articles
<dl>
<dd>That's not a reason for keeping them.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first.
<dl>
<dd>That's irrelevant. This one has to go, it doesn't matter what order it's done in.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>they're not harming anything or against Wikipedia policies that I'm aware of.
<dl>
<dd>Yes they are, I mentioned the policies they're violating.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If these articles are deleted you would have to delete about every single anime character plus Star Wars and Star Trek articles
<dl>
<dd>That seems like a very good idea. Just because that hasn't been done yet doesn't mean this can't be done first. Furthermore, a main character in Star Wars is a lot more important than every single quartenary robot.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless.
<dl>
<dd>There are various rules and policies that state the articles are useless.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Most of the information is actually translated directly from various sources, including direct references in the show, books, magazines, and model boxes and instructions.
<dl>
<dd>Those are primary sources. Articles require secondary sources. If there aren't any, the articles should not exist (in most cases)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b><span style="color:red">COMMENT:</span></b> Many people in this discussion are stating that they think some of these articles should go but some should not, or complaining that individual AfDs should be created for each separate article. What they are neglecting to state is which articles they think should go and which should stay and stating their reasons. It is perfectly within process to nominate a group of related articles in a single nomination, and the above referenced template lists the included articles. That means that if your position is that not all of the articles should share the same fate, then this is the time and place to make your case for the fate of individual articles. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 12:33, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and refer to a relevant WikiProject for how to best merge, transwiki, or otherwise organize this information. Yes, we have a situation where numerous articles of questionable value exist - but trying to deal with that situation with one gigantic AfD almost guarantees throwing some babies out with the bathwater.

<li><b>Reply</b>: It has already been merged and transwikied. There are no babies in the bathwater. Using that comment is simply an excuse to keep the articles, and until you actually find a "baby", your claim is incorrect.

<li>I'm not going to take your word for it that a group of 85 articles contain no information that are important to a clearly notable anime. There is probably no group of almost 100 articles I'd vote a blanket "delete" on, <i>especially</i> when a dozen or more of them have already undergone the AfD process - and survived.

<li>Any robot in Gundam is non-notable. In a very popular series, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_f5dd.html" title="Metal Gear">Metal Gear</a>, the Metal Gears are the star of the show. They are the most important, and each one serves a very important aspect of it. However, they are all in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear (weapon)</a>. This is good example to compare to, because Metal Gear articles are actually representative of a good set of editors, not a group of fans. I realize it seems disrespectful to previous discussions, but I have already argued against all of the points mentioned in those discussions. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There is literally no comparison between Metal Gear and Gundam.

It does not impact you, but the real world of the modeling industry and publishers and 3D modelers.

<li><b>Question</b> <i>Until you can come up with a reliable source not dedicated to Gundam</i>. What do you actually mean? different series should be separated sources, or everything gundam related is a no? Does something like the sales of a gunpla count towards a source not dedicated to gundam, or someone writing a book stating the impact of specific gundam series to <i>name anything here</i> counted as dedicated to gundam? And what about Super Robot series? Just asking, because this is not clear enough. I limit the sentence to <i>Gundam Seed and Seed-Destiny anime and official guide books</i> for the moment.
<p>P.S. The WP:OR quoted here have been taken to a liberty of extending it to an out-of-reach limitation.

Completely different to the previous nominations. Because of that, you have no argument for keeping the pages. Another invalid vote.

<li>The nomination is flawed. The assertion is that these articles are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, and that the only way for readers to check them is to perform the primary research of actually watching the series directly. However, for an article to be unverifiable it has to be shown <i>both</i> that the article cites no sources <i>and</i> that the nominator looked for sources and didn't find any. (See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.) The nominator has shown the first, not the second.

<li><b>Comment</b> This AfD is horrible. There is no explanation made anywhere why any particular article of the set isn't worthy of an article. Perhaps they aren't, but in order to perform a blanket nomination, <i>every single article's reason for deletion must be stated</i>! You cannot simply call them all "non-notable" without an explanation. I hope the closing admin notices this blatant violation of policy. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 11:46, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>These articles are all pretty much the same. All the complaints in the nomination/comments apply to all of them, in particular that there's no reputable secondary sources that provide the level of detail that would justify so very many articles instead of one or a few covering the whole topic. Are each of these lines of robots even central to the actual series? There's no hint of this in the articles, I don't even see episode/series/movie titles listed. It's just a dump of technical minutiae written as if they were real. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 13:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then wishfully there will be someone with enough knowledge and time to modify them to better articles, one by one. I never have both and I have no interest in working extensively on CE related stuff and thus I only care about this deletion process and how much it really follows WP. From what I see now, the WP is explaint in a pretty twisted way to justify the deletion of all the articles. I am more for the idea of deleting most of them, but the arguement is not made in a good way.

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is but one catch to this deletion process: People voting here do not know what they are voting for. There is no direct link to <b>all</b> the pages that are nominated. Yes, there is a function called <i>What links here</i> however, it is almost certained that most people would not know its exsistence and still vote on the subject. And thus making the nomination not reputable just because there is no way to tell if people even know what there are voting about other than <i>a bunch of supposedly OR pages</i>. If users who voted above saw this comment, please edit your vote to reflect you have at least looked through all the pages and <b>know what they are about</b>, to show that the vote is reputable. The list contain <b>2</b> pages.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly - The <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> does not extend to fictional characters that appears in an anime(Seed and probably Seed-Destiny), in manga(Seed Astray, Astray-X, Destiny Astray), in settings(Seed MSV, Seed-D MSV), Official guide books(Seed data file characters 1~4, Mechanical file 1~4), and a Gundam Mobile Suit guide book for most Gundam series instead of Seed and Seed-D dedicated(MS encyclopedia 2003 and 2006). Some even appeared in the Super Robot Series(Super Robot Wars) that is not dedicated to Gundam but almost every single major mecha anime. Yes, it is very likely that these pages will recieve a lot of fancruff and OR in it if left unattented, however, this is not a reason of deleting any article just because they <b>may</b> contain OR.</dd>
<dd>More reasoning could counter arguments made by the nominator:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought.</i> - No, this is not publishing an original thought, the page is <b>not</b> created by the author of said <i>characters</i>(mecha), and there are more than one source backing them up (I know not all the pages include their sources, and I have no will in doing). No, they do not have to be <i>not dedicated to Gundam</i>, They just have to be not dedicated to the series, i.e. not a comic retelling of the anime, not a novel written by the same author, etc. If someone published a book talking about these <i>characters</i>, in a different way than the story plot itself, it is justified to be a secondary source. Which actually means that the articles not just justified the WP:NOT test, but can also be written to justify the style of an <i>out-of-universe</i> view.</li>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i> - Yes, but per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <i>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> <b>and</b> <i>The difference between 'major' and 'minor' characters is intentionally vague; the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character. Some books could plausibly have several dozen major characters.</i> Here, in the list of AfD, I see quite a lot of important mecha that major characters used. Therefore, at least some of the articles here should not be deleted under this rule. In fact, a <i>citation needed</i> is what you need in these articles.
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I agreed with the fact that <i>There is no reason for keeping them</i>, most of them, at least. However, some of them should be kept, but the nominator indiscriminately list everything here, and thus it is too generic to vote for a yes.</dd>
<dd>And another yes, it does not matter which one goes first, but it should always be done in the correct way, with correctly informed voters, with correctly listed reasons.</dd>
<dd>Also, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters</a>, <b>Fictional characters which are cultural icons transcending their appearance in a particular work of fiction, or who cannot be neatly tied to a particular work of fiction or fictional universe deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</b> This is not an official policy, but a consensus. If they appeared in Super Robot Wars and SD Gundam G Generation, than it cannot be tied to a particular work (It is not Mobile Suit Gundam Seed's Cosmic Era anymore) and thus <i>deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</i> The fun thing is, there are a few listed mechas actually showed up in series that are not related to gundam at all, like freedom in <i>Magical Nurse Komugi</i> and <i>Comic Party</i> and various units appeared more than once in the magazines <i>Hobby Japan</i> and <i>Dengeki Hobby</i> as iconic model kits. If the nominator is going to do anything similar (I mean this kind of mass deletion) to the UC timeline of Gundam, be informed here that most units in that timeline is also showed in <i>Keroro Kunsou</i>, <i>Genshiken</i>, <i>Plamo tsuguru</i>(TV show teaching how to build plastic models).</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b>: The initiative previously failed because of a lack of information. I have provided everything required, making the decision much more clearer. I am trying to argue against this "potentially valuable" information argument. You're only assuming the information might be valuable because of ignorance, but I have looked through all of the articles, and none of it is valuable. For you to decide whether it is valuable or not, you will have to look at the articles. Otherwise, voting "keep" is just as foolish. You can't base a vote on ignorance - whether it's "keep" or "delete".
<ul>
<li><b>Follow-up</b>: To do as you are asking is to delete dozens of articles which probably have not been read individually by us editors. I will read each one on a case-by-case basis, but I don't have the hours required to sift through each article in a blanket VfD. Are we to simply take your word that each and every article has no potentially valuable information AND is in violation of WikiPolicy? To vote based on such would be irresponsible &amp; the height of ignorance.

<li><b>Keep</b>. the Delete admin stated the following (roughly): The only ones who wants to know said gundam is X meters high is a gundam fan! THIS is an ultimatly wrong statement, and if this was to be the rule, than wikipedia all encylopedias worldwide would be EXTREMELY narrow. To say that unless proven to be useful to everyone, it should not be part of an encyclopedia. Encylopedias, and wikipedia for that matter, does not contain info that is useful to everyone, however, shouldn`t the fact that it is useful to SOMEONE be a decisive factor?</li>

<dl>
<dd>No, the nominator (not a "delete admin", just a regular editor: anyone can nominate articles for deletion) gave numerous reasons for deletion, one of them being that these articles violate one of our core policies, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Since these articles seem to be not only not verified but actually unverifiable (from secondary sources), they are a violation of what Wikipedia is supposed to be, and should be deleted. It doesn't matter if anyone likes or dislikes the subjects (we have many articles on subjects I utterly dislike), we should only look if these articles are conform to the policies of Wikipedia. They are not, and thus should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all.</b> No matter your qualms with the <i>procedural</i> value of this nomination, there have been no arguments made that successfully defend against the charges leveled by the nominator. The current poll of votes shows 16-19 "keep" votes, but digging beyond the numbers game reveals a clearer picture of what's going on here. Eight keep votes reflect reservations about the way the articles were nominated, and say nothing about the content of the articles. Four "keep" votes are simple <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> statements. Another "keep" vote is a regurgitation of the "worse articles exist, therefore this should be kept" fallacy. That means that 68.42 percent of the keep voters are ignoring the actual policy arguments, and chasing their tails in some rhetorical netherworld instead. It is my sincerest hope that the closing administrator realizes this. How on Earth is information like the following a worthy inclusion to the encyclopedia?</li>

<p>Please, by all means, explain to me how that information is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? Our guiding policy here should be <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, which gives us this gem of useful information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These articles are written entirely in an "in-universe" style of prose, thus invalidating our first premise. They are unsourced, invalidating our second premise. They make no reference to their cultural value outside of the series, thus invalidating our third premise. In the end, they are a summary of Gundam-specific <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">treknobabble</a>, regurgitating plot specifics. What have we learned, then? Not only do they fail to meet any of the <i>positive</i> criteria set forth, they specifically violate the <b>only negative</b> criteria. Seriously. What's going on in here?</p>
<p>It has already been argued that the Gundam Wing series is a cultural staple and thus important to the encyclopedia as an article reflecting the significance of anime culture. Fine. That's why we've got an article called <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_7037.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>. It covers the psychological and historical value of the franchise without vomiting up huge amounts of made-up statistics and histories for its myriad of plot-specific devices and characters. So stop saying we need an article about a futuristic backhoe to explain how the world is a better place because of the Gundam anime.</p>
<p>This debate needs to focus less on how much of a dick the nominator is (whether he is or not), and get to the crux of the issue: do these articles meet current Wikipedia policy for inclusion?

<dd>This depends on who know their exsistence and who voted. There are unfortunately too many Cosmic Era fans who just walk by and do random edits. There is no method in stopping these. I can foresee these pages be recreated again and again after every deletion if there are no redirects that led them to a list(At least that's what happen to a lot of similar page in the Chinese and Japanese wiki).

<dd>If they are recreated after deletion, the proper response is to delete them again, and salt the earth from whence they rose. The fact that a lot of people edit an article is not an indicator of real-world impact, but rather an indicator of fan base. This was one of the major criticisms raised against Wikipedia in its humble beginnings: it was biased towards popular culture and current events articles because no one was interested in writing an article on hard science or math theory. The standards in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> go beyond "real world impact," also, a fact which continues to be ignored in this debate. Despite the "hundreds of editors" who've worked on these articles, not a one of them has bothered to put any non-fictional context into the article. You tell me how big its fake guns are, how fast its fake engines can go, and how long its fake legs are, but there is <i>absolutely nothing</i> about the artist who designed these units, or how they play into general themes of the anime, or how they've influenced the realm of anime-robot-drawing.

<dd>This is you POV, not wiki's. People <i>say this</i> people <i>say that</i>. Your argument based on a lot of elements that could be called original research, without a source, and violate the NPOV rule. Where on earth does wiki policy states that wiki should be only hard science, math theory? (though I really like those, too) I agree they should have some level of real-world context, they should have information on who designed them and by the influence of what (of course, sourced information). Again, I must tell you that these articles just did not have anyone with the knowledge and sources to edit them, you cannot just coin that to <i>they can never be improved</i>. And face it, popular culture <b>is</b> a real world impact, and I have already included sources that show how some of these articles can be improved to show real world impact. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:28, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your sources do not address these concerns, nor do the articles that are currently being nominated for deletion. They are written entirely from plot summary and technical detail.

<dd>The fact that you have introduced this new term to me is ironically true that it can be used on yourself. You have strayed the discussion on saying how people critized wiki, without source, and expect me to say nothing about it? Back to the discussion. Face it, what I have listed are enough to write a good article on how some of these fictional characters made a real world impact, they have at least impacted someone to write a book on how to 3D model them, they have impacted people on writing published articles on teaching how to model using them as a reference. Even published POV critics can be included in wiki's article, therefore, a third party company publishing magazines and books referencing these fictional units, not talking about the plot, but just using them as a good tutoring material that a lot of people are familiar with, is a good source of indicating real world impact. If only I can scan a fan poll listed in magazine on which of these are more popular, there will be even more real world context, I do not have the magaizne, and I have no interest in finding one, therefore I never said anything about using it as a source. However, for a show having that kind of popularity in Japan, compared to any other anime, they always put up polls just to do a marketing research on which unit they can make a model kit and gain profit on.
<dl>
<dd>No. A straw man fallacy is when you take someone's argument, and reconstruct it in a weaker, more-easily disposed form. I said, historically, there has been a bias towards popular culture instead of hard-science, and that caused criticism. The bias existed because people wrote about their interests, and not necessarily on what people deem academically "important" for an encyclopedia. That there are a lot of people interested in a topic does not make it important. Somehow, you transformed that into me saying, "we should only have articles on hard science and math," which is not only disingenuous, but flat out <b>wrong.</b> Stop it. Even if you're only misusing the term straw man and instead arguing that I'm shifting the debate, it's still a non-responsive argument. I'm probing deeper into why these articles violate <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>, and you're regurgitating the same word-vomit that you have been all thread: "it's notable and important because people make models of them." What you have yet to address is the fact that, despite the hundreds of edits and dozens of eyes that have passed over these articles, no one has taken the time to meet the criteria for writing on fiction. No matter what <i>might be</i>, we're here to deal with <i>what is</i>. And unless you can prove to me that each of these cartoon fabrications has single-handedly reshaped the way people think about drawing 3D stuff, you can't slap a blanket on them and say, "They all belong."</dd>
<dd>Hell, the fact that they wrote a guide on how to model a Gundam isn't a very strong argument in the first place, because <i>not a single friggin' article talks about how these robots significantly affected the world of 3D modeling.</i> "So what?" you say, "People wrote about it in a third-party publication, so it's automatically noteable enough to merit an article." That's bunk. If we grant your premise that the Gundamspooge has rocked the world of 3D modeling -- which I <i>assure you</i>, it hasn't -- that's information that needs to go in the article on 3D modeling. Stop dodging the question and answer me: <b>which of the eleven characteristics of out-of-universe writing do these articles demonstrate?</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Question</b> where on earth do you see a policy saying it has to shake the whole world of 3D modeling before it can be said that it got some impact? Given, if a third party published a book of using it to teach 3D modeling, it means that it got enough credits and popularity that someone actually paid the copyright in order to use the designs for their books. No, it can never be so shocking that it moves the whole 3D modeling community, and thus it is not suitable to be mentioned in the 3D modeling article. However, a book written is a verifiable source of <i>its popularity among the general public</i> and <i>the influence of the work on later creators and their projects</i>. A third party publishing a book about these units is a very good demostration on how these units influenced the work of later creators and their projects. These articles currently contains none of these is a sign of they needed to be improved, if any of the fans cared to do so. Not a sign of deleting them. I have provided the sources, and the argument, and already said that if no one is changing them, I will merge them into a list. I never said anything about they should be kept as they are, and this is why I said the term you have introduced to me is ironically suitable for yourself, while I never said it is not suitable on what I said earlier about your unsourced argument on how people think wiki is biased towards popular culture. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The concepts of fame and importance have implicit in them the notion of a target population — a subject is famous amongst a group of people, a subject is important to a particular set of people. Notability has no such implicit notion. Notability is independent of specific groups of people. To understand this, consider that the primary notability criterion makes no mention of readership. A subject is not notable under the primary criterion if it is widely read about. It is notable by dint of people writing about it. It is the source writers, not the target readership population, that is relevant to the primary notability criterion.</p>

<dd>I'm not saying that Gundam stuff doesn't have a large target audience, I'm saying that outside of that target audience, the importance of these vehicles drops off significantly. Your sources are written from within the anime community, from sources that center on the Gundam universe. These aren't articles from main-stream press or industry trade journals. Beyond that, the criticism that Wikipedia is biased towards popular culture is hardly unsourced.

<dd>Like I have said, having books published satisfy the idea of <i>It is the source writers, not the target readership population, that is relevant to the primary notability criterion.</i>, while you keep ignoring. Yes, they are not of a mainstream press, in America, but do I have to tell you that wiki is an international page, and the publishers are at least mainstream in Japan, if not Asia. The Magazines I have quoted are <b>not</b> Gundam or Anime based. Half of Hobby Japan talks about real world machine models, like cars, aeroplanes, ships and such. And your hatred in Anime does not take away the credibility of a magazine focusing on Anime is not a mainstream publisher and is biased on Gundam. Dengeki Hobby is more figure related than Gundam related. Yes, in your view anything that you have no interest in is not mainstream, because you simply do not need to pay any attention on it, and thus I have the idea of no matter how many sources I can include, you are just going to be able to say they are not notable, not mainstream. From the original Arguement of the nominator of having sources <i>not dedicated</i> to Gundam, you have moved the level higher onto an argument of needing to have sources <i>not dedicated to Anime</i>, and probably you will yet try to raise the bar to any sources dedicated to any sort of fan base, including models, anime, comics, novels, games, and any other thing you cannot name of but have a certain group of fans, and maybe just in case some star war fans are interested in Gundam, too, should not carry enough notablity as they are not mainstream, because you simply hate the fact that they are a source countering your argument. Oh, and I can add it up for you, a newspaper becoming immediately not mainstream if they have said anything about any of these Gundam mechas, why? because they are fan based, they are anime based, and center on the Gundam universe. Face it: <a href="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" rel="nofollow">Dengeki Hobby Magazine</a> is a mainstream modeling and figure magazine that is even translated to 2 chinese version(Hong Kong and <a href="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" rel="nofollow">Taiwan</a>), <a href="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" class="external text" title="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" rel="nofollow">Hobby Japan</a> only have Gundam as one of its nine sections, with at least 3 sections not related to Anime. And if you wanted to say that the section itself is not maintream publishers, anyone could have the same argument on anything, because you can even ignore any sources from CNN or BBC if you say that particular news is written by who is biased towards that topic. And No, wiki never states its sources have to be mainstream, if it got published, by a third party company, it is good enough as a source. It doen't matter if it is anime oriented or not, it is available on the market, people can read it and learn about what is written in it, it is good enough to be listed as a source stating how anything impacted anyone on writing that article of that particular thing. As a matter of facts, the Tokien Companion is a perfect source for books of J.R.R. Tokien. And thus a third party publisher writing anything on a topic should be a perfectly valid source.<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently, we're continuing our parade of bad arguments, and the next stop on your tour is a <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">ignoratio elenchi</a>. I'll play along and grant that these articles demonstrate a significant interest in the Gundamgoo that we're talking about. I'll do you one better, and say that it shows a notable real-world impact, and is thus meritous of inclusion. I don't agree with either of those statements, but we're pretending here, mmkay? Now, tell me what that has to do with the fact that the articles don't meet any of the burdens presented by <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>?

<dd>The thrust of my argument has, since the beginning, been that the articles you defend do not meet the criterion established by Wikipedia consensus in reference to writing about fictional topics. Along the way, I've had to defend against the notion that model kits inherently equal notability, but you'll notice I end each response with a return to the original question. Tell me, dear sir, how these articles meet the expectations placed upon them by the guidelines of our encyclopedia? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 21:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>And I have answered it many times. I never said anything about keeping all of them, and I never said all of them are important, I am just saying the ones that recieve out of universe treatment, like having a model made and appearing in another anime not made by the authors and company of the original anime, and appearing in a published magazine, serveral times, satisfy having <b>influenced the work of later creators and their projects</b>. Since these are not real human acting, the people who design them(including original design and finishing and redesigns) should be listed and replace the point of <i>the actor who portrayed the role</i>. The real world factors that have influenced the work can be found in an interview(listed in the Official website) of the director and two other interviews of the mechanical designer(listed in Data files) who said the designs are influenced by some of the previous Gundam productions not designed by him. Reception by critics can be sourced from the model magazines which over and over stated these designs reference too much from the previous Gundam series and some even referenced non-Gundam series. More could be found in Game Express Magazine published in Hong Kong that Critically analyze by Jeto(similar pronounciation) the series of main mechas(in separate issues) about how the main characters use auto lock on instead of real piloting skills in massive genocide and how the other mechas are being just paper boards without even moving and aiming.(The last one I never state because even though I totally agree with him, I know that that critic does not recieve much credit for his articles of constantly bashing on new series and is being criticised for that) How some of these articles can meet the expectation of our encyclopedia is simple. It cannot cover every single point, but at least some of the articles can have enough coverage on how much it was influenced by previous productions and how much influence they have on the real world modeling, 3D modeling, and anime production of later creators. And sources are posted over and over again. And no, I keep saying the articles at their current state does not meet any of the guidelines and must be improved, and I am assuming good faith on people who are interested in them with the sources I have provided will do a good enough job. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 02:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If any of that information appeared in the articles in question, I'm sure things would've gone a lot differently than they have so far. But until those statements, sourced and correctly applied, appear in the articles, then they stand to be deleted. Which articles specifically will benefit from those additions?

<dd>I am constructing a list of what to do down there, I think if it is passed, we we have some sort of consensus dispite this trainwreck. However, I will use the word <i>merge</i>(and redirect) instead of <i>delete</i>. If they are redirected, it is highly likely that people that can find their information will not create a new page by copyvio from mahq or something like that. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 03:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, having real world context is essential, but an article not having them maybe just needed to improve, especially sources indicate they can be. You can always assume bad faith, but the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Such_a_minor_branch_of_a_subject_that_it_doesn.27t_deserve_an_article" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion guide</a> suggested a merge for these kind of articles instead of a delete. I know 1.3 states WP:NOT as a <i>may be needed for deletion</i>, however, again, I must say that this is only a straw man's explanation on the WP:NOT policy. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> have nothing stating about these kind of articles and obviously a lot of list articles here falls into <i>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article</i> This is why the nomiation is doomed to fail. It should not have started anyway. The nominator should just be bold and started merging them in the beginning(and no, a transwiki is just different from having a list on wiki unless we can redirect people to there without using an external link). Now it is listed, no one can do so because it is like blanking the pages. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 01:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If no one can show real-world impact for the articles on an AfD, then that is an extremely clear indicator is has no real-world impact. He's not coining the term "never be improved", he's showing it through evidence - evidence being that no one has shown any importance of any of the articles whatsoever. The sources you have given are NOT proof of a real-world impact. I have already explained it, please read it.

<dd>Yes, keep ignoring the sources, everything that indicate they have an impact is <i>dedicted to Gundam</i> and should not be used, should not be listed and should not carry any notability since they are against <b>your</b> argument. Face it, the series is made by Sunrise, the models are made by Bandai, which are two different companies, that is enough prove of every single model made is an impact on the real world. The magazines are published by different companies, the books are published by different companies, anime made by other companies with no relationship to Sunrise that may infringe copyright problems are also shown as a proof and your common sense is ignoring anything that is against your argument, you have shown clear prove of ignorancy and yet you try to use personal attacks, POV and bad faith just to try to hook to your own nomination without even trying to link all of these together.

<p><b>Keep All</b>But condense the information... However, I think the whole premise of this motion is outrageous! Many of the points that the main person opposed to these articles (EmulatorGuy) has raised are vague, personal opinions which seem to have been raised on the basis of a personal vendetta. I like the way this material is called "useless" - useless to whom? It seems only to be useless to the people nominating the article and there are evidently plenty of people who find it quite useFUL. If we apply his model to the whole of Wikipedia: there will be no articles remaining for anyone to discuss or do anything with. It is obvious that many people want these articles to remain.

<li><b>Reply</b>: Indeed, more have voted to keep. However, if consensus is to "keep", Wikipedia does seem to support polling, since nearly all of the "keep" votes are ill-founded and ignore all of the issues brought up. But of course, there'll be a generic "no-consensus" just because there are more fanboys than people with common sense. I've yet to see one valid argument towards keeping the articles. No one has shown that ANY of the articles don't violate policies. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 01:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, I had some human error in my counting, but you made you biased your list in the opposite direction. Ben's redirect should be considered a delete (since you have to delete to redirect) and SidiLemine and Kerochan no Miko only said keep unless it was transwiki-ed. So that's at least 18 to <s>16</s> 17. wtfunkymonkey's vote probably shouldn't be considered, as it's both a delete and keep statement, so I say the voting stands at 18 to <s>15</s> 16, delete being the majority. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to remind everybody of an official wikipedia policy, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. That is the foudnign of my argument, I feel like these articles at least have some value and should not be deleted, per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. I think that IAR, is for situations like this, when somebody, so badly wants something deleted, that they try to cover all of there bases. I think that AFD's should be for the people participating to do the resaerch and make a decision, not attempt to innoculate the voters by squasing every keep argument! - <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 01:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That all depends on what you think "improve" means. Because the encyclopedia is intended for normal people, not Gundam fans (no offense), the rule would not apply. Only a fan of the Gundam series would ever find that information helpful. Regardless, that policy itself seems to have problems. It seems to imply that I can upload an image that violates copyright laws just because it would make Wikipedia better. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 01:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

If it were an article on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">Food</a>, it would be something most people know about.

This is why I feel that <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applies here. IT is not something that is bad faith, like blatant uploading of copyright images, it is an area that most people dont know about and should get some coverage. In my opinion.

<dd>- At least we agree! It is not a bad faith edit! I am all for that. The foot analogy was pretty good. If your foot had a fan club, and there was something unique about your foot. (perhaps you have 123 toes) or your toes look like a star wars character or something, I would probably support keeping the article.

<dd>Just because they are part of something popular does not mean they are notable themselves. An even more popular series like Star Wars doesn't have a page on every droid. They are listed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids_dcc6.html" title="List of minor Star Wars droids">here</a>, and what's more ridiculous is THE LIST is being accused of non-notability.

<dd>I'm sick of defending every argument here. It just isn't worth it, no one wants to accept it and keeps ignoring logic. From here on I'll just stop and let the nomination get a "no consensus", which was clearly going to happen from the start. It's beyond me why anyone thinks these articles are notable, have reliable sources etc. etc. etc. I shouldn't bother, regardless of any of my arguments, Wikipedia administrators will base it on amount of votes (like they always do) and not the integrity of votes. I give up, you can have your articles if the administrator says so. If the nomination results in delete, that's fine, but it's just not worth pointlessly arguing with ignorance. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

The chinese wiki entries like these are so much simplier, we just merge and redirect everything without even putting up something like this. If fans can find enough data in the list of mecha, they will not create new page for every single one of them. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:06, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're misinterpreting the guts of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. The fact that some of these things appeared in another anime about big robots does not mean that they significantly impacted said anime. These big robots haven't significantly affected <b>anything.</b> The television show, perhaps, has made a dent in the Great Big Timeline of Stuff, but I'm willing to bet, when it all comes down to the line, no one is going to say, "Thank God for the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-600_GuAIZ_af9c.html" title="ZGMF-600 GuAIZ">ZGMF-600 GuAIZ</a>. Were it not for this twenty-meter-tall, eighty-ton mass of metals and guns, my life would be completely void of meaning." WP:FICT makes the argument for real-world reference and analysis because Wikipedia <b>is not</b> a Gundam fan site, and the sum cultural value of the Gundam series is not going to be that Pilot X stole it from Evil Nemesis Q, who was going to use it against Innocent Population T, but instead managed to defeat Otherworldly Monster N, and is the reason for the ring of space debris floating around Planet U. The fact that someone else has devoted time and webspace to listing these facts does not make them worthy of encyclopedic apotheosis. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 21:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While certainly nothing in this AfD (which hits a swathe of over 85 articles, which when the related AfD for the non-mecha vehicles of this same series is added, tops 100 articles all told) is of life-shaking importance, there are several articles in here which are at <b>least</b> as notable as, say, <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wing</a> or <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Enterprise_%28NCC-1701-D%29_08aa.html" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)">USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)</a>. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 21:29, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hadn't read the X-Wing article until now. Having done so, I'd say it's pretty crappy, and a poor example of writing on a fictional topic. Only three or four of the paragraphs relate to real-world content, with the other 4/5 of the page devoted to Star Wars <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">treknobabble</a>. That article needs cleaned up, purged of irrelevant and trivial knowledge, and polished, but I digress. Since I'm not familiar with the intimate details of Gundam stuff, I'll trust you that some of the units mentioned are of value to the series. Could you give some examples of the ones you think should be kept, and provide a rationale for them? I don't mean that as a mean-spirited challenge: I'm not attacking you and demanding you come forth like some kind of deletionist McCarthy.

<dd>I've already conceded that the "grunt" units should be compressed into summary articles by nationality (ZAFT/PLANT, Earth Alliance and Orb are the relevant nationalities).

<dd>I'm in complete agreement with you there, and I think that's an acceptable compromise between the two extremes being presented in this debate.

<p><b>Comment:</b> I've never seen any Gundam, but I have a strong feeling that most, if not all, of these articles are about things that only appeared briefly in an episode or two. Any character/etc. that does not have at least ~30 minutes worth of focused airtime is too minor to have an article about. Can it be established that <i>any</i> of these weapons have had enough focus within the series that they need to be kept? It just gets worse outside of the nominated articles.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I agree that some of these articles deserve AfD-ing, but the majority of them do not. This was a bad nom period.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Its better, but I wouldn't suggest making mass deletion noms out of principle. For example, the Skygrasper in this new Nom is one of the more featured air/spacecraft of the show and some of the main characters involved in the story fly them.

<dd>From what I see in the series, its worst. The mass-production models appear in the series as paper boards and have probably less than 5 actions each. They fly out and get destroyed by the main characters without even having the need of dodging or aiming(aiming is done by an automatic fire control system, much less powerful than the F-22 onboard FCS). The same sequence keep on and on just to show how <i>powerful</i> the main characters are(failure attempt to most people with normal level of judgement, i.e. that are not blind). That is why I am really into merging those into one big list. As per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. No voting is needed according the WP:FICT for minor characters to be merged into a list, if there isn't already a AfD tag on the page, I would have done so when I knew pages like this exsisted. I only followed a vandal's path of vandalism and figured these mecha have their own page and someone tagged AfD on it so that nothing can be done to blank them, yet. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

It's not like we're considering deleting all or even most of the articles dedicated to a single franchise; as far as I can tell these don't even touch on the plot, characters, fanbase, criticism, impact on the real world, etc., just the props. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 18:23, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice and ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom be merged to Justice and Freedom, they are not very notable other than being the mecha main protongists pilot, esp when they are just kinda like upgrades of those two: Anime <i>Sunrise</i>, Model <i>Bandai</i>, Game Bandai, Manga <i>Kondasha</i>, Manga <i>Kodogawa</i>, Book <i>Media works</i>, Game <i>Banpresto</i>.</dd>

<dd><b>Arguable items</b></dd>
<dd>The GS and GSD both have a team of three piloting three different Gundam units that the main protongist fight against, these units mainly appeared only in the series and games by Bandai, they are not even a main element in the plot(none of them stayed in the series for more than half of the series). They recieve a little more treatment by having models in the GS and GSD series but not much in the Bandai regular series like the MG models. (Almost all important ones have MG models). I do not view them as having any appearance in the model because it is only one of the GS and GSD series models which are named as dedicated to those two series. Even if they exsist outside the main lists, they should be merged to the three in the team instead of having their own page.</dd>

<dd>Emulator, all you have done in this whole discussion is continued reassertion of your initial premise. It's already been firmly established that you believe there is no viable content to be had from these articles, which is debated by other posters (including posters who are not fans of the Gundam Seed universe), so further reiteration of this argument is pretty well pointless. If by this point, where viable post-AfD plans have been mentioned and posted, which satisfy the requirements of policy, you are still sticking to your original premise and demanding that the entire article complex be thrown away, in spite of all apparent evidence that contradicts your original argument (which was based on a pretty twisted interpretation of policy to begin with), you simply have nothing meaningful to contribute to this conversation from this point on (really, you have contributed nothing meaningful since the initial nomination). The consensus appears to be <b>keep some, merge most,</b> and that is probably what the discussion should be closed on. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 23:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

I'll let you ignore the fact ANY separate article for a weapon in Gundam is against policy, because obviously we need fucking "individual merit".

<li><b>Comment</b> It may be that this needs to be broken into smaller chunks. However, the other side of this issue is that having the same people make the same arguments in 84 different discussions is also not useful. It would be helpful if the people arguing for a finer-grained deletion discussion could delineate some middle ground between 1 and 84 AfDs so that we can move forward instead of stagnating. Without wanting to prejudice the discussion, I will say that it seems to me that at minimum there is a consensus here that some of the articles should go, so maybe some consensus can at least be reached on which ones those are. For at least that reason, I think it is premature at this time to close this discussion. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply comment</b> I guess it is because it happened that all the 84 randomly selected articles are not of good quality? lol I must admit the work going into these articles are towards a not very good direction. Most of them are just going for 1) plot summary of what happened to that unit(or the series of them) and 2) the settings spec of them. While little can be found on what they have impacted, even with the handful of sources I can just pull up that should be included into the articles long ago. (I have not read any of these articles before, even if I made like a little edit on them, it is most likely that I am tracing a vandal's path of vandalization and only revert those without actually looking at the articles.) Most of them could be improved, at least the lot of Seed mecha can be said to have impacted the Seed-Destiny mechas and have appearance in Super Robot wars. However, little was included in these, and I have no interest and time in improving these because I have an even longer list of Universal Century Mechas to work on, before some deletionist list the few hundred mechas AfD, I have to do what I can to either merge them or improve them to a point where it is good enough to meet any policy creep keeping criteria. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, the GNAA should never be cited as a precedent for anything, ever. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 07:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not that the Warcraft AfD was the first attempt at such a thing, of course.

<dd>The only way it would work is probably listing items out like in the other mass AfD for the CE vehicles. Never treat every article listed as generic, because they are not the same, especially to fans, they are never the same and thus treating them the same is only going to make things worst.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd just like to say that this AfD is a complete catastrophe, and that each article should , really, be AfD'd seperately. If this goes through it will end up in DRV because of the Inclusionists here. As a Deletionist, I'm not really ... happy ... with the way this is laid out, since it's a bit of work to look through all the articles and Gundam makes me see red anyway. That being said, some of these articles are possible copyvios. Some are just summaries. Some could, theoretically, be expanded. Mass AfD's rarely succeed since most people will not axe huge clumps of information without being sure every single one deserves the axe. This one will go down as no consensus, so a good and careful look at most of the articles in this series is needed by those voting to keep on how to expand them, or in a few days I'll go through AfDing the crap ones and voting they get salted. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 15:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the sake of all that is non-flamewar-causing, let us do some editing and merging before any new AfDs go out. This AfD is a train wreck because the initial poster was so goddamned determined to get the whole mass AfD deleted without any sort of compromise that he was willing to ignore policy to try to get it done (recall that he threatened to immediately re-nominate the whole thing if the result came up "no consensus" and to "teach the administrators a lesson" if the result came up "keep"); emotions need time to settle before further delete action should be taken, IMO. And I don't think ANYBODY will benefit from a precedent that shows that a huge group of articles can be summarily, collectively deleted by somebody with an obvious axe to grind. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 16:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Shut down this ridiculous monstrosity (keep)</b> for the time being. I'm not a fan of Gundam, however it appears that there are plenty of users who know where to merge and redirect these articles, so I think they should be given the chance to do so. Nominating 84 articles at once is not going to solve any problems these articles may have; merging, redirecting and such will, and will prevent the articles from being recreated with policy-violating content again. If nothing is done to correct the obvious problems that these articles have, then the nominator will certainly have the opportunity to kill them with fire in the future, and I think he'd be more successful with this discussion backing him. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbag_b817.html" title="User:Catbag">Catbag</a> 22:45, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>More and more people pop in and say <b>keep</b>, I hate to say this, but if we can say we have the least consensus here, it is <b>merge</b>, not keep, most of the articles. If you only want spec data for something, go to [www.mahq.net MAHQ.net], or the trans wiki link posted somewhere in the middle of this trainwreck. Or if we merged the pages, the spec will still be there. Here is what I propose, and is probably closest to people who actively participated in this discussion want. (I do not count the people who just come out and drop down a sentence without actually wanting to contribute and wished a blind keep).</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - Influenced at least 2, if not 3 later design in the sequel of the series, the only Perfect grade model of the series, used as the front page of a 3D modeling teaching book about all Gundam, not Seed only. Said to be one of the more realistic military based design of the mechanical designer <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunio_Okawara_1bbe.html" title="Kunio Okawara">Kunio Okawara</a> by Dengeki Hobby. Been a featured topic of a model convention in Japan by Hobby Japan.</dd>
<dd>Reasons for merge of others - they are of a subdivision of Strike, either mass-production or special unit. They have not recieve any special treatment from the company Bandai, and thus are generic enough to be merged, if not deleted.</dd>

If possible, merge the Justice page and the <i>ZGMF-X1??</i> series under this page. more details will be stated in the section <i>Suggested merges</i> below. For now, I treat those as they could be separated.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - Influenced said merge mecha in the sequel, recieved treatment of having a Master Grade model of its own and the same series only have Strike Gundam having the same treatment. Featured in the Game <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Wars_af61.html" title="Super Robot Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> along with a lot of well known mecha in Japan, and have a cameo appearance in the anime <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_Witch_Komugi_c7e4.html" title="Nurse Witch Komugi">Nurse Witch Komugi</a>, produced by Tatsunoko productions, which have no relationship with Bandai and is actually sort of a rivaling company.</dd>
<dd>Reasons for merge of others - Strike Freedom is more of an upgrade of Freedom, although it is going to have its own Master Grade model soon(December, 2006), more have to be shown in a keep since it does not influence anything, yet. I see no reason for keeping it for now, if it can recieve more attention by publishers and the company, it could be split back out at any time.
<dl>
<dd>For Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice: Not quite usual upgrade. Not even a variant. That why we place F-15 and F-15E, F18 and F18E/F, separately. They are quite distinct, they have quite a story (Though original Freedom has more). Though they take much previous design, it is quite different, except some source say so. I never see any source which say they are upgrades. This may be only speculation, however, Freedom, Justice, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, receive different code (X10A,X9A,X20A,X19A respectively). I may agree if asked to merge Infinite Justice, but not the Strike Freedom based on notability. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 12:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reasons - First appeared in MSV, influenced the author of the manga to include them into the manga(which is not a retell of the anime), no out of the series model kits have been made for it, but it is featured in Gundam Evolve, a series not dedicated to Gundam Seed or related series, the only other appearance of a Seed series mecha is Strike.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - They are pretty much the same thing, but the model recieved a bit more attention for the Gold frame is an event limited item in a Japanese model convention not dedicated to Gundam. Also for the new technology in modeling in hiding the cut between the useful pieces and the backbone of the injection moulding piece. It is not the first to have such treatment, but the second of the Bandai modeling series, after Hyakushiki. And since the other astray articles should tag along, I'd say merging them to a page for the Astray series is not a bad idea.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>ZGMF-X23S Saviour, ZGMF-X24S Chaos, ZGMF-X31S Abyss, etc. that starts with ZGMF-X??? that is not 1X are called <i>Second series</i> on the official Japanese page, they generally recieve the same treatment altogether, and should be merged to a page other than the mass-production ZAFT mecha. This includes <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X56S_Impulse_Gundam_32f8.html" title="ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam">ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam</a> and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X42S_Destiny_Gundam_5c98.html" title="ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam">ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam</a> due to their not so important figure out of the series. At least until something special about them is released, I'd say this is good enough.</li>
<li>ZGMF-X09A Justice and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X19A_Infinite_Justice_2bee.html" title="ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice">ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice</a> are not even satisfied as a main plot device to some certain extend. They might be a little more important to the series, but is definitely not having any special impact to the real world. The latter actually is less popular than a Zaku unit in the series(per the series models having it out so late that it is 11 months later than the last Zaku unit.) (for the 1/144, it is even 1 month later than the Dom units) For a unit appearing pretty much the same time as the Freedom, its attention is way lower and my view on this is that its popularity is not high enough for the modeling company to release it early. Therefore, I'd say merge it to Freedom, its partner and let them tag along to increase that article's notability instead of being evaluated to be deleted soon after this.</li>

<p>I would like to say the others should be deleted, but redirects to big lists would greatly reduce the chances of them being recreated by randomly dropped by fans. Since merging everything left into one page is definitely going to exceed 32kb, I propose 2 methods of merging:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merge by fictional nations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easy links from the fictional nation page (though I kinda think they should be merged to one page, too) Easier explanation on which is the predecessor of which.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: too easy to get the articles into another mess of in-universe article, and is hard to organize the whole thing to let people without any knowledge to comprehand which one is from which story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Merge by series</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easier to let people know what appeared in which series (All the manga Astray series viewed as a whole) which from my point of view, it is better served as an out-of-universe view of things. (Most people walking by is not going to understand what is ZAFT and Orb and etc.)</li>

<p>I will not work on the above articles until I have finished a major part of the Universal Century mechas having similar pages like this one. I have provide sources and what I have listed in this page should be enough to improve the articles I have listed as keeps to a point where they meet wiki's policies. If nothing has improved for some while (like more AfD pops up), I will not back up those pages any more. Because it is obvious enough that nobody cared to improve those pages. However, I see that there are people who seems to be willing to do so in the above discussion and I am assuming good faith on this. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 07:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Anyway after taking a look at some articles I can say that some ideas I have to towards trimming an article down is not to go into so much detail over Mobile suit capablities since that had resulted in mutiple paragraphs also the triva section should be trimmed down to remove any speculative, and unneccessary material. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>One other comment to post: It would help if for the Gundam articles not to go into extra detail on the Technology used in that Gundam such as Phase Shift Armor, N-Jammer Canceller, and DRAGOON System since there are already sperate articles for them and it wouldn't be ripping off the Gundam website MAHQ.net of their style of explaining this technology in their Mobile suit summary. An example I have is of the Gaia Gundam <a href="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" rel="nofollow">ZGMF-X88S (RGX-03) Gaia Gundam</a>. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Article merges, trims, redirects, and maybe some individual AfDs seem to be our next step. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gundam_cc10.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam</a> would be a good place to organize this. I think we can all agree that things shouldn't stay, as they are now, for these articles. What to cut and what to keep is the question now. Personally, I think the whole thing could be cut, especially if it's been transwikied, but that's just me. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 07:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've still yet to see an example of <i>content</i> in this category that should exist, although I imagine it would be possible to write different, out-of-universe article(s) on the <i>topic</i>. My first choice position would still be to delete these and start over; but I have no particular objection to a merge so long as it 1) drastically reduces the number of articles (sections can always be split into new articles later) and 2) Gets pushed towards <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>'s goal of articles about fiction in the real world, instead of an encylcopedia of fiction as if it were real. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 08:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
