<ul>
<li>Obviously my vote is <b>strong keep</b>, I mean, G4TV dedicated an entire segment of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1ROKY4fdQ" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1ROKY4fdQ" rel="nofollow">Attack of the Show to the game</a> - that passes notability. And what about bandwidth? Over 300,000 downloads and 7 terrabytes of bandwidth. Surely, that, too, passes notability. Most <b>commercial</b> games are considered a success when they sell over 250,000 copies of a game; well, 300,000 people have acquired my game. I need to say nothing further on the matter. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 00:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, to pass notability, this game must be "the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." As far as I can tell, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a> is the only such example -- and that show often runs segments on things like Flash movies, Internet memes, "cool websites," and other assorted non-notable, non-encyclopedic ephemera. Add to that a bit of a vanity concern and I think we have a clear delete. No hard feelings, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory of cool games and links. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 00:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It was <b>NOT</b> just Attack of the Show. Several gaming websites gave it great reviews, as well, and possibly even a few magazines. Face it, the game's famous. Delete the article, and you're probably going to have your head ripped off by a horde of rabid fans. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 00:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These reviews and magazines are not <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cited</a>. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 00:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> (formerly <s><b>Weak keep</b></s>) per <i>Attack of the Show</i> coverage and claim of having "been featured in many magazines". These magazines need to actually be cited within the article to "count", but it's a start. Weak keep for now, with the possibility of a full keep or weak delete depending on how the magazine coverage thing turns out. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 00:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have updated my vote. Per below, it seems the magazine coverage is trivial and a mention on Attack of the Show apparently isn't such a big deal after all. I'd also like to point out that the conduct of the article's supporters on this Afd has been truly abysmal. Granted, that is certainly no reason to delete in and of itself, but it certainly doesn't help what is already a borderline case at best. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The game was also in numerous published magazines. The number of downloads, and bandwidth it's used should be more than enough to take care of it's notability.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Andre... You saying, "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a directory for cool games and links" is so hypocritical. The majority of the wiki articles would never appear in a published encyclopedia, and you can't keep trying to make wiki a, "Standard Encyclopedia" because it's obviously become much more than that. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshuku_d2b5.html" title="User:Ashuku">Ashuku</a> 00:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand what hypocrisy is involved here. Wikipedia <i>is</i> an encyclopedia and articles must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/Wikipedia%7EEncyclopedic_889f.html" title="Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">encyclopedic</a>. Also, observers, please note that this user has under 50 edits. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 01:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Its hypocritical because there are tons of articles on wikipedia like this, which are just as notable, and get keeps all the time. And if you read what I said, I clearly called it, "Much more than a standard encyclopedia".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, stating that I have under 50 edits was <b>ignorant</b>. Since when does the amount of edits I have reflect on my knowledge of wikipedia. Or Anything for that matter? Thats like saying a higher post count on a forum makes you a better member.</dd>

<ul>
<li>"Trivial" is such a broad term, though. What Person A considers trivial, Person B may not. What about Kotaku? Voted the number one gaming blog for Spike TV's Videogame Awards 2005. They mentioned MarioWeen when it first came out, too. Googling it returns 264,000 sites. Is that trivial to you? Because it's not trivial to me. I'll try to find the magazine scans I have (I saved most of them, but not in a unified folder or anything, and they lack identifying file names, so it's going to take me a while to track them down). Also, <b>Luigifan</b>: Chill out. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 00:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Triviality is not in reference to the source itself, but the nature of the mention. Gaming blogs in particular are not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable sources</a> for notability. They also have a strong tendency to, like <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a>, write about non-notable ephemera. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 01:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I want to see this magazine coverage actually cited in the article. I'm seeing a lot of general claims but very few specifics. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:07, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What do you mean it lacks specifics? I didn't know I was supposed to list every single last magazine that had a blurb of my game in it. I listed the bigger name ones I could think of; <a href="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" class="external text" title="http://blazefire.mooglecavern.com/GMMarioBlueTwilight.jpg" rel="nofollow">GamesMaster</a>, for example, the largest gaming magazine in the UK. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazeHedgehog_a731.html" title="User:BlazeHedgehog">BlazeHedgehog</a> 01:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The GamesMaster mention is clearly trivial - it's just one sentence and a screenshot. It is not sufficient to establish any sort of notability. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 01:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, I let myself get riled up, and that's my fault; I'll readily admit that I overreacted. However, Andrevan's being a bigot. He refuses to change his point of view, even with me, Blaze, and several others prodding solid evidence of this game's notability <i><b>up his eyeballs</b></i>.

<li>Gamesmaster is only trivial to you because you're not British. And because you're determined to see things your way.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- Why on earth should this be deleted?! I mean, for one, it <i><b>has</b></i> been featured on magazines and a TV show, dosen't that qualify it as notable?! If we manage to find the said magazines then BOOM! we have a winner. Anyway, everyone (or mostly everyone) here thinks it's notable, and most "discussions" for deletion usually are decided by the number of people who think it is notable. And, no offense, Luigifan, you shouldn't go to such extremes. I don't wanna sound like I'm nagging, but it'll do more damage than good if you do that. Try to be civillized and maybe we'll be able to hold up a persusive argument. I mean, I wouldn't agree with someone who vandalized a page or is using profanity.

<li>Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding anything more than the GamesMaster scan. It WAS mentioned in Hardcore Gamer Magazine, but it was <i>really</i> trivial - one of the editors mentioned it under "Games I am playing this month". Which really, really sucks. I thought I at least copied the images in when I packed up the MarioWeen source and burned it to a CD, but they aren't there, either. I don't know where else to look unless I go through each and every individual image on my HDD - of which there are <i>thousands</i>.

<dd>Like I said, I lost my temper when I felt that Andrevan was ignoring us. However, now I see that it's because you don't think the citations are good enough. I would agree... if this was a <i>commercial</i> project. However, a mention is the best coverage a fangame can expect, evn if it's pretty good. If it actually gets an <i>article</i> in a magazine, it must be stellar... on the other hand, this game should fit those guidelines.

<li><b>comment</b> I'm invoking the common-sense rule. There's no dispute that the game exists, was featured on a television show, and has a large number of players. The guidelines were intended to ensure this type of notability -- to provide a test for it. They weren't intended to disqualify otherwise-notable topics that fall under a certain unspecified threshold of media attention. That said, my personal interest in the game and the article, and in fan games in general (and Mario stuff in particular) is pretty much zero. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 18:43, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think this is a classic case of Wikipedia through the looking glass syndrome the writers feel got at "where are all these comments coming from" - take a look at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_October_27" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2006_October_27" rel="nofollow">2006_October_27</a> - seeing things from the other side of the looking class might help! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 19:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't want to sound rude, but with all due respect it doesn't really matter whether the subject is interesting to you or any other particular individual. Virtually <i>everything</i> is interesting to somebody, that doesn't mean it needs to be on Wikipedia. I find a number of things interesting that aren't appropriate for an encyclopedia. The guidelines which have been formulated for us to follow were designed for this precise reason. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly right. For instance, I'm extremely interested in my husband, in my friends' blogs, in the way some people's ears have bumps on the tips, and in the awesome birthmark on the back of my right knee. Not one of those things would be appropriate for a Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 23:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Why should it matter that this is a fan-made game? It's a game that's appeared on television, SEVERAL gaming websites as well as printed magazines in a few countries, and has been downloaded a great amount of times. It has a fairly detailed Wikipedia entry, complete with references and screenshots. All of which is more then I can say about a good amount of officially released games, I can tell you. Oh, and it's also been mentioned in NGC Magazine. A scan here: <a href="http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg" class="external free" title="http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://coldflame.doorsclosing.com/images/twilightNGCarticle.jpg</a> (I have a full page scan for anyone who asks for it) I hope this may help even slightly in proving the article's notability even further. <a href="../../../h/_/h/User%7EH_Hog_547c.html" title="User:H Hog">H Hog</a> 16:03, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The scanned image would count as a trivial source (at least to me). A sidebar is not the same as an actual article, which would be much more impressive. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 16:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">guidelines</a> don't specify a distinction between sidebars and other reviews. Their purpose is to ensure that a game actually exists, and that it has wide enough recognition to have appeared in objective media sources. A nine-page spread in some game-industry journal would also be more impressive, honestly, but we've reached that crucial moment in which an article has satisfied the spirit of the guidelines, and has passed the common-sense test (i.e., it's not fancruft, a commercial pitch, or a vanity page), and votes for deletion are going to have to rest on opinion and personal taste. My own opinion is that game stuff is completely uninteresting, but the article isn't for me, if you see what I mean. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 16:51, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> would suggest, it's long enough to not be counted as trivial; as the page suggests, a "trivial" mention would consist of little more then the name of the game and its release date. <a href="../../../h/_/h/User%7EH_Hog_547c.html" title="User:H Hog">H Hog</a> 17:10, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>change vote to <b>keep</b>: In light of new evidence (the scaned image from H Hog), coverage is definately NONTRIVIAL. Though short, it is an honest-to-god review, that establishes notability. We also have other short (though also nontrivial) reviews listed in a few places above. Let this be an object lesson to everyone on how to do research and provide evidence to a defence. Cold hard facts will beat passion any day. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 01:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I am one to agree that most indy projects do not deserver articles however this one has reached acclaim for what it is, G4, Kotaku, etc. Its obviously meeting the standard of notability. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>If you think this should be deleted, then by that same logic, many, many, wiki articles need to go. Such as the All your base articles, any and all fangame articles and basically 1/3rd of wikipedia. Don't be silly, the fact that wikipedia has articles on such things that have a small or 'cult' following is what makes it a cut above other encyclopedias. To delete this would be to denounce the foundation of wikipedia. This is a definite keeper. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfect_Chaos_Zero_c45f.html" title="User:Perfect Chaos Zero">Perfect Chaos Zero</a> 01:27, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>"All your base" has been cited in 44 "scholarly" articles per google scholar. I'm sure I could find enough to make the page stick. It's notable and sourcable--they're not comparable. Wikipedia has a lot of articles that fall short of notability guidelines. If you find similar that you feel do not meet the guidelines, put them up for deletion. But that's not the point. We're not discussing 1/3 of Wikipedia, we're talking about this article. We have objective criteria to determine this article's merits and we should used those to determine rather than the "if we delete this, we have to delete 1/3 of wikipedia" strawman. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 02:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>What Perfect Chaos Zero is saying, is that this page does fit in Wikipedia, albeit in a sort of "stubbish" fashion, in that it's encyclopedic enough to be included in an online encyclopedia, but would be a waste of paper (and a bit of extra mass) in a paper encyclopedia. Since Wikipedia is supposed to be dynamic, and to cover things that other encyclopedias would ignore, this page shouldn't be deleted. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 02:39, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> This article needs to be trimmed down tremendously, including cleaning up a lot of peacock terms. A four line entry is not being "featured" in a magazine. Linking an article to a user's page is NOT appropriate. Having 3/4 of your article consisting of a trivia section does not give any real information. I'm going to through and whittle this article down to what is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and non-trivial. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 17:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Also, I'm removing a lot of the media mentions. The digg article just points to a primary source. The Insert Credit article says "by brandon, via <b>Ryan Bloom</b>". I've taken out the "game of the week thing" because 1. Game of the week = 52 per year =&gt; not too hard to do and 2. There were <a href="http://www.create-games.com/download.asp?id=5591" class="external text" title="http://www.create-games.com/download.asp?id=5591" rel="nofollow">70 votes</a>, which makes it susceptible to ballot-stuffing. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 18:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would say keep the game of the week thing considering how many titles are released a year, and this was an indy project, its more then a testament to success on behalf of the developers. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Alright, I've put it back in. However, I've taken out the "landslide" bit because apparently the votes aren't archived and there's no other source for it, meaning leaving it in would leave us as a primary source for that information. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 15:52, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
