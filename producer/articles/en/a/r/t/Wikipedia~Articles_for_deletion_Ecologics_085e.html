<dd>Comment: The article now begins... <i>Ecologics ([Ikologiks])is defined as a cumulative-progressive system (science) of philosophical thought or study into universal phenomenlogical knowledge; within the context of integrated dialectical, metaphysical, revolutionary transformational praxis.(Davis, 1977,1999).</i>. I don't think this has any meaning. Certainly it is incompatible with <i>Ecologics is a research term used to describe a field of study or theory that is an extension of the academic discipline known as Human Ecology.</i>. A term cannot be "is" something other than its definition. Still delete, sorry. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> - This document is awkward. It seems to be either a very talented piece of historical research or a remarkable fraud. In the spirit of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, I am going to assume the former. Google seems to verify the existence of many of the key terms (Ikologiks), organizations (Cornell College of Human Ecology, Eco.Logic Powerhouse) and people (Adisa Maina Omar). However, my use of google is not able to establish certain other entities or the connections between them. For example, I have not been able to connect any "Roger M. Davis" to either Adisa Omar, Cornell, or Ecologics. Key facts of this type clearly need citations. At the very least, I would feel a lot better about this work if the author would provide full references for some of Davis' ecologic work. Also, it seems that the term "ecologics" existed at least in 1971 when Libbie Agran &amp; Bobbie Gilbert wrote a book by that title. Of course, it is not clear whether they were refering to the same concept as this article. In response to the original research comments, I would observe that most of this article is presented as a collection of facts. As such, it should be possible to document these issues in sufficient detail to avoid the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> prohibition. Assumming the author is willing to start filling in the citation details (and s/he seems to have expressed a willingness to do this) then I support the existence of this article. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 08:02, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Adisaji, here is a copy of the citation information from my university's online catalog. Frankly it reads rather strangely, since the "publisher" is given as "Los Angeles". I wonder if this was someone's thesis, or something like that. Regardless, they did use the word "ecologics", though I have no easy way of knowing what they meant by it. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 02:04, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> pseudointellectual claptrap. Even direct citations have spelling and grammatical errors, which leads me to believe this is a hoax. Also, as a professor of philosophy who has read much in the vein of environmental ethics and metaphyics, this is (a) like nothing I've ever seen published and (b) too religious to be analytical as the article implies. It would be a disservice to readers to maintain this article. As far as the author below claiming that he will provide "copies of news articles and clippings," I find this claim dubious because he expects prompting, rather than freely presenting the information in the first place. See <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> for my thought on the matter.

As for my reference to <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, I am pointing out an article which deals with a controversial subject, points out that the subject is controversial, and provides citations which prove the subject isn't so much hot air.

<dd>Your tone is still belligerant -- for the record I NEVER attacked you. I just replied to your bias and responded to your offensive language and non-verification of your academic qualifications. I don't want to waste more time with "negativity-bickering" so like you said I'll make the corrections and you can vote the way you want. Dianetics and Scientologist (Tom Cruise, John Travota, etc.) may be bogus or "kooks" in your opinion, but some had that same feeling about other movements like Mormans, Hare Krishnas, SevenDay Adventist or those that once said the world was round when the common thinking was the world is flat (middle ages). We may disagree with their ideas but that doesn't mean wikipedia should not list them. I suggest opinions remain just that and pure objective scientific review not be based on cultural,racial or intellectual bias. That should be the golden rule at wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdisaji_5e6e.html" title="User:Adisaji">Adisaji</a> 04:44, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>you DO NOT CITE, where you received your degrees in Philosophy</i> reads like an attack to me.

<li>To User:William Connolley, when someone uses language like "hoax" "dubious" and "pseudointellectual claptrap" I TAKE THAT VERY PERSONALLY AND AS AN INSULT ABOUT MY INTEGRITY AND HONESTY. Had he simply referenced the article that would be acceptable, but he personally attacked my sincerity, honesty, integrity. I had every right to question his "academic credentials" when he used them in a paternalistic/condesending fashion and as a basis for discrediting my submission and essentially calling me a liar.

<dd>This argument is a red herring, and I hope he begins to edit the article with as much tenacity, for his and the article's sake. Also, feel free to see his user talk page where I have provided him a list of revisions he could make to meet "my" and Wikipedia's standards. Two citations, relation to current literature, and a revision of the article's definition (which at this point is nearly the same definition for <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a>) doesn't seem too much to ask (Since if this is provided, I could do the grammatical/spelling revisions as penance). I, and anyone here would provide these edits if they could, since there is no prejudice about the article existing <i>per se</i>. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmicuspublilius_c81e.html" title="User:Amicuspublilius">Amicuspublilius</a> 15:34, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Talk:Ecologics From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. ECOLOGICS</p>
<p>I am responding to those citing the submission for "deletion" on ECOLOGICS. I spent a lot of time preparing and researching this submission. Yes, it has historical relevance and I am prepared to offer copies of news articles and clippings that would substantiate this claim.</p>
<p>I think it is unfair and unreasonable to delete an article submission just because the reader has NO KNOWLEDGE of the subject. If you don't have knowledge about this topic then you should not comment. I would appreciate any serious contributions and help in editing this material since I am brand new to the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>I really think this online source is important specifically because minor topics or information often ommitted in commercial dictionaries or encyclopedias can be now be viewed by researchers.</p>
<p>Thank you. Adisaji</p>

<p>I really found the assistance of <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">EvilPhoenix</a> very helpful and supportive. The "comment" by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> seems well-founded. I am trying to locate the actual article by N. Hare so I can determine whether the term "black ecology" was used in a generic sense in the journal article or as an actual introduction of a new english word/term. It is possible that both N. Hare and R. Davis both began to popularize the term. For example, the 1960s black activist Stokely Carmichael is largely viewed to have introduced the term 'Black Power.' However, the term 'Black Capitalism' is accredited to former President Richard Nixon, and there is some indication he (Nixon) might have also introduced the term 'black power' preceding Carmichael (see book "Star Spangled Hustle" -- I'll cite detailed references later). I have located several scanned copies from the following presses: The Washington Post, Bronx Press Review, Our Daily Planet, NY Daily News and Cornell Daily Sun which all pertain to the material in the article -- Ecologics. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW I CAN UPLOAD THIS IMAGES, so interested parties can review them and assist in the ongoing discussion. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> Your comments were I believe a violation of the very Wikipedia policies you accused me of violating. It seems you just want to emotionally dismiss the submission -- for the record, I did not attack an editor. I'm trying very hard to be polite and scholarly.</p>
<p><b>(Updated!!!)</b> <s>I think at this point ... maybe the article should just be DELETED. I'm feeling so pressured to revise this article before your "five day review" deadline. The nature of this research for acquiring citations will take time, since the material is not easily recoverable and deals with material over thirty years ago.

<li>This is almost a decent case to start an article black ecology, although it isn't clear whether the "black ecology" in question would be a branch of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> (a biological science) or of <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_ethics.html" title="Environmental ethics">environmental ethics</a> (a philosophical science). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmicuspublilius_c81e.html" title="User:Amicuspublilius">Amicuspublilius</a> 03:49, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am considering starting a "Black Ecology" page as well as soon as I get the first page "Ecologics" refined, tweaked and put in conformity with wikipedia standards. I have noted your other comments (above) -- and responded.--<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdisaji_5e6e.html" title="User:Adisaji">Adisaji</a> 04:34, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
