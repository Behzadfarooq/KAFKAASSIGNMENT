<p><s>The college shuttle bus that runs between Wellesley, MIT and Harvard is not sifficiently notable to merit a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 14:34, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</s> I retract these comments and have changed my vote. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:02, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><s><b>Delete unless moved back to "Fuck Truck"</b>&#160;: renominated because of the move from "fuck truck" to "Wellesley College Senate Bus". I voted againt deletion in the last debate because the term "fuck truck", used at colleges across America, is a genuine piece of American collegiate folklore; I thought this article had potential to grow beyond its discussion of the Wellesley bus and, in so doing, become notable on this cultural basis. However, with this move, the article focuses on this one shuttle bus between a amall liberal arts college outside of Boston and larger nearby colleges...Can you imagine if wikipedia had an article for every specific college shuttle and its campus lore? Simply put, this article in its new, more specic form, simply does not deal with a notable topic.</s> <b>Keep</b>: I am changing my vote for the sake of consistency. I really felt like I was doing the right thing, but I can see how my actions might be perceived as bad faith or at the very least obnoxious.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. The name change is irrelevant and this nom is in bad faith. The article move followed a discussion and vote on the article talk page. Everything was above board. This nom argued extremely hard in the last AfD, which closed less than a month ago, to save the article based on its encyclopedic content <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fuck_Truck" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fuck_Truck" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, calling it in one of his 12 posts "<i>a quite well written and well researched article</i>". Speaking about the article , he wrote: <i>"the term 'fuck truck' and the sexual connotations of this service needs to be a part of that final form"</i>. Well <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_Truck_44c0.html" title="Fuck Truck">Fuck Truck</a> still redirects to the article and the term is prominently mentioned in the first paragraph. However, it now seems that all this nom was interested in was having some kind of joke based on the lewd nickname for the bus. I say that while wikipedia is not for schoolyard jokes, it is for encyclopedic material and this bus was encyclopedic last month as the nom so passionately argued. That he is now changing his tune out of spite is no reason to slam the door on the bus or participate in a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">WP:Point</a>-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:53, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>::::<b>comment</b>: it is clear that you have not actually read my comments. I have repeatedly said that "fuck truck" should be retained because I believed it would grow to include information about other shuttles. I myself intended to get to work on this project when I became less busy. I have repeatedly said that it is this widespread usage, which, as I said, I hoped would be incorporated into this article, that created notability. A Wellesley-specific name seems to preclude the addition of information relevant to other schools. Thus, based on rationale for notability, the move to "Wellesley College Senate Bus" made this article non-notable. I have repeatedly stated this good faith rationale for nominating for deletion upon the name change and you have been part of the discussions in which I have said this. So, given that you have had this rationale for my behavior in front of you the whole time and have still made these accusations against me, I feel that I am justified in accusing you of making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:03, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</s><a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 04:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article seems fine, and it does look like a bad faith nom ("my way or nothing"). As it stands the article has a section on the use of the term at other colleges with a total of one example from a student web publication (as against <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <b>Boston Herald</b> for Wellesley). When there is more evidence of notability at other colleges (especially notabilty that extends beyond the students into the community) then consider moving the page back. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 23:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article might need some tweaking, but an article about a transportation service is certainly relevant (see <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humphrey_Go-Bart_548d.html" title="Humphrey Go-Bart">Humphrey Go-Bart</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitrans.html" title="Unitrans">Unitrans</a>, or even <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Buses_route_1_9a78.html" title="London Buses route 1">London Buses route 1</a>), particularly as this seems to have had media coverage. <a href="../../../r/x/u/User%7ERXUYDC_0144.html" title="User:RXUYDC">RXUYDC</a> 23:18, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Allow me to defend myself</b>: Please do not accuse me of bad faith. This is an unsubstiantiated <b>personal attack</b>. If you read my arguments throughout this process, you will see that I have consistently argued for inclusion on the basis that "fuck truck" is a general, non Wellesley-Harvard-MIT specific term (along, I admit, with other complementary rationales). I sincerely believe that an article about a general concept in collegiate humor (fuck truck) is notable while an article about a specific shuttle bus connecting three campuses is not. I have come to hold this view more strongly over the last couple of months, which explains my greater focus on this perspective and increased unwillingness (in my mind) to compromise. Please see my numerous good faith edits (including reverting vandalism) and stop hurling unfounded accusations at me.

<dd>I apologize for using the term "bad faith" given that you are sincere in your belief that this service is non-notable. From my point of view, "Fuck Truck" as a college neologism is not interesting <i>unless</i> it is attached to specifically notable examples. At the present time a generic article would be 98% about Wellesley and 2% about Byrn Mawr. Wellesley's transport service attracted considerable undesirable notariety that spilled over into the public eye; Byrn Mawr's use is (so far) only documented in a student web newsletter. If there are more examples, add them to the article, in detail if you like, and when the "other use" section outgrows the rest of the article it can be moved back. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a student at <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a> with a couple friends at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellesley_College_7f40.html" title="Wellesley College">Wellesley</a>, I can testify that the beloved fuck truck is a notable piece of the shared history of our two schools. Regardless, I think this article establishes a context for the discussion of social life at MIT and Wellesley. The focus of this article is partly about the aforementioned shuttle bus and partly about the (perceived) sexuality of students at the two schools. This assertion is backed by cited publications from various student groups, as well as the national magazine <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a>.
