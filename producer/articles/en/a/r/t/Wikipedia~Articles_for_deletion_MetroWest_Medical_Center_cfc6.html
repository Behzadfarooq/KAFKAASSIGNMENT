<ul>
<li>I think the real problem here is a failure to remember what, exactly, an encyclopedia is. An encyclopedia is a general reference work that highlights and synthesizes important people, places, things, and ideas. It is derived almost exclusively from secondary sources and provides an overview of the critical objects either in all fields of study, as in Britannica or Wikipedia, or in a specific area, such as the Encyclopedia of Military History. Inherent in an encyclopedia's mission to highlight and syntesize is the necessity of making distinctions between what is important and what is not, i.e. notability, which will always be a subjective decision, but one that every encyclopedia editor is called upon to make (in this case, the editors would be the entire wikipedia community). Now, there are many that say that wikipedia is not paper when they justify keeping trivial information, but this should not make wikipedia a junkyard. It is true that wikipedia can include far more information than a typical encyclopedia can, but I see this more as allowing us to go from the level of notable to the whole of human history, which is what Britannica focuses on, to the level of notable in every little sub-field of human exploration. Thus, we can have notable schools, hospitals, sports figures, congressmen, MPs, churches, authors, etc. that would be left out of Britannica for space reasons. If every hospital were to be included, however, then the entire point of an encyclopedia would be lost, for it would no longer be highlighting. An encyclopedia article needs to place its subject in proper context, and that is impossible when there is little distinction made between the subject and similar institutions. There is a reason that the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> page states that this is not a general database or a yellow pages: an encyclopedia highlights and synthesizes. If wikipedia were meant to include everything, there would not be a wiktionary or a wikisource, or a wikibooks, or any other wikiproject save this one. If wikipedia becomes a source for trivial information that is hard to keep up to date, verifiable, and accurate, or continues to have longer articles on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate then on Kaiser <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_I_of_Germany_8df0.html" title="Wilhelm I of Germany">Wilhelm I</a>, the scholarly community will never take it seriously and no one will use it as a reference for research. Thus, wikipedia would be a monumental failure. This is a thought that should cause stress for everybody on the project. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:00, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are indeed correct. The real problem here is a failure to remember what, exactly, an encyclopedia is. Encyclopedias were conceived and intended as organized compendia of <b>ALL</b> knowledge - not just "select" knowledge or so-called "notable" knowledge (whatever <i>that</i> is supposed to mean). Nothing has changed in the past several thousand years, other than the technological capacity to make real the actual intention of the early encyclopedists. Those who promote the notion that "some knowledge is more important than other knowledge" would do well to remember that "importance" is a largely subjective matter (as the above Star Wars vs Kaiser Wilhelm II example shows), and that it is right and proper that an evolving project such as Wikipedia reflect the concerns, interests and obsessions of those who create it and the times in which they live, rather than presenting itself as the informational equivalent of a constipated Victorian maiden aunt. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:06, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It resulted from the merger of the Framingham Union Hospital and a smaller hospital in Natick, which is the next town. It is run by a for-profit hospital corporation. In fact, there are news reports that it is up for sale, apparently because it isn't profitable enough. I'm not sure that it is a teaching hospital. On the direct route through the western Boston suburbs to Worcester, it probably is in fact the biggest hospital. People in my family have been there a few times, and, you know, it's just a typical suburban medium-to-large-sized hospital. But there are dozens of hospitals in the Boston area, of similar size or larger, several of which are world-famous. This is far from being one of the famous ones. It isn't a Mass General or Lahey Clinic.--<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:36, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
