<p>I am nominating this page for deletion because it is unencyclopedic and I feel the content is too biased to ever be redeemable. The writing of the article is done so as to make Mohammed to look like a saint, in propaganda form, and editors on the page have routinely and abusively edit warred to keep out any factual information that is not flattering to their "prophet." This is not a good thing for the encyclopedia and therefore should be deleted. Particularly problematic are a lack of reference to groups with which Mohammed later broke treaties, a lack of information on problems within the various documents themselves, and a continual claim that Muhammad was solely responsible for changes in the region which is not backed up by fact. The whole article is the same sort of rampant whitewashing of the military expansion of the Islamic lands and conversion by the sword which were Mohammed's primary methods. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 18:03, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The title of the page causes POV issues, as every event described on the page carries with it an accompanying debate about whether Muhammad was behaving "as a diplomat" in the given situation. By its title, the page asserts the POV that many of Muhammad's actions were fundamentally aspects of diplomacy-- contradicting the opposing POV that Muhammads actions were, say, military conquests or religious conversions. Merging into the other pages will allow us to present all POVs without asserting one over the other. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 21:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Editors have pointed out that one can show diplomatic skill without being a diplomat, for example, in setting a family quarrel.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The subject is too important not to have its own article. The name of the article only indicates the subject, not the conclusion that must be drawn about whatever diplomacy Muhammad may or may not have engaged in. POV problems alone aren't enough reason for deletion, and there's a different solution for that and for lack of sourcing. (Even if the article only had the Koran as a source, it would still be useful and it could always be improved.) We're going to have disputes over Islam no matter how we organize the articles about Muhammad. In a religion with <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>, the topic of Muhammad and diplomacy has got to deserve it's own article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Muhammad as a diplomat" might be construed by some as making him seem diplomatic when that seems to be in dispute.

<dd>most academics concur that there are numerous episodes where he assumed the role of diplomacy, whether that was with other rulers, other tribes, or even his own followers. your opinion seemingly remains unsupported by respected academics. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 11:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This claim is not supported by sources.

<dd>yet you yourself have conceded previously that a number of the events described in the article are indeed examples of diplomacy. academics consider things like the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a> and the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Hudaybiyya_09f8.html" title="Treaty of Hudaybiyya">Treaty of Hudaybiyya</a> as examples of Muhammad's diplomacy/political aptitude. if there is a particular academic POV you think is missing, you have yet to specify (and have not done so for a number of months). <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a misrepresentation of my views. In particular, I've always insited that the passage from one source talking about his "diplomatic skill" supposedly showed in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Medina_75b9.html" title="Constitution of Medina">Constitution of Medina</a> was not about <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">diplomacy</a> as conducting international negotiations. That was a figurative passage taken out of context. You seem to admit, though, the rest of the article does not have even such a flimsy basis. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 13:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b> - what's next? Christ as a Masseuse? This would be very appropriate and thought-provoking on an Islamic or Theologic wiki, but I can't really justify it on Wikipedia without justifying a lot of other esoterica. --Action Jackson IV 04:25, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</s> After review, I'm going to go with <b>Delete or substantially rewrite</b> - the primary sources / documentary evidence should definitely be elaborated upon. I'm still not wholly convinced that this is not Original Research, nor am I convinced in the factual accuracy. As such, the tone of the article should strive to present this as a school of thought (as opposed to historic fact) until convincing documentary evidence can prove otherwise.

<dd>Itaqallah, informing a relatively small number of people (especially if they've edited the article in the past -- and I'm not going to bother to find out) is not against policy and is only "controversial" to a degree. Keep in mind there's no demonstrable consensus here for delete, so relax. I know it's easier said than done, but turn the heat down, keep cool, and you might find you like the ultimate results: likely an improved article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 18:53, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b> While your initial point may be true, I'm relunctant to vote to remove an entire article because of POV. It is sourced and has a good deal of material that should be included in some form. If there is a difficulty in the POV area and your edits are being locked out through numbers, a NPOV tag should be applied instead of deletion and hopefully over time a balanced presentation can be achieved. 66.75.8.138 03:37, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>lets see- the opening sentence, for example. The mention of verse 48:18, the giving excessive weight to the "convert to Islam" letters Muhammad sent (which has little to do with diplomacy). The article also depicts Muhammad's enemies as evil, which is very POV pushing. Anything relevant in the other sections has already been mentioned in the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> article. The article is very POV pushing indeed. --<a href="../../../s/e/f/User%7ESefringle_0106.html" title="User:Sefringle">Sefringle</a> 00:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>i see nothing wrong with the opening sentence.</li>
<li>communicating with other heads of state is diplomacy, plain and simple.</li>

<li>"<i>The article also depicts Muhammad's enemies as evil</i>" that's a very general statement. please be more specific.</li>
<li>you haven't argued what academic opinions have been neglected, you have simply outlined issues where the article is not in conformity with your viewpoint. as you may understand, that is subjective judgement. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What I mean by muhammads enemies are depicted as evil is this article gives the impression muhammads enemies were violent, war starters who treated the muslims like dirt, while saying Muhammad tried to work with the muslims. That claim is very POV pushing, as it is trying to instill sympathy for muslims. The opening sentence further helps push foreward that POV.

<dd>i'm getting the feeling that when you say "POV pushing", you actually mean "not in conformity with my POV". i didn't know an academic publication, perhaps the most comprehensive and scholarly on this subject, would be regarded as "POV pushing" also. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 12:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>outside comment: Taking count, the tally was 8 "keep", 4 "delete", with substantial and not unjustified questions of vote-stacking given that EVERY keep vote just "happened" to be a Muslim editor at that point, at the time when a Muslim editor filed a very bad-faith "SNOW" justification to try to quick close it. This continues to present time: 90% of the "keep" votes are former members of the supposedly disbanded Wikiproject Islam: The Muslim Guild. These users are now trying to attack those who are voting the other way.
