<p>I propose that this article is unsalvageable original research. It begins with a shaky premise (namely, failing to define "flop" or to defend use of the word from accusations of original research and opinion) and has since become a dumping ground for everybody to add what they <i>think</i> is a "flop", regardless of a) whether it actually was, b) if there's a source to confirm it, or c) if it's status as a "flop" meaningfully contributes to its notability. The article is written and indeed structured in an unencyclopedic gossipy tone with innapropriate editorial comments after nearly EVERY entry. There is no attempt at providing references. Furthermore, adding a reference to each entry (which I don't believe will ever happen) will merely make this a list of "things that one source or another has referred to as a flop," which is in indiscriminate-list territory. Please don't be swayed by the fact that a lot of people have spent a lot of time turning this into a humungous list. It is fundamentally flawed and at the very least should be blanked and started from scratch with specific criteria and citations for every entry. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 04:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> to Mr.Dolomite — Unfortunately, there might be a variety of definitions for flop, none of them crystal clear. The intro had stated it alright, IMO — "(shows or other entertainment forms) that had high expectations, large amounts of money or widespread publicity, but fell far short of success." That might be the crux of the problem — what one constitutes a "flop" might be a "success" to another, hence the disagreement spoken of. Believe it or not, there may be people out there that thought the Edsel (the poster child for "flop") was a complete success; there's probably some people who think that the non-NFL leagues (i.e., XFL) were successes, although I think that one could easily be verifiable. I think that there are some entries that are verifiable (e.g., newspaper stories detailing a highly anticipated show's sudden cancellation), but the list just seemed to multiply on its own with entries that may or may not actually have been flops. After all, some shows were simply "failures" (e.g., a show that probably was not critically expected to succeed in the first place and didn't), and not all TV shows or other entertainment programs are expected to succeed. That's where the problem with this article lies; this article contains both flops and failures. If this article is re-created, then the article needs to contain only flops and <i>perhaps</i> the spectacular failure (e.g., those shows that were cancelled after one broadcast, such as "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_in_the_Picture_06c2.html" title="You're in the Picture">You're in the Picture</a>," which is verifiable), but definitely not general failures. The inclusion of general failures made this article a flop, IMO!&#160;;-) [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)]] (P.S., sorry for the rant, but had to explain everything).</dd>
