<li><b>Comment</b> (Note, my employer was previously in this space, but does not market itself that way any longer.) Any proven copy-vios where it is proven that the other version is oldeer should, of course, be removed... but to prove such a copy-vio will be an arduous task, as you must ascertain the original date of the relevant content in both places.

<li><b>Delete</b>: even if it isn't a copyvio, it strikes me as original research and borderline advertising. I am unconvinced that "customer relations management" isn't just an excessively abstract jargon phrase for "keeping your customers in a database," only here this mundane process is described with halo words like "holistic." Prior versions of the article were full vacuous prose such as "In today's competitive business environment. . .": but the closer it gets to plain English, the less seems to be there. Vizjim's remarks suggests that those who speak of "customer relations management" are <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlatan.html" title="Charlatan">charlatans</a>, and nothing here really suggests otherwise. There is an awful lot of this sort of buzzword-laden process cruft in business articles recently, and we need to draw a line somewhere. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:44, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Some time ago, someone added the following text to the article:
<dl>
<dd><i>There is not much new about CRM, it is just a piece of new jargon with some useful, money making, side effects. First it lets a load of academics and consultants pontificate about nothing and pretend they have invented a new discipline. Second we can write lots of expensive software to help you "do" CRM. Of course astute business men have applied the concept of “customer relationship management” for hundreds, probably thousands of years. Ever since they recognised the value of a special relationship - “To you my boy I got a special price for this flint axe, not even two cows, ‘cause you buy so many of these fine weapons it is just one cow and a bushel of gain.”</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Obviously, this needs to be reworded before being reincluded into the article, but it does suggest that my perception of the kind of prose in the article is not completely idiosyncratic. When an article is proposed for deletion, I tend to go through a two step process. First, is the subject worthy of an article? I am defiantly liberal about this step. Second, is the existing text at the page helpful to someone who wants to whip it into a good article? I have had my eye on this article for some time now, and I am still not convinced that it is. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I agree with you on those two points. It is clear that much of the article has either been written by industry wonks who are full of marketing fluff, else cynics. There is a middle road. I'm not willing to re-write the article, so I guess my argument for notability is strong but myu argument for keeping the article is inherently weak. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:13, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>. I don't know enough about the topic to tell what or how much of the current content of the article is BS, which is why I'm not going to cast a vote on this one, but I think the subject itself is keep-worthy. <a href="../../../y/v/h/User%7EYvh11a_6048.html" title="User:Yvh11a">Yvh11a</a> 00:00, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Really obvious KEEP</b> extremely notable concept - known to most in the corporate world by now. I'm honestly not sure if it is a copyvio or not, though. <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">RN</a> 10:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
