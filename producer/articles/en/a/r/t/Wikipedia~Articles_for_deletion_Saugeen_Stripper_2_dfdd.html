<p>After a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Saugeen_Stripper_03c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper">disputed first nomination</a>, this article was closed as a no consensus, but deleted out-of-process by another admin. As the first close was controversial (the closer, for example, counted two accounts with very few edits, which is almost always a bad idea, and there was a clear majority for deletion that was borderline rough consensus), and there was support for a relist at DRV, I am relisting this now. My vote is <b>delete</b>, as its basically a news story that isn't even really newsworthy, much less encyclopedic. Although there is support for a <b>merge/redirect</b> to the residence hall where the even took place (<a href="../../../s/a/u/Saugeen-Maitland_Hall_2602.html" title="Saugeen-Maitland Hall">Saugeen-Maitland Hall</a>), which I can live with (the merge has already been done). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Just for the record, the result of the previous AFD was "no consensus," and actually had 11 delete votes vs. 7 keeps. --<a href="../../../n/a/h/User%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_91cc.html" title="User:Nahallac Silverwinds">Naha</a>|<sup><a href="../../../n/a/h/User_talk%7ENahallac_Silverwinds_c8bb.html" title="User talk:Nahallac Silverwinds">(talk)</a></sup> 22:45, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So? 11 vs 7 is no consensus which is exactly what DES said. 70.21.144.18 00:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, most admins would have discounted 2 votes, making it 6 to 10, and remember it's not just about the votes. Some admins don't give as much credence to users who say exactly the same thing on every AFD.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Keep, delete, merge, redirect, any of the above. Will Wikipedia be worse if this is kept? Not by much. Will Wikipedia be worse if this is deleted? Not by much.

<li>I disagree. The question is not whether "will this article change Wikipedia much" but "will all articles like this one change Wikipedia much". If we start having 1 article for 1 event that makes a national newspaper, that will hurt Wikipedia (note that we have Wikinews for things like this). Keeping an article is a precendent that will affect next AfD discussions. That's why I think we should delete this article <i>and</i> move to writing articles that we really need. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 12:41, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous AfD. Notable event (where notable is used in the NPOV sense), merging not appropriate as this event is more well-known than the hall.

<li><b>Delete</b> - The incident itself is marginally notable and worthy of mention in other articles, but it's not worthy of its own entire page. I disagree with having a wikipedia article for every temporary headline, and this is obviously just a short-term story that got passed around because it had pictures of a naked girl. The only way I would vote keep on this would be if the incident turns out in the future to have longer-lasting repercussions, such as being the subject of a book, or leading to a major lawsuit, new legislation or some newsworthy change to school policy. For example, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a> did a small thing by just not giving up her seat on a bus, but it had large consequences and was definitely encyclopedic. As it stands though, this article does not meet that standard for me. Keep its history, but redirect the page. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 04:19, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
