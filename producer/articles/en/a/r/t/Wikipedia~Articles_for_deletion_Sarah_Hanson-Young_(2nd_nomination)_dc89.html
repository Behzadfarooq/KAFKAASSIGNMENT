<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There are too many Green Party Wikipedians to ever allow this article or ones like it to be deleted. So let's leave it aliveand concentrate on improving other articles. Pardon the cynicism, but we had this debate last time and also with similar Green candidates (for example <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Parker_0a26.html" title="Jamie Parker">Jamie Parker</a> or <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kaye_7219.html" title="John Kaye">John Kaye</a>), and there's no point rehashing it. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 10:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are clearly notable people, clearly non-notable people, and then there are those in between. With political candidates of marginal significance, there's a trend towards supporters (or possible detractors) of that candidate writing articles for them. Isn't this a form of systematic bias? Another problem is that the articles often lack citations of non-vanity reliable sources. Any flaws in unreliable sources (or people working from memory) are likely to affect the article. Currently, Hanson's article does not cite reliable sources (it merely lists mentions in the media), and Rishworth only cites one reliable source. In future, if everybody just cited reliable sources for everything they wrote, it won't end up in tears. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 01:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reliable sources to cite are right there in the article. The fact that they haven't yet been woven into the text of the article is immaterial here. We are merely concerned with notability here. The sources can be woven in as citations at any time.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, gaining a minor-party nomination twice doesn't make you notable, especially if you fail the first time.

<li>My local primary school has an article in the local paper <i>every week</i>, summarising the various goings-on. This does not make that school notable. Likewise, anyone standing for a candidacy in a state election is probably going to have a couple of cursory, local news items produced about them, yet unless the person is somehow otherwise notable, this doesn't set them apart from the pack. If we include this individual, then we might as well create an article on every Green, Democrat, Family First and One Nation candidate out there ever, because I'm sure they've all received at least some coverage. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 06:47, 18 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, notability is not about fame, nor whether one wins or loses an election. Plenty of sources are cited for a decent article to be possible, and that's what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> <i>is</i> intended to assure. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 07:56, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Meets WP:BIO full stop. I started to clean up the article, but online references are difficult to find. Information given can be confirmed in snippets only. Nonetheless, there is now one reference (two, if the Amnesty International site that confirms her employment is taken into consideration) and an expanded article. At some point, the primary editor has blanked out the beginning of a much better article including information about why the Australia Day Award was bestowed, presumably because he or she could not cite online references (See the page editor for this text). My feeling is this article can be improved.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This article is as notable as those for similar Green Party activists <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Leong_2767.html" title="Jenny Leong">Jenny Leong</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Risstrom_9227.html" title="David Risstrom">David Risstrom</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kaye_7219.html" title="John Kaye">John Kaye</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Parker_0a26.html" title="Jamie Parker">Jamie Parker</a>. I believe all of them fail <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> because they rely on the outcome of a future event to secure their claim to notability. At the same time, all of them have enough genuine supporters to prevent consensus on AfD.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming good faith from all sides, this suggests that the notability guidelines on candidates (as opposed to elected officials) needs amending to allow inclusion of pages for major figures in minor parties, regardless of whether they have held office. It could be argued that these figures are activists who succeed in delivering social change and have a far greater impact than major party backbenchers who win office and are never heard from again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even this doesn't justify <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Parker_0a26.html" title="Jamie Parker">Jamie Parker</a> who is not even a candidate. But let's leave that aside. We'll never get consensus on deleting these articles. The extensive debate would be better directed at considering the notability guidelines instead of arguing 'angels on the head of a pin' things like whether we can find a source for Ms Hanson-Young's Amnesty International job. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 01:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The subjects of these articles would easily be considered notable if they were elected. They haven't been and we are speculating that they might be to justify the articles. If Ms Hanson-Young was not a Senate candidate with a chance of election, there would be absolutely nothing in her article to indicate notability. So - she is potentially notable because a future event might make her notable.

<dd>Please note I am not arguing to delete the article. I don't think it meets the notability guidelines, but there are plenty of people who disagree, and have successfully disagreed on similar AfD's for other minor party candidates. Wikipedia is the sum of its editors - if there is a continued and vehement consensus to retain articles that fail guidelines, perhaps the guidelines need review.</dd>

<dd>P.P.S. For an extreme example, look at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Robinson_a0a7.html" title="Helen Robinson">Helen Robinson</a>, whose only claim to fame is being a veterinarian and getting 6% in an election. The sources are fine - a source for the profession is unnecessary and the election result is sourced to the VEC. Despite that, it fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> because Ms Robinson's prfession and political history have had no impact that would justify a page. Despite that, the article would survive any number of AfD's because certain minor party candidates have a great deal of good faith support in Wikipedia. So perhaps <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> needs changing to better reflect what the Wikipedia community thinks is notable. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 05:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A person's <i>impact</i> has nothing to do with whether (s)he is notable. A subject's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">nontrivial secondary source coverage</a> determines whether or not it is a notable and appropriate encyclopedia subject. In this case, the person has been covered nontrivially in multiple reliable sources. That's <i>all</i>. If other candidates have received a ton of source coverage but had little "impact", they're notable. If yet others had a lot of "impact" but received only trivial coverage, they're not. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 06:06, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we disagree - a person's impact on politics, culture, history, religion, academia, medicine, whatever, is what I would measure notability by, not the number of newspaper mentions we can find on Google. Genuine "impact" will inevitably generate coverage, which will allow the article to be sourced. But not every newspaper mention is notable - just because we can source something doesn't qualify it for an article.</dd>
