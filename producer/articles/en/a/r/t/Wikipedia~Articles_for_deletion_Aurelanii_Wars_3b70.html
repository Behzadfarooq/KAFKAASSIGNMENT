<p>Completely historically inacurate and totally unverifiable. Appears to be either original research or fan fiction.

<li>I, the author, with a PHD in History have asked in my last comment for you to delete the article and yet you still rail on and on and on and on. Have any of you ever been to these places? Read first hand accounts on the pages they first were written? As i've said before, i saw a void in your little web page and tried to fill it. As i see now, this is not a place for knowledge, but for the same old Roman record keeping garbage that has stifled our knowledge of history for centuries. I suppose i could wait until the book is released and then cite it as "proof". Would that make you morons feel better? While i was in the second world war, there was no proof of genocide taking place. For years afterward, there was no proof that FDR suppressed this proof. Now there is no proof that the Jews have any historical claim to Israel. Have fun on your flat-empirical world, young fellows. I will soon be in Switzerland beginning my next book (of lies i suppose) on the Gallic War. Keep in mind that they pay me to research and write this stuff. How much do you earn to blindly dispute it? <i>unsigned comment by 68.59.230.134</i>

<li>hi. I'm a long time user and a first time poster. Maybe i'm a little "green", but didn't the author request that his post be deleted? Do you guys just like to run things into the ground? I'm not trying to be snotty or rude but haven't you got better things to do than wave your intellectual cocks in the air? I was writing a paper on Britain during the dark ages and wound up side tracked by this stupid argument. True: a few things in the article aren't credible, but this is far from the first page i've seen here that ignore facts or create new theories. Also i have read many books on the subject of King Arthur that support the idea that Magnus was the father of Constantine III. I cannot cite the sources-don't have time-and don't really care. Whenever i look something up on Wikidpedia, i always double check it. Maybe you guys should do your own homework or take the advice of the old guy who wrote this entry and delete it without further discussion. Surely you all have something better to do. Or maybe not. <i>unsigned comment by 68.59.230.134</i>
<ul>
<li>Nice try, but did you notice the article history preserves the IP address of everyone who edits an article? Surely <i>you</i> have better things to do than attempt to fake messages to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 00:00, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this is fiction, it needs deleting. On the other hand, if it is verifiable original research (ie a proper radical redaction of established sources) then surely it deserves a place, albeit marked in some way as theory-not-absolute-fact. Otherwise, havign read the article, I am moved to take issue with <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuralyov_a64e.html" title="User:Kuralyov">Kuralyov</a>'s comment about "Not a shred of accuracy" since quite an amount of this is generally-accepted fact in England, and much of the rest accords with one among a number of radical re-readings of Dark Age history which relocate Arthur to Scotland and make the people in the northern part of ther island substantially more civilized than Caesar and his kith were willing to give credit for. Sorry for rant. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 06:56, 18 May 2005 (UTC)--
<ul>
<li>Any attempts to relocate Arthur to the north of England/Scotland is merely an attempt at aggrandizement for the people of those areas. There is simply too much evidence putting him in the south, and not enough for him to be in the north. An Arthur-like person, or one of the bases for Arthur, maybe, but not <i>the</i> Arthur, if he existed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And as for the Picts being more civilized than was thought: they did not have centralized government, standardized religion or language, or codified law; they did not scult, paint murals, write down their legends; they did not try to build lasting cities on purpose. I think the Romans had them beat.</p>
<p>"Radical re-readings" are interesting, but there is a reason they're called "radical."<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuralyov_a64e.html" title="User:Kuralyov">Kuralyov</a> 10:37, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> Although I haven't the time to check every point here, as far as I can judge this is not a complete invention by the author, it appears to be an uncritical regurgitation of some accounts of the time of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Arthur_40ce.html" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> written centuries after the event, mainly by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth_8be6.html" title="Geoffrey of Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, but regarded by historians as extremely unreliable. (I know this because among other things I read a couple of 20th century historical novels about <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merlin.html" title="Merlin">Merlin</a> by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Stewart_1962.html" title="Mary Stewart">Mary Stewart</a> loosely based on Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the recent film <i>Merlin</i> with <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Bonham_Carter_f389.html" title="Helena Bonham Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a> as Morgan Le Fay also incorporates elements from Geoffrey.) However the article is not salvagable, so delete, and anything useful should be put in the articles on Geoffrey of Monmouth or some of the characters mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 11:32, 2005 May 20 (UTC)</p>
