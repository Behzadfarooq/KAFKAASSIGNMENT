</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>. Discounting sockpuppets, anons, and new users, I see roughly a little less than 3:1 ratio in favour of deletion, which IMO is right on the borderline between keeping and deleting. I have to be honest and say that I find the arguments for deletion to be a little better than the arguments for keep. However given that this is right on the borderline, and the credo of AFD is <i>when in doubt, keep</i>, I must close this as no consensus. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">athphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 03:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The given reason is: "Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety." This page is only here to announce that this person alleges that they slept with a celebrity, and went on to announce that in many places. Frankly this looks like an attempt on that persons part to advertise their "claim to fame". We do not keep pages for every bimbo that slept with every celebrity out there, no matter how fascinating the tabloids think that this is.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a place for breaking news stories either. Especially ones that have ONLY been substantiated by the original claimant. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichigan_user_5764.html" title="User:Michigan user">Michigan user</a> 18:51, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Comment</b> His allegations, as well as his now marginal claim to fame as a gay porn star are notable, however much they may disgust you. This is not a "breaking news story" either. The first published references to the allegations are over a month old now. There is other biographical information included on Paulus in the article as well where sourceable. The bulk of the article is on the allegations, but that is a large part of his notoriety. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERabinid_343d.html" title="User:Rabinid">Rabinid</a> 19:45, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps Paulus' intentions were such. That is not up to us to decide. What matters is that he has come forward with a claim, and that that claim has reached some notability or notoriety. Whether the claim is true or not, and for what reasons Paulus has come forward is irrelevant for the notability of the issue and of John Paulus. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 23:26, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What makes Barresi interesting is that a similar discussion to this decided to exise the Travolta scandal from the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Barresi_3538.html" title="Paul Barresi">Paul Barresi</a> page - a far more sinister act of censorship and "spin" than leaving the scandal in. It's a very basic rule of journalism - it's Clay Aitken's job to refute the claim (which he as not done) and it's not Wikipedia's job to pretend it was either never made or published. (In both cases, frankly.) I would suggest trimming the John Paulus article and leaving a brief mention of the Aitken scandal in both his and Aitken's entries.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is NOT Clay Aiken's job to refute the claim. It is John Paulus' job to prove the claim. Paulus has not come close to proving anything. Until then Clay is the victim. Which is exactly why no mainstream publication is willing to touch this, and Wikipedia should not either. Of course as soon as Clay comments at all to defend himself - then he becomes fair game for the mainstream press - and he effectively increases the damages exponentially. In the cases of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katelyn_Faber_2bac.html" title="Katelyn Faber">Katelyn Faber</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gennifer_Flowers_bfc2.html" title="Gennifer Flowers">Gennifer Flowers</a> the mainstream press provided considerable coverage, making it notable for Wikipedia. 66.82.9.86 00:19, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How are you defining mainstream publication? And on what grounds do you say none of them were "willing to touch it"? The story has been reported in major Australian and British newspapers, the New York Daily News, the New York Post, the Contra-Costa Times, the Buffalo News, the Denver Post, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Portland Mercury, the Louisville Courier-Journal.com, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Arizona Republic, plus the respected online journal Salon, and it has been carried by the AP and KRT wire services to the networks of smaller newspapers they serve.

<dd>I don't think anyone is suggesting that it be recorded in the Aiken/Paulus entries as proven fact, but I think it would be inaccurate to delete the controversy from the record. Fact: John Paulus has gone public with a claim. Fact: major media outlets around the world have reported it. That's called a scandal, and like most scandals (from Keeler to Lewinsky and beyond) it doesn't stand on firm factual ground, because it is subject to claim and counter claim. To pretend the scandal doesn't exist would be either naive or - worse - a sort of censorship, either because some Wikipedia users are Aiken fans, or narrow-minded. To be frank (with apologies to <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">User:Katefan0</a> who clearly believes that anyone with less than 100,000 Wikipedia edits to their name should belong to a silent sub-class) the Paulus entry should be tidied down to the barest details of the claim, the extent of its reportage and its status as proven/disproven, and it should be noted in the Aiken entry.

<dd>Whether John Paulus proves the claim and whether it is true, is irrelevant for wikipedia. What matters is that Paulus has come forward with a claim, and that the claim has received some level of notability. That's the only thing that counts. Not the motives of the article's creator, and not the truthfulness of the claim. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 18:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I believe that this publication should maintain a higher standard. I refer you to the Aiken talk page, where attempts to insert Paulus' allegations began immediately upon publication. Even now, the story is not yet a month old. Six months from now, will anyone even remember John Paulus? The introduction of sockpuppets to this situation makes it even more suspect. It appears that there are a few people who wish to use Wikipedia as a means of promoting Paulus' career and/or to taint Aiken's.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia is not in the business of tabloid news. If this story enters the pages of Wikipedia, it should be as a complete arc, not as a part of some sort of on-going "daily news" style process. There are other outlets for that kind of thing. -<a href="../../../j/m/h/User%7EJmh123_f81e.html" title="User:Jmh123">Jmh123</a> 19:56, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is indeed not in the business of tabloid news, but it is also not in the business of opinionizing on public issues. If someone comes forward with a claim about a notable person (like Gennifer Flowers or Katelyn Faber have done before) and that claim reaches notability (as evidenced by the media who have taken up on this claim), it becomes notable enough for wikipedia. Even if the claim proves to be false and the claimant is an attention whore. But I most strongly and vehemently agree with you on the indesirability of possible sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry in this AfD. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 23:07, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So is that what the qualification is?? If a story gets published in 5 or 10 (or whatever number you pick) tabloids and gossip columns, then it is valid for entry into Wikipedia?? Because there is a LOT of trash out there that meets that qualification, and you would be opening the door. Just saying . . . 66.82.9.58 20:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point in fact: People magazine just published THIS WEEK: "Who's your favorite American Idol?' Clay 69%, Kelly 27%, Fantasia 4%". MSNBC just put Clay on their "IT" list YESTERDAY <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4043608/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4043608/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> with the quote "With American Idol trouncing the Olympics and all other comers in the ratings, it is no suprise that <b>the most popular "Idol" contestant in the shows history</b> made our "IT" list. Now that he is on it, will we ever be able to get him off. Claymates do your worst". Apparently MSNBC does not think that Paulus has had the least little effect on Clay's popularity.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how a popularity poll influences the debate one way or the other. Wikipedia's own (current) definition of a sex scandal is "a scandal in which a public figure becomes embroiled in a situation where embarrassing sexual activities (or allegations of them) are publicized". Wikipedia even maintains a "list of sex scandals". It should also be pointed out there is a precedent for this debate ... in 2001 porn actor Chad Slater/Kyle Bradford claimed he had slept with Tom Cruise. That got widespread reportage "in gossip columns" and newspapers/tv/radio, and it is not only listed on the Tom Cruise page, Kyle Bradford has a Wikipedia entry of <i>his</i> own. If nothing else, Wikipedia should be consistent within itself. (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoby_3650.html" title="User:Whoby">Whoby</a> 00:43, 26 February 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>I agree that popularity is not an issue. The references were in response to Rabinids "repercussions extending to Aiken's career" logic. My point was that Paulus so far has NOT caused any repercussions (as evidenced by the People and MSNBC references) - and therefore Rabinids references have nothing to do with whether or not the Paulus article should or should not be kept. The Kyle Bradford comparison is faulty because Tom Cruise actually SUED, which was reported in mainstream news and made it notable. So far Paulus is just a pesky gnat being ignored by most of the world - not real news. 66.82.9.58 01:00, 26 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Given it's widespread reportage (Google it) I think your assertion that it's not "real" news is incorrect. Who are you to judge? The horse has bolted on that one - it's had wide dissemination in the news media, therefore it's news, full stop. (Perhaps not your kind of news, or just not news you like, but it's still news.) My point is this: it fulfils Wikipedia's own definition of a sex scandal, and there are comparable precedents (big name + pesky gnat) already on record in Wikipedia ... Tom Cruise/Kyle Bradford, Paula Abdul/Corey Clark etc. If you exise Paulus, then you have to exise every other unproven party in a sex scandal. If not, then it should not only be restored to the Aiken article, but frankly, it should be added to the "list of sex scandals".
