<p>The result was <b>keep</b>, but remove any and all unsourced or poorly sourced entries as per <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> (if such is the case), and don't put them back until you find adequate references. The arguments presented for deleting this list are accompanied by the suggestion of dumping everything into a category, which would darken the situation from imperfect to incurable. Remember that it is not possible to add footnotes to an automatically generated category page, which, in isolation and at face value, may be interpreted as libelous. Controversial classifications, especially of people, should be handled by properly cited lists, rather than by categories. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 19:55, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating this article for deletion. Most of listed names are not sourced and listing them does not meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Jimbo has said that calling someone a "porn star" without providing a source is something that should be removed from Wikipedia articles. Everyone who should be on a list like this and meets the sourcing rules for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for living persons should be listed in the gay porn stars category which already has many more verified names than this list. WP doesn't need two different lists on the same subject (even if one is called a category). The category is better. So it is the one that should be kept. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 00:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Pointless, the list adds nothing that wouldn't be done better by a category. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../p/a/d/User_talk%7EPaddles_d91c.html" title="User talk:Paddles">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paddles_cfed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paddles">C</a></sub> 02:27, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The <font color="#FF6600">List of gay porn stars</font> <font color="#660000">article</font> is separate and distinct from the <font color="#FF6600">Gay porn stars</font> <font color="#660000">category</font>; the category does not duplicate the information in the article. The article is a list of <i>names</i>; the category is a list of <i>articles</i>. Articles haven't been written about each performer on the list; one of the uses of the list is to identify articles which need to be written.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The veracity of the names on the list can be checked against the reference sources listed on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk.html" title="Talk">Talk:List of gay porn stars</a> page. That list of sources can be moved to an "External links" or "References" section at the bottom of the main article if need be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the names on the list are familiar to those who are interested in gay pornography. While organizing and reformatting the list recently, I searched on several names that I didn't recognize and deleted them from the list if I couldn't find videographies or reliable information for them. This is ongoing work; the article is closely monitored by several different editors and attempts at vandalism are reverted.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - one of the reasons for having the list is to show articles that need to be written; removing the names that don't have already have entries defeats the purpose of the list.

<dd>If you check the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_gay_porn_stars_a5c3.html" title="Talk:List of gay porn stars">Talk:List of gay porn stars</a> page, you'll see that the consensus was to de-wikilink names for which articles didn't exist to remove all the red links, but leave the names to show which articles were still needed.</dd>
<dd>Creating stubs isn't the solution, either; they get deleted before they have a chance to be developed. In the case of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_Torres_%28porn_star%29_8ede.html" title="Manuel Torres (porn star)">Manuel Torres (porn star)</a>, the page was tagged with an AfD (never mind a ProD) 1 hour and 12 minutes after it was started (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Manuel_Torres_%28porn_star%29_546c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Manuel Torres (porn star)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Manuel Torres (porn star)</a>).</dd>
<dd><b>Bottom line.</b> It's either "Keep" or "Delete"; removing the names from the list that don't already have articles duplicates the category and renders the list useless.<font color="#FF6600">â€”</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 03:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A <b>guideline</b> for porn stars is developing at <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>; however, bear in mind that <i>notability</i> is not required by any Wikipedia <i>policy</i>.<font color="#FF6600">â€”</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 00:27, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, if some content in the article violates some WP rule, remove it; we don't remove the whole article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 20:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with this argument is simple. To fix the policy violations we have to remove all the names that aren't verified by the list's article. Right now that's all the names if you read the policy strictly. If you read the policy in a looser way, the blue-linked names can be kept because the articles should be verified. But that leaves a list that's either the same as the category, or it has even fewer names. If we fix the list to meet the WP:BIO policy it's redundant with the category. If we're not going to fix the list, the article can't stay. So either way it should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 22:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. What exactly would "fix" the list? The list explicitly defines who is listed: "male pornographic actors who appear in gay films". The header goes on to say that no claim is being made about the sexual orientation of anyone on the list. If the actor is listed in the cast of a movie and has sex with another man in that movie, he qualifies for the list. Cast lists are available at the links that are provided in the "See also" section of the page. I've copied two of the sites that were listed on the talk page to this section. Some of the sites allow you to search by an actor's name and retrieve a list of films that he is in; a commercial site may only list films that they have in stock. (tlavideo also lists films that are not available.) So where's the verifiability problem?<font color="#FF6600">â€”</font><a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChidom_6af4.html" title="User:Chidom"><font color="#FF6600"><b>Chidom</b></font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/i/User_talk%7EChidom_7139.html" title="User talk:Chidom"><font color="#660000"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a>&#160; 00:05, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because the names must be individually sourced. Just listing outside sites and saying "look him up there" isn't good enough. Jimbo Wales has said solid sourcing for claiming somebody is a porn star (gay or straight) is "absolutely imperative." That's why I say WP should <b>keep the category</b> and <b>delete the list</b>. The category names are supposed to be verified already since they're in articles. All those unlinked names in the list aren't WP:verified -- they need specific, reliable citations. At least one of those outside sites is useless -- it just gives a not-alphabetized list of names. (All the As are together, but not in order, etc.) Another links to semispam sites with no way of proving that the names match the pictures. I get spam all the time about porn with Jennifer Lopez, Allysa Milano, etc. The pages are there, the porn pix are there -- but the pictures aren't JLo or Milano. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHullaballoo_Wolfowitz_1fda.html" title="User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz">The editor formerly known as Harmonica Wolfowitz</a> 18:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
