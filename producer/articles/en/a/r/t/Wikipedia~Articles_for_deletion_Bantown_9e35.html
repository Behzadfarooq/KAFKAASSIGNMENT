<dd>Dear Sam, if I may call you that. Please note if I have added a reference to this article. It's from the online edition of an American newspaper called the Washington Post. Perhaps you could let me know if this would be considered reliable. I didn't add it before because as far as I am concerned Slashdot is a more important news source than what is presumably a local newspaper.

<dd>The trouble with that article is that it says <i>"An established hacker group known as "Bantown" claimed responsibility"</i>. Even if it had said that they had carried out a single attack on LiveJournal, that would be very shaky grounds for notability, being only a single event - <i>claiming</i> to carry one out is almost non-existant. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Sam. I would love to know your real reasons for wanting to delete this article. I don't understand your objection to the 'claim of reponsibility'. Perhaps your unaware that hacking Livejournal was an illegal act, and that so far no successful convictions have been brought against the perpetrators. Perhaps you can explain the distinction between claims of reponsibility and actual responsibility implicit in the words "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". The facts remain
<ul>
<li>This article contains multiple references to news reporting of incidents involving Bantown</li>
<li>They are not all from one source</li>
<li>They do not all refer to a single incident</li>
<li>They include well-known and respected sources such as slashdot.org and the Washington Post</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Consequently any nomination based on non-notability is abusive. The fact that this AfD nomination is being ballot-stuffed by IP-based users who have no other edits on record is further evidence of this abuse. <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EVia_strass_3093.html" title="User:Via strass">Via strass</a> 21:20, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Sam, I have taken the liberty of quoting form Kotepho's comment referenced by you:
<ul>
<li>Can an AFD be closed based on the weight of arguments instead of numbers? The answer is obviously yes, in some cases. I don't think anyone really cares that 'votes' from (sock|meat)puppets and new users are regularly ignored. If 20 people vote keep, but one person points out it is a copyright violation, can it be deleted? <b>If 20 people vote delete because of lack of sources, and one person finds mentions in the NYTimes and Washington Post, can it be kept? I say yes.</b> While this closure is not as clear-cut as these other cases, I do not see it as being egregiously out of line. If they cannot, we should get rid of "NOT a democracy" and move AFD back to VFD. Thus, I do not think arguing this on procedural grounds has much merit. [emphasis mine]</li>

<p>Notability or non-notability aside (and I lean towards non-notable) of the subject, this article itself is a wreck. I vote delete until someone is willing to give this group more than just lip-service; perhaps then we can see whether they belong in the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.92.130.57.html" title="User:66.92.130.57">66.92.130.57</a> 02:03, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Not notable enough yet for an encyclopedia. One successful attack on a blogging site isn't exactly making hacker history. When they graduate to hacking Pentagon computer systems, pull some amazing stunts revealing the truth about secret alien technologies at Area 51 that get headlines around the world, which eventually leads to all the bantown members receiving long prison sentences, then we can reconsider <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thousands of blogs were defaced and had their emails changed to bantown(wildcard) at mailinator or spam.la. There are still some of the defacements up as well as comment crapfloods from hacked accounts on the relevant news posts. The Slashdot story even has someone comment about how their journal was hijacked. Your argument reeks of logical fallacy and illogical denial of legitimate reporting.

<ul>
<li>There is no such a thing as a "permanent stub". The definition of a stub is that it is a basis for expansion. An article that can never be longer than a few paragraphs without breaking <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is just a stillbirth. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:16, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Has the stubs cabal tried to make up some cannonical definition of a stub? Hell, even if they did I don't care. On topic though, such articles may still be useful or they can be merged somewhere.

<li>I suspect this deletion is simply because of a morality matter which should have no impact on this. Unless there is a secret Wikipedia morality policy? Wikipedia's role is not to be moral. It's role is to be an encyclopedia. This strongly smells like people who simply don't agree/like the subject of the article wanting to scrub them from the system based on that. Also, I should add, playing a role (based on four published web sources) in forcing a service with 10 million plus accounts to change their systems permanently is noteworthy. There are stubs that no one makes a fuss over for even stupider/weaker things. Deleting this article is inappropriate based on bias by WP editors. NOTE: I have nothing to do with bantown. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 18:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I should add, if we're going to start playing games of ethics over what should/shouldn't be in WP, we might as well nominate <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> for deletion. I think even more people find both of those abhorrent than do Bantown. Crusading/POV warrioring etc. by select groups of admins to delete things they don't like must be stopped. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 18:14, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You illustrate my point quite well. The nomination is not on grounds of abhorrency, it is on grounds of non-notability. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> et al have acres of news coverage from reliable sources dedicated to them - <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophilia.html" title="Paedophilia">paedophilia</a> ditto, plus numerous academic studies into its causes, its effect on children and why Americans can't spell or pronounce it correctly. Hence, we can write a comprehensive article on them while sticking to that which is verifiable. Bantown has, so far, two reliable sources with no more forthcoming, none of which provide a claim to notability (well, they claim that they hacked LiveJournal and FreeNode... so basically, they claim that they have a claim... rock on). Plus the usual post office gossip from the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_village.html" title="Global village">global village</a>. I dunno, I just think there's not much of a comparison between prosecuting a global jihad by launching hundreds of rockets against Isreal, and t07a11y f1gh71ng t3h p0w3r d00d by annoying a bunch of emos reading each others' diaries.

If it's content of notable nature--for better or worse--it deserver inclusion. Also, how many sources are needed for noteworthiness? Trolling related or other controversial topics I feel are held to a higher and more rigorous standard than most articles. I suspect MANY of the objections are due to "not wanting to let them have a legitimate record" or the ever popular and ludicrous "no trophy platform" statement I see here and there. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:10, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This quest for deletion here (and at the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> article) is against Wikipedia's own policies based on what I suspect is admins having a negative view of the participating group that is covered. I could care less personally whether this article stays or go based on the content. However, based on WP's own rules removing this one in this manner would be a flagrant disregard of our own policies, in my opionion, for "not liking them". Any such deletion should be fought tooth and nail on that criteria.</p>
<p>Would anyone care to try and demonstrate why any of the conditions I list above are not met? Everything of this nature needs to be kept in check. Based on what I listed, I can't see any reason to force a deletion except based on the personal POV of certain admins/editors. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 00:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have added further information to this article in response to comments and criticisms made on this page. Not including Slashdot stories, there are now 3 references and a primary source linking the subject to newsworthy events. A reference and a primary source give direct evidence that Bantown are prime suspects for the two attacks, although their responsibility has not been 'proved'. These references include well-known news outlets - none of them are forums or user-sourced comment. While I understand Slashdot does not fact check, the two front page stories at least show the general level of interest in the topic. The references on this page are much better than most other short articles on wikipedia.</li>

<dd>There are now 11 'Keep' comments on this page and 17 'Delete' comments, at least three of which seem to be sockpuppets (Qurve, ZomgPete and 67.191.90.151), some other of which do not justify themselves sensibly (eg Cheburashka, 71.112.141.236). It really doesn't seem to me that we will acheive any consensus to remove this article. Is it possible that we can agree to end this farcical process? Then I can get back to my work and those people whose main motivation on wikipedia is deleting other people's work can perhaps focus on <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian_until_graduation.html" title="Lesbian until graduation">Lesbian until graduation</a> or similar.</dd>
<dd>If you are someone who has repeatedly called for deletion on this page, it would be courteous if you could leave a comment saying whether or not you are going to continue calling for the removal of this article. If you are going to carry on I think you should give a responsive answer to all of rootology and my points above. As I already pointed out I have other things to do than trying to stop people deleting things I wrote in good faith.

<dd>Apart from my concerns above, which a chat log does not nullify, I cannnot support retaining an article where the claim to notability rests on supposed crimes for which no-one has been convicted, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> (in which I am a great believer, in contrast to the "it's the Internet, you can say anything" attitude that seems to prevail around articles like these). It may seem like an irrelevant concern given that the group involved has themselves claimed to be responsible, but I can assure you that it will look very different to everyone involved when they're 10 or even 5 years older. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not a 'chat log'. It is the official response by the operators of the irc network <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">Freenode</a> to the attacks. They are an irc network so the official comment was made on irc. The page this log appears on gives context.</li>
<li>Perhaps you should direct your attention to the page <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>. AFAIK he has claimed reponsibility for numerous acts of terrorism, but has not yet been convicted of any of them. This objection is laughable.</li>
<li>Bantown is not a living person and this article does not refer to any living person who may or may not be involved with Bantown. The links between the two attacks and a person or persons <i>acting under the name Bantown</i> has been proven, I needn't reiterate this again. If you feel the article should be reworded to avoid incriminating anyone you are free to do so. This has nothing to do with notability.</li>
<li>I'm not asking that you <i>support retaining</i> this article, just that you stop trying to get it deleted.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. the only thing going for notability here are the unverified claims of Bantown. The fact that other articles about vandals and criminals exist does not impinge on the notability of this article. If claims were all that were needed to establish notability, I might claim responsibility for the LJ attack as well... oops.

<li>Hi Tychocat. Thanks for your input. If you would take the time to look thru this page and the article you would see that the issue of 'claimed responsibility' has now been addressed about 5 times. Apart from the question of whether this is a genuine caveat to notability the article now includes the following sources:
<ul>
<li>An internet security expert from the Washington Post discussing in detail Bantown's livejournal attack after having interviewed them at length.</li>
<li>The official public statement and Q&amp;A session given by a Freenode staffer in which they cite Bantown as suspects for the network takeover</li>
<li>The livejournal news page about the attacks showing the involvement of Bantown</li>
