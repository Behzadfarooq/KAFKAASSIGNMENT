<li><b>Keep</b>Popular culture is a part of culture and as such part of our society and daily life. You will agree with me that internet today also forms some kind of popculture, right? the "ORLY" expression has to be looked upon as part of this. so why delete it? if you delete this you should do the same for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freebird.html" title="Freebird">Freebird</a> and other popular expressions from popculture. I do agree however that this article is not really what you imagine as enyclopediac style. but deletion is the wrong impulse. deletion will spawn thousand new articles instead. so go ahead and try to rework this article to an encyclopediac level and then lock it from vandalism.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. 1) The last nomination resulted in a consensus to keep, so we can ignore 'still thoroughly encyclopaedic' because it wasn't a problem last time and so shouldn't be this time. As for the new reasons, 2) Vandalism isn't even close to being a big problem on this page. I've seen high-vandalism targets, this isn't one of them. 3) We certainly shouldn't delete articles just to make arguing a certain side on AfD easier. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> fa<small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 17:47, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> Just as many other internet memes are listeed on Wikipedia, "O RLY?" deserves to stay. The O RLY owl is still an ongoing part of internet culture and will continue to be used for a long time to come. If one wishes to seek information on this meme, one should be able to do so in a more controlled and reliable environment such as wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. O RLY? is a sufficiently notable Internet meme (one of the most widespread memes around, currently) to be Wikipedia material.

Unless Wikipedia policy is changed to declare that Internet culture in general is non-notable, I don't see any reason to delete. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 04:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just because you don't see any 'redeeming value' in the article doesn't mean it's not worth having. If that were the case, I could find several articles that most people would find 'redeeming' and I do not. It's not like the article is comprised of, "O RLY? YA RLY! NO WAI! LOLOLOLOL!". For an article about an internet meme, it's quite informative, well-constructed, and complete. Furthermore, it's 'redeeming' for those that have seen the meme and are wondering about its use or origin. In short, just because you don't like it doesn't mean it shouldn't be here. ~ WindOwl 07:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My point exactly. Just today I remembered a show I watched when I was little called Zoobilee Zoo. When I looked it up on wikipedia there was only a picture and some brief information about it, but that's all I wanted. O RLY might not be much more than a picture of some owl and a short blurb about it, but people will hear it being used and they will come to this site to find an unbiased answer on what it is.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> The content of the article is a useful record of the birth and life of a piece of pop-culture, and serves as a written record of an event that is very rarely recorded.
