<li>Actually, <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDub4u_4e9f.html" title="User:Dub4u">Dub4u</a> blanked the page when the VfD tag was added (a mistake). The original contents were <i>To be informed on housewifes picture the <u>housewifes picture</u>! <small>[URL deleted to avoid triggering spam filter]</small></i> which, in context of the article's title and "what links here", I am speedy-deleting as vandalism. I do think that a serious article on this group could be encyclopedic.

<dd>I disagree with you on two points: 1) The entire assertion that the article is ad-like seems to come from the one statement about being able to buy his CD on his website. I agree that that sentence should probably go... but deleting an article because of one iffy sentence isn't right. If I added a sentence to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> saying that Beatles CDs can be bought at record stores, that would not be grounds to remove the whole article. 2) More importantly, the whole thing about the website not being updated in a year is <b>SIMPLY NOT TRUE!</b> On the very front page it says "Don't Miss The Show with Exile on <b>Feb. 26th 2005</b>". That must have been written fairly recently, unless it's common among Country artists to schedule shows years in advance. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:09, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are very notable, so there is no comparison. The fact is this stub contains little more than the ad, removing the ad practically removes the article. Do searches for Dwain, it's tough to find anything about him. This reeks of an unknown musician trying to get some sales through wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While this is a borderline case, a CD (albeit indy) plus a US club tour in 2003 plus support slots for a number of high profile country stars means that this person is worth having an article on.

The fact that he has won opening slots for a number of stars indicates that Messer must have a fairly good reputation.

<li>Consider the term <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow_orker.html" title="Cow orker">cow orker</a>. What use is it? It's a typo as well (with only 18,900 google hits, I should add.) and it's a valid wikipedia article. The use for both of these terms are for amusement and internet culture. Also, they both demonstrate the amusement that can be derived from common interactions over the net and common mishaps from which many entertaining conversations have sprung. Sure, they're both typos. Sure, thousands upon thousands of typos can be found online. However, not many offer some form of humor--some respite from the droning of articles, conversations, and listings that appear before us daily. If other typos have been witnessed and chuckled over by as many netizens as <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studnet.html" title="Studnet">studnet</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow_orker.html" title="Cow orker">cow orker</a> then perhaps they should have articles as well.

<p>Skateboarding is a very underground culture, look up the z boys, or gator, very deep hardcore lifestyle, this is one of the first introductions to the internet of a very small but powerful chapter of australias own skateboarding history, there is alot more to life than what you may find on google. However.... these days there are documentaries abounding about these times and people, I am certain skateboarding was established in the seventies in Ulladulla, but a new breed of skater and skateboarding was developing in the late eighties, shame none of the ulladulla locals have provided this online encyclopedia with some of their history, because history it is! and as humerous as this particular submission may seem, it reflects the time and people. Please leave this legacy of history for the sports millions of growing devotees, there is a book in the works and also a short documentary, this page on wikipedia is the first of many sources of information reguarding this chapter of history. One of the flaws of the earths history is the censorship of so much of it, we can not trace accurately back more than a few hundred years,,, lets not let ignorance rule in this millenium. thanks</p>

<dd>It isn't a minor mistake to nominate an article which isn't patent nonsense without doing any research. A google search is all that is required. Spurious listings on vfd are harmful on two counts: timewasting, and more importantly that they are a slap in the face to honest contributors and a threat to the ability of Wikipedia to retain editors. There are several cautions against hasty nominations on the guidance pages. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 04:55, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There are many other things which waste far much more time than the occassional mistaken listing, like vanity pages which unfortunately can't be speedied. I don't see why some people stubbornly refuse to cut our fellow contributors some slack in cases like this, especially when they acknowledge it was an honest mistake. Rude responses to minor mistakes and refusal to assume good faith are far more of a "slap in the face to honest contributors" and much more of a "threat to the ability of Wikipedia to retain editors" than a harmless and quickly forgotten vfd listing. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:59, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> - The question should be whether Tuulk has something to add to your knowledge. You can discuss the importance for tuulk being incorporated in the encyclopedia, but what you should really care about is that one specific person that wants to know what tuulk is, because he hears it all the time in the that specific part of Holland. I know that it isn't a strong argument for many of you never have wondered what tuulk is. Anyway, I'm glad that everyone in this discussion - also in the english world - knows what tuulk is.

<li><b>Delete</b>, original research, licensing issues regarding an article about licensing issues. Appears to be promoting a new form of intellectual-property licensing. Appears to claim association with efforts of Free Software Foundation, but I've never seen FSF announcements mentioning this. Article includes pseudonym of apparent creator/proponent of this program, which appears to be an attempt to claim control of all the IP that passes through digital forms. Someone more active in F/OSS should correct me if I'm wrong and this is legitimate, but it hasn't showed up in, for example, Groklaw's extensive discussions about IP and copyright/patent/licensing issues. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:38, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

Mr. Stallman will require some persuading on the matter. I also plan to raise the mathematical need for a set comprising all intellectual property works sharing a given set of properties, for example, all works being compatible with wikipedia. I was going to add the word "wikiverse" but researched it enough to understand that the name was forbidden, because of intellectual property wranglings from the past. Therefore I made up a word. I need a linguistic anchor in your universe so that I can explain my theories, show my equations, and publish my inventions. I understand that my intent is to construct a hypothetical encyclopedia of the future. Rather that creating yet another intellectual property project, to add to the confusion, I decided to stake an intellectual property claim in wikipedia and see if I could persuade wikipedians to invite the future to coexist alongside the recorded past. In my estimation, the only requirement for cohabitation is that and “future POV” be demarcated in some obvious manner.

<p>This article is a lengthly non-NPOV screed (carefully couched so as to appear neutral) in support of a particular British antifeminist movement. The primary authors of the article have a history of reverting changes made with the intent of neutralizing the non-NPOV content. I see no hope that this article can easily be reduced to a form that will pass for NPOV, or that the individuals who are responsible for this state of affair will cease their non-NPOV-introducing edits. Hence, I recommend the deletion of this article. —<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 19:54, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If 'anti-feminist' means oppossing the view that children are women's property to do with as they please regardless of the father's wishes, then I am most definitely anti-feminist, but I haven't heard any feminist spokespeople express this view, presumably because they would in their hearts be ashamed to, though there are women in the family courts every day who actions support that view exactly. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:47, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If the wording is so carefully couched as to appear neutral then how can one reasonably claim that it is not, and surely one needs to cite some evidence to support that view? And what can one do about text that is believed by some not to be neutral but appears so? Perhaps we have a new category of problem in wikipedia, something which is in fact expressed in NPOV terms that accord with wikipedia's policies but which some readers find offensive because it calls into question their deeply held prejudices. All I would say to them is, don't read it then, and go somewhere else where you can preserve your prejudices and ignorance intact, OK? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:37, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Fathers going through this process generally only want equality of care and status with the mothers, surely feminism is about equality, not the superiority of women over men? --DanDav 22:13, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I am very interested that perhaps one or several of the detractors, whom a UK Appeal Court judge has recently referred to as a "small group of obdurate women", might have surfaced in wikipedia, ostensibly on a NPOV tirade, though at least one of them has demanded the removal of all the facts from the article and no one here or elsewhere has identified specifically what it is about my and others' writings here that they find objectionable on whatever grounds. (I can only conclude they don't like my up-front style, which is why I maintain this is an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack, rather than a genuine NPOV argument.) That is a pity, as I was hoping to hear expressed a reasoned set of counter-arguments to the fathers' rights cause. I imagine if anyone were to consult the leading sisters in the womens' movement they would be told to keep quiet and just hope that outlets like wikipedia don't get wide enough exposure to contribute significantly to the downfall of their, it can be reasoned, hitherto quite powerful clique. Has it not occurred to you that what is written in the article just might all be true, regardless of whether you like the people who wrote it? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 07:27, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>I agree, and I would like to warn people that it is ok if the Father's rights movement is anti-feminanist in so far that it seems, from their perspective, feminism is not about equality but in many cases becoming about promoting women at the cost of men's rights SO LONG as the article states that this is what these groups SAY/THINK, then that is NPOV. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 17:46, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Shaun, I think you have misinterpreted the "anti-feminism" argument I have made in my earlier comments. My view is that the movement can only be regarded as anti-feminist if feminism is NOT about equality between men and women. If feminism is only about this equality, then the fathers rights movement cannot be said to be anti-feminist as fathers are seeking only equality in care &amp; status with mothers when it comes to their parenting. I hope this makes this clearer? --DanDav 18:11, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
