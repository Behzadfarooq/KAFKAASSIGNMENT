<li>JzG made a plausible case for deletion. Obviously, consensus doesn't support it, but that falls way short of bad faith. I'm also confused as to how this is the third nomination; it says "second" in the URL. And your link goes to an AfD six months ago.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's a valid point, and the case for deletion was deliberately misrepresented. I'm shocked at the lengths some people will go to to claim neutrality while obviously consipiring to go on a highly-charged AFD rampage, as part of what seems to be some sort of wider vendetta. Perhaps <i>you</i> should show <i>me</i> where the record of the first failed deletion nomination was, seeing as you seem to know all about the fact that it was 6 months ago. As you well know, my link points to the second nomination, in January 2006, which is a good deal less than 6 months ago. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 01:48, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, you're right. The January one was seemingly for "Gay and lesbian kingdom" by name, and was a package deal that also included this article. See?

<li><b>Comment:</b> My thanks to all the above for informing me of my real motives, I thought I was just trying to clear up some cruft (having reviewed, Googled and left most fo the micronations in the category). Seems I was deluding myself and I am in fact a rampant deletionist with an agenda against micronations. I wish I'd known that, I'd have nominated the lot and saved the time spent researching. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 09:38, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not sure that's a useful comment. I have found JzG to be a very thoughtful and hardworking contributor. He may tend to be a bit more deletionist than I am, but his nominations are always done in good faith (to assume otherwise is to in itself act in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a>, in my view) and are worthy of serious consideration, because he does not make them lightly, IMHO. Deleting truly <b>bad</b> articles is part of what makes Wikipedia <b>better</b>, even hardcore inclusionists like myself know that. (I already suggested keep on this one, after all) I believe this opinion of JzG and his actions is not just mine, because he recently was made an admin with over 100 supporting voices and little dissent. Sometimes his comebacks may be a bit acerbic if you bait him, but I expect he's a bit frustrated at how people have piled on him and <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">User:kingboyk</a> about the spate of nominations. Remember, people nominate things as they become aware of them, so there need not be a nefarious <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">plot</a> here, merely a raising in awareness. JzG reviewed the category and a number of related articles to thus get nominated. Perfectly natural, and quite useful, IMHO. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:40, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I appreciate the benefits of being bold, but an editor who slaps an AFD on an article without even bothering to glance at the talk page is not acting responsibly in my opinion. If he had he would have seen the failed AFD from barely a month ago, and saved us all hours of wasted time and effort.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 16:47, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, I'd ask you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, as I am assuming you don't know that's what he did, you're apparently just assuming it. Although the admonition to check talk pages for signs of previous deletions is a good piece of advice, articles can and do get renominated, and it's entirely appropriate that they do, IMHO. 4 times may be a bit much, but the previous cites of that were confuddled, it looked like only one previous one. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:36, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this <i>wasn't</i> a gay issue I would have voted delete, and I suspect for others it's the same. So, rather than there being an anti LGBT conspiracy I suspect rather the opposite. You are of course free to nominate that other article for deletion but it seems to have become an annual festival. I suspect it has notability as a festival and not as a 'micronation', but I might be wrong. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 02:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
