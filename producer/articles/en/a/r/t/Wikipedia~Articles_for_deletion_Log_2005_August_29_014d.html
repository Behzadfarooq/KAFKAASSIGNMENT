<li>Then it might have been a better idea to say just that. As it stands, it might be construed as a lecture for being naughty for suggesting such a delete, an attempt to subtly intimidate, or a little bit of the old na na na na boo boo &lt;thumbs nose&gt;. You should know that in VfD it is of especial importance to say what you mean. More to the point, what is it about suggesting the deletion of yetanother same old same old school that makes one =not= building an encyclopedia. Some of us see it as important that each entry should be judged on its own merits and should possess some degree of notability, not knee-jerked in because, oh, it's another school/mall/road/whatever. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:53, 2005 August 31 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suppose my comment could be interpreted as an attempt to dissect the Gettysburg address, but I don't take that suggestion any more seriously than I take the suggestion that it can be read as an attempt to lecture anyone for being naughty (it's addressed at those who don't know the history), and I can only regard with extreme skepticism the idea that giving accurate, neutral factual information can legitimately be interpreted as an attempt to intimidate. It sounds like sour grapes. This article will be kept, most likely with a majority against deletion. This will not be an extraordinary occurrence. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 22:25, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Absolutely. But what they were <i>not</i> was deletions. We don't delete articles unless there is a consensus to delete them.

<li>My preference is <b>Delete.</b> If kept, move all the unsourced entries to the article's Talk page—which at this point is all of them, effectively blanking the article. State at the top of the article that entries are to be inserted only if accompanied by source citations, meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines, which describe the person as "eccentric," using that word. The list then becomes a list of people who have been called eccentric, with source citations showing who called them that.

<li>This either shows a disdain for religion or a lack of understanding of history. Either way the people you name are not self-described eccentrics nor did they get famous because they're eccentric.

<li>Is this a list of self-described eccentrics we're debating? I don't think so. These aren't people who got famous for being eccentric either. That's not what's going on here. History is in the eye of the beholder, too, when such soft labels as "eccentric" are thrown around. Some guy who calls himself the son of God and runs around in the desert with 12 men, eschews sex, but hangs out with prostitutes, seems eccentric by most standards (and if you disagree, that just proves the point that there is no subjective criteria for inclusion). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Many newbies seem to be confused by accusations of <i>vanity</i>. I understand that Wikipedia uses a special, non-common definition for the term. In Wikipedia, "vanity" means that the article was created by its subject, a friend of the subject, or a member of the subject (in case of organisations) but no one else knows or cares about it. It does <b>not</b> necessarily mean that the article praises the subject. In fact, an article insulting its subject might still be vanity.

<p>I have thought long &amp; hard about this one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, the airport's name and IATA code are wrong. I believe the author is talking about the 'Benito Juarez International Airport', IATA code: MEX.</li>
<li>Secondly, MEX is not in the Top 10 of world's busiest airports and certainly NOT the busiest in Latin America (that honour belongs to Juan Santamaria in Costa Rica).</li>
<li>Thirdly, there is no information other than a list of airlines and destinations allegedly operating from the airport. Both lists are incomplete, inaccurate and inconsistent. There are no verifiable sources given.</li>
<li>And, finally, yes..I do live in Mexico. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddie.willers_4fa8.html" title="User:Eddie.willers">Eddie.willers</a> 05:06, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Bjelke-Petersen School of Physical Culture has 180 clubs in Eastern Australia. Does this make it notable or is it just advertising? Note. The text is a direct copyvio from <a href="http://www.physicalculture.com.au/about.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.physicalculture.com.au/about.htm" rel="nofollow">the school's website</a> but since it was probably they who posted it, I think we should deal with the notability first. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 06:42:48, 2005-08-29 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would vote keep for it but note that it needs a significant cleanup. This is a non-profit organisation with a reasonable following and 180 clubs in Eastern Australia is a significant number of clubs. Hans Christian Bjelke-Peterson (not Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen_7c59.html" title="Joh Bjelke-Petersen">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>) was the founder of the organisation <a href="http://www.humankinetics.com/courses/alevelpe/pdf/Ch6_1_focus.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humankinetics.com/courses/alevelpe/pdf/Ch6_1_focus.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and he has an interesting background in anthropometric studies see the link. However, I am of the view that copyvios should be deleted even if the organisation has no problems with them staying. This is because material coped from the web is usually not POV nor does it usually present the information in an encylopedic way. This should be deleted as a copyvio. If someone wants to write an encyclopedic article on this that isn't a copyvio, I would welcome it. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 07:30, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> this is a notable subject, related to the physcial fitness fads of the 1920-1960 period when "physical culture" was thought to be important.

<dd>Not about dance schools in Oregon, at least I'm not. If you think it's worthy of being altered in the way you outlined than alter it, you'd likely also change some votes. Otherwise, please just vote on the article as it stands not on what you hope the article might someday become. If the time arrives that someone is knowledgeable enough to write a comprehensive article on dance schools in Oregon, they would have my happy support in doing so.

<dd>I don't have any problem with stubs, if written correctly they're great. The problem is this article isn't a stub, it's a list of links.

I can start an article about my non-notable local councilman because, potentially, he could become a senator.

<li>Inconsistency is fine by me. Whenever there is no perfectly "bright line" and decisions must be made by human judgement, there will be inconsistency whenever things fall close to the borderline. If a cop stops you for speeding it is not usually helpful to tell the judge that there were other drivers going faster. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:05, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But then we're not in a court of law talking about a speeding ticket, are we? No. We're on wikipedia talking about the fact that this is all subjective and up to the whims of a clique of wikipedia editors who for some strange reason think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_planets_in_Futurama_51fa.html" title="List of planets in Futurama">list of fictional planets on Futurama</a> are more deserving of mention than the very real dance schools in the very real state of Oregon. Trekkie convention, anyone? And on the topic of speeding tickets: if it can be proven that the police officer was indeed singling a person out it is actually feasible that charges could be dropped. This sort of thing happens all the time. Maybe someone can make a list for you about the times it has happened, and then you can request the list be deleted as it relates to something in the real world and not a cartoon, hence it is not substantial enough for you.</li>

<p>Was tagged as a vanity speedy: <i>it is most likely a vanity article; the IP of the editor is the same as the subjects home (Jacksonville, FL) suggesting it was created by the subject or a friend or relative (info on ip location is from: <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>).</i> and was said in another tag not to assert notability when the article states, he sits on the RSS Advisory Board, registered benedictxvi.com several weeks before the pope was named and also did some reporter work. If you take that together, I'd say calling this non-notable is a bit hasty. <b>Keep</b>, unless someone can prove the RSS Advisory Board doesn't exist or has no real importance in the computer world. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:08, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmm. Marginal <b>Delete</b>. The RSS board is notable, and important as an organisation, but its members are not necessarily notable (and don't need to be).

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is pretty non-notable stuff as far as I can tell. Writing a book itself does not mean the person should be included. I looked up the books on Amazon and their sales rankings are #30,000 and #80,000. The website isn't very notable and the RSS board may or may not be important enough to cary the article.

<li>This comes across as a self-promoting, vanity page. I appreciate the arguments iterated above, particularly the noteworthiness of the various projects, but the fact is that letting vanity pages stand withers the credibility of Wikipedia and mocks the efforts of those who contribute to it.

<li>isn't Jacksonville sort of big though? I agree that it's bad precedent if the guy authored it himself, but do we know that or just strongly assume it?

<li><s><b>Comment</b>. I object to redoing this VfD. rcade seems to be confused as to the nature of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not about doing a clever blog post and then letting everyone else tidy up after it has suited your purpose. I am really very tired of this.

My evaluation of the article as a <i>weak keep</i> stands; the basic principle that article subjects do not dictate the terms of their inclusion should as well. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 19:29, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment again</b>. Reading rcade's blog post, it seems that he was acting in good faith both in creating and later voting delete on his article. However, my vote still stands and I still object to redoing the VfD; the community has looked at the article, found the subject notable, and that's all that needs to be said. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 19:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What Sdedeo and HallMonitor said. Being eager to have a wikipedia article about you has zero bearing on the question of whether or not there should be a wikipedia article about you.

<p><b>From <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity_page</a></b> Problems with vanity articles:</p>
<p>The most significant problem with vanity article is that they often discuss subjects that are <b>not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors</b>. Additionally, they are often "experimental" articles to which the author never returns. <b>The quality of a Wikipedia article is often presumed to be proportional to the number of edits, so if an article is doomed to be a one-edit article, it should be deleted.</b></p>
<p><b>In some cases, Wikipedia users write articles about themselves when the more appropriate action would be to create a user page</b>. In these cases, the article is normally moved into the User namespace rather than deleted.</p>
<p>Another danger is inherent in auto-biographical articles. Users might write articles pertaining to their own work. <b>While the authors of such articles might not consider them "vanity" articles, they are in violation of the soft policy against writing articles on one's own accomplishments.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think I saw this page when poking around Wikipedia to see if there was a prohibition against autobiography. That reference to a soft policy isn't as clear as it could be -- does that mean there's wiggle room and it's a matter of judgment? In any case, if Wikicities accepts my proposal for a non-famous biography wiki, it should make this particular editing issue easier to resolve. Moving a self-promotional or dubious biography to another wiki should be easier for contributors to accept than a deletion. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcade_aa62.html" title="User:Rcade">rcade</a>, 31 August 2005
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> is a guideline, not a policy. Logically, if the information within an article can be verified and meets the qualifications set forth by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it should be kept regardless of how it began. Multiple precedents exist which we can refer back to. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Richard_Bozulich_ff9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Richard Bozulich">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Richard Bozulich</a> was recently closed with a unanimous vote of keep after the subject requested his article be deleted. There are also precedents for the retention of autobiographical "vanity" articles, such as <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Liberty_8348.html" title="Jesse Liberty">Jesse Liberty</a> and Cyrus Farivar, although the latter discussion was somewhat contentious during the second go-round.

<dd>I'm sorry, I took a quick look, and am not clear of what part of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a> you're refering to. I thought I read the GFDL requires us to keep the old edit history of article, if the content there-in was used elsewhere (in a re-direct/merge or a move without copying history). It appears there is content that predates <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granta.html" title="Granta">Granta</a>. So, if you don't wish to do a disambig, why not just revert back to the previous re-direct. Seems quick and easy. It's pretty normal/legit to have a re-direct from a possible (though wrong and/or obsolete) spelling of a place. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 12:28, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It explains why "Merge to Example and Delete" is invalid. Basically, any old history has to be kept, no matter what, if any of the old content found it's way into the new article. I interpret that to mean, we can't delete this old article. Now the "merge(?)/redirect" part was done a long time ago, and we can't now to the delete part.

<dd>Thanks for the precise link, which I just read. I'm not sure we disagree. I'm saying there should be *no* pub article. I'm advocating The Granta *either* be a disambigation page or a re-direct page. But, not a "content" page. You're entirely correct, that there should be no "content" page called The Granta. Disambiguation and re-direct pages aren't subject to normal naming rules. In fact, their whole purpose is to move somebody from the wrong name, to the correct name. Also, I agree <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granta.html" title="Granta">Granta</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Cam_e457.html" title="River Cam">River Cam</a> should stay in the same place. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 13:57, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am placing a VFD on this and, probably, other articles concerning porn 'stars' simply because, all too often, there is confusion between 'notability' and 'notoriety' - this is a perfect example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lara Roxx, Darren James and their ilk are 'notorious'. That is, they are known, but in an unfavourable manner and in a restricted circle. They cannot be considered as 'notable' or 'noteworthy' as they have not added anything to the sum of human intellectual achievement or to the human condition. Nor are they particularly striking or worthy in their achievement.</li>
<li>They cannot be considered as 'actors' other than in the sense of their being participants in an act. They are not 'theatrical performers' in any sense - being filmed whilst having sex does not require any communicable skill.</li>
<li>Tough on Lara, but catching AIDS in your line of work does not make you notable either. I am sure that if one dug around, there are cases of medical professionals catching AIDS in their line of work - folk who are probably a good deal more 'socially useful' too (dons flamproof suit quickly).</li>
<li>Wikipedia can, does, and should have entries for 'notorious' persons (eg:Al Capone, Jeffrey Dahmer) who may be considered notable for their actions, the effect of those actions and the amount of interest garnered by those actions in a general social sense.
<ul>
<li>In the case of pornography, and with reference to the above paragraph, Larry Flynt and Hugh Hefner are good examples of those who may be considered notorious and notable.</li>

<li><b>keep</b> I don't buy the distinction between between <i>notable</i> and <i>notorious</i> wrt the wikipedia standards for inclusion. "Adding to the sum of human intellectual achievement or human condition" seems to me to be a weasly way of excluding people whose behavior doesn't please the nominator; that is, it is an inherent POV value judgment. Therefore, there is no proposed valid reason for this to be on the table for deletion, so keep. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 13:39, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Would also like to say that it sounds like you are trying to use VFD to push an agenda, which I don't think is a good idea. Whatsmore, if we used your method of saying that someting is notable, we wouldn't have pages on murderers etc either because they haven't done anything other than "kill people" which has gone on for thousands of years. I don't think someone necessarily has to have done anything intelligent to be noteworthy as long as they are somewhat known in their field. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 13:50, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This one has some minor interest per the start of the article. That does not apply to most porn-stars however, and I would be interested in a <i>selective</i> VfDing of those that are non-notable. Simply VfDing them <i>all</i> would not be appropriate however. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 23:24, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's keep in mind that "lack of notability" has never been accepted by consensus as sufficient grounds for deletion of articles. We're not dealing with the assistant editor of a high school newspaper here. We're talking about perfomers who appear in movies that are widely distributed. Many of them also appear in magazines that are also widely distributed. This makes then public figures, and therefore worthy of a Wikipedia article, as long as it provides some relevant information beyond "Candy Blossom is a porn star." The "porn stars aren't notable" argument smacks of a bit of prurience. In an encyclopedia that has articles on fictional characters, TV show episodes, and reality show participants, it is hard to justify deleting articles on performers in a popular, mass market form of entertainment. <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeromacnoo_1a90.html" title="User:Zeromacnoo">Zeromacnoo</a> 19:40, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The criteria outlined by Eddie Willers are NPOV and should be irrelevant to considering biographies. According to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> the relevant criteria is "Well known entertainment figures, such as TV/movie producers, directors, writers, and actors who have starring roles, or a series of minor roles, in commercially distributed work watched by a total audience of 5,000 or more." Ms Roxx meets these criteria. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 20:02, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't buy the distinction between <i>notorious</i> and <i>notable</i>. Whether or not everything the proposer says is true, they're still notable and worth putting in Wikipedia. (And the fact is, much of what the proposer says, I consider to be nonsense and wrongfully judgemental, and I'm sure I could find fields of interest that I consider to be without skills and merely notorious among a restricted field that the proposer would disagree with.)--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 20:18, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Having looked at the article, I have to wonder what you were thinking. Yes, being the first person in four years to get AIDS in the porn industry and prompting potential government intrusion or changes from within to avoid government intrustion is notable.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 22:39, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> as is (in)famous with many people, it's perfectly notable. Notorious would be a subset of notability in any case. Further, I remember a VfD on every Victoria Cross holder, since Victoria Cross awardees are imminently more notable than Congressional Medal of Honor recipients, ever CMH holder should also be VfD'd because they are inherently less notable. So... if being notorious is not good enough, we should VfD "Al Capone", "Caligula", "Nero", "Pol Pot", "Papa Doc" Duvalier, "Robispiere", "Elizabeth I", "Ivan the Terrible", "Vlad the Impaler", "Jesse James", "Billy the Kid", "Ulysses S. Grant", "Heinrich Himmler", "Marilyn Monroe", "Martin Luther", "Copernicus", ... 132.205.3.20 20:53, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't like what they do, but they are legally allowed to do it.

An entirely misguided concept is not a good starting point, and the rest of the article consists of the usual rktect rants (see <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_Sandbox_rktect_4494.html" title="User:Egil/Sandbox/rktect">User:Egil/Sandbox/rktect</a>).

<li>Milion is not the Greek name for the Roman unit because its Latin not Greek.</li>
<li>Milion is the Roman name for the Greek unit from which the Roman Milliare is derived.</li>
<li>You can raise the issue of what evidence is there that a Greek unit of 8 stadia = 1 (Roman name for it) milion existed?</li>
<li>The evidence is that the name the Romans chose for their mile was milliare.</li>
<li>In latin the milliare is differentiated from the milion or mylios</li>
<li>The Milion or Milos are the Greek units which were the source of the Roman mile.</li>
<li>The Greek Stadion was also the source of the Roman stadium.</li>
<li>This information comes from Vitruvius a Roman Architect.</li>
<li>In his "Ten Books of Architecture he tells us that the Romans got their units from the Greeks.</li>
<li>If you read his book you will discover why he says that.</li>
<li>Milion is not a misspelling for million, its not a flower,</li>

I can only find a handful of google hits associated with this particular language, and most of those are conlang websites that can be edited by the user.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

A list of words, however long, should not be enough. However, there are obviously Wikipedians of a different opinion, which is why I'd like to urge anyone voting to delete this article to check out the straw poll being held at <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConlangs_Votes_e743.html" title="Wikipedia:Conlangs/Votes">Wikipedia:Conlangs/Votes</a></b> where an attempt is made to create general criteria for inclusion of constructed languages.

I agree that some of the criteria some people have proposed are a bit silly, but you'll notice most if not all of the silly ones are getting a lot more oppose votes than support votes (oops, I used the word "vote"; Messrs.

It's merely a collection of <b>possible</b> criteria proposed by individual people. The purpose of the whole discussion is merely to establish some objective criteria for conlang notability. As someone who cares for conlangs and to whom it is an important field of interest, I want a conlang section that is clean and of high quality; I do <b>not</b> want to be overly inclusive, and I definitely do <b>not</b> want articles about 1200 individual conlangs. To me, number of words and a unique script do not make a language notable. And yes, some of the proposed criteria are a bit sillyl.

<dd>I personally believe googling for {lara "constructed language"} is unfair, because you exclude anything that is not in English. In cases like this one (especially since the creator of the language is Italian) I much rather google for LANGUAGE NAME + SURNAME OF THE CREATOR. In this case, "lara" + "pedicelli" generates 72 ghits. --<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 13:11, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>: It's hard to explain the case in English but I'll give my best. Blackplait (Trubetsky) is an Estonian anarchist and a real-existing person. I really doubt he has (ever had) no connection whatsoever with the "original" The Flowers of Romance. But he is a singer in Estonian band Vennaskond and he's been using the pseodonym Blackplait. I think the situation is that some person has been sending false data to wikipedia and other similar sites in the Internet. He has released an album under the name The Flowers of Romance in Estonia, but there is no connection whatsoever with the "original" band. The "Estonian Flowers of Romance" is a band consisting of Vennaskond' members whose names have been anglicified (Allan Vainola has changed to Al Vainola for example). It's probably kind of a homage to the band, and so the "Estonian TFOR"'s a mix of facts and fiction, it's kind of urban legend. On the movies/books/albums the facts are actually mostly right. All the albums listed have been released in Estonia and of three movies I have seen two, one of them is currently located on my HDD by fact (though they are really bad amateur-documentaries). Trubetsky didn't appear as an actor in movies "Serenade", "The Sweet Planet" and "War", he actually was a animator on those (working at the time in Tallinnfilm movie-studio). Estonian titles of the movies are "Serenaad", "Magus planeet" and "Sõda" and you can find them in IMDb, with the information on Trubetsky being an animator listed only on the case of "Sõda". I guess he appeared in Pekka Karjalainen's Hysteria (information on this film's at IMDb, though he's not been submitted to the cast list, but hey, the imdb's incomplete like anything else.) The case is the same with books: they're in Estonian and not known in the world so I guess it's hard to find information from the Internet and I doubt they're ever been translated to English so their names would have to be in Estonian. I know anonymous users' opinions don't count on VfDs, but my suggestion would be to move the article under the name Tõnu Trubetsky (as he's not know in the west that well under the name of Blackplait and to clean up the information on movies and books, as he in fact's pretty well-known in Estonia and Finland (as a member of Vennaskond). The only part on which' autenticy I doubt is from "...and lived in different cities..." to "made a "demos" with Teet Tibar, his Estonian friend." This part is imho the only part of article that should be deleted or at least improved very much.

<li>Please show proof for what you are telling us. I still don't believe. I find your information very hard to believe. So you are telling us that "Flowers of Romance" is both the title of an album released as well as the name of his band? This is not very believable. And even if the information is correct, this raises the question if the guy in question is of enough relevance for wikipedia. I don't think that "really bad amateur-documentaries" are a criteria for inclusion into wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../../de/k/j/u/Benutzer%7EKju_bede.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer:Kju">Kju</a>/<a href="../../../k/j/u/User%7EKju_%28de%29_3206.html" title="User:Kju (de)">Kju (de)</a> 22:44, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>on the "really bad amateur-documentaries", they are music films, mostly a collection of music and live videos from different eras and some other segments, like the band walking the streets of Helsinki or playing cards on a ferry boat. they aren't quite what you'd call a movie, that's what I meant.</p>

<li><i>Keep'</i>. I back the opinion and the proposals of the anonymous contributor above. Move the title to "Tõnu Trubetsky". The "hoax" obviously is due to a mystification by Trubetsky himself and his band companions. The titles of his books are given in translation in the article, this is why they cannot be found. The films are not the reason of his fame, they are just musical videofilms documneting the band's activities. Tõnu Trubetsky is a famous and influential figure in Estonia. I added the Estonian wikilink to <a href="../../../../et/t/%C3%B5/n/T%C3%B5nu_Trubetsky_2238.html" class="extiw" title="et:Tõnu_Trubetsky">et:Tõnu Trubetsky</a>, and I'll make some clean-up there. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndres_1bcc.html" title="User:Andres">Andres</a> 07:55, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Please do not delete. The religion of jesus Church has been on the basic of many 'modern' churches who's members use cannabis as a sacrament. the simple fact that there seem to be not enough time/effort by wiki editors to dig up some "approved" sources does not justify the absense of this religion in an encyclopedia which claims to be complete and neutral. Also, being the founder of the Amsterdam Cannabis Ministry and keeper of the international members DB I know the numbers of people world wide who are officially registered with only one of the cannabis related religions and I can assure you this is not a "small group" but a very fast growing international community in more than 40 countries. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerre_d8ea.html" title="User:Ferre">Ferre</a> 09:05, 3 september 2005</li>

<p>No evidence to support article's claims; original author unresponsive to queries.</p>
<p>More specifically, a request was placed on the author's (<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvun_a92b.html" title="User:Corvun">User:Corvun</a>) talk page for documentation of the claims on the page, after several searches of the relevant literature came up with no evidence to support the existence of a "black recluse" spider living in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Northwest_2643.html" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> (or anywhere). No response was given; the author later deleted the request (as part of a general "housecleaning" of his talk page).</p>
<p>Further, the page makes claims concerning this creature which are rather specific in nature--which need external documentation; the page also makes the rather specious claim (regarding the "ignorance of local fish and wildlife organizations") that the local authorities on fauna in the region are uninformed.</p>

<li>As far as I'm concerned, a person who's only notable as a crime victim should have an article <i>only</i> if they have significant name recognition on their own.

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the mostbeautifulman.com artcile was directly stolen from something *I* wrote for <a href="http://antek.us/bio.htm" class="external text" title="http://antek.us/bio.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, all they did was change the third person to first .. and badly at that.</li>
