	    <p><b>Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia</b> defines various terms used in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Malaysia_160a.html" title="Constitution of Malaysia">Constitution</a>. It has an important impact on <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_Malaysia_0379.html" title="Islam in Malaysia">Islam</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_people.html" title="Malay people">Malay people</a> due to its definition of a Malay person under clause 2. It took effect after <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> ("Merdeka Day" or "Independence Day") in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Malaysia_c14e.html" title="West Malaysia">West Malaysia</a>, and took effect in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Malaysia_f417.html" title="East Malaysia">East Malaysia</a> when they merged with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaya.html" title="Malaya">Malaya</a> in 1963. The article no longer applies to Singapore, as it declared independence from Malaysia in 1965; however, it does affect the legal status of Malay Singaporeans when they enter Malaysia.</p>

<p>The article defines a Malay as a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian_citizen.html" title="Malaysian citizen">Malaysian citizen</a> born to a Malaysian citizen who professes to be a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, habitually speaks the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_language.html" title="Malay language">Malay language</a>, adheres to Malay customs, and is domiciled in Malaysia or <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. As a result, Malay citizens who convert out of Islam are no longer considered Malay under the law. Hence, the <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumiputra.html" title="Bumiputra">Bumiputra</a> privileges afforded to Malays under <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_153_of_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia_eb69.html" title="Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia">Article 153 of the Constitution</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian_New_Economic_Policy_b090.html" title="Malaysian New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a> (NEP), etc. are forfeit for such converts.</p>
<p>Likewise, a non-Malay Malaysian who converts to Islam can lay claim to Bumiputra privileges, provided he meets the other conditions. A higher education textbook conforming to the government Malaysian studies syllabus states: "The non-Malay thought that is when a non-Malay embraces Islam, he is said to <i>masuk Melayu</i> (become a Malay in Malay language)<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. That person is automatically assumed to be fluent in the Malay language and to be living like a Malay as a result of his close association with the Malays."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
