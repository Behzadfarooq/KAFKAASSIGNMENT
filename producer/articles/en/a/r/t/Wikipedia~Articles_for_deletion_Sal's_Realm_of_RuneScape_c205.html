<p><b>Delete</b> If you search, or know about it, you'll know fansites like this on RuneScape have always been deleted by afd. This is yet another fansite which doesn't deserve anything more than a link at the bottom of the page. A few months back an article about runehq was deleted. It was done well and didn't read like an advert. Runehq is arguably much better than this webiste (traffic and guides) and it got deleted therefore, I feel this should be deleted as well. Also another reason I feel it should be deleted is that even the moderators of the site think this is not needed. <a href="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" class="external text" title="http://runescape.salmoneus.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=29884&amp;pid=341297&amp;st=20&amp;#entry341297" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 22:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sagnella, I don't see why you're so interested in seeing that this article gets deleted. Any ulterior motives? Well, I don't think that this article is the same as the previous ones on RuneScape Community and RHQ. RSC and RHQ's articles were stubs that barely had any content in them besides unshameful promotion of their respective websites. This article contains factual information that is potentially useful to many people. If you feel that it's written simply to promote the site, I am sorry to have to say that it is of my opinion that you are mistaken. As proof of that, any links, biased opinions, or whatnot may be cleaned up to comply with Wikipedia's policies. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissentor_91cc.html" title="User:Dissentor">Dissentor</a> 22:40, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll put it this way. Sal's Realm is by no means the best RuneScape fansite. Even if it was to be kept, articles about tip.it, runehq, zybez, runevillage and possibly others would have to be created to mkae it equal. That would be a big waste of Wikipedia space. <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 06:42, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>First of all, define how you rate a fansite as the best or not. What are you using to judge how good or bad a fansite is? I am not saying that Sal's Realm is the best fansite; however, it seems that you came to the conclusion that Sal's Realm is not the best fansite without any supporting information. If other fansites would have to have their own articles to make it equal, by all means, let them be written, as long as they're not partisan pieces of nothing but how great they are and how much other fansites are worse than their's. And as for that being a waste of Wikipedia space, I'm fairly sure you're not paying monthly server costs or anything of that sort. If you think that this article is a waste of space, please do say so in a more succinct manner and I'll spend some time finding articles that have been allowed that are even more useless than this one.</li>

<dd>This brings me nicely on to the key reason as to why this should get deleted. A few months back an article about runehq was deleted. It was done well and didn't read like an advert. Runehq is arguably much better than this webiste (traffic and guides) and it got deleted therefore, I feel this should be deleted as well.

<ul>
<li>I don't think that traffic and guides are what make a fansite better or worse. I believe that it is the community that truly defines the fansite and what it's about. As for RuneHQ's article getting deleted, if I was around for the discussion, I would've most definitely supported its existance. If it is a well-written article, not biased, and completely factual, then I believe that it would be in Wikipedia's best interest to keep it. That's why the deletionist mantra doesn't make any sense to me. Wikipedia wants to grow, then why throw out articles that aren't tabloids in nature, serve a purpose, are of interest to some, and are not harmful/hatred in nature?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia wants to grow. But we don't want to have an article on absoloutely anything. Wikipedia has strict guidelines on what makes it and what doesn't. <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 07:20, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Also another reason I feel it should be deleted is that even the moderators of the site think this is not needed. <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 21:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you take a closer look, it is not "the moderators", it is "a moderator". On the lowest rung of the ladder, if I may add. The site administrator is well aware of this article and supports its creation and commented in support of its existance as the Rickster, thereby rendering that argument of your's moot.</dd>
