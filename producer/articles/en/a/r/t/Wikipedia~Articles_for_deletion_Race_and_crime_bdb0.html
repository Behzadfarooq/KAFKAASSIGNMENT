<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up this sad, sick article. I think I have to vote this way, but we're an encyclopedia and the subject itself is notable and, in theory, could be written without animus and actual racism. There simply are differences in crime rates by race (as well as by sex, age, ethnicity and just about every other way you could chop up a population; and other subjects besides crime could also be looked at that way). This article will always have to fight off the racists and the politically correct people. I guess you just can't avoid it. Nature of the Wikipedia beast. What a chore. I'm going to delete the part about Jews and North Africans not being "white". Ugh! <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 02:20, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have been trying to come up with an alternative merge suggestion...I'm surprised that the subject was not handed elsewhere in some (better) way. As an alternative proposal, perhaps the page could just be defered in favor of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">Racial profiling</a>, which I think is the essence of the article here proposed for deleetion, that minorities are more likely to be involved in crime, although the racial profiling article does a much better job. If you would allow me one rant, in this (in my opinion racist) article, there is no mention of say, white-collar crime, which is almost exclusively committed by caucasians, and argueably has a much greater per-crime impact on society (I'm white myself, by the way). <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakerforever_a413.html" title="User:Jakerforever">Jakerforever</a> 13:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per arguments above. Normally I would vote keep in this instance. The article itself is important, but a collection of statistics implying whitey is best is not helpful, and should not be used as a basis for this article. Redirect per Bobanny as there is nothing to salvage from the current one. <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">mceder</a> (<a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">u</a> <a href="../../../m/c/e/User_talk%7EMceder_b9e9.html" title="User talk:Mceder">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mceder_ec10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mceder">c</a>) 07:58, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep with <i>massive</i> cleanup</b> - Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowdlerized.html" title="Bowdlerized">bowdlerized</a>. Like it or not this topic is brought up often in the real world, regardless of how much distaste one may feel for even considering such a comparison. There is plenty of information out there on this topic, but the current revision reflects information that is either cherry-picked or from <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe</a> sources. The POV of the article is <b>definitely</b> slanted, as almost every statistic is compared to the corresponding for "White" people. 90% of the current content needs to be thrown out, which would normally lead us to delete or merge the article. The problem is that a) <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_censored.html" title="Wikipedia is not censored">Wikipedia is not censored</a> so we can't really salt it, and b) if we delete it some racist hack will just re-create it, probably with even worse sources. (As it is some of the sources are quite respectable, just summarized shoddily) A far better solution would be for some intelligent, well-reasoning editors to take an interest in this page and turn it into an unbiased, complete, speculation and conclusion free article. I'm willing to chip in a bit, but it'll definitely take several editors working together to make this article what it should be. On the positive side, it will likely turn into a good (if controversial) article. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 09:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think the racist stuff can or should be purged in a re-write, since that's part of the subject's significance. I remember when <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Philippe_Rushton_c22d.html" title="J. Philippe Rushton">J. Philippe Rushton</a> - a professor at a mainstream Canadian university - came out with his book. He was quickly and decisively denounced by other academics for using dubious methodology and scientifically invalid interpretations of the data (things like ignoring that variations were greater within his racial categories than across categories, which signifies that the racial categories were arbitrary). Normal criminologists deal with race as a sociological, not biological, phenomenon, which leads to something quite different than the contents of this article, but the biological determinism is still an aspect that merits encyclopedic treatment because the racists don't always stay on the fringes where they belong. Also, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">racial profiling</a> is something quite different, and is more about law enforcement than criminology. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 05:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The issue isn't that the sources are "racist", it's that many of them fail <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>I wasn't suggesting that anyone's proposing censorship. I also don't think whoever does a rewrite needs to use what's already in the article as a starting point at all (per WP:NPOV and WP:NOR). However, the racist element here probably shouldn't be excluded as an irrelevant fringe perspective because it periodically sparks controversy and gets mainstream coverage <a href="http://www.psychology.uoguelph.ca/faculty/winston/papers/rushton.html" class="external text" title="http://www.psychology.uoguelph.ca/faculty/winston/papers/rushton.html" rel="nofollow">see here, for example</a>. On a practical note, dealing with the racist perspective encyclopedically would also make it easier to protect the article from it being highjacked with original research (inappropriate edits are more likely to be reverted in articles where the standards have been set high by proper citations, NPOV, etc.) I'm not arguing that the racist perspective should necessarily take up much space in the article; it'll ultimately take a bit of research to determine what the rewritten article should consist of and in what proportions. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 19:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> - I'd love to see people volunteer to take this article over and clean it up, as it's great for Wikipedia to encourage learning about all sides of the topic. However, I think it'll always be a permanent magnet for POV complaints and re-editing that adds new OR and SOAPBOX violations - you'd need an army putting this article on their watchlists forever to keep it safe. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 23:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> - I gave a cursory look at the article and every single statement made has been attributed with an outside link. No OR or POV jumped out, nor did I see fact tags. I'm sorry, but while perhaps refutations and counter-statistics could be added, I don't see why this article has to be deleted, except maybe that people find it distasteful. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 23:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> - The POV issue is a type of systematic sampling bias, in that all statistics are specifically compared to "Whites", using them as a sort of control group and making this article so that it reads from "the white point of view". The article also notably omits certain statistics, such as the arrest vs. conviction rates of certain races, and implicitly directs the reader to draw conclusions concerning the general "lawfulness" of certain races. POV-pushing doesn't have to "jump" out at you to be present. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 21:32, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The relationship between racial origin and involvement in the criminal justice system is a notable subject discussed by persons from all shades of the political spectrum in many countries. Wikipedia should maintain an article in regard to it. The solution to POV in to add/alter content. In regard to fringe sources I list here most of those contained within the article: U.S. Department of Justice · Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Statistics, New York Times, The Telegraph, The Independent, The Home Office,Research Branch Correctional Service of Canada, New Zealand Department of Corrections and Australian Bureau of Statistics. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomper_c946.html" title="User:Romper">Romper</a> 21:40, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This is undoubtedly a valid article topic, although I don't think lumping together statistics from various countries (not to mention continents) was a good idea. The nom provides 7 reasons to delete, one of which (not encyclopedic) is overly vague. 3 others are obviously inaccurate descriptions of the article (not factual, lack of context, lack of verification). That leaves: POV (inclusive of "misleading"), original research, and attack page. This is not a blatant attack page, so that can be dropped as well. The fact that sources exist in most cases, inclusive of this one, means this is not original research (perhaps incomplete research). There is no "unique synthesis"--it's simply a poorly- or insufficiently-performed synthesis. That leaves only POV, which I have never before supported as a reason to delete an article. This time, I will <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">make an exception</a>. This article was clearly created with a POV agenda (for instance, it doesn't even mention that perceived racial effects are significantly reduced after controlling for socioeconomic status). There are more than enough available reliable sources about the relationship between race and crime (government records and scholarly articles) to write a good article but no effort was made to incorporate them. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 21:49, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
