<p>The result was <b>Speedy Deleted</b> per CSD G4 (repost). This is an identical copy of the article considered at Kitty May Ellis and deleted at AfD (as it was reinterpreted by DRV.) Since even the original closer agreed to overturn the original keep, appeals regarding this content belong at DRV.

So there is no way to know who, except I see one of the same persons who have viciously attacked this article in the past, running abour deleteing any reference to it. So what do you think? Any *new* review should either be based exclusively on new comments, or should take into account the many responders in the original AfD who voted to KEEP. And should not be done, in the middle of the night, in a few hours. The persons interested in the history of the Pacific Northwest in general are not awake at 3 in our morning to respond to attacks on our published history by people who have no idea what's going on, and who are boldly lied to by others in the response pool. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:00, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This person is one of if not *the* only narrative, first-person, source for many events in early Pacific Northwest history. The original article stated that quite clearly.

And the article and the AfD and review revealed quite clearly that most of her diaries are comments on newspaper articles (which means she isn't the only source), and furthermore that your argument does not really matter as long as she doesn't pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:19, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't you ever get tired of constantly making things up to try to *win* your point? The point isn't whether "most" of the diaries are x y or z. The point is that *some* of what she says, is very relevant to the history of this region. So stop trying to spin this discussion by masking what's really going on here. You refuse to even read the diaries to see what they say, but suddenly you're an expert on them? And you constantly mischaracterize what's in the diaries, in the Afd, in the Review, and now here. Anyone who reads them can see the value of the source. And if she is valuable as a source, then she needs an article to explain WHO she was. That's pretty simple. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Undent. Oh I understand it quite clearly, as it's been discussed ad absurdum in these multiple attempts to wipe our history out. <i>Clearview, founders and pioneers</i>, Frances Smith, 1982. John Brown &amp; Co. Everett. states&#160;:" Miss Ellis' diaries, should they ever be completely published promise to be a significant source for the history of the Pacific Northwest, she having come here in its infancy in 1883 and lived here her entire life. I here give a brief biography and a few pages of some example stories that were gleaned from just a few of her journals, and proofread by my publisher, but space cannot allow me to publish more". <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:48, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom (and nearly a speedy as an attempt to re-create a deleted article). I recall that past commentors had some serious concerns about <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>. I also think it may be difficult to verify some of the claims in the article. One such claim is that Ellis is "one of" or "the only" narrative, first-person sources of information for the Pacific Northwest. For example, one would have to comb the Hudson Bay Co. archives, various university libraries, and state and provincial archives to ensure that there are no such other first person accounts of life in what is now Washington and B.C. for this time period. I am also a bit concerned because the creator of this article verges on <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a> (as can be seen in this discussion) and acts in a manner that is <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">overly possessive</a>. That, however, is not a reason for deletion, it's just a concern about the constant appearance and disappearance of this article. The creator of the article is not helping his cause by such behaviour. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some of the sources don't seem to exist (particularly <i>"Clearview, founders and pioneers"</i>), and the ones that do aren't about her directly.

<li>Logically, if Ellis is is "'one of'" or 'the only' narrative, first-person sources of information for the Pacific Northwest", historians covering the time and area should be leaning heavily on her material for their research -- yet mention of her seems notable by its complete absence from Google Books, Google Scholar, or even Worldcat. <b>Delete</b> on verifiability grounds and on making a suspect claim about her uniqueness as a diarist. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:24, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your argument fails logic. This source has not been easily available for historians to consult. The only persons who have consulted the works are the sources I cited, whose works are local in scope, and limited in copies (to my knowledge at least). These is no requirement on wikipedia that a person be widely known already, outside their focal group. In fact your argument fails the notability critieria, which states, in fact, the exact opposite. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 00:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do believe that if an artical has information that is useful for the research of our Ancestery ,Then it should be left alone ,I would like to heaar the reason for the deletion,It is such athrill when you can find out the History in ones family, There stiries are why we are here today .Sio It is so important to keep thes ethings available.and not hidden.Thank you for the time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.227.67.217 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.227.67.217_72d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.227.67.217">contribs</a>).</small> 02:07, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. By 1883 the Pacific Northwest should have been populated enough for other sources besides a girl's diary to exist. Although the article claims that she was a first-person source for "many newsworthy events," the article doesn't mention a single "newsworthy event," except perhaps claiming to have met Chief Joseph. All I see are lists of moves from town to town, jobs she took, and comments on her family members. Where are all these events she is supposed to have witnessed? --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 04:00, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well if these rambunctious editors would relax, you'd get a chance to see them. As it is, they keep deleting the article *as I am creating it*. It's going to be hard to prove notability, if every time I find another notable thing the article gets deleted again. And she wasn't a girl number one, and I think watching Tarkio get created from nothing is notable, since there is *no* other narrative source which claims that for one thing. That isn't the sole notable thing, but again this comment proves another editor refuses to actually read the diaries. Editors who vote, and yet refuse to acquaint themselves with the situation shouldn't be counted. Just like the one who claim "not verifiable" and yet refuse to attempt to verify. Verifiability is not whether it's *easy*, its whether its *possible* and Kittie passes that test with flying colors. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 04:10, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
