<li><b>Delete</b>. Agree with submitter. See: <a href="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com/about.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.torrenttyphoon.com/about.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Apparently wikipedia is being used to provide an easy-to-update page for the vendor in lieu of updating a page on their site.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ended up on the wikipedia article through that same link. This is an abuse of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/s/k/User%7EOska_3d36.html" title="User:Oska">Oska</a> 02:42, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> No evidence this site is encyclopedic; The page is POV and promotional. However I disagree with the nominator and a couple of the above votes about the reasons for deletion. If this were to be a good Wikipedia article, there would be no objection to the site linking to us. We should evaluate the article according to the same criteria as any other. Perhaps, in time, we should expand the guidelines of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:autobiography</a> to include promotions such as this? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 05:22, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I see little difference in the content from that found in say <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. If it is POV then we can change it. --<a href="../../../r/j/s/User%7ERjstott_f82b.html" title="User:Rjstott">Rjstott</a> 05:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: This website has existed for less than two weeks, and it's not yet known how many people will ever know of it. Microsoft Windows has been available for twenty years and nearly all the computer users in the world know of it. If you don't think that's a significant difference, fair enough. I do, so no change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:00, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Rjstott, I'm not sure you quite understand what they did. They basically are pointing their website back to a Wikipedia article, which is very very against policy. Very.&#160;:) Content doesn't matter that much, honestly. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 05:42, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think I understand perfectly well and wonder what the fuss is about. Both of the policies cited need a serious stretch of imagination to cover this situation if it is really seen as a no-no. Do you suggest that if the referring web-site had a copy of this then it is ok. There is serious merit in having a definitive view and that that definition would be the one in Wikipedia. The problem I see is that the creator of the page might suppress any change and keep it POV. However the rules of Wikipedia would sort that out and have already given the article Public Domain status?--<a href="../../../r/j/s/User%7ERjstott_f82b.html" title="User:Rjstott">Rjstott</a> 09:47, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Woohookitty, how do you feel about <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/007457.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/007457.cfm" rel="nofollow">this</a> blog entry from a Macromedia employee? --guest 00:12, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Agree that POV is not an issue regarding deletion, this is a very important point. But the issue here is that this article is promotional by its very nature.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is much condensed now, and I put all the information that was on it on my About page... so I think it is fine now.

<li>I'm not yet. "We have served 19704 searches," says its front page. For a <i>search engine</i>, that's nothing. The article says it "will search the major torrent websites and pool their results onto one page;" so it's a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metasearch_engine.html" title="Metasearch engine">metasearch engine</a>, or a script that relies entirely on results from other sites. It's longstanding official policy that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a web guide, or a vehicle for self-promotion. I can't see squaring this with a keep vote, or I could write my own metasearch script and spread notice around and have a Wikipedia article the next week. I hope keep voters understand how low this would set the bar for the notability of websites. <b>Userfy</b> to User:SubKamran or a subpage, without a redirect from the main article space. Bring it back to the main article space if and when it starts getting cited in major media, hitting the high ranks in Alexa, etc, and if someone other than the person behind the site puts it there. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 20:50, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Notability is all very well to apply to people (because there are so many of us and we're vain and like to see our names on websites, and most of us aren't of much interest to anyone beyond our families) but here we have a publicly available (if very new) website and an article containing verifiable information about it. That is all that Wikipedia policy requires of an article. An article about a website of this type doesn't have to establish "notability". The question is whether or not it's an accurate article about a website that people may wonder if they want to use. They could try the website if they knew (or guessed) the URL or they could enter the name in Google and be brought to Wikipedia to read about it first. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:50, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree with ya a bit, Tony. I think notability is an issue no matter whether it's a company or a person. Otherwise, Wikipedia could very easily become a web directory and it shouldn't be. I mean I work for a small ISP in Wisconsin that has 7,000 users. Are we public? yep. Are we notable? No. We're just a plain ISP. The problem with opening up that can of worms is that Wikipedia is not meant to be a web directory. Once Typhoon Torrent becomes well known, great. Otherwise (and especially in an age where using open source materials, anyone can make a program), we're opening ourselves up to alot of crapola that doesn't belong here. You describe it as whether or not its an accurate article about a website that people may wonder if they want to use. Isn't that a description of a web directory or search engine? That's what web directories or search engines are for, NOT an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 22:09, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I fail to see how it is advertising now that all the fluff has been removed and I do not link back to it anymore. All in all, I don't mind if it's deleted if it goes against WikiPedia's policies. Let's examine it now: 1) "or vehicle for propaganda and advertising" -- The article is now in a neutral point of view, no advertising, I do not link back to it anymore. The article provides a brief and concise explanation to what Torrent Typhoon is. But like I said, I will not cry if you remove it if it goes against policies. --SubKamran 1 May 2005</li>

<dd>It sounds misleading to me. Even taking "shadows" into account, (and I'm not exactly sure what those are) Islamofascism gets <b>610</b> (not 601) Google hits, and 997 Yahoo hits. On Google "Islamic fascism" gets another 521, "Islamist fascism" another 296, and "Muslim fascism" another 129, for a total of 1556 (though there will no doubt be some overlap). All of these pages are referring to the same topic. On the other hand, "American fascism"'s <b>436</b> (not 445) hits refer to all sorts of things; movements in the 30s, modern day Republicans, Lyndon Larouche, even the Green Party!

<dd>Well, it shows that people have used the term, not that it actually means anything. A series of articles on Uses of the term "Islamofascism"/"Judeofascism"/"Christofascism"/"Littlegreenmanofascism" would be properly sourced to such uses, but articles about phenomena of those names?

<li>If the term is used in a notable fashion it deserves a WP entry.

<li>I'm not sure what a "notable fashion" is. Are insults notable because of who uses them or why they used them? Maybe. But writing about the use of an insult is, as I said, different from writing about the insult itself. If I note that X calls Y a Zhead, does that merit an article on Zhead? I think the article is then actually about the use of Zhead as an insult, not Zhead itself.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:50, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I voted to re-direct <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> since I don't think the article can be keep strictly to the use of the term as an insult. But, Islamofacism is the article people are trying to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> about anyway. The general consensus is that its a bad point, by virtue of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> being a pejorative term that people are likely to encounter and look up, while the others are just madeupwords. In any event my indignation was aimed at the fact that the point was made properly in the VfD there when several people commented we were inviting people to create americanofascism or hindufascism or or or ..... Actually going and creating one of the articles to prove the point was counter productive but realtivly understandable. Creating a second article with even less merit than the first (and I mean this in terms of probability of encountering the term not the supposed phenomena) after the fist was delete. At this point even assuming good faith it is starting too look like it is just ment to disruption of the wiki or as some kind of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantrum.html" title="Tantrum">tantrum</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 20:06, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I stumbled across this article by looking for a "random page", and was perplexed at what I read. Shouldn't encyclopaedia entries be reserved for people/places/things/etc. meriting them? This is not one. If you allow this one, my companies and I will be the next to be immortalized in this questionable manner. Will Wikipedia become a place where one can post one's resume or into which one can place links directed to pages which are, effectively, advertisements? Eventually, if this kind of behavior is permitted and encouraged (by any failure to delete them), that is exactly what will happen. I guess if Wikipedia doesn't care that their hard drive space is being occupied by egomaniacs, then fine, but this is clearly not someone worthy of an entry. Sorry for my longwindedness. I'm new to seeing crappy entries like this, but am keen to improve Wikipedia as much as possible.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the article noted that the band had been nominated for a Dove Award, it would be easier to determine whether the band was notable.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Hence, the Doves are not taken particularly seriously by many musicians or music fans."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I don't have a strong feeling about this particular case, but the current article completely fails to establish any notability at all. Instead of telling us about what quick searches show, how about fixing the article so that the band's notability is evident to everyone. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 04:37, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Then that's a borderline POV/original research or at least poor wording problem with <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dove_Award_f7d5.html" title="Dove Award">Dove Award</a>. In the Christian music community everybody seems to know about them, and anybody curious about Christian music would quickly too.

<dd>It is my interpretation of this text (which I studied in the original) as excluding the possibility of deletion at <i>this</i> level of process.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to clarify here—the only reason I put this article up for deletion is because EJay Day has done absolutely nothing that I know of since American Idol. Sure, he was on the Season One tour; he was also on the finalists' album (I think). But he has done nothing on his own aside from that. I'm not saying we need to delete all Top 12 articles; but I agree with <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> insofar as people whose only notability is finalist status on AI.

<li>Comment: If Ejay Day is so important to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Karaoke</a>, mention him in that article. He is simply not important enough for a standalone article and he is not in the slightest bit notable outside the karaoke context. It <i>does</i> hurt WP to include these sorts of articles. It isn't a question of WP not being paper.

<li>It's useful to scholars <i>in context</i>. Scholars of pop culture won't look up Ejay Day because he's simply not notable.

Consider researching all the contestants of American Idol, The Apprentice and The Bachelor. Put the non-notable contestents in the articles for those shows and the information is in 3 places.

<li><b>Delete</b> sorry but this band still isnt that notable. BEC Recordings is not Epic or Warners - its a specialist label for mostly Christian bands many of them very obscure. A fair slice of those Google hits are by fans leaving messages on blogs about the band. As has been pointed out on vfd before, the Google Test is not a good indicator of notability for music or pornography. Their "national" tour seems to be mostly confined to churchs, religious festivals and small stadiums. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 04:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't want this to sound like a personal attack, but... if every band that is on this site has to have a page full of #1 hits and several national tours in which they sold out every <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> stadium, should we delete all the others (including those who started some of the more obscure musical genres)? That's a strict criterion; Christian rock basically is on the fringes of mainstream rock, so its bands don't sell a lot of records and are mainly stuck in the church culture. Pretty much any Christian artist that isn't <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Day_0bc9.html" title="Third Day">Third Day</a> doesn't crank out #1 hits in the general market or sell out a very large stadium in every show. (Also just a side note: several Christian festivals - see <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornerstone_Festival_4f45.html" title="Cornerstone Festival">Cornerstone Festival</a> for one of the examples - draw tens of thousands of guests.) Falling Up is also featured on <a href="http://www.xthealbum.com" class="external text" title="http://www.xthealbum.com" rel="nofollow">X 2005</a>, a compilation of Christian rock hits from 17 bands, most of which have articles on this site that have been accepted without question. If you'd like to go through and delete all of those bands too, go ahead and do it. But keep things standard across the site. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:09, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I never mentioned #1 hits. Should we make exceptions to Christian bands just because they wish to be identified in that genre? I dont think so.

<ul>
<li>That depends. The Billboard Christian Rock and Heatseekers charts aren't based on many tens of thousands of unit sales a week like the rock and pop charts. Making #1 on those charts would still be a little bit notable. Merely showing up on the genre charts (Top Ten albums of the year? Top 100 albums of the week?) is not notable by itself. How meaningfully they "charted" isn't shown in these comments. Having one release on BEC Recordings doesn't make a band notable; they have to do that themselves.

<li><b>Keep</b> Apologies for going silent; my access to the wikipedia is limited (I'm only getting on at the school library) but I'm still here. You also might be able to check IPs or something if you want evidence that I'm different from the first guy to make the article... Also, as far as notability goes; with Falling Up's Crashings being ranked as 9,427 in music sales. Britney Spears' "Oops, I did it again" album is ranked at #9,591 in music sales. Granted, if you added up all of Britney's albums she'd certainly outperform Falling Up, and this is only a statistic on amazon.com, but for them to outsell one of Britney's albums probably means that they're notable enough for listing on the wikipedia. (And the article <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falling_Up_8dcf.html" title="Falling Up">Falling Up</a> is about an album by Digby. On amazon.com's music rankings, Digby's album is ranked 96,371 in sales.

<li>When EDRA reaches mainstream notability as the distributed disservice whose security failures or standards-breaking caused the Great Windows Crash of 2006, that might make Jason Hogg WP-worthy if he's still program manager or if he's blamed in Congressional hearings. Until then, no, not every department head at every big corporation needs an article of two or three sentences here.
