<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keene%2C_New_Hampshire_4507.html" title="Keene, New Hampshire">Keene, New Hampshire</a> since most of the stuff here is pretty basic, and I am unconvinced that information about school clubs is altogether encyclopedic. Nevertheless, info on a town's education system is valid so I'll oppose outright deletion. The wish to have <i>independent</i> sources is mostly one of verifiability as far as I can see. Unless someone is seriously contesting the <i>existence</i> of this school, I cannot see why the sources used should be a serious issue. (Dividing schools into "notable" and "non-notable" based on whether a newspaper has or has not happened to write something about them is a poor practice, which is the very reason I have disputed the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guideline.)

<dd>"Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources <i>wherever possible</i>" (italics mine). Nowhere does it say that articles based only on primary sources <i>should be deleted</i>. That is a leap of logic that is unsupported in the policy. The existence of the school is easily verifiable, therefore there is no reason to delete the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I added an external link to the Great Schools Web site. Since every or nearly every high school, at least in the United States, has its own Web site with information on the school, and since the Great Schools Web site has information and individual web pages on all or nearly all high schools in the country, you can <b>always</b> assume that a U.S. high school has at least two sources of information on it, plus whatever you can dig up on Google, Google News and Google News Archives. In addition, with the "No Child Left Behind" act, state departments of education are increasingly posting statistics on high schools on the state DOE Web sites. That should be enough notability for all public high schools in the U.S. It is hard for a public U.S. high school <b>not</b> to be notable by Wikipedia's definition. I think the only reason to redirect a high school article is lack of interest by editors in building up the article and letting the article become a vandal magnet. I argue <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">here</a> that all high schools are inherently notable. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> on the Great Schools website. As Noronton says, it lists essentially every school. The information it lists is posted by the school, and the word "great" in the title is an obvious misnomer. It is therefor an uncritical list, and inherently trivial, and cannot be used as a RS for any purpose. Ditto with DOE Websites: they list every school. Noronton argues that this makes all schools notable. I'd say that this is just about as notable as the mere listing on Amazon makes a book notable. They are both indiscriminate lists. The listings on these sites are trivial in the WP sense. Now, if something in such a listing is truly noteworthy, and confirmed by independent sources, that is another matter. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
