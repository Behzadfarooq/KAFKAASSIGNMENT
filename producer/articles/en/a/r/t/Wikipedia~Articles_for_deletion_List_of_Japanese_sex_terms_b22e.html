<dd>I was asked to provide a reasoning behind my decision, so here goes: 1. If I count&#160;!votes I get roughly 21 dels, 13 keeps, that's a 60% majority for deleting, but really in no man's land between no consensus (ca. 50%) and rough consensus (ca. 67%). 2. The policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is very much in flux over whether glossaries are exemptions to the <i>Not a dictionary</i> provision. Unless there is consensus to strike the exemption I prefer to stick with the status quo ante (still reflected in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), which is that glossaries are acceptable. 3. Most importantly, the content of the article changed significantly in the last days of the debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> thanks mostly to edits by <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a>, and this change was reflected in a number of delete→keep changes and late keep&#160;!votes, so the early "delete not sourced"&#160;!votes are no longer on solid factual ground. Taking these three factors into account I did not see that consensus for deletion was established. This is a no consensus closure though so it can be renominated anytime. I recommend waiting three to four weeks for the policy debate to be settled and to see if the article improves, and consider renomination then. But of course I might be wrong, and that's what we have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This list contains Japanese terms for sex, sex organs, sex positions, and so on. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. We should not be hosting random lists of foreign words. Although we <i>do</i> have some lists like this, unlike those there's no particular reason to maintain a list of sex terms in various languages, since sex-related articles on English Wikipedia are written in English, and those that are specifically on Japanese sex topics define all the terms they use. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 06:58, 9 November 2006 (UTC) Erm. <b>Delete</b>, obviously.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is inherently unverifiable. We have no way of knowing if these definitions are accurate. If anywhere, it belongs on the Japanese Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I fail to see any merit in this ever-growing list of foreign language sex-slang. It fails what Wiki is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a>, so I'm suprised it's managed to stay up for so long. At best this article is an unverifiable list of foreign language slang with minimal use as any kind of reference point, and at worse it's just acting as a bulletin board for people to post titillating rude words from Japan. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShizuokaSensei_e098.html" title="User:ShizuokaSensei">ShizuokaSensei</a> 08:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uh - this is clearly not a dictionary entry. Thus <i>wikipedia is not a dictionary</i> doesn't apply. There's zero plausible basis for even trying to assert it's a dictionary entry. Clearly it's a stub or start class list - but being a stub is hardly a criterion for deletion. It's hard to aruge that it's not a dictionary entry because there's no argument to be made - a cursory visual inspection reveals it not to be. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>If you are using the definition of encyclopedic as "an alphabetical organization of fields of knowledge" then you are being pedantic. It is not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, no matter how much it tries to fit a dictionary definition of encyclopedic. It is not a collection of verifiable facts. If you are saying that it is, then I respectfully think you are wrong and agree to disagree.</li>
<li>If you are suggesting that articles, without sources, that are little more than stubs, that have existed in the same state for months, are verifiable, do you mean theoretically? Because, theoretically, <i>anything</i> is verifiable to some people. But it is not verifiable in terms of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for a very large majority of terms on that list. --<font style="background:black"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="LightSteelBlue">Shrieking Harpy</font></a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/17px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="17" height="11" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a></font><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup>Count</sup> 18:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, apart from being demonstratably not an inclusionist (I've compared my AfD votes and it's pretty clear I'm a "centrist" on the issue - my keep arguments for articles that are deleted are a percentage of my keep arguments that equal to the percentage of my delete arguments where the article is kept) I'll show what the problem is when you vote to delete an article without first reading it.</dd>
<dd>If an article is appropriate for an encyclopaedia, but not for "the spirit of an encyclopaedia" then voting to delete it clearly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Rather than make value judgements about whether I particularly like a topic or not, I apply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she ain't paper</a> and ask merely "Is it encyclopaedic?" - here even you admit the answer is yes, so I'll move on.</dd>
<dd>I'll ask <i>is it sourced?</i> For this article, the answer is <b>yes</b> - clearly it's important to read the article to determine whether or not it's sourced. Merely guessing can result in the wrong answer. Being sourced (such as this article is) brings the advantage of a vaguely NPOV test of notability - someone else has found it notable enough to document - this is (I believe) a much more NPOV test than <i>Do I personally find this article interesting?</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - In addition to the problems we see alot with lists we also have the fact that WP is not a dictionary, not a slang archive. The article lacks sources and is unverifiable. -- <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 16:45, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'd just like to note that people aren't providing reasons for their "keep" votes. It's not enough to say it's encyclopaedic, particularly when so many have argued that it's inherently <i>unencyclopaedic.</i> While items <i>on</i> the list may be verifiable, that still doesn't provide a convincing rationale for keeping the list itself, as mentioned in the original post. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The justification for keeping the list is that it explains a variety of encylopedic topics grouped in an obvious way. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it doesn't. It's just a list of non-English terms. All the Japanese sex-related articles should already appear in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexology_topics.html" title="List of sexology topics">List of sexology topics</a>, and every article that uses Japanese terminology should already be explaining those terms within the article. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not a slang dictionary, or even a regular dictionary. A big list of words and definitions beside them is called a dictionary. Slang is not only hard to cite, but it also means different things in different areas/eras.

<li><b>Keep</b> a precise list of terms on a given specific subject is authorized by policy. Terms such as bukkake, gokkun etc. are extremely well known and verifiable through tons of sources. I don't even understand the objection on that score. The nom seems to be questioning the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this list. Well, for better or worse, Japan and sex have been tightly intertwined in the western imagination since at least the 19th century. The interest in Japanese erotica is thus not new and is today a serious subject for critical examination and scholarship <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Japanese+erotica+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Japanese+erotica+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The vast popularity of specific Japanese porn genres in the west is just a later-day manifestation of the previous craze for Japanese erotic prints. Given the cultural divide, it is entirely appropriate for wikipedia to maintain a list of this type for its mainly English speaking readers. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Note that the list is also rather inaccurate. It might be better titled List of random Japanese words that some otaku think might sometimes be associated with sex. How the hell are "bishōjo" and "bishōnen" <i>sex terms</i>? (And in what parallel universe does anyone use the word "bishōjo" by itself to refer to eroge?)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't understand how anyone can argue this is encyclopædic. It is a list of foreign words with definitions. Additionally, <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> is absolutely right about it being a very Western-otaku-biased "article" with very little Japanese language comprehension: even as a dictionary article it is not very good. The onus of explaining the individual terms should be on the individual articles, as linked-to from the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Category%7EJapanese_sex_terms_138a.html" title="Category:Japanese sex terms">Japanese Sex Terms</a> category. Finally, do the 'keepers' not see the redundancy, all other arguments aside, of a "list of japanese sex terms" article within the overall category "Japanese sex terms"? <a href="../../../m/r/e/User%7EMrErku_4e64.html" title="User:MrErku">Erk</a>, 1345, 10 November 2006 (GMT-8).

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Presuming the terms can be verified.

<p>So I checked as to why that list survived. <i>"Like other 'lists of trivia', they are interesting and not detrimental to the encyclopedia."</i> Seems like that could apply here as well. It is all verifiable info. Its interesting. Seriously, what is the point of lists at all, anyways? None of them are "unencyclopaedic."

<li>Has it occured to you that those articles may be just as deserving as deletion as this one? After all Wikipedia is not subject to precident.(actually the list of films with the word fuck is very well sourced, but is not a dictionary list) <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 01:16, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree with HighInBC's comment. I can't find a thing to verify most of these terms, but if they're easily verifiable, cite sources and I'll happily change votes! The main sticking point here is the lack of verifiability, so at least to my thinking, fix that and the whole issue goes away. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 01:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this list is going to survive, what is listed on it needs to be very closely monitored. The fact so little of this article's definitions are unique to Japan is a big part of the problem with it. Very little of what was listed is unique to Japan - it simply defines a Japanese word for something which goes on all over the world. This is a deeper problem with Wiki wearby numerous topics of little or no note are documented in great depth, but let's not get into that here. So, what is of note out of the article? Just up to H, I'd argue that at least half of what is currently there is not in anyway unique to Japan and merely serves as a DicDef.
<ul>
<li>Bukkake: A Japanese invention - worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Chikan: Not unique to Japan - of little note. However, has a long and meandering article (lifting large sections from Rotton.com as a source) suggesting otherwise...</li>
<li>Ecchi: Links to the article for the English letter H. A foreign slang word for sex - of little note</li>
<li>Enjo kosai: The Japanese term for underage prostitution - at a strech worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Futanari: Japanese for hermaphrodites - of little note</li>
<li>Fuzoku: Defined as meaning "sex culture" in Japanese Doesn't have an article. Of little note.</li>
<li>Gokkun: A genre of Japanese porn. Worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Hentai: Defined as "pervert." This is a much wider part of sex culture, so worthy of inclusion</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- I voted to delete this before, but I've changed my mind, because the article is in different shape now. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but these are not simply translations of English phrases into Japanese but rather a completely different beast: sociological phenomena of sexuality in Japan, explained, and with articles about (most of) them. This could maybe use a renaming of some kind, but this list is cut down to the essentials and is encyclopedic. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> and you'll see that this kind of list is much like other kinds of lists given there. I can't help but think that many of the people who endorse deletion under the dictionary argument haven't noticed these points, but rather noticed the "list of ... terms" and didn't like the article concept. So like I said, maybe renaming is a good idea, but I'm not sure to what. Still, this goes well beyond mere "terms." <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
