Anyways, seeing as I didn't write anything involved in this, I'm not gonna vote to delete it. However, seeing as I really don't want anything involving me here anymore (especially after this), I ain't even gonna vote (even though it really doesn't meet notability (for once)).

<li><b>keep</b> Google doesn't capture everything. Relying on it alone and not doing a narrower manual search is academic laziness at best. I have participated in the DOR webcomics project for two years, and my entries can be located <a href="http://tessflynn.net/node/36" class="external text" title="http://tessflynn.net/node/36" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://tessflynn.net/node/161" class="external text" title="http://tessflynn.net/node/161" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Many of the webcomic artists elect to post their entries temporarily as either a splash page or as a comic page. After the event, these pages are often removed so as not to interrupt the flow of the comic to archive readers. Furthermore, That was Zen This is Tao's entry can be located <a href="http://thatwaszen.blogspot.com/2006/11/transface.html" class="external text" title="http://thatwaszen.blogspot.com/2006/11/transface.html" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, Grey Matters <a href="http://greymatters.comicgenesis.com/d/20061117.html" class="external text" title="http://greymatters.comicgenesis.com/d/20061117.html" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, Misfile <a href="http://www.misfile.com/index.php?page=598" class="external text" title="http://www.misfile.com/index.php?page=598" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, Transe-Generations <a href="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=209" class="external text" title="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=209" rel="nofollow">2004</a> <a href="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=259" class="external text" title="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=259" rel="nofollow">2005</a>, <a href="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=314" class="external text" title="http://www.transe-generation.com/archive.asp?pgid=comic&amp;RefID=314" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, Triquetra Cats <a href="http://triquetracats.comicgenesis.com/d/20061118.html" class="external text" title="http://triquetracats.comicgenesis.com/d/20061118.html" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, and Venus Ascending <a href="http://catgirldo.comicgen.com/d/20051120.html" class="external text" title="http://catgirldo.comicgen.com/d/20051120.html" rel="nofollow">2005</a>. This is what I've found with only 20 minutes of time and there are far more I could find with another 20 minutes.

It is in violation of Wikipedia policy, and I vote this article is to be kept, as he is in the wrong here.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - important to a lot of people, and I see no reason it doesn't meet the notability criterion. Even if it did, a strong enforcement here would stink of prejudice given the looseness elsewhere.

<li><b>Keep</b> - not only would a Google search be ineffective with regard to the Day of Remembrance project but this is an important social and political project that certainly deserves its own article.

I don't think that the article itself is notable (though I may have a bias against webcomics). As SkierRMH mentions, a number of the comics don't even mention this project on their site. However, a mention of it on the remembrance page might help to emphasize that page's subject's importance within the transgendered community, and help to make the notability of that page a little more evident to people outside that community. --- <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 04:07, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Merge</b> As the original author of the page, I may have misunderstood the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria when creating this page in good faith. After doing a Google and Alexa seach just now, I found a combined total of less than 50 hits. Some of this may have to do with the fact that it is an "internet event" in which individual pages of the contributors may not be correctly meta-tagged or commented by the authors (due maybe to using a template system to produce those pages), and hence slip through. In either case, it fails the strict <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria, and it's initial inclusion reflects my lack of experience in editing wikipedia. The page should be merged with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender_day_of_remembrance.html" title="Transgender day of remembrance">Transgender_day_of_remembrance</a>, for reasons listed under the 2nd and 3rd points at <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html#Merging" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE#Merging</a> <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELauraSeabrook_2642.html" title="User:LauraSeabrook">Laura Seabrook</a> January, 29, 2007 - 21:17:08 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Verifiable if one actually goes further than a google search and visits the actual webcomics, it is an event as such OR does not apply, the only real issue is notability but Wikipedia does not assert that an event be famous for it to be notable, only that it have meaning. I can assure you for the thousands of transgendered people out there, it is very significant and notable.</li>
