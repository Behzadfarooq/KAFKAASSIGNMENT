<p>The article's creator claims that it is a "primal Internet pop-cultural reference". I would rather say vanity (and a spam link to a non-notable website with an Alexa rank of 555,448).

<dd><i>Otherwise known as "laser-face", once used a laser to rip off a shark's face. This was by no means an accident; in 1976 laser-face conned the shark into shallow water using scented candles and a hint of garlic. The 6' mako shark could not resist. Once in close enough, the shark was defenseless against the precise and accurate guiding hand that held a mild laser. It took buzz buzzelli (laser-face) 4 hours and 26 minutes to consummate his efforts. After the incident was over and the shark was faceless, the stunned crowd gazed in awe as laser-face took the bloody shark face and left the beach. Laser-face worked as a librarian and would often wear the shark face. It was later reported that laser-face was arrested for re-arranging groceries in a local grocery store in 1998. In 1999 laser-face was released and never caught in public again. As one of the witnesses on that beach on that mysterious day, I can say that no one will ever complete this feat ever again.</i></dd>

<dd>Re "vendetta:" you use that word. I wish you wouldn't, as I don't think there is one. I stand subject to correction on this, particularly by SimonP, but I have never been aware of <i>anyone</i> who thinks all high schools should be deleted, and I have never been aware of <i>any</i> organized campaign against them. If there is one, I'm sure out of the loop, because I have never received a message advising me of any school votes in progress. (And for the record, I hope I never do). Last year, at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_High_schools_938a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/High schools">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/High_schools</a>, I tried to track every school article that was created for a bit more than a month, just to see what really happens. What I found was that
<dl>
<dd>a) school articles are created at a very slow pace, slower than one per day. At that rate of creation, even if you make reasonable projections of growth, there is no credible prospect that U. S. high schools will get comprehensive coverage, comparable to sites like www.greatschools.net or to our (controversial!) Rambot town articles, in the foreseeable future.</dd>
<dd>b) I saw no evidence of any systematic attempt to delete schools. Many high school articles--generally the ones that would have had decent BEEFSTEW scores if anyone bothered to score them--sailed right in without getting nominated for deletion.</dd>
<dd>c) If there were a "vendetta," the section of the list headed "School articles created in November that have not been listed on VfD" might well have been like waving a red flag at a bull and been treated as a "hit list." It wasn't.</dd>
<dd>d) Generally, it appears to be only the very-low-quality school articles that get nominated for VfD.</dd>
<dd>e) Statement that "it's a waste of time listing these on VfD because they never get deleted" are incorrect. Many of the really bad substubs do get voted for deletion. Some do however get kept for various reasons, including some degree of improvement during the VfD comment period.</dd>
<dd>Once again, subject to correction if anyone know more history on this than I'm aware of. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:59, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>More like 95. For rough purposes, 1923 is the dividing line. Before 1923: probably OK. 1923: assume it's verboten unless there's some good reason to think otherwise. One good guide is <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/okbooks.html" class="external text" title="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/okbooks.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And song lyrics are <i>very</i> sensitive, more so than other material. You'll notice that novels are <i>very</i> punctilious about obtaining permission for quotations from song lyrics even when it's just a line or two that's being quoted.

<p>I am not an American and I don't give a shit if all you are enslaved by a corrupt theocratic messianic dictator, who throws people into jail without due process and who orders murders of American citizens and torture of innocent people abroad. But perhaps this allows me to stay more objective regarding 11/9. The official story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Some can be explained, some can't because of the wall of secrecy surrounding these events. By placing all concerns in a page called <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, Wikipedians make a judgement statement, implying that all these stories are bullshit.</p>
<p>For an example of a relatively unbiased and well-developed article, see <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a>. Compared to it, the 11/9 article on conspiracies is a joke. Supporters of official version are quick to carefully minimize the effects of their opponents' edits, by removing as much as they can.</p>
<p>The <i>open questions</i> article is a good start in fixing this deficiency of Wikipedia. It would be a shame, if a majority rule would essencially censor this topic - especially since most of the "arguments" for deletion center around it being POV. Guess what, the "conspiracies" article is the opposite POV. I vote <b>Keep</b>, but a careful and unbiased <b>merge</b> with existing articles would be a good option as well, provided that Bush supporters can control their urge to silence the opponents. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 07:08, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> POV should be rewritten not deleted. 'conspiracy theoy' is what I would call the mainstream George Bush viewpoint... I see nothing very highly POV in this article or anything nonfactual.... and if there is POV, the solution is to edit not delete, if there are nonfactual entries, they should be edited or corrceted, not deleted. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 22:58, 2005 Mar 29 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a <i>general rule</i>, yes, when an article is POV, it is preferable to edit rather than delete. However, the class of exceptions that leaps right out is when an article is not just POV but a POV fork, which this is -- Bogusstory came right out and admitted that he created this article because he couldn't make people accept what he wanted to do at the <i>existing</i> article on the 9/11 attacks. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:27, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A POV fork? Can you get POV knives too? What are you on about? And if there are people who prevented him from altering the existing article, i.e. unanalysingly deleted the assertions he added, does that mean they are right? <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 11:38, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you don't know what a POV fork is, perhaps you're not as ready for VfD as you think. A POV fork is similar to a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_fork.html" title="Code fork">code fork</a>: there's a difference of opinion and rather than <i>resolving</i> that difference of opinion, one or both parties says "Okay, you do it <i>your</i> way over <i>there</i>; I'll be over <i>here</i> doing it <i>my</i> way." In open source, forking a project can be a healthy response to a difference in opinion. In Wikipedia it is recognized as an unacceptable alternative to actually resolving the issue. We want the best article that can be written on each subject, not one article containing X's slant on the subject, another containing Y's slant on it, a third for Z's, et cetera. That's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>'s major modus operandi, but it's not Wikipedia's. Addressing your "if" -- yes, <b>if</b> the people who reverted his changes at the existing 9/11 articles did it by "unanalysingly deleting" his assertions, that would be against the policies of Wikipedia. Even if that unproven claim that the deletions were unanalysed and unthinking was true, however (and if I had a dime for every user who claims "they reverted my edits for <i>no good reason</i>" when the good reason is plain as day to everyone <i>but</i> that user...) two wrongs don't make a right. We have mechanisms in place for resolving article content disputes and POV forking is not one of them. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:06, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have a few comments. First, I guess that <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogusstory_01dd.html" title="User:Bogusstory">Bogusstory</a> might want to have a copy of the article in his user space - now is the time to make that copy. Second, I believe that the discussing points out that there are serious shortcomings in Wikipedia coverage of "tricky issues" related to 9/11. The US government was caught lying many times - the whole WMD fiasco, the attack on that Italian journalist, the prison torture, etc. I absolutely fail to see how being contrary to the official line indicates that a version is wrong. It isn't even too farfetched that Bush himself ordered a strike on the towers - worse things happened. Well, this one may be a little bit over the top... but that doesn't mean there is nothing fishy about the 9/11 story.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that we create some placeholder stubs that can be used to expand that coverage. Their talk pages could then be used to discuss how to do it best. Meanwhile, this article should, of course, be deleted according to Wikipedia procedure. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 09:48, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If your belief is that you can get votes discounted by saying "I improved the article; now none of the votes cast prior to that improvement count", you're quite mistaken.

He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member. New he found out a new thing-namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up ‚Äî gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours ‚Äî fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his death-bed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.

<p>Having nominated the article for deletion, I found that it had previously been speedily deleted on two occasions. However, the content now is very different, and I feel needs further debate. In fact, it is rather a well-written article, and far more than a stub. However, I don't feel that a single magazine article merits its own article, unless it has in some way been very influential, which this doesn't seem to have been. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 18:10, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I created the article based on an empty link directly from the Hunter Thompson page and what I thought was a need for it. Though not a particularly significant article it is indicative of Thompson's style. I also think that the relative importance of the article depends on where you're coming from. For Killy fans it probably means nothing, for Thompson followers the information is useful in locating the source and content of the original Scanlan's article, as well as giving some insights and context into Thompson's well-known sports addiction. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogan_5_aba6.html" title="User:Logan 5">Logan 5</a> 19:24, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<b>Slow Down</b> I'm a student at the school and started the TJS page earlier today. I admit, it's <i>baad</i>, but only because I just put it together! True, I shouldn't have ripped info from the TJS site (my fault), but I simply wanted to make a starting point for which myself and others associated with the school could work. I say, don't delete anything until we at least have a chance to complete the article.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I thought it would be allright to start an article for the school is the presence of articles concerning <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phillips_Exeter_Academy_058f.html" title="Phillips Exeter Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> and other, similar institutions. Of course, TJ is in no way as well known as these schools, nor does it have the resources or man-power to function as they do. Still, TJ does offer similar educational opportunities and frankly, (though I feign from making this the school's single point of interest) a similar degree of success. For example: the method of teaching at TJ is similar to (if not matching) the"<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harkness_table.html" title="Harkness table">Harkness table</a>"style as advertised by Exeter. If you are going to delete it, at least do it once the article has reached its completed form and you can truly judge its relevancy. -Cartweel 00:30 26 Mar 2005</p>

<li>VfD's last for about 2-3 weeks, so if you want to fix up the article, the clock is ticking.

<li>In other words, over 4% of the hits can be discounted by identifying one other common occurrence of the phrase "fake news".

<li><b>Comment</b>, ok now the article seems to cover several different definitions of "fake news." All of them seem to be covered better elsewhere. For instance, the parts on fake news as propaganda are better covered in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> article. The part on fake news as journalistic fraud is better covered by the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalistic_fraud.html" title="Journalistic fraud">journalistic fraud</a> article. Furthermore, inserting a section on fake news as satire contradicts the intro sentence: "Fake news ...[is] a deturpation of traditional journalism in which false facts, or government official propaganda are deliberately presented by the mass media as genuine news reports." For what its worth, I've also never heard of journalistic fraud seriously referred to as fake news. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 01:25, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Spockpedia</b> - If Wikipedia was Spockpedia, all words could be deleted through arguments. <b>All words have something in common with other words</b>, but this is not an argument for deletion. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplane.html" title="Airplane">Plane</a>, <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a>, for instance, have something in common. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">Water</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean.html" title="Ocean">ocean</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea.html" title="Sea">sea</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake.html" title="Lake">lake</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">river</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterfall.html" title="Waterfall">waterfall</a> have something in commmon, but they all exist as separate words. <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_news_release.html" title="Video news release">Video news release</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">public relations</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_news.html" title="Fake news">fake news</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_administration_payment_of_columnists.html" title="Bush administration payment of columnists">Bush administration payment of columnists</a> have also something in common, but they should all exist as separate words, as they present <b>different angles</b> and <b>unique perspectives</b>. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a></li>
<li><b>Selection of reality</b> - Every word is a <b>selection of elements</b> of reality that presents a unique perspective. Words are like <b>mathematical sets</b> with multiple intersection areas. You <b>redirect</b> A to B when all elements are equal. You <b>merge</b> A with B when A contains B or vice-versa.

<li><b>Censorship</b> - Note that you can also <b>censor ANY word</b> by dissecting it, slicing it in different pieces and rearranging the slices in different places. The word <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>, for instance, could be censored by merging it with <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeling.html" title="Feeling">feeling</a> (once love is a kind of feeling). It could also be censored by slicing it into several types of love and rearranging the slices (e.g. to <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friendship.html" title="Friendship">friendship</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity.html" title="Solidarity">solidarity</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compassion.html" title="Compassion">compassion</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, for example). <b>This is a very dangerous possibility, as deletionist censorship can be carried out intentionally by any individual or group of individuals at any time</b>, bringing serious doubts about the credibility of Wikipedia as a true "free Encyclopedia".

<li><b>Comment</b> We are not arguing that fake news should be redirected because it is similar to propaganda.

<li><b>Stalinism</b> - In the Soviet era, Josef Stalin, the Soviet leader (who was a dictator) used to <b>censor</b> articles in Encyclopedias. Just a reminder. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a></li>
<li><b>Diversity</b> - Personally, I believe in concepts like <b>diversity</b>, <b>multiplicity</b> and <b>complementariness</b>. <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange.html" title="Orange">Orange</a> is not simply a combination of <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow.html" title="Yellow">yellow</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">red</a>, it's another color.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, comparing us to Stalinists constitutes a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>, which is not allowed on wikipedia. Secondly, while I only represent myself, I can make a fair guess as to the motives of the other wikipedians who are pushing for a redirect. Thirdly, the three definitions of fake news don't seem to sit well together. The inclusion of satire completely contradicts the intro sentence, and fake news as satire is better covered in the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> article. I've never heard journalistic fraud refered to seriously as fake news, but if it was, the definition is better covered in the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalistic_fraud.html" title="Journalistic fraud">journalistic fraud</a> article. Which leaves the propaganda side of fake news, which is better covered in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> article. The fact remains that fake news is not a concept radically different from any of the topics it purports to cover, and having a sepearte article on it is redundant. This is not censorship, merely improving Wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - I see your point. I never meant to attack you personally, my dear friend. However, the rules of Wikipedia allow Stalinist censorship, that's my point. And in my humble interpretation what is being carried out here is a kind of censorship. While deleting an article is a right assured by the rules, the abusive use of this right may constitute censorship. Please read again sections "Spockpedia" and "Censorship" above and section "Mr. Editor" below. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a></li>
<li><b>Satirical fake news and journalistic fraud</b> - The inclusion of satirical fake news does not contradicts the intro sentence, once webzines, portals and other producers of satire are also media outlets. Secondly, satirical news contain facts known to be false presented as real news - that's the definition (although in this case the public usually knows about the satirical aspect, but this detail was not specified in the intro sentence). Thirdly, journalistic fraud is a broad term but it applies to fake news every time the reporter or journalist knows the facts are false (e.g. when he/she invents the report) or knows for instance that the source is lying but presents it as genuine. Please reread the intro sentence, it covers well the three aspects of fake news, and maybe new aspects to be added in the future.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a></li>

<li><b>Mr. Editor</b> - Please may I use this space to grab your attention for a few seconds to focus something else (I don't know other way of doing this). Of course it is your decision to keep or delete this article, but whatever is your decision here I ask you - or should I say I beg you - to talk to other Editors or to your superiors if they exist, about something very serious&#160;: <b>Wikipedia can be used by a group of people to deliberately censor words, masquerading censorship as technical deletions</b>. In a literal interpretation, these people are following the rules. But do rules permit censorship&#160;? If they really do, this is a flaw, IMHO. I strongly suggest that certain users should be <b>closely watched</b>. User <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> for instance created this page of VFD only 25 minutes after I added the <b>first scratch</b> of the article. He didn't wait to see if there would be new updates or developments. In his User Page, he admits to be a professional observer of pages, with purposes of deleting or merging them. How did he know about a <b>new</b> page so fast&#160;? On the other side, user <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a> seems to be eager to delete the article. Of course I'm also an enthusiast because I have <b>created</b> the article, it took me several hours of patience and work. But he alone interfered <b>five times</b> in only two days. This is really odd, to say the least. I suspect some of these users are not "technical purists" trying to defend the "integrity" of an Encyclopedia. They act more like censors, in the <b>Stalinist style</b>. Please pay attention to their future moves not only here but in all other words. And thank you for your time. P.S. If you wish, you can send me an e-mail using my user page.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a>.

<li><b>Reply</b> - Again I must say that I understand your point and that I never meant to attack nobody. As for the "Recent changes", I didn't know this button. However, you really seem to be anxious to delete this article (or at least that's my sincere impression). Notice that you came back once more and now this is your sixth participation in three days. Frankly, this sounds really odd to me. I did understand your point, but I have doubts if you understood mine&#160;: I do believe that the rules of Wikipedia allow censorship whenever there is an abusive use of the right to delete, and that this is an opportunity to discuss also this point. Reread sections "Spockpedia" and "Censorship" above. If you have a suggestion, take the opportunity to leave it. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a>

<li>You seem to be missing the point entirely. This is a VfD <i>discussion</i>, meaning that participants respond to arguments. You seem to have no problem doing this yourself. If you think my behavior is odd, take a look at any contentious VfD discussion; you will see the same pattern from regular VfD contributors. If you have a problem with deletion policy, this is not the place to make such arguments; this discussion should be for the article in question only. I don't care if you "meant" to attack or not ‚Äî it was a personal attack, plain and simple. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>‚Üî<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 22:57, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I sincerely don't see the things this way, Android, but anyway it's your interpretation. With respect to the deletion policy, you're right, this is not the place to discuss it, but I don't know any other place, and I still think it is a relevant issue to be discussed. Maybe at least you agree with me that someone (not necessarily you, but someone else) may potentially want to delete words with the deliberate intention of censoring certain ideas or angles of study over a subject, alone or guided by organized groups. Technically, any word can be deleted through arguments, if you distort them far enough. 29 Mar 2005, 01:20 GMT <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a></li>

<li><b>Mr. Editor (2)</b> - I take this opportunity to suggest the introduction of some sort of mechanism to avoid the abusive use of deletion rights by an individual or an organized group. Notice that in the present model not only individuals but organizations, companies and governments may interfere directly in Wikipedia with the purpose of censoring it, Stalinist style, once logical arguments may be twisted to delete any word. Perhaps an Ombundsman could be introduced in Wikipedia, or some kind of Council to oversee polemical deletions and cut the excesses, interfering every time the right to delete is transformed into a right to censor, Stalinist style. I thank you in advance if you pass these suggestions away or discuss them with other editors or superiors of yours. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a>
