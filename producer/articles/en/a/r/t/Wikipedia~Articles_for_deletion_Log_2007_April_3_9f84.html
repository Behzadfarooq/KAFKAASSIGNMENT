<p>No reason; was added to AfD by Majorclanger but this subpage was not created and the article itself was not tagged. 1,640 Google hits, including a CNN article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/25/dynamite.plane/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/25/dynamite.plane/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Hmmm... didn't think I actually submitted to AfD, but obviously I did. My main issue with this is that it's not an encyclopedic article at all, just a copy and paste or slight rewrite of a news article - it has next to no information about this guy apart from the single event.

<p><b>Weak Keep</b> The person in question, Ourei Harada, is indeed notable and has some media attention in Japan and some overseas countries.

<li><b>Comment</b> Tractor is definitely real and almost certainly notable, but the bulk of the article is a copyvio from <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:64j20rnac48j~T1" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:64j20rnac48j~T1" rel="nofollow">Allmusic Guide</a> (one of the more common sources for music-related copyvios). There's been a bunch of editing since the original copyvio was posted, so I'm not sure if the result is salvageable or not. As for Hewitt, he seems to be real, and was associated with the band, but even so, the notability seems marginal. Dunno. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 08:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you take the rash step of including "things I saw at Deeply Vale in 1979" in the category of "things that exist in the real world" then this band exists.I am sure it is recalled with affection by the 20,000 or so ageing hippies who were there and even if it's fame has spread no further than this I think it is enough to count as notable.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> both unless citations are added. With the massive amount of articles on the Wikipedia, there really is no time for "keep to allow a chance to find citations" and similar arguments.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think we're all missing the point of Wikipedia. Sure, the article needs cleaning. And if I have to do it, I have to do it.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree, it needs a lot of work. But, per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (criteria #4), all the band has to do is release two albums on a major or notable indie, and Tractor's fulfills that aspect (see <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wpfoxql5ld6e~T2" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wpfoxql5ld6e~T2" rel="nofollow">here</a>). So I agree citations are needed for the improvement of the article -- and they will be added -- but are not for its keeping. As it stands, per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the article should be kept and then improved sans a time frame. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 00:40, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I don't think that attitude is based on any policy. As I see it, you just said 'Yes, they are notable, but because this article isn't going to be featured any time soon, it should be deleted.' There are lots of articles on super-notable topics that are very badly cited. For instance, just before I came here, I was reading the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> article. That is tagged as needing more sources. Using your attitude, we should delete it, and let it be recreated if someone will 'bring along some solid sources'. I am a massive believer in sources, and probably a deletionist, but what you are saying is pure madness. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 00:21, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>No. The fact that the articles <i>can</i> be merged doesn't automatically mean that they <i>should</i> be merged (let alone that they document "a single subject"). There was near-unanimous opposition to such a merger.<br />
It would be very easy to merge the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> articles into a single article entitled Presidents of the United States named George Bush, but that doesn't mean that it's a good idea or that the two men are "a single subject." —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:25, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>That's a false analogy and a bogus argument. That two other completely different articles are not a single subject does not say anything at all about the articles actually at hand. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:49, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not claiming that it does. I'm refuting your argument that the ability to combine two articles into one automatically establishes the appropriateness of such a merger. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:31, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since I didn't actually make that argument, your refutation is yet again the tearing down of a straw man. Once again: Those two articles are <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a>, both discussing the same single subject, that should be merged. We merge duplicate articles. The actual subject isn't a single word, as can be seen when one stops looking solely at dictionaries and starts looking at sources that <i>aren't</i> dictionaries to see what they cover. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:01, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only straw man is yours (because I didn't make the argument to which you responded above). You claimed that the fact that "this article duplicates the content of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a>" "demonstrates that those two articles are <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a>, both discussing the same single subject, that should be merged — into this one." That's a 100% false statement. It certainly is <i>possible</i> that such a merger is appropriate (setting aside my opinion to the contrary), but the mere fact that you were able to duplicate much of the articles' content on a single page doesn't <i>prove</i> what you claim it does.<br />
Once again, I disagree with your assertion that <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> are "duplicate articles, both discussing the same single subject." You're entitled to your opinion, but simply repeating it over and over (as though I didn't understand you the first dozen times) doesn't bolster your argument. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 21:13, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <i>am</i> judging the article by its merits. It serves no significant purpose other than to duplicate information already contained in other articles (thereby defying a clear consensus against combining them). The usual solution to the existence of a duplicate article is to merge its text somewhere, but there's nothing to merge. Therefore, the article should be deleted (IMHO).

<li>You argue that the article duplicates other articles. That is the point.

<li>OK, since you're so polite, I take back the "bullshit" but it's still a load of nonsense (to use polite terminology when other wording is far more appropriate....). The rest of my comment stands because this article DOES encourage, openly and overtly and intentionally, an attempt to derail the Chinaman page's direction. As for the rest of your comment, while I appreciate that English is a second language for you, you have just suggested that there will be violence resulting from this. Really? I'm sure you're not meaning it as a threat, but quite honestly I am brave enough to defend the truth in the face of violence, and if the "downstream effects" here are anyone's fault, it's Uncle G's for being disruptive and contrary and <i>endlessly</i> lecturing others on what he asserts are their faults while never admitting to his own.

<li>It is important that you understand that the word "Chinaman" <i>does</i> exist and is in extensive use <i>by Asian North Americans</i> and others of Asian origin as a self-identifier (see <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Yang_cdc6.html" title="Bo Yang">Bo Yang</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Chin_05d6.html" title="Frank Chin">Frank Chin</a>, and I can provide various webrefs to artists/performers who use "Chinaman" as their nickname/public persona. It is also important that you understand that Chinaman is <i>not</i> as severe a derisive - when it's a derisive - than other much more inflammatory words, and also to understand that it <i>was</i> the standard English usage until the mid-20th Century (see the opening paragraph of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> re <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman/Archive_1#Fowler.27s_Dictionary_of_Modern_English_Usage.2C_Oxford_1954" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman/Archive_1#Fowler.27s_Dictionary_of_Modern_English_Usage.2C_Oxford_1954" rel="nofollow">Fowler's Dictionary of english Usage, 1954</a>; the section just before it is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman/Archive_1#Oxford.27s_Dictionary_of_Etymology_.281966.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chinaman/Archive_1#Oxford.27s_Dictionary_of_Etymology_.281966.29" rel="nofollow">Oxford Dictionary of Etymology, 1966</a> and contains a listing of <i>completely</i> archaic English names for Chinese people (e.g. Chinnish, Chinensian, Chinesian, etc.) <i>none</i> of which were derisive but, apparently given time and resentment, any one of them could have become so in the way the originally-innocuous word "Chinaman" did. There are also <i>other</i> uses of the word which have <i>nothing</i> to do with Chinese people, but rather to do with trade/imports from China (the <i>original</i> usage was for a ship in the China trade, and following on that for a dealer in Chinese porcelain wards, aka "china"); the ship usage ended with the end of the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Sail_fd8d.html" title="Age of Sail">Age of Sail</a> and is mostly a 17th C. usage (when other words such as those in the Oxford Dictionary of Etymology were used instead of Chinese or Chinaman). And of those uses which devolve from the Chinese people context, three have nothing at all to do with people - (1) a type of porcelain figurine in imitation of Chinese art, featuring Chinese men, (2) a type of throw in cricket and (3) a term to refer to a mentor/backer of Indiana politicians, which is an honorific, denoting power and influence, a borrowing similar to the use of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin.html" title="Mandarin">Mandarin</a> for (especially high-ranking) bureaucrats in the UK and Britain. The existence of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> article is not going to provoke violence (other than verbal violence, or "procedural violence" like Uncle G's creation of this page and his deceptive and misdirecting comments on this AFD. It is a "mild" word, and most white people that use it do not so derisively, but because they do not consider it a derisive (these are mostly rural, but include people like Jerry Seinfeld); if so, it is used in a more or less jocular sense and not with vicious intent; "chink" on the other hand, is explicitly derisive and associateed with aggressive behavior - and document as such as you can see on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a> article; this is also the case with the other forms in THIS article like "china boy" which Uncle G seems strangely eager to document.

<li>"Pls remember that an encyclopedia is NOT about censoring history and censoring words, but about explaining them." i.e. their associated history/variations, as is also done with various other derisives as <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dago.html" title="Dago">Dago</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/g/Wog.html" title="Wog">Wog</a> and not least <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gweilo.html" title="Gweilo">Gweilo</a> (which I consider a violent derisive; it was used by Chinese mobs killing whites in the Boxer Rebellions in the same way that "chink" was used by modern-era mobs in the United States.....there is a pretense that <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gweilo.html" title="Gweilo">Gweilo</a> is no longer offensive, even though it was created to be an insult/derogation; while ironically Chinaman was <i>not</i> created to be an insult/derogation, but now is widely denounced as being derisive, some going to claim that it's <i>always</i> been derisive, which is just not the case. And some of those same people, in my experience, are also people who claim that (because <i>they</i> say so) Gweilo is not derisive, or is "misunderstood". I submit that a lot of the hostile/fearful attitudes towards "Chinaman" are also rooted in misunderstanding, and also in "branding" people with guilt when they had no intention of being offensive. I take offense at Gweilo, especially here in Vancouver where we know what it means, and get to hear it in its offensive usage/context. I know comparing the intensity of "Chinaman" to any other word is not that relevant to this AFD, but the irony is there nonetheless.

Again, delete delete delete, and I do agree with Wen Hsing that obsessing over these words only promotes knowledge and use of them in derogatory ways; but Chinaman has many non-derogatory contexts and also non-ethnic meanings and an article on it has no place being merged with an article about what is overtly a slur, or as re this page merged into an article (as Uncle G wanted) that is really only a list of slurs and ethnonyms with no other context than Uncle G's original writing trying to tie them all together/comparing them (which considering he chastised "us" for original research re: <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> seems hypocritical in the extreme....but that's nothing new, either).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 03:55, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I will try to decipher your argument, UncleG, since it hasn't been made clear anywhere that I can see. You apparently believe that the terms <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> are synonymous and should be housed within the same article, and this has now extended to what is deemed "English words for Chinese people". Please, nobody accuse me of misrepresenting, I am just trying to sort things out. So, by making this point, UncleG seems to imply that the histories and usages of these words mean, and have always meant, precisely the same thing. The problem is that there is marked disagreement at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a> page and article itself on this point. Additionally, there are already ethnic slur pages, which represent modern and historical slurs towards various ethnicities. Why duplicate it? One could counter that there is room here at this article for additional notes on the terms, however, some of these already have articles which will allow for this. A sort of <i>halfway</i> between a list and specific word article isn't needed on this topic. Why should it be? Finally, I'm not going to argue anyone's opinion on whether a precedent should be set for articles of what certain language speakers call certain ethnicities, if one believes it's a sound precedent than I guess one approves of this article. I just don't think it is, that's all.--<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeefer4_a544.html" title="User:Keefer4">Keefer4</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeefer4_2c5f.html" title="User talk:Keefer4">Talk</a> 22:34, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I made it clear right from the start. No deciphering is needed. Once again, just as clearly stated right at the start: The articles are <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> that address what is actually one single subject — a subject that has a wider scope than just one individual word. We merge duplicate articles. We don't have separate articles on the same subject under different titles. I pointed to the sources right at the start to show that the sources treat this subject as one single subject, too. Not a single editor has actually discussed what is written in the sources that I've cited, so far.
<p>That there are other things denoted by the word "Chinaman" is entirely a red herring. No-one has suggested merging all of those other articles listed at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Chinaman (disambiguation)">Chinaman (disambiguation)</a>, only the article that has the "X is a name for a Chinese person. Some think it pejorative. Some not. Here's a laundry list of people who have got into hot water for using it." form, of which we have several, all addressing the same single subject in exactly the same way, with the only difference being the article titles.</p>
<p>You ask "Why duplicate it?". Given that I'm the one saying that the duplicate articles should be merged into a single article that addresses this one single subject, that question should be posed to others, not me. So I pose that question right back at you: Why are you arguing for having a whole raft of duplicate articles (which at last count would end up with <i>22 articles</i> addressing exactly the same <i>single</i> subject, in exactly the same "X is a name for a Chinese person" form) instead of one single article for one single subject? You also state that "We have ethnic slur pages.". I suggest that you read the article and the sources, because they both tell you that these are not solely ethnic slurs. Treating them solely as ethnic slurs is wrong.</p>
<p>Treating them as lists of words is wrong, too. The sources address this as one single subject, don't treat it from the single viewpoint that these are ethnic slurs, and don't treat the individual words seperately from one another. Please do as encyclopaedists are supposed to do and base your arguments upon what the sources say.</p>
<p>And please, as I've asked repeatedly, start looking at sources other than dictionaries. Building articles solely from long lists of dictionaries, as those individual duplicate articles are being built, can logically (unless one performs the sort of original research that editors are performing) yield nothing except a whole set of dictionary articles. You have at least three history books cited as references in this article. That should be a big clue as to the sort of source that editors should be looking for. Such non-dictionary sources, you will find, don't divide this single subject up. That is, in part, because <i>they are not dictionaries</i> that give individual articles to individual words. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>, too. We merge duplicate articles that are about the same single subject, that differ solely in the titles used. This article is a demonstration of what the single subject is, of what sources there are, and of how many individual words it covers, in part to <i>show</i> those editors, who claimed that there wasn't a single subject here solely on the erroneous basis that "the words are different", that there was, and that if they actually went and looked at some actual sources, instead of performing lexicography in the wrong project, they would see what it was. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:17, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What is becoming clear is that UncleG's POV is simply the deletion of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> article, which is not to due to any duplication concerns. This assertion is backed up by what he has said here and at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a> and the several merge proposals that he has made. What is also clear is that he is convincing some of the legitimacy of selectively citing sources while summarily dismissing dictionary definitions and contemporary usages. The goal is apparently to create an encyclopedia entry that would be clean of any reference to historical and current meanings, as well as, in some cases, contradict them. He uses words like lexicographic to dismiss citing any usage of dictionaries. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a dictionary, but nor should it explicitly derogate usages of words as documented in dictionaries or in contemporary culture to assist in the building of an encyclopedic article. By undermining any of the dictionary and contemporary citations, what UncleG has done is arbitrarily bestowed the burden of proof for any non-derogatory usage of the term (in any time period) to an untenable position. The funny thing is that, in saying this, I have not and will never attempt to bestow that burden upon him in a reverse manner. His sources are fine, I have never attacked them on their merits, despite his defensiveness on the subject, and I have no personal qualms or vendettas with the way that anyone interprets the term from their particular POV. But his selectively picking apart and narrowing these terms to his own liking and POV, through the above means should be seen for what it is. I am really not trying to misrepresent anyone's arguments or to push/incorporate any particular POV into the articles themselves. This is just my take on what is transpiring here, there is very little you have demonstrated in words or actions to convince otherwise. Fortunately it seems most can see this, so I don't see a point in making further response to your inevitable next retort. --<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeefer4_a544.html" title="User:Keefer4">Keefer4</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeefer4_2c5f.html" title="User talk:Keefer4">Talk</a> 19:18, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>That paragraph is almost wholly erroneous. Taking just two examples: Merger is not deletion; it is the former that has been proposed, not the latter. And both "The goal is apparently to create an encyclopedia entry that would be clean of any reference to historical and current meanings." and "By undermining any of the dictionary and contemporary citations, what UncleG has done is arbitrarily bestowed the burden of proof for any non-derogatory usage of the term (in any time period) to an untenable position." are quite clearly directly contradicted by the very content of the article at hand, which documents both historical usages and non-derogatory usages of the various names, citing sources for such analysis. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:49, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's not like anyone would have expected your agreement with my analysis, but it's good to hear some of it met with your approval, just as some of the article met with mine. You have admitted above that there is a difference between terms: "very content of the article at hand, which documents both historical usages and non-derogatory usages", which I think is a step forward. The bottom line here: I think the article sets a poor and un-needed classification precedent (How XXX Language speakers refer to XXX ethnicity), "Pls remember that an encyclopedia is NOT about censoring history and censoring words, but about explaining them.", and selectively derogating dictionary and contemporary references in constructing an encyclopedic article in words here and actions elsewhere, just isn't very tasteful. I don't want to belabour the differences we have. We see things differently with respect to the article's merits and that's all. It's been a good discussion.--<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeefer4_a544.html" title="User:Keefer4">Keefer4</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeefer4_2c5f.html" title="User talk:Keefer4">Talk</a> 19:37, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>You have admitted above that there is a difference between terms</i> — That's not what the text that you quoted said at all. If you have read it that way, then you have mis-read it. Please read it again, in the context of the original erroneous argument that you made above, which it refutes. As for "Pls remember that an encyclopedia is NOT about censoring history and censoring words, but about explaining them.": The argument that people that one disagrees with are censors is a propaganda technique that the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis_b0f5.html" title="Institute for Propaganda Analysis">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a> classifies as <a href="../../../n/a/m/Name-calling.html" title="Name-calling">name-calling</a>. And, finally, if you think that "selectively derogating dictionary and contemporary references" is what people have been arguing in favour of, then you haven't actually read their arguments at all, or at least have mis-read them as badly as you mis-read what I wrote above. The problem here is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>, with editors constructing their own theses based upon firsthand analysis of raw quotations. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:14, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I apologize if you interpret anything I disagree with you on, as a name-calling or a personal attack. It is never and will never be intended as such. Raising censorship concerns (which I am actually quoting from another editor on this page) is not name calling, although I suppose anything could be considered name-calling if one hunts for a source that says it is. Again, the fact that you now differentiate between the terms by virtue of their historical/derogatory usages, as you allude to above with your referencees in the article (I appreciate you pointing me to those passages in the article which I overlooked-- my opinions are not static and stubborn), clearly means that they are not synonymous. And certainly I think it prudent to substantiate allegations of original research with examples of how they have been incorporated into the articles at hand. On the merits/precedent of this we disagree, but hey that's why this discussion page exists.

<li><b>Comment</b>While the article does seem to be very negatively focused, perhaps some NPOV cleanup as well as making it a more historically based article could make it more acceptable, although I am not personally sure of how this may be done. Maybe more of a history of slurs, but that still seems very negatively focused. I think there is a lot of good information here, just portrayed under a very negative light. Flipping sides again, we can not hide from the negative things, and the only way to stop them from occurring is to educate others upon the issue. I'm not sure where I stand exactly, but I really feel there is a use for this information somewhere. <b><font color="#6699DD"><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedian_ca90.html" title="User:Redian">Redian</a></font> <font color="#6699DD">(</font><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedian_24f6.html" title="User talk:Redian"><font color="#6699DD">Talk</font></a><font color="#6699DD">)</font></b> 04:52, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, this is not bad faith. Nor is it original research. This is a good faith demonstration, <i>by example</i>, of the merger that I suggested at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a>. This is what <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chink.html" title="Chink">Chink</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> should all be merged into, because they are all <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> that are addressing the same subject under different titles. (Note that all of the individual articles are of the exact same form: "X is a word for a Chinese person. Sometimes it is pejorative. Sometimes it isn't. People disagree. Here's a laundry list of incidents where people have got into hot water for using this word.")
<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>, but unfortunately several editors are doing lexicography here, as can be seen at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_Skookum1%27s_sources_1fbd.html" title="Talk:Chinaman/Skookum1's sources">Talk:Chinaman/Skookum1's sources</a> where editors are collecting a corpus of quotations that contain certain words, and then performing their own firsthand analyses of these words and what people may have meant when they wrote them. That's lexicography, and is exactly the sort of work that belongs in Wiktionary, where it is welcome.</p>
<p>A proper <i>encyclopaedia</i> article, in contrast, should have sourced analyses, not analyses done by Wikipedia editors directly, and <i>this one does</i>. Hence the reason that it isn't original research. You'll find, for example, the analysis given in the article that "chink" has been used as an "innocent slang term", on the very page of the source that is cited for it. This isn't a collection of firsthand analyses by <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> and other pseudonymous Wikipedia editors of quotations that they've collected. It's a summary of the analyses by Mencken, Lewis, Isaccs, Tchen and the others whose writings discussing this subject are cited in the article.</p>
<p>(Notice also from the talk page discussions, and the discussions above, that the main aim of this mis-placed lexicography is to <i>contradict</i> what the secondary sources actually say, because editors disagree with what the sources say and want <i>their own</i> analyses to be reflected in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/e/u/User%7EZeus1234_9651.html" title="User:Zeus1234">Zeus1234</a>, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:English_language_names_for_Chinese_people&amp;diff=119844064&amp;oldid=119843502" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:English_language_names_for_Chinese_people&amp;diff=119844064&amp;oldid=119843502" rel="nofollow">asserts that these words are all slurs</a>, even though we have a cited source, Lewis, documenting the fact that they have been used <i>without</i> intent to slur by some people. Ironically, it is <i>that promulgation of a single view</i>, and not this article, which states right from the start that there's more than one opinion to be had, and presents several of them, that would be non-neutral.)</p>
<p>It's not even original research in terms of being a novel synthesis or presentation. Ironically, the novel synthesis and presentation is exactly what those who want to do lexicography in the encyclopaedia are creating. If one <i>looks at the actual sources that discuss this subject</i>, rather than trying to do one's own primary research from quotations, one finds that they don't discuss these words individually. They discuss them <i>en bloc</i>. Lewis discusses "Chinaman", "Chinee", and "chink" in the same breath, for example. Tchen discusses "John Chinaman", "chink", "heathen Chinee", "mandarin", and "celestial" all together, for another example.</p>
<p>These are not separate subjects, and should not be dealt with piecemeal, with editors doing original lexicographic research in the wrong project, in individual articles. The way to deal with them is to use sources, who have already done the analyses, and to deal with the single subject, that the sources themselves address as a single whole, in a single article — i.e. exactly as here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:47, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> How typical of Uncle G to say something like "This isn't a collection of firsthand analyses by Skookum1 and other pseudonymous Wikipedia editors of quotations that they've collected." complain (elsewhere) about my writing 5000 word essays in the course of refuting his various inanities. But more to the point, he's claiming that the materials compiled on the resources sandbox he would so dearly like to have deleted are "a collection of firsthand analyses by Skookum1" which is entirely a misrepresentation of the materials which myself, Zeus1234, and Keefer4 compiled in response to the aggressive edit war caused by his interference and obfuscatory questions and wheedling. There is no analysis on the compiled resources - a comment here or there, a speculation but always noted as such and not meant for article use (it's not as if we haven't been subjected to Uncle G's "analyses" - not the least of which on the article overleaf) - but rather just a huge index of tons and tons of weblinks to dictionary definitions, literary and government usages, and more examples of sages of Chinaman which Uncle G and certain others at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a> were in open denial about. No - not open denial at all; open accsation, open hysterics, and lots and lots of posturing like the grandstanding just above. THIS article is Uncle G's "collection of firsthand analyses" of materials he's carefully selected; the materials I <i>and others</i> compiled about Chinaman were come up with because we were accused of not having proof that non-offensive usage of Chinmaman ever existed. In actuality, the non-offensive uses are <i>more commmon historically</i> but because of the edit war and obstructionism (including this "red herring war") these realities have not yet been added to the article as we (meaning myself and other editors actually trying to work on the article, instead of war on it.....), and continue today in use by Asian-American/Canadian authors who use it not as a derisive but as a summation of the Chinese archetype (<a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Yang_cdc6.html" title="Bo Yang">Bo Yang</a>), or of the historical experience /identity of being a North American Chinese (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Chin_05d6.html" title="Frank Chin">Frank Chin</a>) But all that Uncle G has wanted is a focus on the 1990s and afterwards denuncations by politically-correct ideologues, and held hard to the idea that Chink and Chinaman should be merged "because they're the same thing". Failing the Chink merger he wrote this article - a "collection of his analyses" - and presumes now to complain it's encyclopedic while undermining the encyclopedic content and the discussion surrounding it elsewhere - and as soon as writing it he nailed the merge template on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinaman.html" title="Chinaman">Chinaman</a> (I checked, there were only six edits at the time of "nailing"). The curious part, considering his pretention to being on the moral high ground, is that he didn't bother to place the template on THIS page (I did once I noticed he'd decided it was unnecessary). That's just sloppy on his part I suppose, but he's full of such sloppiness (there was no merge template on Chink either, not one for Chinaman, but rather for Chinky). I'm not going to bother (like he does) hunting down his various wild allegations and crazy "logic" - all just puff-n-stuff posturing like what's above - but maybe another admin than him around here might opine on how ethical it is <i>to create an article only with the intent of forcing another article to merge with it because you'd failed in efforts to control the other article</i>. It's obviously not ethical, it's obviouly an insult to the work of other editors (in so many ways; what I compiled were not "analyses" but RESOURCES which he wants to maintain don't exist, or are as he's said "irrelevant". They're not; he only wants them to be, and he wants to silence the debate by "leading" his own article into the fray. And then turn around and accuse US of being "incivil". As if he wasn't. At least we're logical and not trying to hide truth or undermine the collective work of other editors. And we're not even admins, and he is...."A single article, exactly as it is here" is his position, and it's a LIE and a MISREPRESENTATION and entirely deceptive as to his motive/purpose in creating this page, which was for one reason only - to try and force a merge when he couldn't get his way.

<dd>Your calling my writings "rants" is a demonstration of those very hysterics and the typical misrepresentations/accusations that went along with them and is in fact one of those covert personal attacks you seem to specialize in, but let's not make this arena for our own particular views of each other, OK? I do think your position is based in hysterics, although not as much as Uncle G, and I wasn't so much referring to you as him and 4.x and the other useless interlopers on <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a>.

<dd>Oh, give it a rest, Hong. Your position is not based on facts, <i><b>rather on the denial of them</b></i> and you have consistently evaded and misdirected questions as well as data/references that you just happen not to like and claim are "irrelevant". And attacks on my writing style, which happens to be very prolix, is just more stock-in-trade of your penchant for "covert personal attacks" which is one of your stock ways of avoiding questions and/or avoiding issues/evidence that disagree with your own prejudices, and you DO have prejudices. Claiming I'm bored with an article when I obviously feel strong enough to write at length about the issues facing it is just yet another patronizing dismissal like so many before, all written to avoid answering the questions and issues raised by your own comments.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:16, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><i>Really??</i>. Seems to me I've seen a gross or more of disambiguation pages which "represent different concepts represented by the same word", and it's point of fact that the disambiguation page got created/designated as such because of the dispute (before Uncle G came along) about the original Chinaman article; there's a case to be made, because of the necessary content discussing the word's history that the disambig and main page should be one and the same, but that's a separate merge discussion and not quite relevant here (and I haven't field it yet, until now). Point is not so long ago there was only one Chinaman page; the variability in itsmeanings and contexts are why the disambig got split off (although it took a while for it to get the "(disambiguation)" part of its title, as the split-off Chinaman article from it had its own paranthetical qualifier ("racial term", which was not correct and got ditched also). That a word can evolve away from its original meaning/context into something as obscure as, oh cricket and Indiana politics, is in itself of encyclopedic (not dictionary) interest. And in point of fact while they <i>look</i> the same, "chinaman" and "chinaman" are two different words, no kidding, if you break down the syntax between the china trade/dealer meaning and the ethnic meaning (from which all other usages derive, e.g. the Politician and the cricket pitch) the one's syntactical frame is "China + man" (where "man" equals either a ship or a merchant) or "Chinese + man"; sure, they're "identical words" but their meanings and origins are so opposite/apposite that there's encyclopedic content right there that goes way outside the bounds of what can be represented in Wiktionary. And AFAIC moving all three to Wiktionary is <i>just another way of censoring Wikipedia</i> that mergists and ideologues are trying to do all over the place. Tell ya what - why don't we merge the whole damn thing (Wikipedia) into Wiktionary?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 16:51, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

He usually has a point, but it's all hidden in between comments about how people who disagree with him are prone to hysterics and are generally hiding some evil ulterior motives which he always sees through, or comments about how he's missing the sunshine outside and how he's bored with editing an article. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 18:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Speaking of soft-pedal attacks - Hong is always claiming (like Uncle G) that my posts are irrelevant, but that's only because they don't want to see the relevance (other editors do). As for the weather remark, that was to a friendly editor who'd asked me to do something, but I'd been dealing with the inanities of this page for hours and needed a break - and if you lived in the rainiest major city in the world that just came through the rainiest, gloomiest March in history, you'd want to have gone out in the sunshine too.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:31, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Deletion of posts on an AFD? Now <i>that's</i> unprecedented. And that I have to point at Uncle G's motives and behaviour in order to explain why this page is a piece of redundant twaddle is entirely because this page is entirely a creation of Uncle G and <i>no one else</i>. But why is it that YOU, Mukadderat, are attacking what you claim is a "long and boring personal attack" when Uncle G's (and HQG's) ongoing attacks on my writing style, my personality, and more, go unchallenged. It seems to me you've taken one side while ignoring the other. But I'm learning pretty rapidly in Wikipedia that people who don't want to see what they don't want to see will claim it's not there, and what they want to see they wilol, if necessary, invent - or grossly distort. I have been subjected to repeated attacks on this page, many of them "soft-pedalled" but still attacks, and you haven't had a problem with that. One-sided persecuttion combined with active censorship is what yo'ure asking an admin to do. All very ironic because the whole issue with the article this one was created to eradicate is focussed around censorship and manipulation and ethnoparanoiac hype.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:58, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, my critiques of Uncle G on this page have to do with his conduct <i>here</i> as much as anywhere else, such as his circular and tautological arguments about duplicate articles as rejoindered by David Levy (apples, oranges, and fruits referenced together), and the many, many times he's misled the community on this page with assertions either about articles or about the contexts of arguments, or in a glaring case of misdirection above, labelling a link with something that's not what the link indicates. Smug, sniping comments abound from Uncle G on this page; but I'm not asking an admin to censor them because they're "boring" (and they are). But you want Wikipedia to censor debate, just as Uncle G wanted to censor an article and, failing that, created another to suit his tastes. It's that article that should be deleted, not any of my posts discussing why, or defending myself against Uncle G's puerile sniping and ongoing deceptions and misrepresentations on THIS page; that reference is necessarily made to the Chinaman article and its talkpage is because it was in THAT arena that Uncle G didn't get his way and so "came over here" and made his own sandbox. "It's my shovel and bucket and you can't play!". And from his little sandbox, he throws sand at anyone trying to come in and fix it (or, because it's in the wrong location and doesn't have proper zoning, tear it down).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:07, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Going with <b>Keep</b> here, despite my abstention above. In review of the...well, I can't call it a debate any longer.

<li>And your are being misled if you think the etymologies here are <i>comprehensive</i>.

The selective picking of evidence here, with stuff that Uncle G doesn't like being branded "irrelevant" or just ignored (as with all the evidence he ignores/castigates at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Talk%7EChinaman_fa32.html" title="Talk:Chinaman">Talk:Chinaman</a>....and actually he rarely attacks the evidence, as he rarely answers to evidence but instead starts complaining about the way other people write; which is the tactic of somebody who has nothing valid to say, enit? And don't pretend that only Uncle G has been <i>criticized</i> (not attacked); how can you not see the various defamtory attempts of his on this page, and also his misrepresentation of what others are saying (whether it's me, David Levy, Keefer4, or anyone else).

<li>Uncle G supports his position by misrepresenting it, misrepresenting the contents of other articles, misrepresenting the contexts of the other articles, misrepresenting the comments even of the oth3er participants of this page (and I don't mean myself; and David Levy is not alone in rejoindering him for presuming to mirepresent his posts), and misrepresenting the nature of the resources; and misrepresenting even a link, so as to make a personal attack rather than to actually feed that linhk to what it was titled as. He invokes Wiki principles while outreageously violating them. Such behaviour is not "common courtesy" and he's not the only one here with copious contributions to Wikipedia. Just because he's obtinate in his deceptions and misdirection and posturing doesn't mean he's being persistent in any kind of admirable way; he's persistently misrepresenting people, misrepresenting the words that are the focus of the debate, and even <i>citing Wiki guidelines while actively editing them to suit his position</i>. I can't believe you other people who've been sucked in by him. No, actally I <i>can</i>, unfortunately.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>it's quite "cute" that in his just-recent edit, he calls David Levy's response "bogus" and then elsewhere talks about how "our Wiki guidelines and principles", as if he were the spokesman for Wikipedia, and he consistently uses "we" and "our" around here in a way no one else does; and in this case it's again really UGLY for him to say "our Wiki guidelines" when, in the course of citing one recently, he went over to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and changed it so it would fit his cite (and postscript, as I just looked at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> how <i>curious</i> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=120529872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=120529872" rel="nofollow">another POV-flavoured edit was just made by Kevin Murray</a>, similar to Uncle G's, and is another case in point of people obsessing over guidelines and principles while <i>actively editing them</i>. That's called moving the goalposts in mid-game, baby. That's meddling, it's dishonest, and it's typical; he's made edits on pages/talkpages in question that have nothing to do with the deceptive edit comments that accompany them with him. He's a wheedler and dissembler and also a slanderer of other people's positions here, over and over and over. If that's a personal attack and I get blocked for pointing out what is SO OBVIOUSLY THE TRUTH about his conduct, then I cry <i>SHAME!!</i> and will in future regard the campaign here to "sell" this page (Uncle G's pet project, and full of misrepresentations as a result and by default) as a prime example of passive-aggressive/hyperbureaucrat mentality passive-aggressives who throw rule after guidline after rule after guideline at other editors, hiding their own agenda behind technicalities and the a pretense of procedural propriety, with no thought of principle but of using the "system" to get their way and to soft-attack others whose input they want to silence, and if the person stands up for themselves to the calm-faced aggresion of those talking principles loudly and repeatedly while not actually applying them to their own behaviour/posts.....why, then accuse <i>them</i> of personal attacks, even better if you can provoke them with your obstinacy into saying something angry; it's classic passive-aggressive behaviour and also of "nattering nabobs of negativity"; as always with passive-aggressives, they control their language so as to not seem aggressive, but revel in accusing others of aggression. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:30, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Chinese people simply don't understand the importance of coopera- tion. But if you tell a Chinaman he doesn't understand, he will sit down and write a book just for you entitled The Importance of Co-operation.</i></li>
<li><i>Chinese people can be extremely convincing when they talk, thanks to their remarkably nimble tongues. If you believe what they say, there is nothing they cannot do, including extinguishing the sun with a single breath of air, and ruling the world with a single flick of the hand. In the laboratory or examination hall, where no personal relationships are involved, Chinese can produce impressive results. But when three fiery Chinese dragons get together, they can only produce about as much as a single pig, or a single insect, if that much. This is because of their addiction to infighting.</i></li>
<li><i>Those of you who live in the United States know that the people who harass Chinese people the most are other Chinese, not Yankees. It takes a Chinaman to betray a Chinaman; only a Chinaman would have a good reason to frame or slander another Chinaman.</i></li>

<li>It has to do with the conduct of this page's proponent, and also with the use of the word chinaman by chinese themselves; in this case Bo Yang himself has chosen it even though the original Chinese is "ugly Chinese person". The pretense of the page overleaf is that somehow all these words were coined by english speakers to defame/degrade Chinese with, but in actuality "Chinaman" has been used <i>all along</i> by chinese people themselves, both in North american and without; just by those with less ideological/political pretensions; that this page (the article) lumps non-derisive terms with derisive terms, but dwells on the derisive ones and on the derisive aspects of those that can be both is a demonstration of its POV-ness, and it's not-so-hidden agenda.

<li><b>comment</b> The pretense held by Uncle G and his claque is that this page is NPOV and cited; but I've gone through and marked LOTS of POV comments and phraseology that are uncited, and taken out DUMB material like "Chinawoman" (google that, if anything it's a neologism used as a name by a woman in Nelson BC, but in all my readings of North american history I've seen it maybe THREE times; usually women were also "chinamen"); editors who want to understand why I think this page has a POV agenda, and has been structured to hide or ignore material that disputes the principle author's very blatant agenda are invited to review my recent edits of this morning, and of lst night, and Uncle G's reversal of last night's. Important non-offensive uses have been buried within passages about offensive terms, e.g. what's "chinaboy" doing right next to the ship/porcelain usages anyway???? No doubt Uncle G is going to remove my additions, and tell me that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Britten_1874.html" title="Mark Britten">Mark Britten</a> doesn't exist, and won't read Bo Yang's article (that's now cited <i>in situ</i>) in which Bo explains why he chose to use "Chinaman" in his English translation. All kinds of lists of pejorative claims/words have been idnividually cited, as they're clearly interpretations of Uncle G and not in any source provided; fine to provide a source, even better <i>if it actually states what the person citing it is claiming it's a cite for</i>. Picking and choosing cites/authors who agree with him, while deliberately leavingt out so much else that doesn't, or masking it under cover of mentions of other things, or demanding fact templates for things he KNOWS exist (like the comedian "The Chinaman" and yeah, I had his name remembered wrong but <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Britten_1874.html" title="Mark Britten">Mark Britten</a> exists and is very real, despite someone's attempt to delete the original stub within two minutes of its creation. Anyway, the bandwagon and tub-thumping from Uncle G will no doubt continue today; I've added important bits and challenged and zero'd in on blatantly POV material and structure in this page; the Chinee section was moved to its own, as again (as with Chink before) Uncle G was trying to postiion "Chinaman" alongside more overtly discrminatopry words so as to obscure its ongoing non-offensive nature to many people. Oh - "many" is a weasel word, like "some" - funny that he gets away with using those, but whenever I do Hong Qi Gong jumps all over me and deletes them. Everybody here knows what a double standard is, and what hypocrites are, so there's no need for further comment in that department.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:44, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Colleague, what you said just above is a normal process of editing wikipedia articles. Of course, we don't claim that UncleG wrote absolute truth. You pointed out or fixed prtoblems with his article, very good. This is how wikipedia works: no one is perfect. At the same time it is a fact of note that in English language certain nationalities have a disproportional number of ethnic slurs. (How many English ethnic slurs you know for, say, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish people</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a>? and how many for <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a>?) Therefore this topic is of curiosity, and if there are books that cover this topic (I assume the books quoted in the article are such ones), all the more the article deserves to be in wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 22:15, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Chink is currently used as a general term against all Asians, not just Chinese. The article title is very restrictive and misleading. Right now, the article says it's about English names for Chinese people, but it's really just covering ethnic slurs. If this article were to be NPOV, then it'd have WAY more information about "Chinese" (the word), since Chinese is the accepted English name for Chinese people. Its very disproportionate and is trying to mash all these terms into Original Research categories (Chink and related names has and had words of no relation to Chink in etymology). It's a POV fork, since Ungle G is really just trying to associate terms through his own POV, by creating a new article and hoping all the other ethnic slurs will get merged into it. Some of the information was just verbatim copy and paste from other ethnic slur articles. You'd pretty much have to rewrite all the titles in this article to maintain <a href="../../../n/o/r/NOR_11d4.html" title="NOR">NOR</a>. These words have their own context. A big part of understanding slurs is understanding their different contexts and histories, which this article fails to do so appropriately and probably couldn't do since some of the words have no association and OR context (e.g. ricer does not belong in this article, since it's a general term for Asians, not a term for Chinese).<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalsedef_9833.html" title="User:Falsedef">falsedef</a> 23:48, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> OK, I'm bored with this silly game where rational intelligent people like Falsedef and Keefer4 and David Levy are insulted and told that they said something different than what they said, and then the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Goebbels_d1dd.html" title="Joseph Goebbels">"if you make a lie big enough and tell it often enough people will eventually believe it"</a> crowd repeats its mantras of "duplicate article" and "Wiki guidelines" and "citability" and false claims of NPOVness. Hopefully the deciding admin here is fully capable of seeing the paucity of the arguments of the promoter of this page and his defenders (who, funny, all say the same things, and never really talk issues, or when they do simply obfuscate them). In any case, last night's reversal of my attempts to introduce balance to this article were all labelled "damage" by Uncle G, and places where I placed fact templates on his qualifications of material from various sources - choices of wording, things left out, things not admitted to, things distorted - <i><b>ALL</b></i> was obliterated by the self-appointed author of this nuisance of a pag, all while wrapping himself in the Wiki flag, while enforcing a clearly POV edit agenda on this page. Claims from him that it is NPOV are now ridiculous in the wake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=English_language_names_for_Chinese_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=120969948" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=English_language_names_for_Chinese_people&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=120969948" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. Many of the things he claims are cited are NOT in the citations not in the way he has presented them, and corrections of unsubtantiated editorializations of his that present a different perspective than "the English language is very racist against Chinese people" were all taken out (that's the real title/subtext of this article, as is painfully clear by now). Furthermore, here he is over on the WP:NOTE page insisting on mutiple, substantial references; yet few of his POV citations here, i.e. citations supporting POV wordings and choice of content, few of them have more than one cite. And if Pearl Buck says something about the 19th Century - <i>if she said it in the way that Uncle G is presenting it</i>,that is (which I find doubtful) - where are <i>her</i> citations?? A lot of these interpretive comments from modern historians/politicos, also, are NOT borne out by actual evidence. The basic point is that he's only citing one for a lot of these, not the "multiple" cites he's rewriting the guidelines for, apparently so he can take out one-point cites of things he doesn't like. But in this case he's taken a lawnmower, <i>as he has before</i>, to any attempt to substantially change the content/structure of the page to a more NPOV level. I've been wary of legitimizing the page by trying to contribute to it; now that my latest round of attempts to instill balance into it, and to correct his LIES and challenge his FALSE interpretatinos and editorializations of what evidence he chooses to cite (and the deletions of evidence he wants to have ignored), I think it serves as ample evidence that this page properly belongs on User talk:Uncle G/Sandbox and nowhere else. He's behaving with "ownership", and isn't that a very big important wiki guideline? How come he's not wrapping himself in THAT one? Anyone here who's had Uncle G tell them that they said something other than what they said, or watched him "answer" a question which you hadn't actually asked, or listen to him expound "duplicate article, duplicate article" without being able to prove it, must inherently realize that it's the same as his false citations and misrepresentations of citations; it doesn't matter what someone else says, even a cited work - it only matters what Uncle G says it says. There's also the highly POV juxtapositioning if items - like the mention of Frank Chin being tucked in between the kid's taunts and other derisive material, and branding Chin "in the amelioration camp" (an inherently POV statement, as it suggests that amelioration of the term was needed); as is also the case with hiding the original ship and porcelain dealer meanings of the word in amidst a bunch of other derisives, immediately followed up by "china boy", which of course directly connects to the relevance of the ship and porcelain dealer meanings, doesn't it? Other similar obfuscations and downplayings abound, and biased langauge is everywhere, even the <i>structure</i> of the article is biased as he lumps unrelated terms together; Chinaman and Chink should be separate sections - but then they're already separate, and much more thorough <i>and</i> much more NPOV than this article; and don't presume to equate terms that shouldn't be discussed in teh same section, except in terms of painting them all with the same garish and ugly POV brush. His lumping Chinee and Chinaman in the same section is the same thing as trying to merge Chink and Chinaman articles; lumping chink and ching chong together was ridiculous, and there's more such garbage now all over this page. I tried to straighen this out, but he branded it "garbage",which far more aptly as just used by me fits his material overall, and reversed it all so as to keep to the ethnic-slurs basis of his view of all these words, and his obvious hatred for anyone who disputes his version of things, despite the pretense of calm and citations and wiki guidelines and rule-pulling/waving. But oh well, it's clear that any attempt to legitimize this page with real content, whether now or after the AFD is closed and (god help us) this article survies, it's Uncle G's personal property and he's NOT going to allow anyone else to reshape or contribute to its contents, unless through his POV lens. I surrender to his supporters, who have helped me see the one true light: Uncle G is godlike in his wisdom, Uncle G is calm, Uncle G is a superior being, Uncle G is right and anyone else who's against him is mean and stupid. yeah, uh-huh, ok. see ya later.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 18:47, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Skookum, I support the deletion, but you have to realise that these long drawn-out comments and replies have the potential to move an AfD toward a "no-consensus" decision. Maybe this article will be deleted, maybe it won't. But basically, what I'm saying is this - if you want to see the article deleted, make your point clear and then refrain from making these long comments. I can almost guarantee you that most people have stopped reading your comments in their entirety. I know I have. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">Hong Qi Gong</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHongQiGong_c2a3.html" title="User talk:HongQiGong">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HongQiGong_7564.html" title="Special:Contributions/HongQiGong">Contribs</a>)</small> 19:06, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

But in the case of the "above" it was such a cleaer violation of NPOV in this latest policing of the page it had to be spelled out. I have my own writing style, and debating style; it's time for you to stop attacking that, and stick with the issues.

<p>OK, there is no easy way to do this, because our deletion templates are being to smart and preventing me from doing it right (namespace confusion). So I am filling this AfD 'by hand', and yes, it should be at AfD, not at CfD and not and MfD. I filled it at MfD first but consensus was to move it here (<a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Category%7ELists_of_topics_by_country_30cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Category:Lists of topics by country">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Category:Lists of topics by country</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Category%7ELists_of_topics_by_region_5155.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Category:Lists of topics by region">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Category:Lists of topics by region</a>). I am proposing to delete all lists articles in those categories (and than categories themselves), but lists (articles) are the primary target. The reason for deletions is: few of those lists are maintained and they are a relic of the past: each country (and region) has way to many related topics to fit on one page; this is what country (region) specific categories are for. Later we may want to consider getting rid of all <a href="../../../b/a/s/Category%7EBasic_topic_lists_e4b2.html" title="Category:Basic topic lists">lists here</a>, but for now, just think: an average country has thousands of related articles. A list with thousand entries is cumbersome and useless, as the categories were designed to automate the process. Most of those lists are not maintained. If you really like them, we can archive them or tag as historical... but basically they are dead weight that may occasionally distract a new user and make them waste their time adding something to those forgotten junk pages.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 04:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I can understand that you may want something done, the fact that there are so many lists tends to point to me that this isn't something that can be handled well in AfD. Some of these lists may be unmaintained as you claim, some may be redundant to categories. Some, however, may not? Reviewing them all to find out which is which? Not something I think could be handled in a single AfD even for the country. I suggest coming up with a different plan to handle this problem, perhaps soliciting some feedback through the Village pump. And since you haven't added the AfD template to all the subpages, I don't think this discussion can proceed anyway.

<li>Lack of the AfD template on the subpages is really just a sign that they ought to be placed there, not a reason to abort any discussion here - otherwise we're getting a little overly fixated on letter by letter process - as a general rule of thumb. That said, I agree that this situation is a little complicated and I too doubt that an AfD nomination like this is the appropriate way to handle the issue. By posting up a category and saying "This is supposed to be a blanket nomination for all the articles contained therein" is putting a bit of a burden on participating editors by expecting them to go through the categories and checking out the articles. I know it seems like a lot of work on your part, but as the nominator you really should be nominating the individual lists themselves, not as a category. You can bundle them into a mass nomination if you'd like but <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> is right, your best bet is to withdraw this nomination and figure out the best way to approach the situation, perhaps by seeking input from other users. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:43, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh, I don't think the main reason for closing this discussion is the lack of the template, if that were the only issue, I'd just say to start adding them. The real problem is indeed, the complicated nature of this proposal. It's just asking for trouble. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:59, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Procedural keep all and speedy close</b> - the two categories contain close to 200 articles. There is no rational way to come to consensus on 200 different articles in a single AFD. If the nominator has specific concerns about specific lists, it can be discussed on the talk pages of those particular lists or in a more tightly focused AFD. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:17, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy close</b>-Mass nominations like this are a bad idea. AfD isn't really the place to get community consensus on the existence of a given type of article.

<li>This is a matter involving an actual policy change in what sort of categories should be made, and is not suitable for AfD.

<li><b>Procedural keep all and speedy close</b>. Absolutely agree with the above comments.

<li><b>Keep</b> as author, for following reasons: Have updated page as requested, including name of vocalist &amp; correct year of EP release (from album sleeve), and also that the EP was also sold through independent record shops across Australia (hence its entry and persistence in then-official national "Australian Alternative Top 10"). The notability criteria which Garrie originally nominated as a reason for deletion (that notice now restored - apologies for my accidental removal during another edit) specify that commercial album release and chart entry qualify as controversial though significant-enough reasons for retention. As to verifiability of sources, J Milburn's comment about Internet sources for older bands is very true, especially for Brisbane bands which have often been omitted from current musical history due to Sydney/Melbourne bias in earlier decades: Hence, I don't expect many corroborating sources to be found. I can truthfully swear that I was NOT a member of the band (!), and actually possess the album &amp; still listen to it occasionally. I believe that deletion of this article from Wikipedia would merely contribute to the loss of pre-Internet history, and invite anyone else with any additional information to enhance the article accordingly.

<li>Agreed, the nominator certainly doesn't seem to be trying to convince us to delete this! The AfD nomination likely should be closed due to the apparent mixup (and it does seem to at least nominally pass inclusion criteria) but that article is in serious need of cleanup and help, it's messy and confusing. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:54, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is also the matter of weather or not ethnicities can have flags. Flags are symbols of countries. Unless the country claims to exist the verifiability of the Flag is compromised which prompts "original research".</p>

The <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" title="Image:Gay flag.svg">LGB flag</a> is widely used but it is not universal.

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, notification is not a requirement, it is a courtesy, and is not a reason to halt an AFD. Second, flags most certainly predate the modern notion of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a> extant since the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Westphalia_adc8.html" title="Peace of Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a>, and many entities that are not countries have flags, ranging from the UN to subnational groups including states and cities, and private entities as well. It would probably be better to use this article to <b>list</b> the articles on ethnic group flags that are in Wikipedia. Galleries are indeed now deprecated to commons. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 14:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True re: courtesy notifications, but I think they help the AfD process in terms of making a good decision for Wikipedia's purposes. They also help morale and improve the perception of fairness and openness; they're something I always do when nominating an article for AfD. Finally, multiple editors have cited the need for references and concerns about original research; the existing contributors probably are the ones that would do the work and know where some of the sources are if the article is kept. As for the galleries question, that would extend beyond this page to a number of similar articles -- see <a href="../../../e/t/h/Category%7EEthnic_flags_1b3d.html" title="Category:Ethnic flags">Category:Ethnic flags</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_flags_8030.html" title="Category:Lists of flags">Category:Lists of flags</a>.

<dd>Yes, and if only you use the flag you design, it wouldn't be notable enough to be included. However, if it is more notable, then lack of official status (and some of these do have official status in one sense or another), is a reason not to describe the flag as an official flag, not a reason not to document the flag at all. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 09:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your concern, while a reasonable concern on the subject of individual entries, doesn't mean there is a problem with the page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: A Google search makes it look to me like this may well be notable. Have a look at <a href="http://www.sitelead.com/blog/why-doba-needs-affiliates/2007/03/08" class="external text" title="http://www.sitelead.com/blog/why-doba-needs-affiliates/2007/03/08" rel="nofollow">this</a>, was an interesting read. Lots of Google hits, hard to know if any of them confer notability though. Seem to be some reviews around- <a href="http://www.salehoo.com/blog/2006/09/24/doba-review-indepth-look-at-what-doba-dropshippers-offers/" class="external text" title="http://www.salehoo.com/blog/2006/09/24/doba-review-indepth-look-at-what-doba-dropshippers-offers/" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://www.dropship-review.com/review_doba.php" class="external text" title="http://www.dropship-review.com/review_doba.php" rel="nofollow">this</a> are two good examples. I would say that, in its current state, it is perhaps speediable, but, as a subject, probably isn't. Can't really tell if it should be kept- there are a lot of mentions, it is just not awfully easy to find any very reliable ones. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:04, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The company has a well know status through out several communities seen by doing a search at Google or Yahoo. A look at the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=http://www.doba.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=http://www.doba.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa rating</a> does provide some incite (while limited) to the status of the company too. The CEO, Jeremy Hanks, has helped author a couple of books as well <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ebay-Inventory-Smart-Way-Merchandise/dp/0814473598/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5624046-5714558?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1175617078&amp;sr=8-1" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Ebay-Inventory-Smart-Way-Merchandise/dp/0814473598/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5624046-5714558?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1175617078&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">see the main one</a>. A look at inventory.overture.com also shows the name Doba receives a substantial amount of search traffic. Another look at search results on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=doba" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=doba" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=doba" class="external text" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=doba" rel="nofollow">Yahoo</a> shows that lots of other companies (including eBay) are paying to show up on for this search term. And as Milburn noted there have been some reviews and other news articles written reguarding the company. The answer isn't going to obvious I guess, but it does not seem to be clear enough to make a deletion decision. <a href="../../../r/y/s/User%7ERyskis_4e7b.html" title="User:Ryskis">Ryskis</a> 16:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hate to be a barn burner, here....however, online visibility doesn't necessarily assume notability.

<li>This is neither a G11 or A7. Reading the content of the article makes it seem like a far stretch to say that this is blatant advertising. The content is more biographical and unbiased than any advertising speak. Hirank 10:03, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This doesn't appear to be biographical, but <b>autobiographical</b>, which would qualify for deletion.

<li>Leroy, I disagree with you on this one. This doesn't seem "autobiographical" to me. And in any case Leroy, autobiographical isn't a valid reason for deletion, even if it was.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I am not trying to sell anything or ask anyone to join anything, I am merely trying to provide information about a subject that is already written about on Wikipedia (by expanding articles on Wikipedia). Why do I not get an article? In short, your argument makes no sense. The stories are not about her, but about her near-death experience- you could argue that they were, in fact, about her doctors. Perhaps she deserves a mention in a larger article somewhere, but unless she is notable beyond her experience (perhaps through her consultant work) then this article should go. It is also rather POVish. Phrases like "truly an inspirational" and "most sought after motivational speakers" just aren't helping this article's case. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:21, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b>I notice the wikipedia entry for Anita Moorjani coming up near the top on the google search. It looks like there is a lot of demand for information on her, as her google hits have also gone up dramatically just over the last few months. It would be great if she could be kept in wikipedia, perhaps with just a bit of editing of the article. She has been on the radio in Hong Kong several times, she has come out in many press publications throughout Asia, as well as many internet news articles.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but it needs sterilizing and rebuilding from the ground up. There is an interesting story there (not so much the not dying - I've not died, and I don't have a Wikipedia entry - but the weird career she seems to be building out of it), and she does have the multiple non-trivial etc etc. However, at the moment this article seems to boil down to spam for her website, with a window-dressing of sources to stop it being db'd. And having so many possible sockpuppets involved isn't doing the 'keep' case any favours - obviously, they may well all be genuine but it seems odd that so many people with an interest in the same subject would all create accounts on the same day. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIridescenti_7b38.html" title="User talk:Iridescenti"><small><font color="chocolate"><i>(talk to me!)</i></font></small></a></font> 15:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. The "sources" attempt establish some borderline notability, but I do have to point out that they are all scans of articles posted on her personal website. Given the newness of the editors involved I will assume good faith and guess that they don't see a problem with this, and for future reference should note that referring to the article itself, preferably with a link to the website if the material is online, is what should be done, and posting information from your own website appears suspect.

<li><b>Keep</b> based on meeting the formal requirements. I recall some of the recent discussions on sexual fetishes, where the postulated impossibility was used as an arguement. I supported them on the basis that the belief in them or even thought of them was notable, and I guess the same holds here. My reaction would be to delete as commercial spam if not hoax, as she charges HK$150 to hear her speak, which seems incompatible with her claims of newly-attained knowledge of relative insignificance of the material world. But we already have the established justification of "notable hoax" so I suppose we can have the justification of "notable spam."

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Hello. I just want to comment on the HK$150. That's only about US$20. The money goes to cover costs of the venue, and the promos to announce the event. Anita doesn't get paid for speaking. Hong Kong is a very expensive city. $150 is actually very little. Just thought I'd let you know. THANKS!

<li><b>COMMENT</b> If I may just add one more thing - Anita has now been approached by the BBC who are considering making a documentary on her case. Just to let you know something about her - she is very generous with her time and information (while not actually promoting anything). She speaks freely when invited, and has been speaking at Rotary Clubs, various women's groups, etc. Her experience seems to have created a lot of (ongoing) public interest. One suggestion - perhaps if we could be guided as to how to edit the article to meet wikipedia standards, would you consider keeping it? Just a thought. Whichever way, we leave the decision of deletion to your professional editing capabilities.

<li><b>Comment</b> It does not appear that the creator and substantial editors of this article have been notified about the AfD. [WP:AfD] says that providing such notice is seen as civil. This guidance is often ignored. Providing this notice should be the responsibility of those initiating the deletion process. I will do this myself tomorrow, time permitting, if no one else steps up to do so.

The article lists six books is way more than the average for a scientist. (The most heavily cited one has been cited 284 times!) The main publication work of a scientist is in journal papers, and he has published 161 papers; the most heavily cited of them was cited <b>547</b> times. (I have added the top 10 to the article) . This is notability by the specialized criteria of WP:PROF, by the general notability guidelines, and common sense.</li>

<dd>He has met much stricter criteria than we can use here--the successive promotion review boards, the grant boards, and the many peer reviews for publications. His peers have decided on the notability, and we record it.</dd>
<dd>Funny: half the notable scientist bios we see here have been nominated because of sometimes outrageous self-advertising, which detracts from their real accomplishments; half are excessively modest, and get here because they don not display them. I think it careless to nominate a senior academic for deletion without at least checking Google Scholar; though not very accurate, it would have shown about 200 results, many with hundreds of citations. The appropriate action upon seeing this article would have been an "expand" tag. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:18, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I helped write much of the article. I suppose I don't pretend to understand Wikipedia &amp; its policies for inclusions. I have seen many living "artists" (part-timers with dubious clout &amp; little or no body of work) included. This is an artist who has shown in many major museums in the US &amp; world &amp; is a known artist in the field of ceramics. Acceptance into museums is the highest achievement for an artist (as opposed to privately owned galleries which may insure sales for an artist but not necessarily any kind of longevity of exposure for future generations). If Wikipedia does not accept this artist, one has to wonder... —User:Trippydude, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this applies to all of the Polish Top 50 nominations. The underlying concept of the top hits in Poland seems notable enough to warrant a page. Moreover, a website may well be a reliable enough source for this sort of data; that the compilers of the Polish Top 50 have a cheesy looking website on home.planet.nl is neither here nor there. If this site gets a data feed from another source, that source should be cited though, if available. I do think that the several pages about Polish hits ought to merge into one.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> - I think the article is notable - if it is completely re-written to actually explain the history and methodology of the Polish music charts (article needs categories too). As it stands now its definitely a copyright violation as its probably updated every week with the current top ten by a music chart fan <i>and</i> those images can't possibly adhere to any fair use/image guidelines. - <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 16:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is, I believe, the fifth nomination this article has received. Although reliable sources do exist for this article, it's not the sort of thing that is suitable for Wikipedia. Jimbo Wales himself has opposed to this article's existence, trimming it down hugely in one edit. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angry_dragon_7bae.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angry dragon">angry dragon</a> article was deleted because such a definition belongs in <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban Dictionary</a>, and the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">donkey punch</a> is exactly the same: it may be slightly verifiable, and although Wikipedia is not censored, just because something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion. This is about a fake (there is one mere claim in the talk page that it has been carried out in reality) violent, illegal and misogynistic sexual act, with no claims for notability. The talk page and the previous deletion archives have much information and debate on the article and its validity. While articles on things like a band with an album and an EP that has supported a major artist are deleted, articles like this one along with its notorious siblings <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusty_trombone.html" title="Rusty trombone">rusty trombone</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_steamer.html" title="Cleveland steamer">Cleveland steamer</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirty_Sanchez_67e0.html" title="Dirty Sanchez">Dirty Sanchez</a> (which belong on urban dictionary, sure, but not here, and I may well list for deletion if this is successful) are, as some have noted, what makes a mockery of Wikipedia as a serious encyclopedia. Let's get rid of the donkey punch once and for all. -<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 18:14, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: As Iridescenti said, it is well sourced, and is more than a dic def. The fact that it <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe.html" title="Ultimate fate of the universe">hasn't happened</a> isn't grounds for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> as I'm primarily responsible for the article in its current form (see history if you like). I'm not sure where this prejudice against what <i>should</i> be in an encyclopedia comes from as <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENSOR_1cbe.html" title="WP:CENSOR">Wikipedia is not censored</a>. Certainly the fact that it's <i>fake</i> isn't something that has any bearing on its notability. I did a similar <a href="../../../h/e/y/WP%7EHEY_63b4.html" title="WP:HEY">WP:HEY</a> on autocunnilingus but I'm letting that one go (after trimming there's only one <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). But as sexual terminology goes, this one actually figured (in meta-slang form) in a national scandal and <i>one of the sources is a US Senate page</i>. I don't know how often sexual slang, no matter how real, makes it to that lofty height. Call it stupid, call it ... irresponsible, but it's a "real" fake, and it's a notable fake at that. What Jimbo did was exactly right, he excluded the pointless wankery, er, original research from the article. It's the kind of article that attracts the "Howard Stern mentioned donkey punching on his show last night" additions. But we seem to have that under control now. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:48, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Dhartung. All four previous nominations have resulted in keeps, and the article has never been stronger than it is now. The nominator implies that this article is comparable to the article on "angry dragon", but this article is clearly neither a dicdef or a neologism, and the implication that Jimbo supports the deletion of this article based on his improvement of it seems odd to me. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 00:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - well sourced. The fact that something is lewd and apocryphal does not mean it should not be included. Consider it a modern version of a Catherine the Great and her horse story. -24.68.187.88 01:47, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> For no other reason than that following four failed nominations for deletion, a fifth nomination, without more, should be foreclosed. Surely some kind of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claim_preclusion.html" title="Claim preclusion">claim preclusion</a> can attach to that kind of consensus. Indeed, <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> states speedy keeping is appropriate if "[t]he nomination was unquestionably vandalism or disruption and nobody else recommends deleting it . . . .

<li><b>Comment</b> - let me reiterate and expand on my arguments. Firstly, the link posted by irisdescenti does not show a genuine "donkey punch"; merely a punch that stops short of hitting the female on the back of her head with any real force as the link states. Secondly, I am neither a vandal nor trying to disrupt the encyclopedia (I've made a good article from scratch and have contributed positively for a long time). Thirdly, although this may have been mentioned in multiple third-party reliable sources, is it truly notable? If this weren't sexually/controversially charged and was a so-called 'boring' topic with the same number of references, would it still pass the notability test? Is Wikipedia a place where such jokes can thrive? How is 'donkey punch' not a neologism? I actually think Wikipedia loses a lot of valuable information through deletion, yet articles like this are allowed to exist (and yes, I'm well aware that Wikipedia is not censored, and of all the policies and guidelines). Fourthly, to quote the talk page, <i>"Not only does this kind of gratuitous prurience threaten to destroy the good work you people have done... eventually, you're going to find yourself slapped with lawsuits when a young boy pulls a stunt like this on a young girl, and the girl's mother finds out the he got the idea for it on Wikipedia. Trust me. I'm not going to be the one to do it, but, as a JD, I can guarantee you I'd take that case. If you want, I can show you all the cases in which you could be held liable."</i> Finally, the fact that Jimbo did not want an article about the concept of the donkey punch as it is currently held is a good sign that it should be deleted.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 10:57, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I certainly do not believe in censorship in general and on Wikipedia (articles on real sexual practices carried out by more than a tiny minority of people should certainly be included), but having disgusting jokes in an encyclopedia makes a mockery of it, as I have stated.-<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 11:00, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> If I may fairly answer your objections, research: First, we use neither the somethingawful description or the porn movie as sources (although they'd actually be helpful resources for the article, best not open the floodgates). I wouldn't describe it as a "genuine sexual practice" except in the broadest sense, where a subject of pornography counts as a "practice", but it's certainly a genuine subject of pornography (ridiculous and ultimately more of a joke than a route to orgasm, but you never know). Second, I don't see your nomination as disruptive, and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> should apply here, but people are always trying to get rid of stuff because <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>, and I confess I believe that's a large part of your argument. Third, again, as sexual slang, it's notable -- very few sexual slang terms come up in congressional investigations. (Yes, others did, but this was approximately the only one the newspapers would print ...) Yes, it's a neologism, but <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is not a blanket prohibition on articles about neologisms, it is a guideline that restricts their intemperate application. Fourth, Wikipedia does not have a policy on dangerous practices, so far as I know; we have <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molotov_cocktail.html" title="Molotov cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-injury.html" title="Self-injury">self-injury</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASE_jumping_d51b.html" title="BASE jumping">BASE jumping</a> and so forth. In fact, there have been edit wars over the use of safety disclaimers in articles. I don't know how many times we have to say it's not "real" or quote Dan Savage on the risks to get the point across. Finally, you misrepresent Jimbo Wales because he did not want the article in its <i>prior</i> form. He expressed no opinion on its <i>current</i> form. He literally instructed editors to "start over from scratch", and his first words on the Talk page were "I insist that nothing go back into this article without a proper source." That doesn't read to me as you represented it.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 12:57, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response re disruption and bad faith:</b> I would add that asserting disruption and assuming good faith are separate concepts. A user, as here, might very well have only good motives yet nevertheless in acting on those motives, end up causing well-intentioned disruption. I've been on the losing side of AfDs before and remain unconvinced by the rationales provided by the prevailing side. Still, if I renominated merely because I remained unconvinced, it would of course be disruption, regardless of how fervently I thought I was right. That's the situation here. Accordingly, the elements of a speedy keep are met and that should be the result of this nomination. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 03:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further response</b> - Nowehere do I say the Something Awful article and the porn movie prove the practice exists - they prove that the practice exists <i>as a concept</i>.

<li>AfD is certainly that in many of these repeat nominations (I wouldn't assume it here, but this isn't the 14th go round like some others have had), remember you only have to get deleted once then CSD A4 means it's dead for good. The deletionists just need to hope that the keepers aren't watching once. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:18, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> again. Sorry, I also don't know what to make of the Jimbo argument in the nomination? If Jimbo didn't like it he would have deleted rather than edited it (I assume he has that power), but I don't know him and wouldn't presume to speak on his behalf as the nominator appears to be doing... <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:18, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable neologism and hoax. 'The term is not strictly defined or well-documented; at least one source attests to the move being "made up."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While doing research for a paper I am presenting at the Western States Folklore Society Annual Meeting 2007, I came across this debate regarding the Donkey Punch. I am strongly in favor of keeping the Donkey Punch as an article. Dan Savage (who is referenced in this debate) refers to activities such as the Donkey Punch as Extreme Sex Acts, and I am currently researching Extreme Sex Acts as a form of folklore. They are quite obviously folklore, as they exist in variation, are anonymous in origin, and are passed as a traditional form of humor. Under all of these criteria, NO item of folklore would qualify for a Wikipedia article, though articles on folktales, specific types of jokes (lawyer jokes, blonde jokes), festivals, and religious rites abound. These are ALL forms of folklore that are readily accepted in the Wikipedia community. Granted, most folktales that are included are in print and frequently on film (due to Disney), as in general, they are not told by word of mouth anymore. But I find it a double standard that one genre of folklore is included and another is not. Perhaps the Donkey Punch should be included in an article about the genre entirely, rather than having it's own article, but removing it entirely is ignoring a significant part of our contemporary folk culture. Just a note: much of what is found on urbandictionary.com is what folklorists call "folk speech." I understand that each individual item of folk speech could not be listed on Wikipedia, but Extreme Sex Acts have a relatively small canon (far smaller than the canon of folktales) and could reasonably be listed in some fashion on Wikipedia. For a verifiable source, I refer you to Dan Savage, as listed below. If you need more than that, attend my presentation at UCLA April 21.

<li><b>Keep</b> This band has a fairly extensive article in Wikipedia, Japan, which (if I'm reading it correctly) says they're a prominent example of the genre. Good quality references on Japanese bands are hard to find in English. Pkeets 19:16, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> If other Wikipedia articles would constitute reliable sources, one could just create an extensive, yet completely uncited article on one incarnation of Wikipedia (like <a href="../../../../ja/a/l/i/Aliene_Ma%E2%80%99riage_8b31.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Aliene_Ma’riage">ja:Aliene Ma’riage</a>, as it does not seem to reference any of its content) and then use it to ensure the notability of its other-language counterpart. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 19:47, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm the author, and Cyrus said referencing the Wikipedia, Japan, article was insufficient. I'm now looking for Japanese references which meet the requirements. Pkeets 20:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable. Perhaps it has a place in an article on science experiments. Is "boil water in a paper cup" even the formal name of the experiment? Or just a description?

<p><b>Delete</b> - does not appear to have the requisite independent sources attesting to his notability. Being mentioned in an essay collection or being contacted by a documentary filmmaker does not notability make. Apparently, "Alan Kistler has often stated he would like to pubish his own fiction pieces" and "several comic book fans have e-mailed MonitorDuty.com to offer their support that he will one day write for the professional comic book industry." Should that day ever come, then perhaps this gentleman will warrant a Wikipedia article. Until then, no. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Save</b> - The article has been edited to exclude superfluous information and now adds that he has actually been published as a cartoonist by a professional organization and that dialogue from him will be in the upcoming "Secrets of College Survival" book and that he's now being sought by a second documentary crew (though they may only be independent). Considering how many comic book related Wikipedia articles reference him and how he's all over google, I see no harm in letting this article remain for comic book fans who are curious.

<dd>My main point is that there's enough interest from many comic book fans about his work that it makes sense to me to have at least the brief summary that is currently his article. If more independent sources are needed, then I say that's a problem that can be fixed rather than deleting the article entirely, which seems unecessary to me when he's a published freelance cartoonist and is all over google. I've seen a wikipedia entry or two on internet cartoonists who don't get paid for their online comic strips. Just my thoughts. Jackofhearts2099 06:32, 8 April 2007 (UTC)Jackofhearts2099

<p><b>Save</b>- The individual focused upon in this article is referenced all over the internet, in various publications and is well known within the science fiction/comic book community. Any google search will pull up multiple articles, stories, reviews and cartoons that have been written and created by Alan Kistler. A wikipedia article is a fantastic way to link all of his work on one easy site containing multiple links and a simple rundown of his many accomplishments. Please keep this article.

<dd>It is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to state that the Quebecois are a cultural nation like the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalans.html" title="Catalans">Catalans</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots.html" title="Scots">Scots</a>. There is a consensus on this in Quebec and now in much of Canada. The cultural and ethnic definition of Quebecois refers to French Canadians living in Quebec. This is because during the Quiet Revolution, nationalistic French Canadians living in Quebec began to refer to themselves as Quebecois. This means that the word Quebcois is ambiguous in French. You will also note that <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> refers to French Canadians living outside Quebec as the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_diaspora.html" title="Quebec diaspora">Quebec diaspora</a> and the French spoken by <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadians_a024.html" title="French Canadians">French Canadians</a> outside Quebec as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_French_50f7.html" title="Quebec French">Quebec French</a>, indicating that the relationship here is similar to that of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots.html" title="Scots">Scots</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavarians.html" title="Bavarians">Bavarians</a>, etc. living outside their homeland. So, yes, the term is ambiguous, which is why a page is necessary to disambiguate this; moreover, another page is required to describe the complexities of the Quebecois identity. Perhaps the page needs to be renamed Quebecois identity. --Soulscanner 23:13, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are misinterpreting everything from A to Z on Quebec. The first sentence of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalans.html" title="Catalans">Catalans</a> reads&#160;: "The Catalans are an ethnic group or nation whose homeland is Catalonia...". There is of course a link between the territorial identity and the cultural one. The <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots.html" title="Scots">Scots</a> article is a disambiguation article like the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Canadian (disambiguation)">Canadian (disambiguation)</a> page. We could have the same disambiguation at the top of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> article. The French Canadians of Quebec began to refer to themselves as <i>Québécois</i>, the people of Quebec, which in English gives "Quebecers". The transformation was from A) an ethno-linguistic (and even religious) minority without any State to B) the majority of the citizens of Quebec, Quebec as a strong State inside a loose confederation for some or as a separate State for others. This is what Claude Belanger accurately describes on his site. After the fact, after the Quiet Revolution, some anglophone Canadians began to refer to the French Canadians of Quebec as the "Quebecois" in English, either out of respect for the name they themselves used to refer to themselves (much like we went from Eskimos to Inuit, Montagnais to Innu, Huron to Wendat) or out of a complete and utter misunderstanding of the political reasons for the renaming. The old definition of "French Canadian" was thus cut &amp; pasted to "Quebecois", masking the nature and reasons of the transformation impossible to grasp. This is <b>specific to the English language</b>, and native francophones from Quebec discover with great surprise and disbelief, when, after learning English as a second language, they land on individuals who say "I am Quebecer, but I am not Quebecois" and even actively fight identification to Quebec by all its citizens, including non-francophones. Canadians who speaking English do not always refer to themselves as Anglo-Canadians, which is perfectly normal. Franco-Quebecers do the same. They simply say we are <i>Québécois</i> and they invite (and use political means to get) people within the community of Quebec citizens to identify with Quebec first or solely (which is already the case for the strong advocates of independence). When there is a need to distinguish the Francophone majority (~83% of Quebecers) and from any of the various ethnic minorities for whatever reason, then they say <i>Québécois francophones'. In English, this would be "Francophone Quebecers". When referring to those Quebecers who have French Canadian origins (~74% of Quebecers), they say</i> Québécois d'origine canadienne-française<i>. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 19:56, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</i>

<dd>Again, this is true only in exceptional cases. Refering to yourself as French Canadian is only done among older generations. As you rightly say, French Canadians in the Quiet Revolution went from refering themselves as French Canadian to Quebecois. We agree on that. But as the Petit Robert states, it is not anglophones that gave Quebecois it's ethnic sense. You are obviously eager to demonize anglophones in misrepresenting this. It was done by francophones during the Quiet Revolution, which is why you can find this definition (among the others) in most authoratitive distionaries. That is why anglophones and allophones, while understanding that they are Quebecois in that they are residents of Quebec (the civic sense), are reluctant to do so in the cultural sense. This is quite obvious to anyone in Quebec. Now, many are working to change this and I laud that because it shows that Quebec nationalism is progressing into a more civic sense, but I think most would recognize that we are not quite there yet. but simply denying the facts doesn't help the situation. --Soulscanner 01:28, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What exceptional cases? No we do not agree. You say "the Quiet Revolution went from refering themselves as French Canadian to Quebecois." I say "During the Quiet revolution, those who called themselves <i>Canadiens français</i> began to call themselves <i>Québécois</i> meaning Quebecer. The fact that the English-Speaking majority of Canada, which is only a minority in Quebec and does not think of itself as a minority at all did no join in the boat is not the result, as you imply, that Francophone Quebecers excluded them. It is obviously because they already considered themselves as the majority of Canada. The fact that only a minority of allophones self identify as <i>Québécois</i> can be explained by the state of competition between two host societies in Montreal, one being tremendously more powerful than the other. If the federal State had been driven out of Quebec in 1980, today Quebec allophones would be francized in much greater proportion than they are anglicized. That is pure common sense mathematically and sociolinguistically. Your belief that Quebec nationalism is progressing implies that it was not civic from the start. That is simply incorrect. Quebec nationalism exist BECAUSE of the abandoning of ethnic survivalism inside Canada as made obvious by the rejection of the "French" Canadian name and the adoption of Quebecer instead. You have still to produce the full definition found in your 1984 Petit Robert by the way. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 07:15, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As I pointed out earlier, the normal course in the case of cultural nations like the Quebecois is to distinguish between the people and the territorial homeland (e.g. <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish people</a>/<a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This is perfectly in keeping with Wikipedia practice. I also agree that we should adhere to Wiki guidelines. This means that we need to use language that is commonly understood to describe nations and cultures like the Quebecois. This article attempts to do that, but it is difficult to develop it if documented usage is consistently denied for political purposes of imposing preffered definitions. --Soulscanner 05:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You will note that, as requested, I added a French dictionary definition that identifies the usage of Quebecois as referring to French Canadian culture and language in Quebec. I apologize for not including it earlier. I'll also point out that the ambiguity of the term is part of what this article tries to sort out. Unfortunately, we have been stuck at this point for quite a while because you will not acknowledge that this definition exists in English or in French, even though it is common usage in Quebec (as evidenced by the reference in the Petit Robert). This has prevented us from progressing in this article as I consider it important to reach a consensus on this before proceeding. Despite the fact that you've obstructed this progress by denying common definitions, I acknowledge the importance of references in backing up statements that others may disagree with for political or ideological reasons. After much scouring of the internet and literature, I have found authoritative references that firmly establish these defintions. I've always pointed out that the other definitions do apply (they are also found in most dictionaries as I have readily documented), but that the ethno-cultural definition applies as well in many cases (especially in culture). The fact is, French Canadians in Quebec constitute an ethno-linguistic majority. It is also a fact that the majority of French Canadians in public and in private life will self-identify as Quebecois. Hence, even though French Canadians outside Quebec do not refer to themselves as Quebecois, they in fact speak the same language, share the same ancestry, share the same culture, and share the same ethnicity with the Quebecois. Hence, the semantics of it can be confusing. It makes it especially important to carefully distinguish between Quebecois (the people; nation; culture; etc.) and Quebec (the territory).--Soulscanner 05:09, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am not denying that this definition exists. I have documented it here, and been very forthright about it. Quebecois can mean Quebecer, a resident of Quebec, especially in French. We both agree that this is one definition. I've simply documented, in an authoritative source, that the word is also used in French to mean a french Canadian living in Quebec; words can sometimes have different definitions depending on context. You choose to deny because you do not like this definition. However, you cannot deny that it exists. --Soulscanner 01:16, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I do deny that it means "French Canadian living in Quebec" in French. It does not even MAKE SENSE to say the équivalent of this in that language. It is antinomic! The standard definition of <i>Québécois</i>, in French, is equivalent to that of <i>Canadien</i> or <i>Américain</i> or any other. Therefore, a <i>Québécois</i> is a person from Quebec as is stated in every French dictionary including your 1984 Petit Robert. In addition, far less commonly and certainly not conventionally, it can mean, as a noun, the language of the <i>Québécois</i> (as in "I speak "American", meaning I speak the English that is characteristic of the English-speakers who constitute 80% of the American people.) As an adjective, it means "of Quebec" which is quite vast as is "of America" and also can take a cultural connotation. The <i>Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé</i> makes this quite clear, but I did not need the <i>Trésor</i> to figure out that of course most Americans think of American culture as a primarily English language culture and that the overwhelming majority of the people who think that way are not proving to be unfavourable or hostile to their civic institutions by doing so. Would I have needed to explain the self-evident to an American of a French? Is it possible that Canadians who are so numerous to think there is no specific national culture to Canada have an issue with Quebecers not having the same problem at all?

<li>Firstly, Franco-Quebecers do not refer to themselves as such. The refer to themselves as Quebecois.

<li><b>Keep</b>, for now, for reasons cited above. The dictionary definition is only there to document the common usage of the word, which has been challenged.

I've gone through considerable pains to document this and much of the article. Probably, Quebecois should be on a disambiguation page, in a manner consistent with <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish.html" title="Irish">Irish</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish.html" title="Scottish">Scottish</a>, and the documented information here shifted to a separate article that can be used to describe the ambiguity and usage of the term.

<ul>
<li>As the reference to the Petit Robert points out, this began around 1965 among French Canadians in Quebec who adopted a Quebecois identity and broke with the pan-Canadian identity of French Canadian. If anglophones do it, it is because they respect this shift in identity among the Quebecois. Again, this is not POV. It is documented in any review of Quebec political history. --Soulscanner 02:50, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, it deserves information, but that is not the reason for the suggested deletion or redirection. A partisan user, SoulScanner tries to transpose the definition of "Quebecois" (exclusively Francophone Quebecers according to many) to the definition of <i>Québécois</i> in the French language, which the numerous dictionary definitions I have provided above prove to be just wrong. From there he promotes a particular POV on everything that related to Quebec politics and culture. A redirect of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebecois.html" title="Quebecois">Quebecois</a> to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> would be consistent with the present redirect of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.

<ul>
<li>I will propose that a redirect of Quebecois to Quebec is not appropriate. Quebecois identity (what is meant by the Quebecois nation or people) is more complex and hence more ambiguous than "Ontarian" or "Albertan"), and needs its own article. In fact, Quebec's role as the homeland of French Canadians (or the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_diaspora.html" title="Quebec diaspora">Quebec diaspora</a>, as <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> refers to them) and the center of the francophone linguage community in Canada really has no paralell in the other provinces, and is more akin the the role of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavarians.html" title="Bavarians">Bavarians</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_People_3051.html" title="Scottish People">Scottish People</a>, and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_People_0815.html" title="Irish People">Irish People</a> in Europe.

<li><b>Improvements and Scope of article</b> Acknowledging that the article reads too much like a dictionary article, I've added some improvements. The aim here is to briefly summarize the cultural and political currents that have run through the French-Canadian/francophone/franco-Quebecois (simply refered to as Quebecois in Quebec) community since the Quiet Revolution. --Soulscanner 08:01, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I'll summarize here (at the risk of more repetition) that Quebecois identity since the 1960's (what is meant by the Quebecois culture, nation or people) is more complex and more diverse in its various meanings than "Ontarian" or "Albertan". In fact, Quebec's role as the homeland of French Canadians (or the Quebec diaspora, as Mathieugp refers to them) and as the center of the francophone language community in Canada really has no parallel in the other provinces (or North America!) , and is more akin the the role of other cultural homelands such as Catalans, Bavarians, Germans, and Hungarians. The discussion of this is too long for a subsection in an introductory article on Quebec, and interesting enough to go beyond a dry disambiguation page.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To me, it's obvious that the request to redirect was malicious and WP:POV motivated. I believe that Mathieugp and Laval simple refusal to accept an authoritative referenced source as an indication that they are deliberately hindering the development of the article in order to advance their own political agenda. It has been frustrating to say the least. I suggest that future requests for redirects and deletions be considered malicious.</dd>

<li>I've restored my text that you deleted, but in a way that will not interrupt your "flow". Please do not delete my text again. This article does not single out Quebec anymore that <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalans.html" title="Catalans">Catalans</a> singles out their cultural group. Quebec is different from other provinces precisely because many consider Quebecois to be their national identity. The fact is that for many ethnicity enters into the equation. Many do not like that, but that is no reason to deny it in others. The intent of this article is to survey the complexities of the Quebecois identity. This is not appropriate on an introductory article that describes the geography, economics, and population of a province as it will take up too much space and eventually consume the entire discussion page. --Soulscanner 05:11, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think you're being a bit overzealous here. It's usually a good idea to be willing to compromise and accept what the dictionaries and standard reference texts state. In this case, the consensus is clear: redirect to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>. It's really not that complicated. As the other editors have made clear, Wikipedia does not entertain <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original ideas and concepts</a>, and it is not a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">dictionary</a>. The definition of the term, as I've looked it up as well, is that it refers to the inhabitants ot Quebec. This is no different than the examples the nominator cites. Clearly it makes more sense to redirect to the article on the province, rather than use the current article here as a springboard for political purposes. metaspheres 10:44, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would appear, after some investigation, that the problem user in question, User:Soulscanner (also User:Soul scanner), is responsible for a great number of POV edits and has used the Quebec articles to push a particular anti-French POV. In this case, with this specific article, the user, based on the discussions and edit history, is the only one who used the article to (falsely) promote the claim that the term is ethnically motivated and used <i>only</i> in connection with French-speakers. First rule of Wikipedia: We are not a battleground of nationalities, ethnicities, ideologies, peoples. Second rule of Wikipedia: Do not under any circumstances use Wikipedia as a springboard for your cause. Users like Soulscanner attempt to use Wikipedia to promote their own political agendas, and their edit histories clearly reveal what they are up to. My suggestion to the closing admin is to completely disregard this user and focus on the facts and Wikipedia policy. Such problem users are inherently hopelessly POV and are never willing to compromise and work towards consensus. In fact, they almost always reject consensus.

<li>If you feel I've made anti-French entries, please back up this very grave assertion with facts rather than personal attacks and character assassination. I take this personally. Please point out which entries are POV?. If I have been bigoted in anyway, I will apologize. If you cannot back it up, I expect an apology. They are all maticulously referenced and I took large amounts of time to document everything that I've posted here as I do in all of the pages I edit. I have responded to good-faith challenges to unreferenced claims by producing reference, and I've responded to requests to make the article less dictionary-like by adding referenced, encyclopedic material that is consistent with Wiki fromatting at other pages. You are showing bad faith by deleting documented and referenced material that I have placed in this article. You have also deleted commentaries of mine on this in an attempt to suppress my defence of the article. You have reverted and edited the page to make it less encyclopedic and more of a dictionary entry. this clearly constitutes vandalism (see <b><a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a> Blanking</b> ). Now you are telling editors that you should ignore me. Interesting reasoning.</li>
<li>As for simply ignoring complex issues of national identity among the Quebecois (and the significant political events that surround them), that does not help anything. Quebec nationalism needs to be explained to understand the various facets of Quebecois identity. This is best handled by documenting various points of view from important political or intellectual figures, some of which any one of us may or may not agree with. If you feel I am not adequately representing these, you can remedy this by taking the time to find one or two authorative sources, summarizing them, and providing a footnote so that we can verify them. I invite you to add constructively to the article rather than indulging in Blanking WP:Vanadlism. --Soulscanner 20:03, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

I have hesitated to report this to admins because some of his initial contributions (ie on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English-speaking_Quebecer_e6e4.html" title="English-speaking Quebecer">English-speaking Quebecer</a>) seemed mostly OK. Unfortunately, this community seems to be the only human community which he knows something about. His edits seem to focus on editorial changes to articles related to the French-Speaking minority of Canada. He has misrepresented the contents of various references to try to support his POV, for example in the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebecois.html" title="Quebecois">Quebecois</a> article case in claiming to cite an "academic" <a href="http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=547&amp;layout=html" class="external text" title="http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=547&amp;layout=html" rel="nofollow">article</a> by David Young. By reading the article, we can see that it is an opinion on a media controversy originating from Don MacPherson, columnist at <i>The Montreal Gazette</i> who in 1990 misinterpreted the actions of Celine Dion when she refused the <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/l/F%C3%A9lix_Award_79f1.html" title="Félix Award">Félix Award</a> for Anglophone Artist of the Year given by the <a href="../../../a/d/i/ADISQ_9731.html" title="ADISQ">ADISQ</a>. She was quotes by him as saying: "I am not an anglophone artist and the public understands that. Everywhere I go in the world, I say that I'm proud to be <i>Québécoise</i>". Don MacPherson insinuated that this was yet another proof that for Quebec francophones, (get that) the non-francophones were not Quebecers too. Of course. The ADISQ gives an award for best Anglophone artist, but Quebecers reject non-francophones, it goes without saying. That is perfectly consistent from a logical standpoint. The fact is, the overwhelming majority of Quebecers understood Celine's action as she herself understood it: "No, I am not a sell-out singing in English for the big US market as people have been gossiping about since I started singing in English. Give the award to real English-speaking artists from Quebec who better deserve it than me." And this is the reference SoulScanner uses to support his POV that Quebec nationalists (like Celine Dion who said she supported independence like most artists in Quebec) want to built a country to persecute non-francophones, which is the core ideology behind most of his edits. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 19:01, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The controversy over this term (just look at this page) should be documented in an encyclopedia, not a dictionary.

<li>Then wouldn't it make so much more sense to treat the subject in let's say Controversy over the usage of the term Quebecois in the English language, or Representation of French-Speaking Quebecers in English-Speaking Canada? To write on this particular issue (how Quebecois in English is used compared to <i>Québécois</i> in French), which I have stated quite clearly cannot be written in any NPOV way at all since it is a POV to start with, would be like writing in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">Feminist</a> that in certain situations or certain social milieus (in a certain language), the term has become synonymous with "promoters of a sexist society ruled by women". After saying this (which after all is possibly a phenomenon that can be documented as any other) some people, those who pushed for this content in this article, tried to insinuate with bad references that since some Feminists also seem to agree with (or by their actions attest the validity of) this defamatting definition of their movement, its motivations and goals, it was therefore true and encyclopedic and not basically a misunderstanding of feminism. Do I need to explain why an encyclopedic article on such an issue would not belong in Feminist? We can demonstrate quite easily that the transition from <i>Canadien français</i> to <i>Québécois</i> was politically motivated. That the intent of the intellectuals who promoted it and mostly succeeded at this extraordinary psychological revolution in the collective self-representation of a people was intended to have the French Canadians in Quebec stop thinking of themselves as a national minority inside Canada but as the people of Québec. French Quebecers thus becoming a national majority inside Quebec. These intellectuals were either favourable to the ultimate secession of Quebec (the radicals I guess) or the reform of the federal system of Canada to formalize the nature of it as bi-national. There are HUNDREDS of academic references to this in French. This ultimately makes the standard definition of <i>Québécois</i>, in French, the equivalent of <i>Canadien</i> or <i>Américain</i>. Therefore, a <i>Québécois</i> is a person from Quebec as state every French dictionary. In addition, far less commonly and certainly not conventionally, it can mean, as a noun, the language of the <i>Québécois</i> (as in "I speak "American", meaning I speak the English that is characteristic of the English-speakers who constitute 80% of the American people. French-speaking people also constitute ~80% of the Quebec people by the way.) As an adjective, it means "of Quebec" which is quite vast as is "of America" and also can take a cultural connotation. This politically motivated social change was the practical separation of Quebec from Canada even though it had not happened at the political level yet. My generation was brought up thinking that we are either Quebecers alone (sovereignist leanings) and more than ready for independence or Quebecers first (nationalist but federalist) and being Canadians pretty much has the sense of as "citizens of Europe" in this case. But Canada is not Europe and those nationalist-federalist want to change the constitution of Canada and have English-Speaking Canadian nationalists give up their project. The radical change in Quebec, radical in the sense that it seemingly happened overnight for a lot of intellectual Canadians, that is an understatement, was taken as a threat to the continued existence of the Canadian federation as a nation-state with 10 equal provinces in it. All this history is very much encyclopedic, but it is recent, heavily charged politically and writing on this in a NPOV way will very difficult. It belongs to a special article either in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_nationalism.html" title="Quebec nationalism">Quebec nationalism</a> or Quebec identity. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 06:48, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There are definitely POV problems to watch for in this article, but as I've always said, the reason this has a separate article, where other Canadian provincial demonyms don't, is that the term has a complex, loaded and highly controversial political and cultural context that words such as <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontarian.html" title="Ontarian">Ontarian</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertan.html" title="Albertan">Albertan</a> don't have. It means different things to different speakers, and that inconsistency gives rise to conflict. Whether that's as it <i>should</i> be is not for Wikipedia to dictate. Our role is to reflect how things <i>are</i>, not how we think they <i>should</i> be — and how things <i>are</i> is that "Québécois" <i>is</i> a politically loaded term which <i>does</i> deserve a neutral, properly referenced encyclopedia article about <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> it's so politically loaded. <b>Keep</b>, with whatever POV cleanup is necessary. And, for the record, Soulscanner's obsession with a distorted and biased view of Quebec politics and history is seeming very awfully <a href="../../../d/w/_/User%7EDW_b2cc.html" title="User:DW">familiar</a> to me somehow. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:06, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>I understand and respect your desire to see this topic, the how and the why it is politically loaded, be covered in Wikipedia. But I cannot agree that <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebecois.html" title="Quebecois">Quebecois</a> is the place for it, nor can I remove from my head that we cannot achieve this when <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Quebec_eef9.html" title="History of Quebec">History of Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_nationalism.html" title="Quebec nationalism">Quebec nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Quebec_4ad4.html" title="Culture of Quebec">Culture of Quebec</a> are still so poor in terms of both contents and quality. Why not Quebec identity with poll results and all like there is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a>? Isn't it more the place for it? And can't you see by reading <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_identity.html" title="Canadian identity">Canadian identity</a> that if someone like me did not respect how English-Speaking Canadians tend to see themselves and see Canada, if I decided to interve and insert with good documented references how French-Speaking Quebecers think of the ROC and Canada without saying it is just a POV, we would never get out of it because these POVs are simply irreconcilable? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 06:48, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>NN autobiography. Author seems to feel quite strongly that autobiographies are suitable for encyclopedias. I feel differently. Speedy tag removed multiple times, prod tag deleted, inappropriate person tag removed with the statement "IT IS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY". Brought this here for consensus - I'm with CSD A7, but it's borderline. Might also be copyvio, the prose doesn't make it entirely clear one way or the other. <i>EDIT: Copy-paste from <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1990/markowitz-autobio.html" class="external text" title="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1990/markowitz-autobio.html" rel="nofollow">nobelprize.org</a>.

<p>Bumping up from speedy because notability is asserted. Problem is, it appears to be unverifiable. Google gives plenty of results for "Heather Cameron", but nothing that appears to be the person this article is talking about. Likewise, lots of results for "HC Experience", but none of it's related to a folk-music band.

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's not actually true. Patent nonsense hoaxes can be deleted per CSD G1. Per CSD guidelines, articles cannot be speedy deleted as a hoax if the subject might be "remotely plausible." However, they can if the article "is obviously ridiculous." I, and I'm sure many with me, would argue that the record label "Muff Dyke" as well as an occupation of "Singer/songwriter/lesbian" qualifies as obviously ridiculous. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockstar915_f516.html" title="User:Rockstar915">Rockstar915</a> 01:08, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_house.html" title="Public house">pub</a> with no assertion of notability given. Whilst the original author has previously stated that historically interesting information will be added to the article, it has now been around for almost a year, and fails to meet our criteria for inclusion. If the building in which it is in is notable, then it is perhaps that that deserves an article on Wikipedia, and not this pub.

<li><b>Keep</b> These Visual kei bands are an interesting element of modern Japanese culture and I'd like to see them represented for the Japan project. There are also a couple others under consideration for deletion: Missalina Rei and Aliene Ma'riage. Elsewhere, there's been a proposal to combine these into a single article on say, the Enamel or Key Party labels or something similar. If I can come up with enough information and proper references, I may consider working on that.Pkeets 03:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>" I am getting the impression that these guys are internationally famous, but I may well be wrong." I'm getting the idea they (along with others of the genre) have something of a cult status. They're one of a number of indie bands out of Japan with an approach that looks to derive from Kabuki and No. Interesting, eh? Pkeets 03:57, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Pkeets, I am getting the impression you are pretty big on Japanese culture- if you speak Japanese/are familiar with Japanese media, do you think you could have a look for some decent sources in Japanese? <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 12:11, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>A few years back I was very interested in Japanese culture, but I've gotten away from it. I speak a bit of Japanese, but don't read it. I asked around and some folks here who do read it say there aren't any good references online and that we need copies of the music magazines from around that time which covered the bands quite often. However, I have no access to these. It would take a long-time fan or someone living in Japan who could find them in say, a library. Would there be support for merging these articles with the one on Visual kei, maybe? Pkeets 19:04, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

Are all these to be deleted, or should we add to the list? Pkeets 19:07, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are a lot of <i>List of [genre] bands</i> type articles about, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_visual_kei_bands.html" title="List of visual kei bands">list of visual kei bands</a> (which I presume is the article you meant to link to) is just one of them.

<p>This article is a detailed description of the behind-the-scenes server mechanisms for the online game <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Heroes_1cf2.html" title="City of Heroes">City of Heroes</a>. While the article has good writing style, it unfortunately has little to no verifiable published references backing it up, not only in the article itself but most likely not from any reliable publisher (it uses blogs and other Wikis as its sources). Therefore it is unlikely the article will ever satisfy the verifiability requirements of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and it is also unlikely that the article will ever meet the sourcing requirements of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> or its related proposed ammendment <a href="../../../i/n/c/WP%7EINCLUSION_c8e9.html" title="WP:INCLUSION">WP:INCLUSION</a>. I'm not sure if the article fails WP:NOT or not, so I'll keep an open mind there. Either way, unless some independent reliable sources are produced for verifiability and notability purposes, I'd recommend deleting this article and replacing with a redirect to the main <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Heroes_1cf2.html" title="City of Heroes">City of Heroes</a> article. IMPORTANT NOTE: I was not able to add the afd tag to the article itself! It is currently protected. I would like to request that an admin please place the appropraite afd tag on the article itself. I will also mark the article's talk page with that request. Obviously the article should not be deleted until after that tag in placed, to give interested editors sufficient chance to reply. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:41, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I think technically the way this would work is, if necessary, this afd nomination should be relisted automatically by an admin on the same date that they add the appropriate afd tag to the article. So if the tag is added on April 5th, then relist this afd under the April 5th nominations and copy and paste the nomination reason. That way people will have the full five days to discuss from the time the article itself is tagged (plus a little extra time starting today). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have added the AFD tag to the page. I have no position on the AFD nomination itself; I am only making the edit because it seems procedurally necessary. Since there is only a short delay since the nomination, I don't believe changing the AFD date is needed. The closing admin should keep the circumstances in mind. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 23:25, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminant collection of information. City of Heroes is indeed a notable game, but a catalog of its servers (along with a heapin' helpin' of related trivia) is more the realm of a fansite than an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Weak Merge</b> in the sense that there is some information that should be covered in the main article, such as the different American and European releases (and it should be documented, I would think, in the various magazines that cover it), I might also include the bets about the test servers, but the full details? A bit much, at least for Wikipedia. Maybe transwiki to <a href="http://paragonwiki.com" class="external text" title="http://paragonwiki.com" rel="nofollow">paragonwiki</a> which seems to have most, but not all of this article's content. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:47, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I could accept that, Manticore. It's possible that some small part of the article like what you described could be verified through reliable sources, but it seems doubtful such info would be enough to constitute a full article in and of itself. Merging those bits to the main CoH article would make sense. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 15:07, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the names of the servers and what datacenters they're in would at least be useful information to have, but I tend to agree. It's kind of fancrufty. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobomaster_55b2.html" title="User:Robomaster">Robotech_Master</a> 07:25, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even assuming the datacenter list were verifiable from published sources, it would probably fit better in Wikisource as a data point for the City of Heroes article than as an actual article in its own right. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:20, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I wouldn't recommend the list of servers, kinda pointless, but the special servers? The distinction between American and European servers? Works for me in terms of acceptable content. The bits about "unofficial PVP" or "unofficial RP" may be a bit much, especially unsourced though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:38, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article is mostly rehash of content from <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzestan.html" title="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Khuzestan_6357.html" title="History of Khuzestan">History of Khuzestan</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Khuzestan_f592.html" title="Politics of Khuzestan">Politics of Khuzestan</a>. Rest is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and/or unsourced. Furthermore one should note that there are no similar articles on Wikipedia and the article title is <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> for a number of reasons, including the fact that Arabs are found in other places in Iran as well, including <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandar_Abbas_9c31.html" title="Bandar Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashhad.html" title="Mashhad">Mashhad</a>, and <a href="../../../i/s/f/Isfahan.html" title="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>. Considering <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_citizens_of_Israel_cae8.html" title="Arab citizens of Israel">Arab citizens of Israel</a>, one must apply the same standards here: <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> or Arab citizens of Iran. All census reports from Iran consider Arabs together nationally (3% of national population), not as separate ethnic groups as this article implies. There is no evidence that Khuzestani Arabs are a "distinct" ethnic group from other Arabs in Iran. Their culture is similar to Arabs in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and to some extent the Persian Gulf states. But the current title is not well written and lacks sources for the rest of the information that is not taken from other articles already mentioned. If not deletion, then at the very least redirect to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Iran_3067.html" title="Demographics of Iran">Demographics of Iran</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 22:47, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oppose</b> There is no reason why this article cannot exist and the title is hardly POV, any more than the alternative suggested (<a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a>) is POV. Arabs in Khuzestan are distinct from Bandar Abbas (although some of these Arabs have been forcibly moved to other parts of Iran due to forced relocation by the Shah regime and the Islamic Republic regime), in terms of their tribal structures and language. There is a problem here and that is that content that was due to be merged into the article from other articles has been blocked. This would have benefitted the article by showing the distinctiveness of Arab tribes and their history in this province. I put it in the talk page some months ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan/Archive_2#Merge_sections" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Arabs_of_Khuzestan/Archive_2#Merge_sections" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, but other editors refused to discuss the content with me despite an effort at mediation that I agreed to but Khorshid refused. But this article will go because there is a body of editors that votes the same way and enforces content changes by stacking 3RRs. This is the case with all Iran-related articles. Whenever I have offered any evidence, even from academics, it is immediately dismissed by these editors.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 23:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have already explained why the article should not exist - Iran's Arab population can be detailed in a neutrally titled article such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> or Arab citizens of Iran, which is what the Israel article has: <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_citizens_of_Israel_cae8.html" title="Arab citizens of Israel">Arab citizens of Israel</a>. The same standards should apply to citizens of Iran. Do not level accusations at other editors - your reveals the root of all the problems in Iran's Khuzestan articles. Most editors here are interested in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. You, however, have been pushing a nationalist political agenda, which again your block log shows. The only "academics" you have cited is one professor from Shaw University in Canada who makes outrageous claims that have no acceptance among scholars anywhere. <a href="../../../y/u/s/Yusef_Azizi_Bani-Torof_0ae9.html" title="Yusef Azizi Bani-Torof">Yusef Azizi Bani-Torof</a> who you constantly cite is not even an academic but a journalist. Give it a rest. There is no justification for this article or the controversial separatist and nationalist agenda you have been pushing for all this time. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a battleground to wage such campaigns, do you understand? <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 23:27, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition, we don't and can't have articles for every single Persian, Azeri, and Kurdish ethnic group in Iran. For instance there are literally dozens and dozens of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian</a> ethnic groups in Iran! It is outrageous to have articles from them, from Tehrani, Isfahani, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirazi.html" title="Shirazi">Shirazi</a>, Mashhadi, etc etc. We have <b>one</b> article on Persians here, <b>one</b> article on <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds.html" title="Kurds">Kurds</a> (there are also dozens of Kurdish-speaking groups), <b>one</b> on Azeris, <b>one</b> on Mazandaranis, <b>one</b> on Baluch, and so on. We can't have articles for every single local group and dialect in the world, it would be a nightmare! <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 23:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you want to put me on trial, then do so. If you want a discussion on this article, then stick to the point. You don't even believe that Arabs are an ethnic group!<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabs_of_Khuzestan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=120099339" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabs_of_Khuzestan&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=120099339" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The fact is that you have refused to discuss the introduction of more information to the page and refused mediation, so it has sat in the talk page and has now been archived out by you. Many of my 3RR violations are simply frustrated attempts to introduce even minor changes. Why? Because my user name is Ahwaz and not the Farsi spelling Ahvaz and this simple difference in spelling turned a whole load of people against me from the very beginning. Even some of the most non-contentious edits - right down to correcting English spelling and grammar mistakes - are immediately removed. But, I don't know why you feel the need to discuss this with me now when you have refused to for months.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 23:43, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>BTW the same exact Arab tribes (like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bani_Kaab_1079.html" title="Bani Kaab">Bani Kaab</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bani_Tamim_36e0.html" title="Bani Tamim">Bani Tamim</a>, two of the biggest) in Khuzestan also exist in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>.

<li>I am half-Arab (and half-Kurd) myself genius, so don't start with the "Persian chauvinist" routine. I have never denied that Arabs are not an ethnic group. But "Khuzestani Arabs" are <i>not</i> an ethnic group - they are no different from their cousins in Iraq and the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> Arab states such as <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrain.html" title="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> and <a href="../../../u/a/e/UAE_b6ae.html" title="UAE">UAE</a> (except Iranian Arabs speak Persian!) Again, your block history proves your POV and your attempts to transform Wikipedia into an ethnic battleground. The fact that I am advocating for an article on <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> or Arab citizens of Iran puts your accusations to shame. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 23:50, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have not even mentioned the term Persian chauvinist. Where have I ever called you a Persian chauvinist? In contrast, you have called me a separatist simply for defending the existence of an article entitled <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a>, which was created in May 2005 by a member of the Iranian Wikipedians team called <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> - an ethnic Persian who comes from Khuzestan, who has now retired from Wikipedia - and which I only began editing in January 2006, long after <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a>, another Iranian Wikipedian who never contested the article's title. So why is it, after nearly two years of editing by various people, you decide that this is a POV article title?--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:02, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What others have done or what others ignore is not my business. So far many Iranian editors have more interest in <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish.html" title="Turkish">Turkish</a> matters than Khuzestan (or Kurdish articles). But anyway thats not my concern. I have already explained the points of concern, which you ignore. BTW do not use terms like "Iranian Wikipedians team" - there is no such "team". Like I said, Wikipedia is not a battleground of ethnicities, races, ideologies, whatever. If you think it is, you should leave because there is no tolerance for this stuff. I suggest you look what happened to the Armenian and Azerbaijanis who were constantly in conflict at the ArbCom. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 00:09, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Given the fact that I withheld content from this article because of <i>your</i> objections and put it into the talk page for discussion, which you refused to participate in, indicates that I am not the one imposing a POV but have attempted to seek an agreement. I've tried engaging in dialogue with you and agreed to a mediation offer from a neutral party, but you have refused. Now you want to delete an article which has existed for nearly two years and has had participation from Iranian editors, who have never raised the argument that the article title is inappropriate or POV.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:22, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your block log speaks otherwise about your so-called "diplomacy". I have already explained the problems. Do you want me to explain again? If Iranians don't raise objections, what the hell does that do with anything or have any concern for me? This has nothing to do with what Iranians object to or don't object to, this is about factuality and neutrality. There is no such thing as a "Khuzestani Arab" ethnic group. They are <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>, plain and simple. Is this difficult to understand for you or what? Stop wasting my time. And articles have existed for three years and then been deleted. There is no "statute of limitation" here - if an article is bad or wrong and people ignore it, that doesn't mean it should stay because its been around for years. Thats a joke. Most Iranian editors don't seem to be interested in Arab issues, I guess, so they either don't care or don't know enough about this matter. To admins: <b>What is obvious to me is that User:Ahwaz (see outrageous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ahwaz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Ahwaz" rel="nofollow">block history</a>) is attempting to close this AfD with <i>no consensus</i> by hammering the same objection again and again.

<ul>
<li>I'd request that editors assess the existence of this article, rather than making it a trial of me personally. As I have said, many others have edited this article, including Iranian editors who created the article in the first place. So, it is not an article created by Arab separatists to support an Arab separatist agenda, or it would have been deleted by now. It is not a POV fork. Any editorial problems should be dealt with on the talk page - something that Khorshid refused to do when I pasted merge sections from another article into the talk page for discussion.</li>
<li>Additionally, the argument that all Arabs are just Arabs is not true, as Arabs are varied in their tribal, religious, national, linguistic, geographical, historical and racial profile. It is not "plain and simple". Arab identity is complex and Arabs in Khuzestan are distinct from Arabs in other parts of Iran, unless they have migrated to another by of Iran either voluntarily or by force.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 00:44, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have <b>never</b> sourced any of your claims. Instead you rely on anti-Semitic "scholars" like <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasser_Pourpirar_e067.html" title="Nasser Pourpirar">Nasser Pourpirar</a>, who you have constantly praised (editors please check history of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs_of_Khuzestan_fc5b.html" title="Arabs of Khuzestan">Arabs of Khuzestan</a> for evidence). Arabs in Khuzestan belong to the same tribes as Arabs in Iraq and the rest of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>.

<li>I must say, this is a gross distortion in order to discredit me. In a discussion, I quoted from a document. In another part of that document, there was a quote from this man. To claim that I have quoted him, let alone praised him, is just wrong.

<li>Unfortunately <a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">User:Ahwaz</a> is very good at diverting discussion with his unsourced claims, so this may result in no consensus. See his block history. However, my points have been made. It is POV to have this kind of article for Iran, while Israel, Turkey, and the Arab countries themselves (which have various dialect groups of Arabic) have only <b>one</b> article - if that - about the Arabic-speaking populations. That is what the closing admin should take into account, the POV nature of the article title, the mess that the article is, and the constant hauranging by Ahwaz, who repeats the same objection <b>again and again</b>. If anything he should be blocked again for two months this time for wasting my time. In a way I am foolish for continuing to reply to him, but I'd like to make sure the closing admin realises who he/she is dealing with. Most countries keep this information at <b>Demographic of [country]</b>. Instead, we have this POV nationalism. Again, Wikipedia is not a political battleground. Furthermore, there are <b>no</b> sources at all to distinguish Khuzestani Arabs from other Arab groups. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 01:16, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>It takes two to get into a fight, and speaking for myself, I don't care to sort out the dispute between the two of you, but it is obvious that there is an ongoing dispute, and that's not healthy for Wikipedia. If you believe this user is disruptive, try <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> instead of AfD. And as far as the subject itself goes, I don't see a problem with it. If somebody wants to make articles about other ethnic sub-groups in other countries, I am not inherently opposed. They need only provide reliable sources. And yes, examples those sorts of pages do exist. See <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Americans_in_New_York_City_3857.html" title="Irish Americans in New York City">Irish Americans in New York City</a> for one. Not a great page, but the subject itself is acceptable.

<ul>
<li>Show me one reliable source in the article. Like I said, I have already made my points. It is true it takes two to get into a "fight", but I am not going to allow this user to make baseless accusations against me without responding to them. You clearly do not know much about the subject matter, and that is why I have to respond to such accusations, lest people think he is making a legitimate point. This user has a long history of creating problems - if you want to ignore that, fine. But don't make accusations yourself. Again, I have stated before <b>clearly</b> that no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have been provided! You ignore my statement. That is abusive.

<li>BTW that article on Irish Americans in NYC is just a list! It should be moved to List of Irish Americans in New York City! For heavens sake, at least come up with a better example to prove your ill-conceived point! There is not even a single mention of a Khuzestani Arab in this article, since we already have a list of Iranian Arabs at <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Iranian_Arabs_f9c0.html" title="Famous Iranian Arabs">Famous Iranian Arabs</a>. Again, an article on <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> is justifiable, one on Khuzestani Arabs, that has barely any properly sourced content, is not. One that is being defended by a user who has been blocked numerous times, the last time for a month! We do not accodomate abusive and troublesome users here.

<li>Ahem, I'm not taking about the other user, I'm not backing him up, nor am I attacking you, but I'm concerned that the obvious problems between the two of you are detracting from any discussion of the subject itself. Which they are. You can worry about responsibility if you want, I'm not. I'm saying there is a problem between editors here. And hey, I don't think <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Americans_in_New_York_City_3857.html" title="Irish Americans in New York City">Irish Americans in New York City</a> is a good article, right now, but I think the subject itself is quite valid. Sources could be provided for it (there are books documenting the history of the Irish in New York City. See for example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Immigrants-York-City-1945-1995/dp/0253338433" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Immigrants-York-City-1945-1995/dp/0253338433" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. And there are pages on individual neighborhoods in NYC, from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinatown%2C_Manhattan_bc23.html" title="Chinatown, Manhattan">Chinatown, Manhattan</a> to <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell%27s_Kitchen_f123.html" title="Hell's Kitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a> and more. Given that this Arabic group is real, I see no reason not to have an article. Or at least some coverage. If you want to cover them under some other article, that might be worth discussing, but this isn't the forum to do that.

<li>Why do you insist on changing the subject again??? We are <b>not</b> talking about neighbourhoods. We are talking about an ethnic group. There is <b>no such thing</b> as a "Khuzestani Arab" ethnic group. They are <b>Iranian Arabs</b> who <b>live</b> in the <b>Khuzestan Province</b>. Are you suggesting we also create articles for each and every Persian group in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad, Abadan, Ahvaz, Yazd, Kerman, on and on and on and on and on???

<ul>
<li>I already said, I have no objection to providing information on any ethnic subgroup on which reliable sources exist. And if you don't see the connection between a neighborhood and an ethnic subgroup, well, I'm not sure how else to explain it. If it's ok to cover a few blocks in NYC, it's ok to cover the ethnic groups of a population of a province in Iran. As I see it, there's no real reason not to cover these subjects. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Arabs of Khuzestan" is a horribly POV title, and as I suggested even if the article was to be kept <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> (the best choice) or even Iranian Arabs in Khuzestan would be better (not a good choice considering the lack of information in this article alone). Though to conform with other Wikipedia articles, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> is best. Do you think there would be support in the Israel articles for Arabs of Tel Aviv or Arabs of Haifa??? If this article is kept, then we should definitely create articles for every Israeli city and township that has a significant Arab population. Same holds true for United States - we should create Arabs of Michigan, and for France, Arabs of Paris, and the UK, Arabs of England as well as Pakistanis of England and Indians of England, and so on.

(And every Israeli city and Township should have an article, and that article should cover the Arabic population there if there is meaningful information on it, whether or not that should be spun off? Probably not, but that's because the size of the article itself isn't likely to be a problem.). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> and <b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> or Arab citizens of Iran. I agree with <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> . I am sure there are some differences between different arab groups but the same can be said about any other group in Iran and many other countries as well.Not all the persian people of Iran live a life exactly similar to each other. Each little town has its own tradition, food, etc. Same thing can be said about Italian people, French people, Germans, chineese, etc. The only rational way is to go based on language as do most sources such as CIA <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html." class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html." rel="nofollow">[14]</a> CIA obviously does not distinguish between different Arab groups in Iran. when it says 3% of Iranians are Arab, it means all the Arabs so obviously they are close enough to be considered ONE GROUP.

I can not understand how ahwaz can claim that <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arab_744c.html" title="Iranian Arab">Iranian Arab</a> is POV? what part of it is POV? that they are Iranian? or that they are Arab? what is POV in calling the Arab citizens of Iran as such?<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 19:08, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike other Arab groups in Iran, Arabs in Khuzestan had a degree of political autonomy until 1925, when the region was known as Arabistan. The local ruler was Sheikh Khazal, who led the tribes of Khuzestan in alliance with some local Bakhtiari tribes. Arabs in other parts of Iran, eg Bandar Abbas, were never a part of this and even have different tribes, origins and dialect. Consequently, the culture and origins of the Arabs of Khuzestan deserves an article. Khorshid claims there is a lack of sources, but this is no reason to delete an article. The quality of an article does not determine whether it should exist. As for Arabs of Paris, British Pakistanis, etc articles, why not? There is no rule against this. If there is a notable ethnic group in a region with a distinct history, then there should be an encyclopaedic article. Incidentally, there are articles on different Persian ethnic groups (<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakhtiari.html" title="Bakhtiari">Bakhtiari</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/r/Lurs.html" title="Lurs">Lurs</a>), which I think deserve more attention.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 19:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

They are <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>. The real issue at hand is the fact that Ahwaz seems to want to avoid articles that state the facts, e.g. <i>that Khuzestani Arabs are indeed Iranian Arabs</i>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> seems at least partially sourced (the deletionists should feel free to delete those parts which aren't) but it seems that this ethno-linguistic group really exists, that there are multiple independent sources to that effect. Keeping this does not mean that there will or should be all the Foos in Fooland articles because simply many of those groups aren't notable per se. Here, I think that case to keep has been made "nothing but net". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:40, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>A quick note on terminology: apparently the languages used by the Arabs of Bandar Abbas and those of Khuzestan are not the same (see <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IR" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IR" rel="nofollow">the Ethnologue report</a>), so regardless of whether the Iranian government lumps all Arabs together or not (like the Turkish government doesn't recognize that there are any Kurds) is something to mention in the article but does not negate the appropriateness for a separate article on the separate groups. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 19:46, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>CIA puts all Iranian Arabs together as well. Also the comparision with the kurds in Turkey is completely wrong. the huge difference between Kurds and Turks are not even comparable to small differnece between two Arab groups in Iran who both speak Arabic but different dialect( not languages but dialect) kurdish is not a dialect of turkish or vice versa. they are two different languages from different families. There is no similarites between these two issues. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGol_cff6.html" title="User:Gol">Gol</a> 20:59, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>What are you talking about Carlos? Arabs speak Arabic - this is basic. Arabs in Khuzestan speak what is called a Mesopotamian dialect while Bandari Arabs speak the Gulf dialect. Every Arab in every region speaks a different dialect, but its still Arabic. Persians in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, etc all speak different dialects of Persian, but its still Persian. That doesn't make them different ethnic groups. Seriously you should do more reading on this subject before jumping to such ridiculous conclusions. Wikipedia is not here to pander to nationalism and separatism. An article on <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> will have enough room to deal with both Khuzestani Arabs and Bandari Arabs. The sourced content of the current article is minimal and is basically just population figures, some of which are for Iran's total Arab population. And as Gol says, comparing Iranian Arabs to Kurds in Turkey is nonsense. Iranian government doesn't deny anything about the existence of its Arab population - but Khuzestani Arabs and Bandari Arabs are not "distinct" ethnic groups. They're Arabs, just as the Iranian government doesn't differentiate between Persians from Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan, etc. Is that difficult to understand??? Furthermore please keep your personal opinions and politicking out of this discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why delete and redirect/merge? Why not just change the name of the article to whatever you choose and work to extend the content? There doesn't seem to be anything to merge this article into, as there is nothing in Wikipedia on Arabs from other parts of Iran. "Delete and merge" implies to me that the content is moved into another article - so why not save the effort and simply rename the current article? "Delete and redirect" seems like support for deleting the article content and redirecting to the current "Iranian Arabs" page, which contains very little. Is this what people want? Is it the case that they want the current content on Ahwazi Arabs to be part of a larger article on Arabs in Iran or that they want the article itself, with all its content, deleted.

<li>Ok, I hear your points - even though there is nothing that would bar an article such as Arabs in Khuzestan from a logical point of view (since, if there is enough content, we can also have Arabs in London, Germans in Paris), the article really looks like it has hashed too much info from other articles. Listen, I am definitely not against covering the topic, far from it - nevertheless, I believe that there needs to be a clear structure to such articles. But there is not even an article at Arabs in Iran and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> was just a dab page - don't you think that it would be healthier to create and expand a larger article for all of Iran (ie Arabs in Iran/Iranian Arabs), cover the Arabs of/who live in Khuzestan in a section there, <i>then</i>, at some point in the future when the article will have grown in an encyclopedic structure and manner, perhaps branch out to such a sub-article at that point? (Although I also hear the point of Alborz Fallah about the confusion between Arabs of Iran/Iranian Arabs - but that is a specific content issue that needs to be ironed out in those articles, not this AfD) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 11:34, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

If I had been allowed, by other editors, to add these sections or even if they had discussed this with me, the article would have improved. As I said, there has been a tendency to stack 3RRs and revert everything I write, but no interest in using the talk pages or taking up offers of mediation. Consequently, the article has stagnated. Now the way to deal with the issues that some appear unwilling to discuss is to delete the entire article, which I think is a legitimate and encyclopaedic topic of study - especially given that the Arab tribes in this region had political autonomy up until 1925 whereas Arabs in other regions had no autonomy.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 11:48, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bretons are a Celtic ethnic group in France, Acadians are French-speakers who settled in New France centuries ago and have no connection to France except language, thus cannot be considered "French". Same with the Pennsylvania Dutch and so on. These aren't ethnic subgroups, as they have no modern connections to their root ethnicities. I have explained that Arabs in Khuzestan don't form a homogenous "tribe" or "ethnic group" - the fact that there are refugees and immigrants from Iraq and immigrants from the Gulf states speaks a great deal to this. What sources are included with the article demonstrate that many Arabs in Khuzestan speak the very same dialect of Arabic as their brethren in Iraq, striking another blow for your unusual <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> theory. But just as you ignore Khorshid's points, you ignore mine. Please, don't waste my time.

<ul>
<li>Yet the Bretons are a distinct group of people, not just generic Celts, as the Khuzestan Arabs are a distinct Arabic ethnic group in Iran. Small differences. Besides, I mentioned Cajuns and Acadians for a reason. There are two related groups there, not to mention, the French of Quebec who they could be merged into if, for some reason the consensus were to have a single article. But wait, there's not. Not to mention you completely ignored <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_German_4aad.html" title="Ethnic German">Ethnic German</a> which provides many articles on German subgroups that are hardly different from the coverage in this page.

<li><b>Comment</b> No evidence has been displayed showing that Khuzestani Arabs are a "distinct" ethnic group. I also have to mention that Manticore's accusations to the other editor, accusing him of denying the existence of Arabs in the region was purely out of bad faith, as the editor in question has not at all denied the existence of Arabs in Iran. The point that everyone is trying to make here, but being ignored, is that Khuzestani Arabs are not a distinct ethnic group and there is no evidence to justify such a theory of "original research". I say again my statement that <b>"Khuzestani Arabs are Iranian Arabs"</b>. A Google search shows that "Iranian Arabs" is almost always connected with the Arabs of Iran, including in Khuzestan: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=iranian+arabs&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=iranian+arabs&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> I think there are some bad faith editors trying to divert the discussion away from the real points being made here and instead levelling accusations against those who are advocating deletion and/or merging. The fact is that the article has no real content. I suggest to the closing admin to closely inspect my arguments and that of others, since we have pointed out the problems, while Manticore simply resorts to straw man arguments and bad faith accusations. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a political conference, it is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">soapbox for nationalisms or any -ism</a>, it is <b>not</b> a battleground of ideas, ethnicities, nationalities. The fact is that <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a> is the proper article for this subject. This article is mostly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> as it postulates a fringe theory that Arabs in Khuzestan constitute their own ethnic group separate from other Arabs, when in fact, this is not true. They are Iranian Arabs, and they are found outside of Khuzestan in Tehran and other cities. People like Manticore have no knowledge or education in Iranian matters and yet desire to impose their view on cultures and nations with which they have no education about. This is called <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> and Eurocentricism and it is repulsive. To the closing admin: Hold the Iran articles to same standards as Israel and other nations: just as there is <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_citizens_of_Israel_cae8.html" title="Arab citizens of Israel">Arab citizens of Israel</a> instead of "Palestinians", let us have <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Arabs_422a.html" title="Iranian Arabs">Iranian Arabs</a>, the proper and correct term, instead of the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> "Arabs of Khuzestan" which is being used by these users to postulate the existence of a "distinct" Arab ethnic group.

<li><b>Comment</b> - if an indigenous ethnic group in Khuzestan, which numbers millions, is now being stripped of its own Wikipedia article, will articles such as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians_in_Sweden_fabf.html" title="Assyrians in Sweden">Assyrians in Sweden</a> (of which there are a few thousand) also vanish?

<dd>The indigenousness of Arabs of Khuzestan is in question. Nevertheless, that's Assyrians in Sweden, a country, not Assyrians in <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppsala.html" title="Uppsala">Uppsala</a> --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayis_0f35.html" title="User:Rayis">Rayis</a> 10:19, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So, are you saying that articles on an ethnic group based in provinces or cities are POV, whereas those articles on ethnic groups in countries are NPOV? This is the argument being put forward here for the deletion of this article on the Arabs of Khuzestan. I look forward to seeing the nomination of many articles and categories on that basis, or this deletion could be seen as being unfairly unfavourable to Arabs.--<a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhwaz_ff24.html" title="User:Ahwaz">الأهواز | Hamid | Ahwaz</a> 10:35, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>天寶十二載（753年）進士，曾任檢校祠部員外郎、洪州鹽鐵判官。大歷末（779年），伉儷歿於洪州[1]。有《張祠部詩集》。在唐代詩人中，張繼不算大家，也不是名家，宋人葉夢得《石林詩話》記載其詩在南宋時僅存三十多首。《全唐詩》中，只存四十餘首。《楓橋夜泊》是他最著名的詩，作於天寶十五載流寓蘇州時，这首诗首先被选入高仲武編選的《中兴间气集》，後又選入《唐诗三百首》。高仲武評張繼詩：「員外累代詞伯，積習弓裘。其於為文，不自雕飾。及爾登第，秀發當時。詩體清迥，有道者風。」「比興深矣。」其事蹟見於辛文房《唐才子傳》。 According to this, he became a scholar in 753. In terms of Tang poet, He is not a huge poet; Record show that he only have 30 poems left by Song dynasty, while The "Complete Poem Collection of Tang" he only contributed 40. However, he did contributed&lt;&lt;楓橋夜泊&gt;&gt;, which is collected in the "300 Tang Poems", and most famous chinese poem anthology. 142.58.101.27 00:52, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The idea of a notable middle school poet is just ... odd. He might have talent, but I don't think the references are sufficient to establish notability. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:14, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry for my poor English. If the concept of "middle school poet" is <i>odd</i>, do you think "young poet" or "child poet" is fine? It's not usual for a middle school student to publish poems. There is a movement of <i>middle school campus poems</i> in 1980s in China. See article <a href="http://paper.sznews.com/jb/20070317/ca2610875.htm" class="external text" title="http://paper.sznews.com/jb/20070317/ca2610875.htm" rel="nofollow">The Memory of Campus Poems in the 1980s</a> (in Chinese). This article introduced some background for this movement. Jiang Hongwei, a leading young poet in that movement, also wrote some articles to discuss this movement. He is also writing a book about it.

<li>Whatever. I <i>write</i> about Chinese people, but Chinese or not, people have to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guidelines to have articles about them. I don't think this person does. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:24, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>What sources do you think can satisfy the requirement of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>? The <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> requirement says <i>A notable topic has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject.</i> I think that I have provided enough published works to prove his notability.

<li>However, the reference in the <i><a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Daily_2356.html" title="People's Daily">People's Daily</a></i> -- while the paper with the largest circulation in the PRC -- is not, in my opinion, dispositive, because of the general consensus here that a "15 minutes of fame" type of reference is insufficient to establish notability. That's effectively what that link shows. In effect, <i>as it stands right now unless more notability is shown</i>, this was a man who got published as a youngster for the novelty value of having written poetry as a youngster. No literary or other notability is otherwise shown.

<li>I don't think that the <i><a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Daily_2356.html" title="People's Daily">People's Daily</a></i> article is only a "<a href="../../../1/5/_/15_minutes_of_fame.html" title="15 minutes of fame">15 minutes of fame</a>" type of reference. And it is not the only reference in article <a href="../../../h/e/_/He_Li_34f8.html" title="He Li">He Li</a>. Jiang Hongwei's article indicates that He Li was an important figure in the <i>campus poem</i> movement in the 1980s in China (for the background information about Jiang Hongwei and his articles, see "<a href="http://paper.sznews.com/jb/20070317/ca2610875.htm" class="external text" title="http://paper.sznews.com/jb/20070317/ca2610875.htm" rel="nofollow">The Memory of Campus Poems in the 1980s</a>" in Chinese). Moreover, until now this page was exclusively used to discuss <a href="../../../h/e/_/He_Li_34f8.html" title="He Li">He Li</a>, not <a href="../../../h/e/_/He_Jiuying_71cf.html" title="He Jiuying">He Jiuying</a>. I hope you can establish Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/He Jiuying to discuss him separately. Even though the article <a href="../../../h/e/_/He_Li_34f8.html" title="He Li">He Li</a> may be deleted, it does not follow that this conclusion should also be applied to the article for his father.

<dd><b>Comment</b>- I'd also like to add that the first line says <i>Smalltime English activist and writer. Wasn't very well known for his work. He protested against King George II of Great Britain's rise to power because of the king's domestic issues.</i> Here it is logical to ask -</dd>
<dd>1)if he is a smalltime activist and writer, why does he deserve a page?</dd>
<dd>2)if he wasn't very well known for his work, then what purpose does his page serve?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the original article creator, I guess I should point out that this page is not intented as a memorial. The fact that he recently died is tragic, but is not the reason to keep the page. The plain fact is that he was a co-host in several very popular podcasts and a radio show, and out of the four main hosts of these shows, currently only two have pages in wikipedia (which don't seem to be considered for deletion at all). I must say also that is my full intention, once Joe's page is mostly complete, to create another entry for Summer Brooks, the other host that is not currently included in Wikipedia. Failing to include them would not paint a fair picture of their contributions to podcasting history. --Mklopez 04:00, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
<dd>The same can be said for the other people invovled with these shows. And what exactly are the "standards of notability"? That enough people listening to podcasts just happen to be active on Wikipedia too? I have come across loads of articles here that were completely irrelevant to me, but I didn't nominate them for deletion because the authors obviously had a point in putting them up there. Personal preferences might help decide what goes on Wikipedia, but they certainly should not decide what doesn't.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Yes, it is sad that he is dead, but the guy is completely non-notable. A podcaster is no more notable than a HAM radio operator.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Mr. Murphy was a regular contributor to some of the highest rated podcasts. The arguments that "all he did was review stuff" are absurd. There are entries for Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, and all they did was "review stuff" as well. The announcer from the Rush Limbaugh show has his own entry. Engineers and producers from the Howard Stern show have their own pages. To diminish the work Mr. Murphy did on his several podcasts is to make a judgement call that podcasts are less significant than radio broadcasts.64.255.240.82 17:25, 4 April 2007 (UTC) <small>— 64.255.240.82 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.255.240.82_ef59.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.255.240.82">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.

<li><b>Keep</b> As others have said, the timing is unfortunate in that it looks a lot like a memorial page. I feel Joe Murphy's contributions make him notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. He was nominated for awards for his podcasting, and he is well-known and viewed as a minor celebrity within the podcasting world. A comparison to ham radio is not valid, speaking as a ham radio operator. Ham radio is about person-to-person communication, whereas podcasting is a form of broadcast. - Fordan 17:31, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>-Although apparently, the above was <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELove2bebookish_a8c2.html" title="User:Love2bebookish">User:love2bebookish</a>'s first edit to wikipedia, this new editor did eventually begin editing, after receiving a welcome. This is quite different than the above unsigned newbie biting approach of "tagging" single-edit users. I am interested in why this particular AfD has a single editor tag at the top, when this is not normative for all, or even most, AfDs. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini"><b><font color="#885500">K<font color="#BB8800">u<font color="#EEBB00">k</font>i</font>ni</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/u/k/User_talk%7EKukini_a0ce.html" title="User talk:Kukini">hablame aqui</a></sup> 06:33, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Clearly, the template was added because someone felt that people were being told to swarm the page by an outside source.

<ul>
<li>Although this may be the case, it does also serve a function of newbie biting to tag a signed-in newcomers first edit AND then not even try to reach out to that editor with a welcome.

<li><s><b>keep</b></s> <b>Strong Keep</b>She is an associate professor, and associate professors are not always notable , and Oklahoma , though respectable, is not one of the really most prestigious research university is cosmology. But she is, according to the Science article listed on he home page , "Yun Wang, a cosmologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and leader of the JEDI project." I put a link on the article, and will get references tomorrow. Her home page claims "Annual citations from Science Citation Index: 290 (Year 2006); 280 (Year 2005); 170 (Year 2004)" a way of expressing it which is new to me. I am at a loss to know the exact meaning of "no assertion of notability"--does it mean that an assertion that someone is an (associate) professor of physics is inherently not notable? Or does it mean that she has to say in her first sentence that being an (associate) professor of physics is notable? But it could, reasonably, mean not a sufficient assertion to stand up on its own without some more documentation. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:54, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I added the refs. She is a/the principal investigatory on a major proposed astrophysics project, b/the subject of an article about her in ISI Essential Scientific Indicators, the principal subject of an article in the NY Times, a joint subject of one in Science and one in Nature. She clearly is one of the Associate Professors who are notable at that intermediate step in their ( I added the quote from ISI to the article.) However, I know nothing about her poetry. This time, she isn't to blame for the modesty--clearly someone else did the article. Again, people should check in at least Google Scholar, where "Yun Wang" Oklahoma has 68 articles, including the most cited one. Qualifies under any possible interpretation of N. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:50, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
