<li><b>Keep</b> To deal with UTC concerns, the school is notable and has several important alumni. These include <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bess_Truman_19fc.html" title="Bess Truman">Bess Truman</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Harlow_b04c.html" title="Jean Harlow">Jean Harlow</a>. The School has been around for over 100 years and would be notable to those in the area.

I'll update the page to assuage your concerns...</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This seems to be another in a pattern of school deletionism aimed at new school articles. The age and distinguished alumni more than justify retention. That this article was never prod'ed and went straight to AfD is a major cause for concern. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC) The school has served the community for over 120 years, which exceeds the "50-year test" dictated by criterion 2 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. That the schools alumni include <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bess_Truman_19fc.html" title="Bess Truman">Bess Truman</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Harlow_b04c.html" title="Jean Harlow">Jean Harlow</a>, qualifies under criterion 6 "notable alumni or staff (e.g. would qualify for an article under WP:BIO or WP:MUSIC)". As such the article meets and exceeds the retention criteria specified by <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is this a cause for concern? If it had been prod'd, the prod would've been removed almost immediately. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Is this another "the ends justify the means" excuse? Prod'ding the article would have allowed editors to identify the issue before an AfD was created. The failure to follow process and allow for the improvement of an article created by a brand new user is an egregious show of bad faith. Deletionists demand that we follow their own distorted set of rules but refuse to follow the ones we all agree on. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me, but that's a terribly biased, poorly-based, and personally offensive statement. I was simply pointing out that every school article which gets a prod tag has that tag quickly removed, which is true. Since you justified why you would've preferred the article was prod'd, I completely agree with your statement- it would allow for improvement before a possible AfD. However, your blanket statement after this rationale is rather awful. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Was policy followed, or not? Are you justifying this or excusing it? It's a new article, teh first created from a new user and you don't see an issue with that? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:01, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Policy <b>was</b> followed. Prod before AfD is not policy. Prod is to be used when editors feel deletion would be non-controversial. Are you seriously suggesting that a high school article would be a non-controversial deletion, Alansohn?

<li>While the nominator might be excused based on the article's content at the point the AfD was created, the article as it stands now makes several specific claims of notability. As your vote seems to be even more out of consensus than usual, I thought it might be useful to understand what goes on in the mind of an extreme deletionist, for the benefit of all of us. Are any schools notable? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hey Kicking, why is it so unreasonable to request an explanation for a delete when I constantly see the same requests for equally unjustified keep votes. I am willing to tone down a bit here, as long as we have a deal that I have carte blanche to defend articles to the fullest extent possible on all future AfDs. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 06:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fully meets some or most of every damned proposed criteria we've ever had for school inclusion at wikipedia. The education of Jean Harlow and Bess Truman is important. They are role models for lots of folks. I also agree that AfD is being misused.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm strongly opposed to the incessant creation of useless stubs on obscure, non-notable schools (schoolcruft), but this one is not a stub, and seems reasonably notable. I strongly dislike the "50 year rule" as far too generous (especially in areas where many schools have been around for 300+ years), but this is 120 years old, in a region that has only been settled by school-building peoples for a couple of hundred years, and seems to have some notable alumni. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tÃ¤lk</a></sub> 12:28, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> There is nothing notable about this school. It is a small, suburban private school mostly unknown in Kansas City. The entire purpose of this article (much of which was lifted directly from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pembroke_Hill_School_2fc3.html" title="The Pembroke Hill School">The Pembroke Hill School</a>) seems to be to make this tiny school seem "big." Just because Jean Harlow or Bess Truman or a purported politician who never won a primary election went there does not justify an entire article about it. 65.28.2.218 00:12, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It does pass <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> but if I explained a mildly complicated concept to a friend on my balcony over a beer one day, this educational act would allow my balcony to pass <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a>. If it had more than 650 students it would help it's cause drastically. Also let's not get bent out of shape about the prodding, we all know that prods on schools and garage bands get removed instantly.
