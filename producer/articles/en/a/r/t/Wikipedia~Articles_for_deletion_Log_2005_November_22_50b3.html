The site isn't overwhelmingly popular, it hasn't had an impact on anyone aside from people who are involved, and Wikipedia is not the place for this sort of thing.

<li>Pedantic mode on: I didn't create the article, I just rewrote it to be more encyclopedic. What I did create is the site the article refers to.

<p>This is not a <i>Star Wars</i> character. "General Louis" is not mentioned in any novels, even though it seems he was pretty prolific—according to the article, he <i>was</i> friends with Anakin Skywalker, after all, and he did battle Luke Skywalker, although this event is not mentioned in any novels. Furthermore, his compatriot, General Maximus, seems to be a fan-made rip-off of the character from Roman history, specifically Russell Crowe's character in the film <i>Gladiator</i>. I see no evidence this character exists in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, and the way it is written strongly suggests that it is a character from fan fiction. – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 00:30, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>this article is real because the novels are in process; it's a gap between revenge of the sith and the clone rebellion. why are you doings this? give me time i got it from a story written by a friend who wants to be part of star writers; he wants to be a writer an his noval is base on Darth vader and his master conquering the galaxy planet by planet so please don't delete this because i'm a fan of star wars and a menber of wikipedia, i've read his noval and i think it's a good one it explains what happen between order 66 and how the death star's (not fully completed) first role in the Empire his noval is call (dark times a galaxy falls) it's about the empire extending it's power and also referring to how some jedi's turning to the darkside but not becoming a sith apprentice.when his noval is finished i hope it hit stores. oh if you don't mine i would like to send a copy to you when it is finish so that you can read it yourselves and tell us if it make sense six poeple who aren't fans said that it's a good book and should be published i agree so when it's finish we would like to show you if intrested edit this page and say (yes) or (no).</p>

<li>We don't believe that this is an actual character in an official novel. Fan-created characters are almost never <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> enough to warrant inclusion. If you could cite a souce saying this is from official literature, than I would change my vote.

<p>Pretty much <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, claims this is a character in a series of books, I can't find mention of these books (title, character, etc.) on Amazon, Google or Newsgroups.

<li><b>Keep</b> This page just survived two very recent votes for deletion.

<li>I for one don't consider two months and four months ago to be "very recent", and I don't consider the nominator's reasons for nominating the article a third time grounds for disregarding the content of the article, which is crufty to the max. Bad articles should <i>not</i> escape deletion because of technicalities. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 03:49, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, first, let me express that my 'Keep' also applies to the article itself. It is maintainable, noteworthy, and verifiable. It also has undergone lots of work from many editors. You honestly don't consider two months to be recent? Would you renominate articles that have already survived a AfD every two months? It would be one thing if the (unsigned) nominator presented new evidence, or someone how convinced us that the previous voting process was flawed, but they have done neither. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 13:58, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You're right. The anonymous user has not provided any new reasons why the list should be deleted, so I'll have a go at it. Firstly, I don't think Nom 2 should be given any weight at all. The only rationale for keeping the list was that the article had been put up for deletion only a month previously. There has been no discussion of the merits of the article itself since August. If two months is stretching it, three months is surely OK. Secondly, as of now the vote stands at <b>15-9</b> in favour of deletion, which indicates that opinion has swung heavily since August. My guess is that my fellow Wikipedians are getting fed up with the proliferation of listcruft in Wikipedia and, in my view, rightly so. There's obviously strong opinions on both sides and I think there needs to be discussion about it. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 02:58, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I just realized there's an institutional imbalance in the tension between Keepers and Deleters of Wikipedia articles. Someone can renominate an article for deletion over and over again, as long as there's some unspecified minimal delay between nominations, but if <i>one time</i>, the interested parties miss the vote window, the article is deleted and can <i>never</i> be recreated without being speedy-deletion bait. This means that anyone on a crusade to rid WP of controversial articles need only be persistent, and they're likely to win, whereas someone fighting to keep such an article loses forever with one negative vote. This troubles me. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 18:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not quite that bad. Sometimes deleted articles get recreated when more notable content is available, and are not necessarily speedied, or even deleted at all. Still, I <i>do</i> think it is somewhat cynical to renominate articles for deletion that have survived multiple prior rounds. It's a rare case (and not this one by a long shot) where the prior notability of a topic suddenly vanishes. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's not that bad <i>in practice</i>, but how would one necessarily know that anyway, given the current size of Wikipedia? Anyway, it doesn't change the principle.

<dd>Your observations make two mistakes. 1) they assume votes are partisan between two camps - they are not, many of us vote on merits not preconceptions. 2) if we are talking of 'institutional imbalance' then remember that the 70% threshhold for deletion (30% to keep) would be a greater conterbalance. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 19:15, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Doc, I'm sorry but I cannot follow your reasoning here, at all. (1) votes <i>are</i> "partisan" if you describe those parties as "those who vote delete on the merits" and "those who vote keep on the merits". Besides, I cannot see in what way JeffQ's argument relies on the "mistake" that votes are partisan. (2) Comparing the 30:70-thing with JeffQ's don't-keep-renominating-thing is comparing apples with fishwives. Surely it's obvious that your chances of getting a 70% vote on one occasion increase in proportion to the number of times you put the matter to the vote. For what it is worth, my view is that:
<ol>
<li>Broadly, editors should respect a keep consensus at AfD and not renominate articles they do not like in the hope of a more sympathetic crowd at AfD on the next occasion;</li>
<li>Wikipedians should be far more careful than usual in voting to delete pages like this one which are long-established and have attracted a lot of editors.</li>

<dd>There is no clear way to separate "partisan" from "non-partisan", as anyone following politics can readily observe. Most passionate arguments stem from basic ideas that have some merit within a society; otherwise one or the other side would feel too uncomfortable to speak up. Many people who claim non-partisanship do so because they refuse to accept the other side as rational. Sometimes this is true, but usually it is emphatic rhetoric to demean opponents. Consider how dismissive and even mean some of the current votes here are ("obviously misconceptions", "stupidly unmaintainable", ridiculing with "ridiculous") and compare them to <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikiquette</a> guidelines. (And what the heck is a "proto-Hornby"? I don't know whether the list editors should be flattered or insulted by this. It would have been nice if JJay had <i>taken advantage of the medium</i> and added a link to whatever was meant by this!&#160;:-) As for AndyJones's idea about respecting keep consensi, I agree in general but acknowledge that we should be able to renominate articles after <i>some</i> reasonable time, because situations and the mood of the community can change over time. But rapid-fire renomination is an abuse of the process. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 18:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> Good point. Keeping this article around helps fight systemic bias on wikipedia and helps shed light on the frustrations felt by minority French Muslims. Many Americans feel that France has a coddling attitude towards those of Arab extraction due to the government's opposition to the Second Iraqi War. In reality, this could not be further from the truth. France has no form of affirmative action and many French Arabs are mired in unemployment and are victims of a form of unspoken racism. While one burger joint outside of Paris might not be notable in and of itself, the underlying social context is a valuable piece of the puzzle in gainging a grain of understanding of the racial crisis that has come to a head in modern French (and European) society. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 20:32, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the link to the French article. I was going on what I had heard in a news report a couple of months ago and could not find a citation either way in English, Spanish, or Dutch (the languages I could read. Just a quick point however; I never argued that the Beurs were "anti-American," but rather anti-globalization. These two terms are increasingly used interchangebly, which is somewhat misleading since, as you pointed out, many people that are opposed to the policies of the American government and MNCs are infatuated with the popular culture of the US. When pressed for an answer, even many Iranians, for example, will admit that they do not hate Americans, but rather the government and globalism. There are even Americans playing in the Iranian basketball league (no citation, but a search of the BBC will lead to the artilce. But I digress. As to the question of the French wikipedia's choice to delete their article, I fully respect their choice for their project, but I do not, in good faith, see how it bears on this particular discussion (see my user page for more on that), but I would, of course, welcome their imput on this discussion, if they so choose. I am, however, starting to lean back towards my "merge and redirect" vote as a result of the source you have provided, with the possibility of this article being recreated as a fork in the future if needed. I also see the logic of A man in Black's point about writing an article on the Euro-Arab trend of recreating elements of American popular culture without negative aspects of globalism. Does this sound like a good idea to others? What would be an appropriate title? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 13:36, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The article is clearly original research, since it is propounding an novel definition of what it is to be a "most famous person". <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:28, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When I wrote that this list implies the existence of dittos for 1864, 1865, etc., it simply hadn't crossed my mind that someone might actually be toiling away at it.

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> - I have worked with Human BioAcoustics for several years now. As a mathematician myself, I am awed with the mathematics of Human BioAcoustics. The steps involved in doing a Vocal Profile are so logical or ‘BioLogical’ as we often say that I feel like I have solved a problem in mathematics when I have finished. The results obtained are outstanding. This truly is a magnificent science and should be supported and strengthened for the benefit of mankind. Sharlene Simmons (Sharlene@natureswell.com) 8:40PM 24 Nov 2005.</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> * Having recently taken training at Sound Health Inc, on the subject of Vocal Profiling and Human Bioacoustics, I am impressed with the research that was presented. I am amazed that frequencies produced by the voice can be analyzed to describe the state of the human body. This is very exciting research and needs to be expanded to broaden its impact on human well being. Neil Simmons PE (neil@natureswell.com) 8PM 24 Nov 2005</p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> - this work is among the most profound I have ever encountered. I have referred many patients to Sharry for Bioacoustic evaluation. She never ceases to amaze me and she has been ever so helpful to me, my practice and my patients. I am very thankful for her presence on the planet. Roman Chrucky, MD. Thanksgiving Day, 2005.</p>

<li>DO NOT DELETE My name is Lita Lee, Ph.D. I am a chemist and my work consists of enzyme nutrition, environmental health, organic nutrition and hormonal balancing. My website, www.litalee.com has many articles and information on these topics. I became certified as a BioAcoustics practitioner in 1998 by Sharry Edwards at Sound Health, Inc. So profound is her work that I dedicate a success story called Sound Bites in each of my To Your Health newsletters available free from my website. Since 1998, Ms. Edwards and I (and many other professionals including medical doctors, nurses, dentists, etc.) have worked closely together to combine the modalities of our diverse professions to produce incredible results that heretofore would have been unimaginable. I have personal experience using BioAcoustics in critical situations where no other help was available and these clinical results are posted on my website in my newsletters and in articles by Ms. Edwards and other practitioners. BioAcoustics is truly cutting edge research into a new future of "drugless self-healing." So, I am not surprised at any negative remarks, condemnations, etc., that would be posted here.</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>- One would think that an open source encyclopedia would have more open minds reviewing proposed entries. Perhaps the Wikipedia community should be less smug and take a closer look at the alternatives being castigated (the stub was offered, after all, for the alt-med category).</li>
</ul>
<p>If Wikipedia becomes merely a sounding board for "quackbusters" and similar folk, it will lose any claim to inclusiveness. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her great defense of Speech, Thompson v Western States, "If the First Amendment means anything, it means that regulating speech must be a last - not first - resort." *** "We have previously rejected the notion that the Government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information." *** "Even if the Government did argue that it had an interest in preventing misleading advertisements, this interest could be satisfied by the far less restrictive alternative of requiring ... a warning that the drug had not undergone FDA testing and that its risks were unknown."</p>
<p>So, you see, even the Government needs something more than uninformed prejudice before rejecting ideas. If the reviewers had experienced Ms. Edwards's research and its potential benefits, they might rethink their prejudices against her. They might discover that she is a skilled healer and teacher, with notable value to offer humankind.</p>
<p>I offered the original stub because I do admire her research and think it ought to be better known. Rather too often in the history of healing, those castigated as "quacks" were proven to have the seed of a new idea. Which one of you "deleters" have ever struggled to help another find healing: you can caste the first stone.</p>
<p>To respond to the specific allegations:</p>
<p>1. "Non-notable quackery" - Ms Edwards' research has been reported in a significant number of alternative venues, including Nexus Magazine, and her work was featured in 2004 in Health on the Edge - Visionary Views of Healing in the New Millennium by Larry Trivieri. In 2002, she was, as noted in the stub, given the O. Spurgeon English Humanitarian Award at Temple University. This award was given, at that same time, to ten other well known alternative wellness researchers, including six MDs and that beautiful mind, Dr. John Forbes Nash (another quack, perhaps?) Check it out at: <a href="http://www.lifespirit.org/se2002award.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lifespirit.org/se2002award.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifespirit.org/se2002award.html</a></p>
<p>2. The "fake peer reviewed journal" is a real peer reviewed journal, with an advisory board that includes an MD and licensed audiologist. The first online edition is an expansion of a private research journal published since 1995. The Sound Health Research Institute is duly recognized and maintains a full ethics and peer review structure. It was precisely the "coming of age" of this modality that led to offering the stub in the first place.</p>
<p>3. "No supporting information" accusation is the result of a lack of willingness to see the research. Somewhat like the Cardinals who refused to look through Galileo's telescope. Read the Nexus article, for example, at <a href="http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/decloakingpathogens.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/decloakingpathogens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/decloakingpathogens.html</a> --or don't read it. I wouldn't want your prejudices disturbed. They are so classic.</p>
<p>4. "Variation on e=mc2" - actually, this expansion of the formula, permitted by the normal rules of substitution, has been noted by others. It is not an example of tampering with Holy Writ. If e=mc2 and e=hv then . . .</p>
<p>5. The "it's wrong and it doesn't work" allegation offers no support other than prejudice. "It's wrong becasue I think it's wrong" is no argument.</p>
<p>6. The "appears to be a hoax" allegation shows an equal lack of thinking. It is soo easy to just go along with the heard, isn't it?</p>
<p>7. "Crackpot" is equally an unsupported ad hominum attack.</p>
<p>None of these objections have any intellectual merit and show an appalling lack of openmindedness. Shame on you all.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia deletes this stub, rather than, say, including an appropriate disclaimer ( such as, "The information in this stub has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration") for the sake of the prejudices of some members of the Wikipedia community, it is doing exactly what Justice O'Connor said is a bad thing to do.</p>

<li>Non-notable quackery. The page helpfully mentions Ms Sharry edwards, M. Ed. eight times, thus also managing to be a vanity page as well.

I am a semi-retired lawyer who has volunteered to work with nonprofits like Sound Health Research Institute. I posted the original stub on Human Bioacoustics because, after 34 years representing people in the alternative healing world, I've come to the conclusion that Ms. Edwards is the real thing.

Here's a bio: <i>Nato a Napoli nel 1940, Peppino Gagliardi comincia la carriera di cantante con un complesso che porta il suo nome, i Gagliardi. Diventato solista, nel 1963 ottiene un primo successo con 'T'amo e t'amerò'. Il suo periodo più fortunato è quello dei primi anni '70: va in classifica con 'Settembre', 'Sempre sempre', e nel 1972 e '73 ottiene due secondi posti a Sanremo, il primo con 'Come le viole' e il secondo con 'Come un ragazzino'. A partire dagli anni '80 si ritira gradualmente dal mondo della canzone; sua ultima partecipazione a Sanremo, nel 1993, con 'L'alba'.</i> <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 08:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</s>

Or merge it with something else, if we already have articles on this type of pigeon and sport. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 15:44, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just wanted to add Zurn on here because you have other companies, like Kodak, etc. I didn't see anything wrong with that. Zurn is over a century old and is a reputable plumbing manufacturer. If you people want to exclude Zurn, fine. But if you do you have also destroyed my faith in Wikipedia, which I have promoted and shared with anyone who would listen to me.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you have a problem with Zurn, why do you still have other companies listed on your site? Isn't that a little crooked to allow some and not others? I do not work for Zurn, but I do know of them quite a bit through my business here in Florida. My intent was merely to provide an informational article on the company. Why is this being done? Do you not have links to a company's website on other articles? I can list a few if you'd like.</dd>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The problem with this article is not that Zurn is a company (just like Kodak) and that companies don't deserve articles. The problem is that the article as written is overly promotional in nature, and is mostly a copy/paste from Zurn's website, making it a copyright violation. If you want to save the article, it needs to be rewritten to explain why Zurn is an important plumbing company (assuming that it is), how Zurn's products work, a little about the history of the company, etc., and remove any unsubstantiated claims (e.g., "one of the largest plumbing products packages in the world"). If Zurn really is over 100 years old (and didn't just acquire an older company to assume their incorporation date), they should indeed have an article, but this isn't it. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 22:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't think he's notable enough to merit an article. Ignoring the Vietnam stuff which is almost certainly a hoax as it is not mentioned on his bio at <a href="http://www.bigart.co.uk/frankjohnston/frankjohnston.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bigart.co.uk/frankjohnston/frankjohnston.htm" rel="nofollow">Bigart</a> (the only mention I found of him on the web), his art career is genuine but not exactly earth-shattering. A quote from the Bigart bio sums it up I think: "His artwork with major companies in the Food, Drink &amp; Leisure industries is extensive." So he does decorative, tasteful work which is hardly ground-breaking or influential. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpondoolicks_64fc.html" title="User:Spondoolicks">Spondoolicks</a> 12:10, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>"Extreme card manipulation" is, purportedly, the manipulation of a deck of playing cards merely as a feat of dexterity. However, searching reveals that the only people who believe that this concept exists are those who are selling their DVDs of "extreme card manipulation" — via the web site that the article used to link to. To contrast this with recognized skills: One can find <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prestidigitation.html" title="Prestidigitation">prestidigitation</a> discussed in a wide assortment of published works on magic by separate sources. One can find <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuffle.html" title="Shuffle">shuffling</a> discussed in many separately sourced published works on card games, card tricks, and recreational mathematics. One can find separately sourced books and even take courses on <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggling.html" title="Juggling">juggling</a>. There's nothing, apart from information from a single source, about "extreme card manipulation". This concept simply hasn't been accepted by anyone other than the people selling it. An encyclopaedia article will be warranted when <i>other people</i>, independent of its creators, go to the effort of creating and publishing works of their own about this subject. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:39, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. I don't see the contradiction between magic and XCM. It's like calling "juggler" a magician who does only juggling in his performance, isn't it? As for the vanity/neologism argument, it has already been coined, and it is obviously (as this discussion shows) known outside their community, so perhaps a <b>neutral</b> article about this topic would be useful? If you don't like them, consider that deletion will have exactly the opposite effect - if someone hears the term, he will look up it in Google instead of Wikipedia, and will get only POV information about the subject. From what I have heard, there is a fashion lately to do "magic" consisting just of flourishes, so it needs to be called somehow anyway. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> 02:12, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

Absolutely no grounds to merge this article as there is insufficient disinterested, independent corroboration out there that this is a legitimate and accepted category. Would set a bad precedent for Wiki being used for self-promotion. The early entries on the page were blatantly POV and as <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> points out were patently self-promotional. I personally know three <i>highly</i> notable card magicians and what weighs for me even more than the discussion here is that <i>they</i> have never heard of this concept. And by the way - these <b>magicians</b> are every bit as skilled as so-called extreme manipulators. What this boils down to is that there appears to be a tiny (<i>very</i> tiny) <i>sect</i> out there who have decided that they don't want to be associated with the word <i>magic</i> or indeed its practice but just want to focus on <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flourish.html" title="Flourish">flourishes</a>; these are not grounds to justify a Wiki page. At most - and this would seem necessary even - exponents of extreme should simply be listed under a (newly created) list of highly rated exponents of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flourish.html" title="Flourish">flourishes</a> and on the latter page. The term <i>extreme card manipulation</i> (or <i>XCM</i>) itself is so blatantly a neologism coined for self-gain purposes and is so incontrovertibly <b>not</b> in <i>bona fide</i> currency that one should forebear from giving it any oxygen of publicity that a Wiki mention confers. As some of you know on this page, I have made contributions to practically every magic related page on Wiki - but this one for me was beyond salvage. Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extreme_card_manipulation&amp;oldid=18408088" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extreme_card_manipulation&amp;oldid=18408088" rel="nofollow">first ever edit</a> - unabashedly crediting the alleged originator of the term and listing that person's instructional DVDs.

<p><s>I believe this page should be deleted for the following reasons:</s></p>
<p><s>1. Lack of notability: a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22toni+kuusisto%22+patch&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22toni+kuusisto%22+patch&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> using the artist's birth name and pseudonym uncovers only one article; a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22toni+kuusisto%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22toni+kuusisto%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">broader search</a> reveals 103 pages, but it does not appear that many of those (if any) are connected to the article in question.</s></p>
<p><s>2. The article is written poorly (while not quite unreadable, it's clearly written by a non-native english speaker) -- not, in itself, a reason to delete the article, but because the article is about an individual from a country that has few native English speakers, I suspect that it is a simple vanity page.</s></p>
<p><s>3. There is only one article (the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patch.html" title="Patch">Patch</a> disambig page) that links to the article in question.</s></p>
<p><s>I'm generally a mild inclusionist, but this seemingly-vane article clearly lacks notability. Should be a simple decision.

Also, who would go to a general reference work to find out about a publication like this, if they really didn't already know about it? I think entries like this generally amount to little more than schemes to inflate the Google rankings for whatever page, and increase website traffic. Eyeballs can be monetized, after all. I'm not saying it's an outright scam; all I'm asking is, what purpose does this type of article serve and who is behind it? Discuss amongst yourselves...</s></p>

As to the substance of the issue (though this nomination doesn't deserve it), I think the utility for the reader is obvious, especially for the reader having read a bit of/about the paper and wanting to know its history. The paper seems to enjoy fairly wide circulation, certainly has notable contributors, and is at least as notable as the many, many high schools which have articles. Note also that the article is a stub, and could probably be expanded with links showing syndication and discussion of Beast articles in larger media outlets. <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 10:12, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<p>Some Boy Scout troops might be notable - maybe. However, this one makes no such assertion.

<p>The intent was to expand the article, and to include over time other troops that are notable, both for their contributions to their community and their history. This was simply the first as it was one I was associated with, and it would have been expanded with relevant information. I've seen a great many frivolous entries about obscure pop culture, this at least would provide the history of a particular troop should someone be interested.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> or "userfy."

<p>Why delete it? Not notable enough? You don't like to list chat sites? I guess if lintilla isn't listed then this one shouldn't be either, because lintilla was way more popular than this one, and was around for a lot longer too. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 17:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Took a while for your comment to show up. Why is it non-notable though? What's the criteria? It had over 10,000 users per day for a period of 7 years, had over 50 spin off chat sites that cite this as its basis for existence, and helped to change political systems. I would have thought that that was notable. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 17:52, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed the nominator got rid of the External Links section. A convenient way to push for a deletion, methinks. Granted they are dead links, but that's where they were held. As stated previously, there was a court case forcing the deletion of a lot of it, and the remainder were either deleted because the accounts became inactive or else they were on free servers that delete things after a while. Still worth keeping the links there though.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you are going to delete it then fine, but at least give a sensible reason why. If it is policy not to list chat sites, or that there is a certain criteria of popularity, then fine. But list it please. I mean, without knowing what the criteria was, I would have thought that 10,000 users per day for 7 years equated to notoriety. Not to mention the controversy involved in it, or the links that it gave.</p>
<p>It's not like this was just some random chat site that someone made as a pet project that was never popular, nobody ever went to, and no programming ever went in to it. I know that such places exist. This was one that influenced tens of thousands of lives. There are probably more notable chat sites but not a lot of them. It was probably on par with Crossroads or Lintilla with notoriety, but probably not as notable as Surfers.</p>
<p>Again, if this is a matter of not being notable enough, then fine, but *PLEASE* quote your sources! For heaven's sakes! Just arbitrarily getting rid of it like this is atrocious. If nothing else, that took me 2 hours to write! 2 hours out of my life! If I'd known I was writing it just for it to be deleted on the spot, then I wouldn't have written it.</p>
<p>If someone wrote a history of chat site culture, they would include this. Is there such a thing on wikipedia? I know, nowadays people don't much use talkers. People use MSN messenger or Yahoo or ICQ. But people used to use them a lot from 1993-1998 or thereabouts, and this one was one of the big ones out there back then. It is historically important if you want to understand such things as the evolution to ICQ and things like that.</p>
<p>But hey, if you consider it to be non-notable, then go ahead. Delete it. At least it was only 2 hours of work, hey.</p>
<p>And delete my links, so that it looks like original research.</p>
<p>Hope you get a kick out of destroying people's work there, buddy, cos there's nothing constructive in deleting something like this. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 19:21, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article does assert some notability, but its current content is patently non-encyclopedic. <b>Delete</b> unless completely rewritten, and verified. - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 20:31, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Okay I have written <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lintilla_%28chat_site%29.html" title="Lintilla (chat site)">lintilla (chat site)</a> with some links that verify that one. Now, the two of these (along with <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleepy%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Sleepy's multiple worlds">Sleepy's multiple worlds</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Fantasia's multiple worlds">Fantasia's multiple worlds</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a>) are all equally notable. Now, you can verify lintilla with active links, and you can see clearly the link to this one in the chain. If you delete this one due to notoriety then you have to delete lintilla. So go and have a look at that one, and if you think that lintilla isn't notable enough to keep, then neither is this one, and they both should be deleted. You really need to validate what constitutes notoriety before making something like an AFD.</li>
</ul>
<p>If its a matter of references, or how its written, then fine. But please remove the AFD and give it time. Once I've written the other 4 pages, then it'll all be pieced together nicely. This is the most important piece in the puzzle of them all, but they all need to be written. But if you are going to delete this one then I obviously won't bother.</p>
<p>Even nominating this is ridiculous.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry lots of comments here. Okay, I rewrote the whole lot. Just made it very clear, crystal clear in fact, as to why it is notable. I had to swallow a lot of pride on that one, but so be it. I am sure that you will agree that it is encyclopaedic. If you agree that it is notable, and hence worth keeping, then and only then will I add in the huge chunks of history, and then only when its proven to be notable. As stated before, I really have to write the other 4 pages first before doing that, because they all tie in together. But I will make sure that this gets a Keep on the AFD before doing all of that, just to make sure that Wikipedia approves. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 21:59, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Verify</b> if possible, <b>Delete</b> if not. I don't recall ever having heard of any of these, and I've been around MUDs and MUCKs and IRC and so on. If this information can be independently verified, and the articles brought up to Wikipedia standards, great. Otherwise I don't think they should be deleted just because they no longer exist. I mean, <a href="../../../p/o/w/PowWow_%28chat_program%29_b31d.html" title="PowWow (chat program)">PowWow (chat program)</a> is long dead (in Internet time), but because of its influence, IT warrants an article. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 00:40, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I thought that the lintilla links verify this. Its just that they wouldn't be appropriate to list here directly, because it would stop it being encyclopaedic. I can prove that it existed by referencing old talker lists (some of which haven't been updated since 1999!), and there's 10 or 15 web pages that go on to talk a bit about it, but none in great depth. I don't see why you'd want to link them here though, because its not encyclopaedic. Do a google search for "Planes of Existence" and "talker" and you'll see them all. <a href="../../../2/0/3/User%7E203.122.225.241.html" title="User:203.122.225.241">203.122.225.241</a> 02:26, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have heard of PoE, although not Lintilla. I got to this article while trying to research a bit of history I remembered. I'd say that it's useful. Talkers aren't / weren't as well-known as MUDs, IRC, etc, but still have their place in "technosocial" history. Articles describing some of the most notable talkers, then, would be good things to have. If keeping isn't an option, then perhaps this (along with other notable talkers) should be merged into the Talkers article.

<dd><i>Comment</i>: I don't see why you would delete this, as it is an important part of describing the history of the internet. It helps to tie the link in development from when we had <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talkers.html" title="Talkers">talkers</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUDs</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> to when we ended up with <a href="../../../i/c/q/ICQ_3c2b.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messenger.html" title="Instant messenger">instant messenger</a> programs. Whilst it came about during a period where talkers as a whole were not particularly popular (and the short-lived web-based chats were), it was the most popular of these talkers at the time, and helped to provide that smooth follow through to the next stage, of instant messengers. After instant messengers, we then had online journals such as <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogspot.html" title="Blogspot">blogspot</a> which in turn led to the reintroduction of online forums, including <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a> itself. This page represents a missing link which ties it all together, and is an important, if not essential, part of wikipedia. In a sense, it helps to form the history of wikipedia itself. If it is deleted, then people would not be able to adequately understand the history of what led to us to where we are today in the internet. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 13:15, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Right now, I'm inclined to delete all of this for one reason: The articles lack any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. There are lots of accusations and lots of chat-politicking, but nothing that indicates where that information came from. This suggests <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> on the part of the article writer, which is not allowed. Remove the unverified bits and you're left with... that this was an adult chat site that people used.

<li><b>Update</b> - its not easy to scour the web for references to something that doesn't exist anymore, but I managed it, and included a lot of links, which reference its influence on popular culture (amongst other things). I am amazed that some people are still disputing that this has notoriety, but so be it. It certainly is not original research, and has been referenced many times. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 23:56, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> = I've also put in there a few other *independent* links that demonstrate that Planes of Existence influenced places outside of their general user demographic, and indeed outside of talkers generally.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I must apologise that the page now just looks like a bunch of links, and assertions of notoriety. I guess that i am just trying to make sure that this passes the Vfd. If you guys would kindly remove the tag, I'll add a bit more general substance to the article, to make it more encyclopaedic. It is just because certain people seem to be questioning its notoriety and/or that it is original research. Remove the tag and I will pad out the article more. IMO a Vfd tag should not be allowed to be put on newly created articles made in good faith, as they should be given at least a month to be written properly. I believe that this is the main problem here. Vfd tag put in far too quickly influenced vote. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 01:27, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

I know its a personal homepage, but it was linked off the official site and does reference evidence. Have still been unable to source the 1996-1999 version of the official site, under original owners. Will keep looking.

There were 10 talkers - Plane of Wisdom, Magic/Mysticism, Madness, Love, Lust/Extroversion, Animals, Women, Men, Peace/Dolphins and Darkness/Dungeon (they changed names over time). These are not spin offs. They were a part of the talker. As for the 10,000 users per day, well, it was in the system logs. And besides which, it was much more popular than Crystal Palace. As for your search, you should realise that planes of existence refers to astral travel. This makes it extremely difficult to search for links about it. Its also been ended for quite some time. I am trying to get links, but its not easy to get them all. If you like, I can remove the 10,000 users per day bit, and instead put in that it was the most popular talker on talker.com from 1996-1999 (Crystal Palace is also on talker.com and was then). <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 23:31, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It was also called a huge number of different names. "POE", as well as abbreviations for each of the 10 planes, including "POA", "POD", "POW", "POM", "POL" and others. People called it "plain" and often just called it "Madness" and left out the plane altogether, or PoE and so forth. Makes it ridiculously difficult to search for it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 23:34, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, just elaborating on the system logs bit. They produced automatic stats of user numbers and popularity. A lot of talkers do this. 10,000 was the average. It got as high as 18,000. Oh, but it wasn't 18,000 on at a time or anything. I think the most on at a time was about 300. That's just how many different users logged in at some time during the day. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 23:36, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Update</b>: I've done the history of talkers on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> as well as updating <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_chat.html" title="Online chat">online chat</a> to include this, and have also added pages for other important chat sites, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_Chat_%28talker%29_9250.html" title="Cat Chat (talker)">Cat Chat (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheesehouse_%28talker%29.html" title="Cheesehouse (talker)">Cheesehouse (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort_%28talker%29.html" title="Resort (talker)">Resort (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothills_%28talker%29.html" title="Foothills (talker)">Foothills (talker)</a>, and <a href="../../../e/w/-/Ew-too.html" title="Ew-too">ew-too</a> (the code base used on the early ones). I've also included less popular Crossroads (chat site) and Lighthouse (chat site). All of this is very stubby, but this is just so tiring to do all of this. I've also referenced a lot of official history of talkers in doing this, to put it all in to perspective. And I've referenced Alexa a fair bit. According to Alexa, right now <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleepy%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Sleepy's multiple worlds">Sleepy's multiple worlds</a> is the 3rd most popular web site that is under the category "talker" (behind Surfer's and Resort). I tried to get Alexa rankings for 1996 and such but was unable to. Of course, that doesn't make it the 3rd most popular talker necessarily, but its a good hint. Isn't in the top 100,000 web sites though, but that is not a surprise, since talkers are not web sites, and rarely have a web site component at all. Hence Alexa rankings are somewhat irrelevant. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 11:42, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Update</b>: I've been padding out some of the stubby articles and have discovered another notable talker, Ncohafmatu, although I question its assertion as the first major NUTS talker ahead of Crossroads (chat site). Nonetheless, I added a redlink and might fill it in later. I think that the dates suggest that it came after Crossroads, but it was probably the first NUTS talker that was created by Neil Robertson, who wrote NUTS, and hence is probably notable enough for inclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also gone to a few other places that referenced Planes of existence, including the article on <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilia</a> to add links to the planes of existence, with regards to 3 existing assertions made in the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>That talkers are the main way that zoophiles get together, but that they are rarely advertised publicly. That's not true, as Planes of existence, lintilla and sleepy's, all with zoophile ports, advertised this very publicly and were listed on most major talker listings.</li>
<li>That in the late 1990s and early 2000s most of the major zoophile talkers shut down. Plane of animals was the only major zoophile talker that shut down over this period of time, so I linked to it. It was also the most popular of the zoophile talkers that were about at the time.</li>
<li>I added the link to zoo code, which is an important part of the identity of being a zoophile, and made a link back to planes of existence because it was created by users on the planes of existence (as referenced in the code itself).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is of course a debatable issue. In some ways, doing so can be used to assert notoriety to this article, and hence why it cannot be deleted. However, some may view it as trying to influence the vote. So I thought to report it here, in case anyone disputes my validity in being able to do this. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 14:56, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just realised that when Neil Robertson made <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nuts_%28Talker%29_a8bd.html" title="Nuts (Talker)">Nuts (Talker)</a>, the most popular talker base in history, in 1992, it was done as a school project about the history of talkers. He was asked to write his own version of a talker, which was based on <a href="../../../u/n/a/UNaXcess_984a.html" title="UNaXcess">UNaXcess</a>, one of the early intranet talkers, and he didn't realise that <a href="../../../e/w/-/Ew-too.html" title="Ew-too">ew-too</a> already existed or that talkers were now on the internet. So, just imagine that in the future sometime someone else is asked to do a project on the history of talkers, to develop something else. If they don't have these kind of resources to investigate it, it might not happen. This whole area might not be overly popular, and might never have been all that popular, in comparison to <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroups.html" title="Newsgroups">newsgroups</a> which it competed with early on, and especially not in comparison to <a href="../../../i/c/q/ICQ_3c2b.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messenger.html" title="Instant messenger">instant messenger</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> and so forth that were about later (and now). However, it may still be used for a project by someone. Deleting something of historical significance may prevent future projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I added in one of the early controversies on <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a> about the stolen code. Its an important part of the history. As are the wars that the early talkers had with their universities, who refused to host them!

<p><small>I moved this from the talk page. It seems they went to the wrong spot</small> Don't delete or merge. It's ok as a standalone, although an introduction with a definition of some of the terms used later ("worlds", "talkers", etc.) would be fitting. I don't know where to find the criteria for deletion here, so if anyone can point me to a link, that'd be nice. Also the references to zoophilia are slightly excesive and not too relevant, maybe some editing is in order, but not a flat out deletion. Now I know what PoE was, and finding out random stuff is kinda the point of an encyclopedia, no? PoE is deffinetly a historical reference to the beggining of talkers, and the internet culture in general. Why delete our own recent history?

<dd>Comment: Great suggestions! I have fixed up the article with relation to the tips. I just have the small link to zoo code listed in influence (its been established by its apparent creator that it wasn't that big a deal), and got rid of the fan sites (the fact that it had a lot of users and was popular isn't really the point here, and determining its popularity is irrelevant with regards to its relevance). I've also put in a basic history, focussing primarily on the events in late 1998/early 1999, as well as the incident that was the death of talkers. Perhaps I should link to NUTS 3 code to point out the holes in the code that allowed this kind of thing to happen? Might be a bit difficult to extract though. Also I found out apparently it started in October 1996, not July 1996, so I fixed that. Seems it was about for a lot shorter than it seemed to be.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the way, I just thought that I'd point out something here. I saw on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> page that there was a reference to a BBC article as apparent proof of validity, yet when I investigated the article it turns out that it is a BBC-approved <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicity.html" title="Wikicity">wikicity</a>! I got this hint when I looked at <a href="http://www.snowplains.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.snowplains.org/" rel="nofollow">Snowplains' page</a>, when I was trying to decide whether Snowplains warrants a mention (IMO it doesn't - its historically irrelevant, and only has 11 users on right now so isn't popular enough to warrant notoriety). Indeed, Snowplains asserted that the article was primarily an advertisement for their service. So much for reliable sources!</p>
<p>As for the ew-too page, that's written by the guy who runs foothills. Granted that we can establish that he is of historical importance, but he is clearly biased in favour of ew-too talkers, and indeed their charts don't even recognise the existence of non ew-too talkers. Neil Robertson protested at that in 1998 and joined with them, but Neil Robertson is biased. He does not mention a single adult-orientated talker, and only mentions the ones that he likes. Some of the talkers he listed in his history are so far from being notable as to be a joke. I mean <i>Crypt</i>? Come on now. Who has heard of that? Nobody uses their code base, and nobody ever went to their talker. It just so happens that Neil liked the talker.</p>
<p>So the thing is that this is a very subjective account, for 2 primary reasons: 1) they historically didn't have web pages and hence most of the evidence of everything was stored within the talker itself, and 2) all of the talk about everything is done from a promotional point of view. The whole thing where a lot of people insist that talkers "only just started" in 1996 while they were statistically the most popular from 1992-1994 suggests bias. The fact that there were more talkers in the 1997-1998 period suggests to some that that was the height of their popularity, but the release of ICQ in 1996 means that in reality it wasn't.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have suggested for a AFD to be placed on Mamnuts. I am not sure about <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnuts.html" title="Amnuts">Amnuts</a> however. I guess if its list where it says that over 100 talkers use the code is true, then it is notable enough for me. But Mamnuts, which only started 6 days ago and has no talkers using it, is hardly notable. Sounds like a good code base though, if you were going to start your own talker. But its basically advertising.</p>
<p>At least nobody could suggest that this is advertising for anything. lol. The place closed down years ago. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 23:59, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicity.html" title="Wikicity">wikicity</a> called zoowiki has a page for Zoo Code already <a href="http://zoowiki.zetapin.de/index.php?title=Zoocode" class="external autonumber" title="http://zoowiki.zetapin.de/index.php?title=Zoocode" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, but am not sure whether it is sufficiently notable to warrant a page on Wikipedia. Whilst it is popularly used within the <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophile.html" title="Zoophile">zoophile</a> community, it is no more common than <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek_Code_ee15.html" title="Geek Code">Geek Code</a> is within the <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">Geek</a> community, and the community itself is much smaller. Secondly, zoowiki already has a page on it, which seems to be sufficient. I felt that it was sufficiently notable to have its own heading within the zoophile article, however. Do you agree that this is the correct amount of notoriety for such a thing? I am also concerned about adding such things until this Vfd passes, because zoo code references planes of existence directly, and was written on planes of existence by 2 planes of existence users (wizards actually) when it was at the height of its popularity. Henceforth its notoriety is dependent on the notoriety of this article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 15:21, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will obviously protest the decision, as I think that standard wikipedia policy was not used when deciding on the deletion process, and this is a valid encyclopaedic article that is important from a historical perspective. However, if Wikipedia decides that it should be deleted, presumably owing to the fact that it closed 2 1/2 years ago (I can't see any other valid reason why it should be deleted), then I think that the information contained should instead be added to other articles as a merge. Whether it is essential for it to have its own page is one issue - there should be no issue about it needing to be included in the encyclopaedia. Its notability is well established. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 15:21, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comment: I think that that is plausible to merge it all. However, then the problem exists as to which of the talkers to keep in their own right and which to merge, and how to merge them. Also, with the <a href="../../../m/u/s/MUSH_a560.html" title="MUSH">MUSH</a> pages, they decided to keep a few of them, such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_MUSH_684c.html" title="Star Wars MUSH">Star Wars MUSH</a> separate. Anyway, here is a list of the notable talkers (in my opinion) and why they are notable (1 line summary):</dd>

<li>Lighthouse (chat site) - first ever adult (18+) talker. Was not popular though. I don't know a lot about it so its a stub.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/n/Lintilla_%28chat_site%29.html" title="Lintilla (chat site)">Lintilla (chat site)</a> - second ever adult talker, and historically influential on the whole adult community, as it led to <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleepy%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Sleepy's multiple worlds">Sleepy's multiple worlds</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Fantasia's multiple worlds">Fantasia's multiple worlds</a> and Planes of existence (chat site), shares with Fantasia, Planes and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> bragging rights as the most popular adult talker in history.

<li><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Fantasia's multiple worlds">Fantasia's multiple worlds</a> - important historically, primarily with regards to it being hacked by <i>Virus</i> who went on to start <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> as a 17 year old, and also is seen as the catalyst for the death of talkers, because of his actions on CP in 1998 and POE in 2000. Also holds the record for the most number of "worlds" - 30, which represented perhaps just why talkers died - because there were too many talkers and not enough people to spread between them.</li>
<li>Planes of existence (chat site) (this one) - first multiple worlds talker that was not entirely adult-orientated, first to use NUTS 3 linking code, first talker of any kind to mix all ages and adult areas, first talker to mix general with human rights elements (although Crossroads (chat site) sort of did that too). Was probably the most popular <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophile.html" title="Zoophile">zoophile</a> talker, one of the most popular <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a> talkers, and as far as I know the only talker that had public <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybersex.html" title="Cybersex">cybersex</a> scenes - and hence the Lust talker was the most popular of its type (and probably the most popular adult talker ever). The 2000 incident on the talker, with the spying, was the most notable, because that caused the death of talkers. A lot of other smaller incidents were also notable.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a> - possibly notable in terms of its popularity - competed as the most popular <a href="../../../b/d/s/BDSM_7cde.html" title="BDSM">BDSM</a> talker. Probably notable as the most well-designed talker in history, with the most unique code ever. But most notable because of the spying incident in 1998, which eventually caused the death of talkers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of others that were more popular than some of the ones listed there, but I was only listing the first of something and most popular of something. There are ones such as Snowplains which is probably the 4th most popular talker in history, or maybe 5th or 6th, and the first big ew-too talker that was created after 1996, and the only one that broke free of the stranglehold that NUTS had on the market. Or of course we can talk about the various talkers that influenced different code bases. But in my mind those things don't warrant their own pages.</p>
<p>Indeed, I don't think that <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnuts.html" title="Amnuts">Amnuts</a> or Mamnuts warrant their own pages either. They are just code bases after all, and every talker ever created had its own unique code base (well, perhaps not quite every one, but every one with a competent developer). Fantasia's, Sleepy's and lintilla all were identical, so that's perhaps one exception. But if we went around including every code base, we'd have 1000 articles, which I think is excessive. There were really only 2 main code bases used - ew-too and Nuts. That's all we need articles on.</p>
<p>But if someone wishes to merge some of these, then that's fine. But that's my rationale for them all. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 19:58, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. While many future game titles may have enough confirmed information to warrant a page a little bit ahead of schedule, Silent Hill 5 simply does not.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I, personally, believe that the article should remain open, but that the 'Speculation' portion of the article can be deleted. The introduction does include a reference to its annoucement from Eurogamer about either being on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. I have also heard various other mentions from Akira, the composer/producer of <i>The Room</i>, but I've yet to find such topics/website pages so that I could refer to them. The crystal-ballery portions can be deleted, but what has been mentioned in the Eurogamer article should stay and that the page should remain open. If anyone wants me to, I'll try to revise this article. --Godzilla 09:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a slang dictionary, and this article is not a slang dictionary article, either. A slang dictionary would tell us the etymology, history, usage, meaning, pronunciation, synonyms, and translations of a phrase. This article, however, tells us <i>about pity sex</i>, including people's motivations for having it and its potential repercussions. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article, while not fabulous, is clearly about the <i>phenomenon</i> rather than the <i>word</i>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Seems like overkill to me, like explaining the roundness of a basketball. I would like to mention I think there should be limits to what concepts deserve articles. That line is probably only going to lie in human judgement and with no hard rules. Is pity sex something people will try to look up? The term seems self-explanitory. Still, seems to be just over the line of having some quality. I would definitely like to see more refs added. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:50, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm definitely ameniable to making a Wikibook out of portions of the current article. I don't want to see the article removed entirely or 'offending links' consistently blanked (usually two or three times a week). When I link to the book from the article, I would like to have those links remain, even though self identified employees of the company that makes the game seem to be vehemently opposed to them. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan888_e9d9.html" title="User:Jonathan888">Jonathan888</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathan888_ae66.html" title="User talk:Jonathan888">(talk)</a> 20:58, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Could you suggest how this article is specific to Runescape other than the unencyclopedic how-to advice?

<ul>
<li>Well, since you ask; it is a major area of interest for the RuneScape community. Whether a specific player participates in cheating or not, it affects play for all. Having an information page about it is very encyclopedic. As I just said, I'm quite willing to move the 'guide' parts to a wikibook, but Wikipedia deserves an entry... just look at the history of the topic, it has more entries in a day than an article like <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathode.html" title="Cathode">Cathode</a> does in a month. The bots used for the game are game specific, the scams used are game specific: based on the mechanisms of the game not MMPOG in general as has been purported by some. The history of how JAGeX has countered this trend is VERY specific to this game. What more do you want?<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan888_e9d9.html" title="User:Jonathan888">Jonathan888</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathan888_ae66.html" title="User talk:Jonathan888">(talk)</a> 23:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clickbots and attacks on the communications protocols aren't specific to RuneScape, nor is any single one of these scams (all of which have reared their head in DikuMUDs, EQ, Diablo, WoW, and scores of lesser-known games). I think there's probably a couple of paragraphs on how Jagex has dealt with these specific problems endemic to online games could fit into the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> article, but most of the content of this article is a description of cheating methods common to all games. I hate arguing by analogy, but this article smacks of having shuffling in poker, shuffling in bridge, shuffling in rummy, etc. The cheats are the same, even when the game is different. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:25, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>OK, here's a list of very game specific cheats:</li>
<li>Casting weaken on tree stump</li>
<li>Scar is RuneScape specific</li>
<li>Random events is very RuneScape specific - other games have yet to implement this workaround (google it if you don't trust me on this one)</li>
<li>Armour trimming - explicitly game specific</li>
<li>Alt-F4 scam (google it: it comes up with 3 runescape hits on the first page, and NO other games)</li>
<li>there are more but that's a quick list. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan888_e9d9.html" title="User:Jonathan888">Jonathan888</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonathan888_ae66.html" title="User talk:Jonathan888">(talk)</a> 01:00, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These cheats are only for Runescape, but they represent more generic methods of cheating with applies to many MMORPGs. Scar, for example, is a macro program. While Scar itself will only work on RuneScape, Macros themselves are a method for cheating in any number of MMORPGs.</li>
<li>Also, please do not accuse editors here of not reading the article. This is akin to saying the votes are bad-faith.

<li>Apologies for my rash bad faith comment - I'll remove it from the sentence and put it here: I said it seemed the article was not being read and that's not a good thing for me to say about another editor. *sorry*</li>
<li>The alt-F4 scam isn't RuneScape specific; I've seen the same scam done in both Diablo (although most players aren't so dumb as to fall for it) and a similar control-C scam done in various DikuMUDs. Heck, it's just a variation on the old "Hey, alt-F4 does (various unbelievable thing)!" online chat gag. Likewise for the armor trimming con; it's a variation on the "give me that item and I'll dupe it for you" con. That leaves us with the name of a cheat program and the random events system (the latter better suited to the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> article anyway). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm sort of wishing I never created this page. When I originally created it, it was simply a history of RuneScape cheating. It was carefully researched and was purely factual with no opinions or discussion of if cheating was right or wrong. It avoided controversy by simply only detailing cheat info after it had been fixed, it wasn't meant to be an article on HOW to cheat, but a more academic article on the sorts of problems MMOGs face and how they solve them, with RuneScape as a case study. Unfortunately a lot of that over the months was gradually erroded, and now it seems to suffer repeat hijacks by malicious people who just see it as a handy place to advertise and try to scam players, which was not the intent! Even worse they seem to have managed to convince some people to support them in this by veiling their advertising as facts when clearly they really just want to promote their own site. Personally I'm not sure allowing Wikipedia to become a site which everyone just sees as a handy source of free advertising, or place to scam gulliable users is a good idea! I've sort of lost faith in wikipedia after seeing hours of work inevitable get destroyed through a million tiny edits which seem to add up to turn it into innacurate nonsense. I can't be bothered anymore, especially when people trying to undo the damage get accused of vandalism! So yes - delete it. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunefire_8dd8.html" title="User:Runefire">Runefire</a> 20:37, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't mind if an exact tutorial hand-holding readers in a walkthrough of how to cheat is removed, but I would object to removing any details chronicling the pervasiveness and efficacy of cheats, the tactics or programs' names, the ease of use of the cheat, and other material that will help assess the weakness in the game's security, including specifics of whether the cheat employs macroing or packet-level modifications and whether the current servers are still vulnerable to the cheat. Especially considering the growing interest, albeit still very fledgling, financial firms have in placing GDP calculations on virtual worlds, as much information about cheating needs to be made available to help assess destability in the virtual markets. I'm looking at Runescape from an economist's lens and would like to evaluate the severity of the problem of cheating just as much as I would in the problem of counterfeiting trusted currencies in the real world. I think the established policies of what's permissible in Wiki articles about counterfeiting real currencies can be applied to this article. Analysis of online gaming is a serious topic: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3570224.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3570224.stm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> Any information Wiki can provide in aiding analysis of Runescape should be kept. Other information such as the Alt-F4 or Ctl-W scams are just good to have mentioned to help identify the demerits of browser-based games like Runescape. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoreaulylazy_ee9c.html" title="User:Thoreaulylazy">Thoreaulylazy</a> 03:10, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Eddie, if you have some kind of reference, just post it already. Stop yacking about it and do it. Most of us would change our votes if you would verify and source it. As it is, you're running out of time. Either put up some sources, or let it go. Bringing all these puppets in to back you up is only hurting your cause. Also, pronouns like "you" and "me" are not capitalised unless they start a sentence. Stop editing other people's writing to make them capped when they shouldn't be.

<li>No Eddie, you don't need to scan the page. You need to give us a standard bibliographical reference, preferably with page numbers. No scanning required, and you can't host such a scan on Wikipedia anyway.

<li>No, I have not heard of the word "exicornt" before because it is obviously very localised and perhaps only spoken by you and your closest compatriots given that other people here, including (verifiably) other Wikipedians, especially transport-interested ones, are siding with the delete camp. We would be willing to include the page if you could verify it, which is why we need the bibliographical references for this book you claim it's in. If you can provide these references and these references can be verified, I would be more than happy to change my vote to "Keep". However, I'm sure I can speak for many fellow people on this thread that I find it suspicious you are not giving an explicit bibliographical reference, which is far easier than a scan (which turns out to be against the rules anyway). As it turns out, the term doesn't appear in the cited website. I suspect you might be clutching at straws to keep this article here.

Since only a few people (and <i>not</i> My friends or My family but people that know subway terminology. I felt it was necessary to create this page so the reader knows exactly what I am talking about when I use the word. I didn't create this page in bad faith, or to drive people crazy and have people talk about whether or not we should keep the page or delete it. Consider this, a few years ago, hardly anyone knew what a "blog" was. Today people say "blog" instead of "journal" because someone came along and defined the word.

However, for Eddie's own personal security, I would like it if someone could discourage him from posting the name of his workplace on his user page.

<p><b>Comment</b>. Just to put an end to Eddie's "Exicornt" quest and his claim that the cited book on New York subways refers to exicornts, I have received an email from Pete Dougherty, the author of the book, which states in part: " I can tell you without hesitation that until your e-mail, I'd never heard "exicornt" ever used in any context and I doubt that it is even a word." He then goes on to say that the only possible use he can think of for the word would be as a location indicator, where exicornt is the name of a road, or other location. He then emphasises again that he had never even heard of the word until he received my email. Sarah Ewart 23:05, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I deleted it because it's pretty obvious vanity, in my opinion. If that's not OK, perhaps <b>userfying</b> would be appropriate? I'm not sure why it should come here, but then again I was perfectly content to leave it deleted with <a href="../../../x/d/_/WP%7EXD_0c2d.html" title="WP:XD">XD2</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 22:58, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You didn't delete it, and XD2 is just blanking, not deleting. That's the trouble. I can speedy it if you like since I don't actually believe a word it says, although I didn't Google it yet.-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:00, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I suppose I should have been more clear. I "deleted" it (via XD2) because it was vanity. Since it did try to claim notability and there was potential for disagreement, I thought XD2 was a good solution. More transparent than a speedy, easier and less broken than Afd. I don't see that it does any harm, sitting there XD2'd and not linked, but some folks consider that "messy". I've no objection to hard-deleting it. The user who created it (User:Odom) was logged in, but that was the only activity on that account. As for the content, it's even possible that some of what's here is true, but it's fluffed up to make it sound more important than it really is. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:06, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
