It is set around the life of Bob Slay, a marketing executive for a leading tolietries, Bob has a swish office, a bikini-on-a-stick supermodel girlfriend and is well regarded by his manager. All of which is massively surprising, as he is the most obnoxious, lazy, amoral phoney to ever put his highly-polished shoes to rest on the office table!</p>
<p>The television show was written by Mark Grant (who would later go on to write Star) and Mark Chapman who was a co-writer for the second series and provided additional material for the first series. Mark Chapman also directed the first series and produced both series a with Nick Wood directing the second. The shows other producer was Lucy Robinson (who produced the first Dennis Pennis installment and played the mayoress in The Thin Blue Line) and had executive producers Danielle Lux (All About Me) and Charles Brand (The Comic Strip Presents...).</p>

<p>Paul Kaye said in an interview regarding the series- "I've never really worked in an office but it was the way I imagined you'd keep sane - I mean an office is sort of like an extended playground, isn't it? So the guy does absolutely no work and the only way he can relieve the tedium is by behaving despicably and I think the whole office would actually be sad if he left because it would suddenly be all very mundane. I mean I'm sure that's the case in a lot of real offices - it's like on reality-TV shows, everyone quite likes the bad guy in the Big Brother house, really."</p>
<p>Tasche de Vasconcelos who plays Lauren in the first series said- "It's a great show, I'm just so proud to have been able to do it. It's brilliantly written". She later went on to describe Paul as "a wonderful actor and co-partner he was so professional".</p>
<p>This is a review of the first episode of series one- "The stylish opening to this new office-centered, six-part situation comedy introduces Bob Slay, the ultimate marketing man. Paul Kaye (well known as spoof interviewer Dennis Pennis), stars as a slick and selfish operator with a saccharine tongue who occasionally justifies his behaviour in asides to the camera. His only real area of vulnerability is his parentage - he was abandoned as a baby. That makes him particularly nervous when he has to meet his gorgeous girlfriend Lauren's parents for the first time. The plotting is quite convoluted in this distinctly adults-only opener, but it has its moments. The best of them involve the marketing director, played by Michael Cochrane as a sex-mad monster who steals all the best lines. Even he confesses to being a little over-eager with Lauren's mother, played by Jan Harvey."</p>

<p>Series Two didn’t have to many differences to the first series but the small changes it did have caused certain criticisms by reports of the show. One of the changes criticised was that the Marketing Directors character had become much more of a central character and with this came many more sexual innuendos and references, to which some people believed was simply too rude for the style of the show. Another criticism was made due to Paul Kaye’s new haircut, which was long, black and in many episodes rather scruffy, this gave the feel that Bob Slay wasn’t as organised as he was in the first series and that he wasn’t to sensitive to what people thought of his image which couldn’t be more opposite to his true ambitions.</p>

<p>Perfect World Series One was released on VHS in 2000, it lasted approximately 174 minutes and was rated 18, presumably for the Marketing Directors sexual implications and Bob Slays use of the F word in Love. The video has been discontinued and there is no plans for releasing Series One or Two to be released on DVD.</p>

<p><b>No Junk Mail</b> is an Australian rock band from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The band currently consists of Andrew Le (lead vocals/backup guitar), David Stackpole (lead guitarist/backup vocals), Hasan (drums), and is currently looking for a full-time bass player. The band was formed by Andrew Le and David Stackpole in 2005.</p>
<p>The members of No Junk Mail listen to a wide variety of music, varying from easy listening bands such as <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashboard_Confessional_df52.html" title="Dashboard Confessional">Dashboard Confessional</a> all the way to heavier bands such as <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorne_Heights_3fde.html" title="Hawthorne Heights">Hawthorne Heights</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_of_the_Year_f215.html" title="Story of the Year">Story of the Year</a>. Because of this wide variety of music taste among the band members, the band is able to play songs of many genres, though the band mostly writes songs of a punk/pop/emo genre. No Junk Mail is currently writing songs for their debut EP, but in the mean time are performing covers of more popular songs to prove their tallents to the youth while their own material is being written. The band will be competeing at The Battle Of The Bands held at Glen Waverley Secondary College on the 8th of September 2006. The band will be playing covers of "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" by <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Chemical_Romance_545a.html" title="My Chemical Romance">My Chemical Romance</a>, "Johnny B Goode" by <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>, and "Who's Gonna Save Us" by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Living_End_a2dc.html" title="The Living End">The Living End</a>. The band's debut album is rumoured to be titled "Glen Waverley: The New Asia" in referance to the suburb the band members attend school, as it is becoming increasingly over-populated by Asians. The title of the EP is ironic because of the fact that one of the band members (Andrew Le) is infact Asian himself.</p>

A 'repentista', in Brazilian popular music, is a singer, composer, or mere poet, who improvises 'de repente' (id, all of a sudden, in Portuguese), so the word refers to Northeastern Brazilian performers of 'repentes', songs with improvised verses.</p>

Well, the first thing that you should know about John Pilla is that he is probably the coolest person you will ever know! Yeah I'm not even kidding. He's pretty short for someone his age, but yet still a funny and outgoing kid. He has many different styles; wearing his hat like a gangsta, (lol) or wearing skater shirts and having skater hair. Everyone should look up to John because he is just so sick. So if you ever get a chance to meet John and actually talk to him you will realize that he is so funny and you're lucky to even know him and speak to him!!</p>

<p>Mission Halo is a text RPG Based on the Halo videogame franchise. It was originally created by Tucker49 on a forum hosting service called "Proboards". Players would sign up on the site and then join an army. Either the UNSC or the Covenant. (in most cases) They would then train using the weapons and vehicles from the Halo universe. Once they were done with training, they would go into battles and fight alongside fellow soldiers. The RPG did well for a while, but then it seemed to lose activity, so the creator, Tucker49, shut it down and closed it. Mission Halo didn't make anymore apearances on the web for a good while after that. But then a new remake of the site was made by Connor Lows using a forum hosting service called Jconserv. It is currently in construction and should be opened shortly.</p>

Hilliard was employed by the well known magician, Howard Thurston. In his spare time, he wrote "Greater Magic", which includes his own essays on magic, and descriptions of hundreds of tricks he saw performed by the great professional magicians of his day.</p>
<p>Greater Magic is considered by most magicians - both professional and amateur - as the "bible" of magic. John Hilliard's work is enough to keep even the most avid magician busy for a lifetime.</p>

<p>In the year 1946, Mahatma Gandhi established the Nisargopachar Nature Cure Centre in Urulikanchan, a small village near Pune. He entrusted the responsibility of managing this centre and initiating development activities in surrounding villages, upon his trusted disciple Manibhai Desai. During his long association with the rural people, Manibhai-ji studied their problems and designed suitable programmes to tackle the complex problems of unemployment, under employment, community health, and other social evils. The rich experiences and confidence gained motivated Manibhai-ji to expand the rural development programme beyond Urulikanchan. Consequently, the BAIF group of organisations was born, which presently function in nine states in India. The Karnataka unit, BAIF Institute for Rural Development –Karnataka (BIRD-K) was started in 1980. Presently BIRD-K is functioning in 20 districts of Karnataka and 7 districts of Andhrapradesh. === Sources ===</p>

<p>Clarence Callahan is a character in the game Need for Speed Most Wanted.Because Clarence Callahan has a sizeable reputation in Rockport(the city on which the game is based on)he is nicknamed 'Razor'. Razor is the main antagonist in the game and thus, at the begining of the player's carrer he sabotages and wins the player's car. Razor then uses the player's car to get the top position in what is called the'Blacklist'.Later in the game the player races him and reclaims his ride.</p>
<p>Razor is most probably in his twenties.He mainly wears vests that show his muscular build and his tatooed arms.Also,he wears jeans and boots most of the time.</p>

Fumball is a playground past time. It is played with a tennis ball and a wall. School children throw the ball against the wall, and others have to catch it before it bounces on the ground. If they do, the person who throws it has to run and touch the wall before the catcher hits him with the tennis ball.</p>

<p>Prince Kael &amp; his Blood Elves finally arrive in Dalaran after helping the Night Elves defeat Illidan. Grand Marshal Garithos leads the remaining Alliance forces in Dalaran and it is clear that he doesn't like Elves, or any other non-humans. An undead force is once again mustering to retake Dalaran. Garithos' forces prepare to move out. He commands Kael to stay behind to repair some observatories so the region can be monitored. The Elf prince obeys, though he considers this task unworthy of him and his warriors.</p>
<p>Along his journey, the Naga,led by Vashj, offer Kael help by giving him and his men boats with which they can cross the river.</p>
<p>After the observatories are repaired, Garithos returns with knowledge of Kael's acceptance of help from the Naga. He reprimands the Prince and returns to the front.</p>

<p>The next day, an emissary from Garithos arrives with news that a second Undead force is gathering to retake Dalaran. Kael's men are to defeat this force ASAP. Unfortunately, all foot soldiers, cavalry &amp; support teams are to report to the front leaving the Blood Elves without any reinforcements. Without reinforcements, all the bases surrounding the main Elven island base were captured by the Undead. The Naga then arrive to give aid to the Blood Elves.</p>
<p>After the Undead are beaten, Kael explains that his people are starving from lack of magic. With the Sunwell corrupted by the Undead, the Blood Elves can't feed from its magic energies. Vashj explains that magic can be obtained by slaying demons. Garithos then returns to find the Blood Elves with the Naga. Vashj escapes but Kael and his men are captured for "treason". Kael and his men are hauled off to the Dungeons of Dalaran.</p>

<p>The Malaysian mafia emerged during the early 20th century. The first organized crime groups were the Hai San and the Gee hin.These groups often called the "kongsi gelap" ( the dark force), were established in Malaya(was known as Malaysia now) by Chinese immigrants that were sent down for the construction of buildings.The immigrants established these secret organizations so that they could make extra money by controling the import of drugs.The Malayans enjoyed smoking these drugs and often purchased them from the dealers.During the Japanese occupation,these groups were closed down by the Japanese because they taught that the Malayans would buy the drugs which would affect the Japanese trade. During the 1960's,there were racial wars between the Malays,Chinese and Indians.Each race made their own organization to protect themselves against other races.This was the dawning of the Malaysian(after 1957,Malaya became Malaysia)gangsters.In the 60's ,emerged a notorious gangster,Botak Chin(the bald/shaved Chin).Who committed a series of crimes including extortion from tailors,barbers and restaurants,murder and robberies.In 1974,Botak Chin was shot dead in his home after a police shoot out. After the death of Botak Chin,his gang,'Gang Number 8' still committed crimes,but none compared to the notorious crimes of Botak Chin.There were no more notorious gangsters for another 20 years.In the 90's came Bentong Kallimuthu,who was worse then Botak Chin.The name Bentong is actually a place in Malaysia.Its the place where Kallimuthu lived.Thus,they called him Bentong Kalli.He was also known as the Robbin Hood of Malaysia because he robbed banks and gave the money to the poor.He too was wanted by the police for extortion and murder.Kalli was shot dead by police while hiding in a jungle.After these two crimnals,there were no more like them. Now in Malaysia,schools are wrapped by local and foreign gangsters.Due to confidental reasons,the gangs will not be named.These gangsters run brothels,loan sharking and drug trafficking.A new business has come along too.Its the illegal copying of CD's and DVD's.The Malaysian police is now launching a crack down on all the mafia bosses and gang memebers.</p>

The original contents of a three piece suit are a jacket, vest, and tie. Although many commonly mistake dress pants as one of the three parts, it has historically not been so. The pants are the assumed fourth part of the suit. It is the tie that makes the distinction of a three piece.</p>

<p>The challenges of finding the right type of leadership that would grapple with the complexities of rapidly changing socio-economic and political environment is of paramount interest in out present Nigeria. The Jigawa State governor, Dr. Ibrahim Saminu Turaki is now integrating oil and gas with agriculture. In this highly fertile state of West African country Jigawa Nigerian, agriculture and industry are teaming up for an ambitious undertaking in economic development.</p>
<p>The ethanol project is the brain child of Jigawa state governor, Dr. Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, it’s goal is to provide one million jobs and sustain economy to eradicate poverty in the agrarian state.</p>
<p>The plan call for planting and harvesting of sugar cane in an area of 750,000 acres, the cane is then converted to ethanol, anon toxic, efficient and environmental friendly over alternative. This empower rural farmers by generating greater earning. When fully adopted it will generate one hundred and fifty million dollars ($150) annually. This would create rural wealth, sustain development and energy self sufficiency.</p>
<p>The new project will radically change the agricultural sector in Jigawa and Nigeria at large which is currently dedicated only to food production and will create thousands of new jobs as Africa gears for what is probably one of its first biofuel and certainly one of the many desperately needed agrarian revolution.</p>

<p>Perfect World is a television show that ran from February 25th 2000 to 25th June 2001. It is set around the life of Bob Slay, a marketing executive for a leading tolietries, Bob has a swish office, a bikini-on-a-stick supermodel girlfriend and is well regarded by his manager. All of which is massively surprising, as he is the most obnoxious, lazy, amoral phoney to ever put his highly-polished shoes to rest on the office table!</p>
<p>The television show was written by Mark Grant (who would later go on to write Star) and Mark Chapman who was a co-writer for the second series and provided additional material for the first series. Mark Chapman also directed the first series and produced both series a with Nick Wood directing the second. The shows other producer was Lucy Robinson (who produced the first Dennis Pennis installment and played the mayoress in The Thin Blue Line) and had executive producers Danielle Lux (All About Me) and Charles Brand (The Comic Strip Presents...).</p>

<p>Paul Kaye said in an interview regarding the series- "I've never really worked in an office but it was the way I imagined you'd keep sane - I mean an office is sort of like an extended playground, isn't it? So the guy does absolutely no work and the only way he can relieve the tedium is by behaving despicably and I think the whole office would actually be sad if he left because it would suddenly be all very mundane. I mean I'm sure that's the case in a lot of real offices - it's like on reality-TV shows, everyone quite likes the bad guy in the Big Brother house, really."</p>
<p>Tasche de Vasconcelos who plays Lauren in the first series said- "It's a great show, I'm just so proud to have been able to do it. It's brilliantly written". She later went on to describe Paul as "a wonderful actor and co-partner he was so professional".</p>
<p>This is a review of the first episode of series one- "The stylish opening to this new office-centered, six-part situation comedy introduces Bob Slay, the ultimate marketing man. Paul Kaye (well known as spoof interviewer Dennis Pennis), stars as a slick and selfish operator with a saccharine tongue who occasionally justifies his behaviour in asides to the camera. His only real area of vulnerability is his parentage - he was abandoned as a baby. That makes him particularly nervous when he has to meet his gorgeous girlfriend Lauren's parents for the first time. The plotting is quite convoluted in this distinctly adults-only opener, but it has its moments. The best of them involve the marketing director, played by Michael Cochrane as a sex-mad monster who steals all the best lines. Even he confesses to being a little over-eager with Lauren's mother, played by Jan Harvey."</p>

<p>Series Two didn’t have to many differences to the first series but the small changes it did have caused certain criticisms by reports of the show. One of the changes criticised was that the Marketing Directors character had become much more of a central character and with this came many more sexual innuendos and references, to which some people believed was simply too rude for the style of the show. Another criticism was made due to Paul Kaye’s new haircut, which was long, black and in many episodes rather scruffy, this gave the feel that Bob Slay wasn’t as organised as he was in the first series and that he wasn’t to sensitive to what people thought of his image which couldn’t be more opposite to his true ambitions.</p>

<p>Perfect World Series One was released on VHS in 2000, it lasted approximately 174 minutes and was rated 18, presumably for the Marketing Directors sexual implications and Bob Slays use of the F word in Love. The video has been discontinued and there is no plans for releasing Series One or Two to be released on DVD.</p>

<p>Dollhouse is a high energy garage band from Enköping, Sweden. Their main influences in the beginning were <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stooges_fd03.html" title="The Stooges">The Stooges</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/5/MC5_4686.html" title="MC5">MC5</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cheer_e6fe.html" title="Blue Cheer">Blue Cheer</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>. They started out as a three piece act in 2001 when they also recorded their debut 7" vinyl single titled "I'm a man on the move" (released by Puresome Productions). Their sound has since evolved into a more rock'n'soul kind of sound, which means they have integrated rock'n'roll music with traditional soul and blues in their sound. They have also added a second guitar to their sound. The band's debut album "The Rock And Soul Circus" was produced by <a href="../../../m/c/5/MC5_4686.html" title="MC5">MC5</a> bassplayer Michael Davis in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, USA. After extensive touring in Europe the band caught the eye of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hellacopters_40c2.html" title="The Hellacopters">The Hellacopters</a>' <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicke_Andersson_58d7.html" title="Nicke Andersson">Nicke Andersson</a>, who produced the recording of the "The Royal Rendezvous" album.</p>

<p>"Benjamin Ezra" Deckard is a songwriter from Indiana. He was born in Lewisville, Texas on Feb 23, 1981. He is the middle of 5 children. His performances are mostly stripped down to harmonica, acoustic guitar, violin and drums. The core of his band is Valerie Carr (violin), Bethany Jones (Violin) and usually Mike Reeb (www.mikereeb.com) on drums and backing vocals. His album "Our Old Selves Forgotten" was recorded with Paul Kim in the summer of 2005 before his European tour. He was coined "The Sears Tower of Folk" by Chicago musicians because he plays Chicago a lot and he is 6'6".</p>

The result was <b>Maze de Boer</b> is an artist who lives and works in <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, The Netherlands. In his work he shows a fascination for illusion. The spectator becomes aware of ‘the bounds’ of reality and always appears to be the object of his three-dimensional work. The participant takes part in his ‘performance’ by simply being present and by experiencing the environment. de Boer starts from a staged view on reality and seeks the boundaries between theatre and visual art.</p>
<p>His films and video work have been screened at various festivals. Just like his three-dimensional work, his films show a both realist as well as absurdist view on the environment. As a director, musician and designer Maze de Boer is working with other film makers, musicians and theatre directors.</p>

<p>No real evidence exists proving prine Madocs story was real but Prince madocs story first appeared in writting in 1582 A.d. (this was about 500 years after his voyage)in a bbook by Richard Hakluyt a sixteenth centry english geographer. Prince madoc's story has also been located in the abbey of Strata Florida in South wales. in 1805 the poet Robert Southey wrote an epic poem based on oral history. some say archeologists dug up his family crest more than 900 years later. This is the evidence of Prince Madoc of wales.</p>
