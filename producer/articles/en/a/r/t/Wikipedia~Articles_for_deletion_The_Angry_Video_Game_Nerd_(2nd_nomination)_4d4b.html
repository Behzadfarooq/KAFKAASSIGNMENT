<p>Why does this guy keep getting deleted? Ive been a huge fan of his stuff for almost a year. Theres biographies for webcomic creators that are nowhere near as popular as the nerd, every time he puts up a video it gets a few hundred thousand hits, stuff like his article getting deleted is why people rightly stereotype wikipedia editors as pedantic jackasses</p>
<p><br />
At the very least this guy is more than just an internet meme, or viral video. He's on a couple of fairly established videogame websites. The article needs some work, but I'd lean towards keeping it. BoosterBronze 18:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep! This article has again been considered for deletion without any adequately explained reason. The AVGN is all over the internet. He is a great star that lots of people know about. There are many articles on wikipedia with a far smaller audience so I really don't see the problem with having a AVGN article. He has millions of views on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a>, <a href="http://www.screwattack.com" class="external free" title="http://www.screwattack.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.screwattack.com</a> and more recently <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com" class="external free" title="http://www.gametrailers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com</a> Ask on any public forum and you'll find plenty of fans begging for a wikipedia-article. Also the Nerd has appeared on TV a few times, is being discussed in plenty of online communities Again. I really don't see the problem with having an article. Unless whoever nominated this article for deletion (again) can come up with some really good reason for deletion, I suggest leaving this article alone and improving it instead. Also when people hear of a internet celebrity (or any famous person for that matter), where is the first place they go. Wikipedia! Seb2net 18:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before the "No new developments" phrase is senselessly dropped on this article, please note that MTV-owned GameTrailers has acquired ScrewAttack and now hosts exclusive rights to premiere the episodes of the Angry Video Game Nerd.216.37.86.10 19:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>James Rolfe himself has stated that he is very excited about making many new videos in the future (something similar is mentioned in the article, but I've read it in a discussion with him on the ScrewAttack forums as well), probably gaining an even greater fan base as time passes. Thereby making an article even more necessary Seb2net 19:19, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Strong keep! The Angry Video Game Nerd is an established internet phenomenon, much like webcomics (PvPOnline, Ctrl+Alt+Del, ...) and comedy websites (Ebaumsworld, Something Awful...). These all have their own Wikipedia entries so I can't see why The Nerd couldn't have one too.</p>
<p>For some reason, I cannot find the article. Has someone deleted the article despite the strong "keep-opinion"? I have a feeling this happened last time as well. The main opinion was keep but the article was deleted nevertheless. Could someone please explain what's going on here? I get the feeling wikipedia doesn't want a AVGN article come hell or high water. Seb2net 22:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article does appear to be gone, despite the fact we only started discussing it two hours ago. Isn't that a little fast? BoosterBronze 23:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep! Currently listed on Youtube as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=JamesNintendoNerd" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=JamesNintendoNerd" rel="nofollow">JamesNintendoNerd</a>, he is the #28 - Most Subscribed of All Time, and is the #52 - Most Viewed Directors of All Time with 4324926 views. He even has his own <a href="http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html" class="external text" title="http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">Fanart Gallery</a> Gardenghoul 05:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone unfairly has it in for this page - the current page was very well-written (much better written then some of the pages that currently remain undeleted) and the subject matter is more than relevant and significant, as Rolfe is a well-known internet personality. Whoever continues to delete this page is, to quote the Nerd, "a shitload of fuck".</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not extremely good at all the wiki codes and functions, but someone should revert (or whatever it's called) the page if that is possible. There is no reason why it shouldn't be there. I know the discussion must last for 5 days but I believe we're getting an impression of what the end result will be. =D Seb2net 08:04, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
