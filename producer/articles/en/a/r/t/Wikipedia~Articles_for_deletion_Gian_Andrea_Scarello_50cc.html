<p>A bit on a non-article, although more complete versions are on the Italian and German wikis. However the artist appears non-notable (Google only give self-authored links) and this may be self promotion. There is a related article at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_Baroque_Art_d7e9.html" title="Contemporary Baroque Art">Contemporary Baroque Art</a> which is also dubious, but I've yet to form a view on that one.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have not (yet) voted to delete the article, but I have mentioned that I suspect the information is not verifiable. Nothing has been added to this discussion to shed any light on the verifiability of Scarello's standing or importance (which is subtly different than his fame or acclaim). If you have access to resources which would verify the claims, then please share them with us. From what I can tell, not being a reader of German, it seems that if Scarello has any note, it is as a founder of a small Commedia dell'Arte theater company in Mainz, and certainly not as the founder of school or style of art, or as a painter. <a href="http://www.scarello.de/scarello.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scarello.de/scarello.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:07, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is not an argument on the personal pleasure.

<p>The painting is one free and conceptual art.The painters who make commerce are not important and they do not cost more than 3000 US dollar..., the art is not commerce even if the paintings cost...</p>

<p>Wiki is not an advertising newspaper. Wiki is not a Chat for poor arguments. Wiki is one free encyclopedia. But it does not have to be manipulated... Everyone of we gives its knowledge on specific topics. Without valid scientific goals they do not provoke argument. I it respects your opinion, but me he does not seem reliable. Too much mistaken and with contained not expert. I do not allow myself to write arguments on articles that of which I am not much expert. Even if sure times if these me seem improbable, I do not make comments.... I could be mistaken and write stupid things. For this I understand some various reactions in the argument, it must make much attention... In adding this artist is the much most famous one than other personages who fill up the pages of wiki... I would want to end the argument here (I already I am admonished in order to have too much written ).

<li>Gunmetal meant no great offense. A sockpuppet is a user account created by someone for the purposes of trying to vote more than once and sway a VFD vote (usually). See <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> for more info. Someone who creates an account and immediately votes on a VFD is always looked on with a bit of suspicion. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11"><font face="Courier"><font color="#66CD00">Etacar11</font></font></a> 19:47, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>explanation</b> - The term <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">sockpuppet</a> has a specific meaning on Wikipedia, and VfD is one of the more battle-tested sites for dealing with the phenomenon. Basically what we are looking for with this vote is a consensus of the Wikipedia <i>community</i>. The WP community is made up of editors that are objectively concerned with the project as a whole. Therefore, in determining a consensus, the comments of people whose concerns extend only to single issues can be justifiably ignored. People who have apparently only registered to enter a vote on VfD can be assumed not to be part of the community yet. The comments of people who do not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> or who engage in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a> will also be ignored. Furthermore, these tactics tend to reflect poorly on the possibility of legitimately justifying the article being disputed. It is presumed that strident arguments that have no substance to them indicate that no valid arguments exist, or they would have been brought to bear already. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<b>Comment</b> Not problem my friend, dear Gunmetal( and all Wikipedia-Friens), I want to ask You to find a compromise, it is important that this argument supplies a good <i>Wikipedia-example</i>. The opinions are too much various: too much negative or too much positive .What I propose? As an example, with a <i>short article</i>(but not too mutch) Me it seems just to propose a not long article, a compromise for all the opinions...This argument resists from too many days, it is right to allow the administrators to close it, with wisdom and intelligence.

<li>Changed to <b>No vote</b> - I just took a whack at correcting the grammar in the recent edits. It was a difficult task and the original text made the subject unclear. Can someone verify that we are talking about an artist? Many references to "it" made me unsure. If the subject is actually a type of art just revert my attempt and start over. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 13:28, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>dear Tεxτurε, please, do You want to control this German article? , perhaps you can translate it:<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarello" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarello" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterloud_2e9e.html" title="User:Peterloud">Peterloud</a> 13:50, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one controls an article. I made a first attempt to clean up the syntax. Hopefully, the next person can take it from there. I am not knowledgable about the subject and probably someone else can give it the proper perspective.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know that inclusionists like to include every article no matter what, but many people seem to have a skewed view of artist notability. Its really not sufficient to have just sold a painting or something, for the most part that is a level of notability equivalent to having a job. <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, where I live, is less than half the size of <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> yet has several hundred active artists (you can find a subset <a href="http://www.camopenstudios.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.camopenstudios.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>), very few would really merit an encyclopedia article.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Now this weekend I started an article on <a href="../../../a/f/e/Afewerk_Tekle_b1df.html" title="Afewerk Tekle">Afewerk Tekle</a>, Ethiopia's most famous artist - we didn't have anything before, although there was an article on the German wiki. In the process, I came across <a href="http://www.the3rdman.com/ethiopianart/whoswho/a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.the3rdman.com/ethiopianart/whoswho/a.html" rel="nofollow">this list</a> of other Ethiopian artists. Notice how many of them have had solo exhibitions, have exhibited internationally, and have their work in national collections. I doubt we will have articles on any of these artists any time soon, but these are the sort of criteria that should be considered with respect to notability. I'm sure that for most of the artists in that list online verifiability will be difficult, but I'm equally sure that if asked, many of them could point to publications where their work is discussed.</dd>
<dd>In general, self promotion is one of the required skills of a modern artists. However, if an artist is writing articles about themselves, but isn't able to point to their national and international shows, or their work being discussed in art journals and the like, it is a fair bet that their notability falls well below the professor test. I can't see why Wikipedia should help promote their work over and above the work of the several million similar artists. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 14:21, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd love to form a quality retort to that, but I've read it 5 or 6 times and I still can't figure out what you're trying to say. Instead of attacking me, perhaps you should focus on providing some evidence of notability for Scarello. That is, after all, the only issue of importance here. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunmetal_9df8.html" title="User:Gunmetal">Gunmetal</a> 17:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>But this is not discussed! If You are not expert , it cannot be discussed. <b>About the "Scarello" there are more information than what You ask</b> , and of what the Vote of Wikipedia demand . I Do not want more to discuss with You.You provoked to an enormous pressure against this article (intellectual violence), To my opinion, Your reliability dont convince me.On Your opinion , there is something of strange, without reason: something that does not have relationship with the article on the Scarello. <b>Like suspicion a Tandem-Voting-job with the User "Solipsist"</b> <i>("Familiar voting method"&#160;? Or , perhaps, it is a a new mode for convincing&#160;:"Vanity-Tandem-Vote voting method"&#160;? )</i></li>
<li><b>About Notability</b>: <b>In your voting, used too many different measures. As an example: between the article of Scarello and the article on the African artist , that You have written, it appears clearly that: Your African artists,<a href="../../../a/f/e/Afewerk_Tekle_b1df.html" title="Afewerk Tekle">Afewerk Tekle</a>,has very, very, much less of the evidence of notability of Scarello ,that you do not recognize, also against every strongly personality evidence.</b>For this example I do not want more to discuss about your incompetence about this&#160;! If you do not have idea of this Scarello-article, please not tried to deny, with strange comments and without reason, the Voting of the other Users.</li>
<li>'<b>I ask,kindly, that an administrator puts this argument in the archives</b>.</li>
<li>After this comment I do not want more to write and to answer to you . Now You can try to convince other Users, Your attempt with me has not had effect. <b>The Voting is democratic and free,like a Your opinion, but now You cannot hide behind the evidence of my affirmations.</b> Getlteman I pray You not to call itself more in cause on this disussion .</li>
</ol>
<p>In every case, dear "Tandem Company" Thank You for Your denied supporting comment.Please you do not take this like a personal attack, but in this argument it is important to donate tests and not only words. I repeat my Vote it remains: <b>KEEP</b> . Thanks--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterloud_2e9e.html" title="User:Peterloud">Peterloud</a> 13:39, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
