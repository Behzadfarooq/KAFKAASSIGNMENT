<p>Unnotable clubnight held in London. It may have been running for several years but isn't revolutionary in any way, nor is it any more famous than a lot of other London nights. Seems to be an advert set up by the promoter perhaps? Karinski 13:09, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Edit</b> I entered this article as I felt Buttoned Down Disco was an notable concept in London clubbing, since I do not know of any other invite only, travelling nightclubs (?) However, I do not want it to end up looking like an advert. Perhaps you could help me edit it? The copy is from the site's history page. Also, if you need to see mainstream press, there is a <a href="http://buttoneddowndisco.com/what_the_papers_said.htm" class="external text" title="http://buttoneddowndisco.com/what_the_papers_said.htm" rel="nofollow">press</a> page. I feel the whole area of Nightclubs could be improved though, I've started a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Nightclubs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_talk:Nightclubs" rel="nofollow">discussion on that here</a>. Ignore the Buttoned Down Disco reference, it was only there as an illustration. Also please feel free to comment on the other pages I added/edited; <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity_Club_a2b9.html" title="Infinity Club">Infinity Club</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_ffda.html" title="The Libertines">The Libertines</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton_%28band%29.html" title="Clinton (band)">Clinton</a>. I'm happy to help with the Nightclub category if needed. RachelTurner 22:34, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Edit</b> Hey Rachel, sorry i'm not meaning to sound like a bitch here but aren't you the promoters girlfriend? I think if someone unbiased were to put an entry in then fine, but as it is it's a little dodgy. I agree perhaps nightlife should be bigger, but it should only be clubs that have made a real, lasting contribution. If you check the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacha.html" title="Pacha">Pacha</a> page you'll see that it's smaller than the Buttoned Down Disco page! User:Halliwell92</li>
<li><b>Edit</b> Hi Halliwell, Yes, I am and sorry, I <i>really</i> don't want this entry to be dodgy! I was just really surprised the nightclub area wasn't bigger and better structured. I tried to follow the layout for an article, incidentally, there doesn't seem to be an infobox template for clubnights, and it is weird how the other articles are so short(?) I'm totally happy for this particular entry to edited down/deleted if everyone argees. However, I think there still needs to be a distinction between venues and clubnights. As Buttoned Down Disco is not comparable to Pacha, it would be more comparable to <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escape_from_Samsara_0245.html" title="Escape from Samsara">Escape from Samsara</a>. I'm totally happy to help with the structuring of this category if needed (regardless of whether this entry is deleted or not!) RachelTurner 12:45, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Actually on further investigation, this could be a 'keep' according to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, since Buttoned Down Disco has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...). i.e. TimeOut, The Times, Metro, Evening Standard and The Guardian. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by RachelTurner (<a href="../../../r/a/c/User_talk%7ERachelTurner_53a1.html" title="User talk:RachelTurner">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RachelTurner_9eb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/RachelTurner">contribs</a>) 21:11, 2006 October 19 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> no significant review or write-up; just the kind of clubbing chat/info you could find on any club night. Nothing to suggest exception or even notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> No claim of encyclopedic notability. Likely spam/marketing abuse of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a nightlife guide, and simply citing event previews/reviews from nightlife guides in Time Out, Evening Standard, Guardian etc. are not acceptable sources for proving encyclopedic notability. The background story for the club (yes I looked through the deadmanboots site or whatever its called) doesn't seem to be extraordinary especially as London is a major nightlife capital. I can find multiple published reviews for the little totally ordinary restaurant around the corner, but this doesn't make it encyclopedically notable. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a bit on the fence, but I think it falls on the "delete" side. What we have here is a neologism that has sprung up on blogs and does not seem to have made an impact on the mainstream. All of the references cited in the article that actually speak of a "concern troll" are blog posts. The major newspapers linked in the "examples" section verify the incidents, but do not describe them with the term "concern troll." I also disagree with the merge tag, as we should not include the information until we have more reliable sources (also, the behavior does not seem totally consistent with "trolling" as defined in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">Internet troll</a>, the suggested target of the merge). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 00:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The liniage is certainly notable. There are notable people along it. It does need work and explication. It would be nice to have proper references, the author indicated that his source was <i>Kutch deshno itihash</i> by Aatmaram Keshavji Dwivedi. Printed from "Nirnay sagar" Mumbai Samvat 1932; shake 1798. With my limited library and not speaking Hindi, I haven't been able to verify its existance. But the book <i>The coinage of Kutch</i> by Richard K Bright (1975), may provide additional verification.

<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, and I may be wrong about this, but Wikipedia is not supposed to be any sort of genealogical guide. Second of all, the 'tree' isn't really a tree, doesn't even seem to show marriage and the like. Third of all, none of the names offer links to articles or any context whatsoever. The 'article,' if you can call it that, isn't the least bit wikified.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are at least a couple of ways to look at you comment. We should delete all fiction from the Wikipedia, or legendary ancestors require deletion, or as an anti-religious statement that decent from the creator, Brahma, must be fiction? Regardless, as argument for deletion, it would require deletion of the Japanese imperial family who are decended from the sun god. Rationally the need to separate fact from fiction is not a reason to delete entire articles. It may be a reason to work as an editor on an article. <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 20:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I meant it should probably be said that mythology says that they are descended from Brahma. The way it looks now is as if it is absolute fact. Legendary ancestors do not require deletion if they are verified as being legendary but if they are passed as legendary then that is confusing to the reader. Even so I doubt that Brahma is considered part of the Jadeja royal family in the same way as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> is not considered part of many royal families in Europe except for the British royal family.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - It's somewhat easier to research British royals than Gujarati royals, especially for English speakers with internet access. This is one source of systemic bias. It isn't surprising that our English royal articles are better. Still, the subject is notable, the content verifiable, and this text, even if it is poor now, contains some information, and may be helpful to someone who wants to improve it. Not worthy of deletion IMO.- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 20:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm reconsidering my support for deletion... however, there are still significant problems with the article. First of all, it's just a list of names and the little blurb doesn't supply anywhere near enough context. The names certainly ALL need to be accompanied by the years in which that person rules. Also, any names which have articles of their own should link to that person's page. More context, years of leadership and article links... if it had these I'd support keeping it, especially because of Wikipedia's drive to rid itself of systemic bias. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:42, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Total Re-write</b> I'm surprised how low the standards being applied are. First, it has tons of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, a comment above notwithstanding, and regularly violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Who decided, to take an early example, that "cognitive" and "theistic" are antonyms? The article is an extended argument in support of the theory that Christianity derives from Buddhism -- and as with all such arguments, it displays an incredible lack of critical judgement -- Antioch was founded by a king of a line that had diplomatic relations with an Indian king, therefore Buddhism influenced Christianity? Nazarene comes from Nazir? -- and a total disregard for chronology whenever it suits the argument.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Where do we get the source for Jerome saying <i>Buddha</i> (rather than Jesus) was born from the side of a virgin? I seriously doubt any reliable source can be found for this. Have a closer look at the "parallel sayings" table -- first, some of them have little or no similarity and were apparently added just to bulk up the list, second, we are given no information about whether the Buddhist saying are recorded in Theravada or Mahayana sutras, which is necessary information in that Mahayana Buddhism is several hundred years <i>younger</i> than Chistianity. At least one has Buddha and Jesus actually saying opposite things. The article generally plays fast and loose with the account of Jesus. In one place it says Jesus told all his disciples to give up all material possessions, a common misunderstanding of what He told the rich young ruler. But encyclopedias exist in part to correct misunderstandings, not spread them.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I voted to keep. Much is not OR and presents long standing comparative religion scholarship, but some of the statements are undocumented OR, such as you cited. But the libraries of theological schools are full of dusty tomes which could and should be cited vis a vis such questions. Unsupported claims should be fact tagged and then deleted. The WP principle is to edit boldly and footnote everything to reliable and verifiable sources, which does not necessarily favor online sources rather than published work.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>The similarity of the teachings of Buddha and Jesus has long been noted by scholars. Comparison of religions has a long scholarly history, so the article has a lot of scholarship to draw on. The subject is notable and encyclopedic.That said, the scholarship can be improved. Footnote 5 is very vague as to what it refers to. Footnote 1 is to a website which appears to be a book, but no ISBN is furnished and it is not footnoted as a scholarly book. It is important in documenting 1st century Christianity in Palestine, a subject with few primary sources. The same info is cited to writings by Hypolytus, but clicking the link leads to a disambiguation page, and checking the various pages does not produce backup for the claim made re Terebinthus. This is only skimming the surface of need for improvement. Editors, get busy and make all references to only verifiable and reliable scholarly sources. (Edited to add: I added ISBN info for ref 1, but tthe form could still use a tweak. Please check other books cited and provide full publication info)<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:17, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rewrite</b>, or <b>Delete without prejudice</b>(i.e. a better article on the subject might be acceptable). '"Harold Thompson" prisoner' gets 1440 ghits, almost all relevant, and he seems to have some notability among various anarchist and activist sites, so an article on this guy is borderline acceptable, IMO. However, the text of the current article is cribbed wholesale from his website. Copyvio is probably not a problem (these are anarchists!) but verifiability is, so pretty much the whole article would have to be scrapped and rebuilt from better sources... --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 01:52, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as above: no assertion of notability, no other evidence of notability thrown up in discussion. It's also a very badly-written article: there is nothing that says directly whether it's in Cambridge, England or Cambridge, Massachussets and the only clue is that it refers to the Grafton Centre, which I seem to recall is a shopping mall in the middle of the city of Cambridge in England. But even with a tidyup, I can't see any reason to believe that it can ever make a legit claim to notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 08:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> According to the history linked to above, this chapel was opened in 1825 - in the UK, most people wouldn't consider this a particularly ancient building.

<li>Of course that's true, but mere age isn't crucial to notability. You'll certainly not find a thousand-year old Baptist congregation anywhere! They appear to trace their roots back to just after the Restoration - fairly significant in the context of Baptism. <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> 15:13, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete this version</b> The article makes no claim of notability. It looks like we <i>might want</i> an encyclopedic article about the church because of its history, but this is not that article, nor even a help to writing it. The links in this AFD are more of a help, but there is a shaky transition in the second paragraph about John Stittle that I'm not convinced would stand up to a real researcher. So delete this, with no prejudice against a future article about the church that is sourced as described in <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORGET_afc0.html" title="WP:FORGET">WP:FORGET</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep it but fix it:</b> Eden is notable for at least a few reasons. 1) Its history, I believe, goes back to the early Particular Baptists in England. 2) It is one of the two or three most popular places of worship amongst students at the University. 3)It was for many years pastored by Roy Clements who became known as one of the premier Evangelical leaders in the UK. There was quite a stir when he came out (or was outed)as a homosexual and resigned his post. 4) Mark Dever, a well known Evangelical /Baptist leader in the US was associate pastor there for a few years.</p>

<dd>If those statements can be sourced and attributed, I'd happily change my mind about the deletion.

<p>What is the point of having this page? There's no realistic way to list every single SDK in existence, nor is there any point to doing so. How do you lay it out? By license? By company? By domain? How big must something be to qualify for the list (ie can my pet graphics engine be arbitrarily added to the list)? Even if all of those questions were satisfactorily answered, there would be no advantage to having such a page -- at the very least, it would be prohibitively large. As described in What Wikipedia Is Not, "excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia." I don't see any redeeming value to simply listing all the SDKs. The ones that are worth talking about (for example, the Open Dynamics Engine) can be given their own pages, and SDKs can be a category instead. Promit 02:03, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> and note that the 'no consensus' afd on Slice of Sci Fi was nearly a year ago, and both of the delete votes appear to have been because the editors thought podcasting was too new to be in Wikipedia. If these articles had been started then, deleting them may have been appropriate, but they've gained a lot of notability in the past year. And yes, I'm a fan, but I think I've supported my position well enough for that to be overlooked. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 15:45, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep one</b> I've edited these before (nominating their Farpoint podcast company for AFD &amp; using prod on other linked articles). The sources for Terra include co-authorship of a (non-vanity) book and media coverage of the "podiobook" startup - so I don't see the point in deleting him. But I don't see any sources for Mennenga's own notability that would meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I grow continually more and more dissapointed with the militant hatred that Wikipedia has for podcasting. I agreed with the vote sometime back to scrap the article for Farpoint Media as company itself is not as notable as the podcasters and podcasts produced under its auspices. However, Michael and Evo are well known persons to a large audience, especially Michael. He is either the host or engineer for a number of podcasts and, as was noted, engineered the podcast track for this year's <a href="../../../d/r/a/DragonCon_3131.html" title="DragonCon">DragonCon</a>. I don't see anything in the article that isn't verifiable. The article could stand some expanding, but Mennenga is well known to enough people to warrant his inclusion here. As I look at <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>, he notes that artists who have a top 10 song and authors who have a widely read book are automatically notable enough for inclusion, even if there aren't many independent articles about them. I would argue that podcasters like Michael and Evo who have a large listening audience to their shows should be considered in that same vein.Ultimate ed 04:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I can't actually <i>read</i> the Hebrew page you get to, but the link is the same in the very first version of this article, meaning that, at one time, it was most likely a real article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I examined some of the ghits that were out there because I agree with Truthbringer's point that the number of them for someone who died that long ago could be misleading. After sifting through a number of articles found and other references in the first 10 pages I've concluded that he seems to be rather notableand meets the WP:BIO guidelines. The article certainly needs expanding and this is not an area of particular interest for me, though I may consider doing it if it seems like the article will be deleted otherwise. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:43, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He appears to be notable. He appears in <i>American National Biography</i> Edited by John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, vol. 9, pp. 517-518; and in <i>Obituaries on File</i> Compiled by Felice Levy. New York: Facts on File, 1979. Marie Syrkin wrote a book about him entitled <i>Hayim Greenberg</i> published in 1977 by the Youth and Education Department, Jewish National Fund, New York City. The Information Dept., Dept. for Education and Culture in the Diaspora published a book in 1954 <i>In memoriam Hayim Greenberg</i> 76 pages. The article definitely needs expanding.

<dd>"if you disagree, discuss the issues raised at Talk:NetWhoring"</dd>
<dd>That's funny, because you never raised any issues on Talk:Netwhoring at all. You put crap on my homepage instead.</dd>
<dd>Next time you want to delete an article, raise you objections on the talk page of the page in dispute. Do not address the author personally. Also, it may help if you actually "discuss" your objections, and "read" the content to see if the issue is the content of the article or the name of the article, and if so, what constructive feedback, if any, you may have to share.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I agree that it's currently an awful article. But two very important things - 1. It's a real town in Portugal <a href="http://lorica.spaces.live.com/LORIGA/" class="external autonumber" title="http://lorica.spaces.live.com/LORIGA/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> with over 1,000 people and per <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a>, <b>"Cities and villages are notable, regardless of size."</b> Just by their existence towns are inherently notable. 2. Portuguese Wikipedia has an extensive article on Loriga <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loriga" class="external autonumber" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loriga" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Perhaps some translation is needed for us English speakers.

It is inherently promotional, borderline incoherent and as Mike put it gives all the information we don't want. Also, as far as I can tell from the wildly obfuscated narrative the temple was founded fairly recently and three out of those five references probably predate it. One of the remaining two is co-authored by Pat Zalewki so it's got to be discounted as unreliable.

<p><font color="#0000FF">This entry reads as though it were likely written by the author himself. There are no citations for any of the information in the entry, the biggest reference I can find (Richard Howard) appears to be his former professor at grad school (hardly an unbiased/objective opinion), he's only been nominally published (two books do not a successful writer make), most of his bibliography contains books that have never been published or even released, and most of the entry reads as though it were a PR package for Ball. My opinion is that the writer maintains this page himself (it even contains information about his current roommate!), he's not particularly well-known among literary circles (I can't find any readings he has done in the last few years or any connection to a literary scene not connected to his former professor Richard Howard -- for instance, Howard used to be the editor at The Paris Review, where several of Ball's poems have been published), and it simply doesn't have enough authors working on it to be a pertinent Wikipedia entry.</font></p>

<li><font color="#0000FF"><b>Comment</b> I wrote a large portion of this wikipedia page. I am a friend and fan of Mr. Ball's. I believe that the comments made in this deletion discussion are valid and I spent a large amount of time today fixing up the page as per the suggestions made here. I removed the personal information, provided more details as to Mr. Ball's international publications, added citations, added external references and a list of readings/performances. I believe the website is now a factual account of Mr. Ball's career. He is a young highly successful poet. As was mentioned on the March Book deletion page, you cannot expect the Google Test to be a good measure of the notability of a poet. Poetry is a small field but that does not mean it is not worthy of coverage by the Wikipedia and its community.

<dd><font color="#0000FF"><b>Comment</b> In regards to the above comment; the IMDB is an English website largely focuses on English films; foreign films tend to get far less attention on it and it is not a valid way of gauging how important a particular foreign film is. Especially given how old the film is, it's not surprising that the film only got a few votes on IMDB; this has no indication as to the notability of the film. Given the size of India, with a population of a billion, it's highly likely that this film meets Wikipedia's standards. Furthermore, given, as I noted above, Wikipedia's desire to counter systemic bias I think we should act in good faith and keep the article, though it certainly could be expanded. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 18:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<li><font color="#0000FF"><b>Comment</b> This neighborhood is well known and deserving of coverage. Even so, it would strengthen the Chuo-ku article if we put the content there (until that article becomes big enough to split). That would place Nipponbashi in a broader context and get it more attention.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Den Den Town is more common, but if you say Den Den Town you only mean one part of Nipponbashi... so Nipponbashi makes more sense. The train station in Den Den Town isn't even Nipponbashi Station, it's <a href="../../../e/b/i/Ebisucho_Station_d8a9.html" title="Ebisucho Station">Ebisucho Station</a>. Nipponbashi Station is quite a bit farther north at Sennichimae-dori and Ebisucho Station is most of the way to the <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsutenkaku.html" title="Tsutenkaku">Tsutenkaku</a>. Either way, it has to be made clear that Nipponbashi is not just Den Den Town. By the way, Nipponbashi is also the site of the national <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunraku.html" title="Bunraku">bunraku</a> puppet theater. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:03, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Yes, I <b>know</b> the subject is encyclopedic, verifiable and potentially interesting, but this is not an excuse for its existence in this form.

Napalm Records is a well known independant label that is existing over 15 years and selling their products in europe and USA and "die verbannten kinder evas" released already 2 albums on this label 2.

Furthermore, I see the potential for useful links <i>into</i> this article from other articles about rap culture. It is a cultural reference as well as a word.

<dd>The AWA didn't fold into the WWE, it went out of business on its own. The WWE simply bought the old AWA tape library.

<dd>The article is fine overall, AWA Superstars of Wrestling is mentioned and what is there is factual, but the number of promotions linked to the current AWA is small (twenty in total world-wide) with most running shows within a very small area. ZERO-ONE MAX in Japan is the only one of any mention. The current AWA Tag-Team title and the historic one aren't really the same either, even though their histories are linked. Somebody winning that title isn't really playing in a professional league. If that was the case then where are all the articles for NWA Tag-Team Champions from that organization's period in the wilderness. Knuckles Nelson for instance, and if you say "Who?" then I hope you see my point. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 21:44, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The 99.94 article emerged from a conversation at the cricket Wikiproject. 99.94 is a number of huge significance to millions of cricket lovers the world over. It is probably the most famous statistic in the sport and the articles should <b>not</b> be merged.

<li>You mean <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cricket_9cf1.html#Iconic_scores" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket">here</a>? I don't read that discussion as a consensus to create an article. I do not disagree that the number is of interest, and a matter for wonder: I am merely trying to find out whether it is verifiably notable. I'm willing to be convinced, but what can possibly go in the article that should not be in the Donald Bradman article? Similarly, it's <i>Bradman</i> that's notable, not the number that happens to be his average. Can you think of a cricketing event that would have turned out differently as a result of Bradman averaging more (or less)? Can I take a musical analogy? Consider: should <b>9</b> be documented as the number of symphonies <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a> wrote? The symphonies are documented at Beethoven, and the influence of the number is documented at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_the_ninth.html" title="Curse of the ninth">curse of the ninth</a>. My point is that it's not <i>9</i> that's notable in that context, it just happens to be the number of symphonies he wrote: it's the <i>influence</i> the number had on other composers. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 17:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here, the issue is naming. Does this info belong in an encyclopedia? Sure, I think it does. Should it be in an article about "99.94"? I really don't think so. It should <i>absolutely</i> be in an article about Bradman (it is), and other articles about Cricket more generally, or even an article on outstanding records in sports generally. Or, put it from another perspective: this may be the most important thing to say about the number 99.94, but in the scheme of numbers, 99.94 is quite unimportant, and right now all we have there is an article about 99.94 that includes one piece of trivia. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 22:19, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Information is already located in two other places. I'm really big on pointing out the precedent not deleting certain articles would set. If we keep this then every number that has statistical significance in sports must be kept (the number of most homeruns in baseball, for example) which is clearly ridiculous and unencyclopedic. Statistical information like this is important in the context of the articles on the sport, the person achieving the record and the article on records in that sport. It, however, does not need its own article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm almost persuaded by Wildthing's argument that we are opening the floodgates to lots of other numbers that happen to be sports statistics.

<li>According to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numbers_793f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers">Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers</a>, <i>A record is worth mentioning if it is from a Major League player, or if it appears in the Guinness Book of World Records. Be sure to indicate the year the record was set in order to facilitate removal when a new record is set.</i> Now the Guinness site is not forthcoming with any information, although a Google search did give me a tantalising result to guinnessworldrecords.co.uk/au, which turned out not to work. It is a notable statistic, and there are many Australians who would be able to answer you "What's the significance of 99.94?" even if they don't know much about cricket. Still, the number is only really notable in relation to Bradman, so I would suggest either have the article <b>redirect</b> to his article, or else have it redirect to <a href="../../../9/9/_/99.html" title="99">99</a> (or possibly <a href="../../../9/0/0/9000_%28number%29.html" title="9000 (number)">9000 (number)</a>, where 9994 would go), and include a mention of it there, in parallel to way integers are listed on collective pages. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 14:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment to Dweller</b> I was waiting for someone to bring that up (.999 was a featured article a few days ago). That's a mathematical article, which is a bit different. I'd say, at least personally, peculiar numbers like that which have a unique significance in mathematics and are more likely to be searched for by people looking for articles in that subject. And besides, .999 has nothing better to link to or be merged into, it's not associated with anything but itself and the abstract mathematical concepts underlying it. 99.94, on the other hand, IS associated with something that it relies upon. People are far more likely to search for the man associated with 99.94 than vice versa, the same is not the case for .999 and other mathematical numbers of significance. And notice that 3.14 redirects to Pi and not vice versa.. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I get a number of IT trade publications, and "enterprise-ready" is a fairly common term (though not always hyphenated), even appearing in headlines with no need for explanation. I suspect just about everyone working in IT or executive management would recognise the term. The definition used in the article is basically correct, but the overuse of "must" makes it sound too authoritive--in reality, it's one of those terms that is slightly nebulous by nature. Of course, the big question is whether it should have an article. I'm not really sure. It's a common term and I surely wouldn't call it a neologism, but I can't imagine how to exapand it further than the extended dicdef it already is. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:11, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The page does not cite references for the history of the site (with the exception of the Ezine) and is also describing a freewebs page. If there was a wikipedia page for all such sites, then we could potentially be flooded by pages of information of little use to anyone. This site already has a mention in the Games Workshop Online community page I believe, maybe some if it could be merged into that. The page as it stands is of little use to anyone, and to me seems more of an advertisement than anything else. - tom ash

<li><b>Keep</b>. Would you mind citing the larger gaming site so I can judge myself?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway; This page did have history of the site, and if it doesn't now, it has been due to hacking problems. I will rectify the article if it would improve the situation. I understand your comment about many sites could have a page like this, but CW is a growing site, and having run a successful campaign with another site, the DC, and having a running E-zine onto it's 7th issue next month, it, in my opinion, deserves an article.</dd>
<dd>Another point I'd like to make, is that IMHO, you are putting our article up for deletion because either A) TLA does not have an article, and you see this as competition, which you shouldn't; we are smaller. Or, B) TLA does have an article, and same as point A.</dd>
<dd>Remember that Wiki is a free Encyclopedia for all, and just because you think we don't need an article, doesn't mean we can't have one. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElegost_14a7.html" title="User:Elegost">Elegost</a> 25 October.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It also sounds to me that this is a matter of publicity. Cheeseweb have been mentioned in several publications including Battle Games in Middle Earth and White Dwarf, and the occassional gamer looking for details of the forum may stumble across Wikipedia, and then search for it. From this, the neutral can gather that The Last Alliance are jealous that their page has been deleted. Whilst it is true that The Last Alliance is by far the bigger website, the fact it has too been published in White Dwarf with a link, and the fact it is known already across the Games Workshop community shows that it has enough reknown already. This is just childish jealousy; one has their article and the other doesn't so they wat the other gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheeseweb deserve to keep their's. It is well-written, and features links to other sites. The Last Alliance, on the other hand, do not deserve to keep this, because, out of spite, they have flagged this and several other articles for deletion. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlorfindel1993_569c.html" title="User:Glorfindel1993">Glorfindel1993</a> 18:04, 28 October 2006</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Well, I think this stems from the fact that the TLA entry was deleted as it wasn't notable or interesting enough. To be honest I feel both articles should be (or should have been) kept, infighting doesn't really help our cause in general. It seems strange though that an article about a website with almost 90 times as many members, that has been running 3 years longer, has won an award, been published in official <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> publications, appeared on radio, has a community that ties in closely with official <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> goings on and that has run 2 campaigns - on a larger scale - is deleted whilst this one is allowed. I reiterate I don't think this article should be deleted, but also the TLA one should be reinstated... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisWilliams1000_4d8d.html" title="User:ChrisWilliams1000">ChrisWilliams1000</a> 18:50, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also agree that the TLA one should not have been deleted; don't get me wrong, TLA is a good site, but I believe that this whole fiasco is just bad blood that we still have one up and TLA doesn't. I don't see The Chamber of Smaug's, The Dark Council's, or The Alliance of Light's articles flagged.

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems that the Last Alliance article was not deleted because of its position, but because it was boring, did not cite its articles, and broke general rules. I for one wouldn’t mind the Last Alliance article being reinstated, but because that article was, forgive me, no good, it does not mean that the Cheeseweb article should be deleted. TLA is definitely more important than Cheeseweb, but it was deleted due to the quality of the article. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAratheking_c277.html" title="User:Aratheking">Aratheking</a> 25 October 2006</li>

<dd>Also, trying to vandalise and making up facts that everyone hates the site will not help Kain. This is clear from the editing history of the Cheeseweb article, and it seems he is very bitter about the loss of his article, so he is taking it out on someone else. Also, in your reason for deletion, you fail to cite your forum. This is not going to help you. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAratheking_c277.html" title="User:Aratheking">Aratheking</a> 25 October 2006</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: The fact that The Last Alliance was deleted is highly unfair. However you have no right to consider Cheeseweb's deletion. It is a fan-site, and has too appeared in publications and a production by a Morayshire DJ. It is talked about in various hobby centres, and holds a great magazine.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I find it hard to grasp - that - just because your paid for, longer running site, was deleted. Doesn't mean to say that smaller communities have to take the outwash of your anger.</dd>

<p>The reason for deletion given by GassyGuy was "Wikipedia is not a dictionary. This expression does not have encyclopaedic significance.

The fact that both versions of the article contain nothing but random selections of usages of a phrase in films and on television indicate that this really is a mis-placed dictionary article about an idiomatic phrase — giving its meaning, quotations showing it being used, usage notes, and so forth — not an encyclopaedia article about a person/place/concept/place/event/thing denoted by the phrase. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:44, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The place for articles on "terms" (in this case, an idiomatic phrase) is a dictionary. This is an encyclopaedia. For there to be an encyclopaedia article, there has to be a subject. The subject in this case would be opening cans of whoop-ass. To back up your unsubstantiated assertion that an encyclopaedia article on that subject can be sourced, please cite some sources that discuss that subject. That assertion remains unfounded without cited sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Jeff, I'm not sure you understood Uncle G's objection. There's a fair amount of material about the <i>term</i> "to open a can of whoop ass". That's good dictionary material, because dictionaries document terms. There doesn't seem to be material about the actual <i>act</i> of "opening cans of whoop ass", which is what an encyclopedia article would have to be about. Based on agreeing that it's an interesting term with a colorful history, one would conclude that it belongs in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. Or, do you contend that Wikipedia should make like a dictionary, and maintain articles on words and usages? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 18:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I understand it. I'm just not as prone to give up on what's essentially a stub when it's clear that it can be expanded to a more useful article. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>A useful article on the act of opening cans of whoop-ass, and not on the term and its usage?

<ul>
<li>Let me put it another, clearer way - if we're using <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a> as a benchmark, I have no concerns regarding the ability of the right editor to improve this past stub status to a useful article within policy. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:41, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um.... that wasn't clearer, and you really didn't answer my question. Let me ask 2 very direct ones: Do you think the topic of this article should be the act, or the phrase? Do you think it it generally within the purview of an encyclopedia to document English colloquialisms? -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 20:07, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1) I think there's room for a study of both in this case. 2) I think it can be in <i>this</i> encyclopedia, but I have a grudging acceptance of the consensus that I'm not a part of on the issue. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>None of those are sources that discuss the subject. The fact that your primary purported source <i>is a dictionary</i> should be raising a big red flag. What you have provided are places to find <i>quotations</i>, showing a phrase in use, and a place where an idiom is attested. The "Encyclopedia for the New American Century" <i>says nothing about the subject at all</i>, for example. (It is actually is discussing <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a>, as is made clear by the prominent boldface heading of the paragraph.) Quotations and attestation are what Wiktionary wants for an article. Wikipedia wants <i>sources</i>, not <i>quotations</i>. As I said, please cite some sources that discuss this subject to back up the unsubstantiated assertion that an encyclopaedia article on that subject can be sourced. You haven't done so. You haven't even turned up any sources that discuss the <i>phrase</i> (most of which discussion is still dictionary territory), let alone the subject that it denotes — which as I point out again, is <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighting.html" title="Fighting">fighting</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:58, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Meatpuppets: <i>"A related issue occurs when multiple individuals create brand new accounts specifically to participate in, or influence, a particular vote or area of discussion"</i> You have actually openly accused us of having created our accounts to vote for this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is so unimportant article. It has to do with a minor amature league of a district, even lower than Greek Fourth Division, where teams play in very bad stadium, and the teams are so weak. It does really not affect Greek football and I doubt even if that could be in a Greek encyclopedia (except wikipedia). So unimportant that doesn't cause the interest even of Greek fans and media. Nobody in the world will care about such an article. If such an article is accepted, I wonder what is not in wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also as we saw, so unimportant it is that ONLY GREEKS SUPPORT IT. The fact that is not accepted by the rest of the world, speaks everything. If Greeks want it so much, why they don't write it for their own in Greek wikipedia and want it here where nobody wants it, except them? Their opinion I think is too subjective. One proof of that that some of them called everyone who is Greek to save the article. One thing that proves the aim of them is that they called me anti-Greek because I proposed it for deletion. Their goal is pariotic rather than helping contribution in wikipedia.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Whoa now, this is beginning to take on a somewhat racist tone. Wikipedia is actively working to promote systemic bias which means we should include things important to different countries, not only things important to the US and UK. KRBN, please tone down this inappropriate rhetoric. The problem with the article is NOT that it's Greek, rather its that it's merely a list and the title misrepresents whats located within. If the article was changed to fit the format of the British football clubs, for example, I'd support keeping it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>if amateur leagues are to have a presence at all on Wikipedia this league has a record of representing Greece in the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Regions_Cup_d8b3.html" title="UEFA Regions Cup">UEFA_Regions_Cup</a> (this is UEFA's top amateur competition and only one team composed of players from one amateur domestic league can qualify - Achaia won the Greek spot by eliminating the collective team of other amateur Greek leagues) in 2005. (<a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/RegionsCup/history/Season=2004/round=1962/Group=1991.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/RegionsCup/history/Season=2004/round=1962/Group=1991.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>). There are leagues in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> that have not achieved this but have been accepted. There has been a similar discussion on English low level teams here: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football/Archive6#Level_10_notability_debates_on_AfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Football/Archive6#Level_10_notability_debates_on_AfD" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>]</li>
<li>the league itself has been around for nearly 80 years, and teams such as <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a> who have won this league several times in the past have moved on and played in Greece’s <a href="../../../a/1/_/A1_Ethniki_76f7.html" title="A1 Ethniki">A1 Ethniki</a>, contributing players to the national team (hence the league has an element of historical significance too)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><b>However</b>, I think individual teams within this league should not necessarily have their own wiki entry (ie just for having participated in the league itself), unless of course they have demonstrated other notability criteria (like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a>). So I propose that the red links should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>I also agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">User:The Way</a>’s comment in that the format could be changed to resemble that of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a>.

<p>To my surprise, this process is working. I have already put in the information that <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> has taken the trouble to find (and some more). I understand <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a>'s desire to remove links, I would not get into the trouble. In my opinion red links are OK, even if they should better stay red for a very very very long time (no objection there). I understand the impression of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a>'s of the long list. It is a bit boring, but it is the FCA's history: The scope of playing is winning, winners should be noted (rather than a factual but ultraboring list of all teams participating in the FCA). It also shows <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panachaiki.html" title="Panachaiki">Panachaiki</a>'s history (an FC of national level Greek football). And...yes...the article was really ugly, but this was a question of notability as pointed out by several wikipedians who participated in this discussion, not a beauty contest.--<a href="../../../f/o/c/User%7EFocalPoint_b506.html" title="User:FocalPoint">FocalPoint</a> 20:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is an <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection of information</a>. I'm a huge hockey fan, and I can tell you that lines change very frequently- as often as several times per game. Usually, only one or two lines are ever stable for a reasonable part of the season, and more often than not, it's only two players that stay together (ie <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Thornton_7dcf.html" title="Joe Thornton">Joe Thornton</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Cheechoo_1ef9.html" title="Jonathan Cheechoo">Jonathan Cheechoo</a>), with the third being rotated. The list will be unmaintanable, and in some cases, unverifiable because the lines are fluid throughout the entire game (particularly in the playoffs). As it stands, each team's page already has its current roster listed, so I see no need to have this article.

<li>In any sport, whether it be basketball, football, baseball, or hockey, teams have set starters and moderately set depth charts. Prior to each hockey game the teams announcers will usually describe the starting lines of the team they are covering, and in some cases the opponents as well. This page is set up to document what teams are using as their current starting lines, rosters and rotations. As in any sport, injuries and other factors will change positions and combinations of players on the ice, field, court or whatever during the course of a game. The purpose of this page is not to track those changes, but rather to state what the current status of the team is, and what the current depth chart of the team is, as far as can be known. Obviously coaches make decisions before during and after the game the effects the information on this page, however those changes do not invalidate the information at one state - for example, starting lines in the last game were X is still a valid fact even if 4 people got injured in the game and the lines got mixed up. The next updated entry would have to show this new information as it becomes available, and probably should be documented when the lines are described. This is not news, but rather is a snapshot of the current and most recently known state of the team, information that I feel is encyclopedic and is not at all indiscriminate. There are other websites out there that can track the change of lines throughout the game, but this page is meant to be a reference as to the last best known lines and rosters for each of the teams in the NHL. Like any page in the wiki, it is only as good as its last update, and with the dynamic nature of lines in the NHL, those updates need to come fairly often. --<a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmarvin44_0d1c.html" title="User:Madmarvin44">Madmarvin44</a> 18:25, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> on one condition: It is reorganized as a depth chart, based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> rather than as current lines, as the present scope is completely unmaintainable. Any individual player could be shifted up or down a line at any given time, but that usually does not change who is considered the #1 right wing, #2, etc. The article does have potential, however. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 04:36, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I like the idea, but I don't think it belongs in an encyclopedia. Lines change from game to game, and even within a game, as do scratches, starting goalies, etc. Right now it reads like a news story or box score of the last game rather than an encyclopedia article. If it could be fixed somehow to make it more encyclopedic, I'd change my vote - but I don't see a way to do that, so I'll vote delete. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 17:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep:</b> I beg to differ on your opinion on this club, for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>PAEEK has a <b>basketball</b> division that has won the Cyprus top league on 3 occasions (See article for reference).</li>
<li>Through its local <b>basketball</b> success it has qualified on several occasions in European competitions (see article for reference).</li>
<li>If we model our coverage of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_football_league_system.html" title="Cyprus football league system">Cyprus football league system</a> on the (so far more developed) article covering the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> this is a team in level 3 football (as indicated by KRBN above). It certainly is more notable than teams such as <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowes_Sports_F.C._e9e3.html" title="Cowes Sports F.C.">Cowes Sports F.C.</a> which plays amateur football in level 17 <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_Saturday_Football_League_4475.html" title="Isle of Wight Saturday Football League">Isle of Wight Saturday Football League</a> (3rd division)!!!

<li>The Cowes Sports "A" Team play in the Isle of Wight League. That's their 3rd XI (after the First Team and the Reserve Team). You'd expect the 3rd XI to play at a significantly lower level than the first team, and in this instance they play eight levels lower.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 20:23, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I feel your point strengthens the argument of keeping PAEEK even further. If all three teams in Cowes Sports F.C.’s pecking order are included, the bottom at 17th level (the one identified by the links above) and the top at 9th level surely a team with PAEEK’s background (I won't repeat facts here) deserves a presence! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> 12:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've never said they didn't, all I was pointing out was the actual level at which Cowes Sports play (BTW their 3rds play at level 15, not 17, as they are in the IOW League Division 1, not 3 as quoted above).... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This is becoming cumbersome and might be beyond the scope of this discussion page. However, wikipedia claims that one team of Cowies FC, be it 2nd 3rd 4th or whatever pecking order plays in the 17th level. Why don’t you just check it out here for yourself: <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> It’s in black and white. The point GeorgeG illustrates is that Cowies FC play in quite a low league, be it the 9th, 15th or 17th. I don’t think anyone here is too concerned which of Cowies FC’s multiple teams plays in which league (maybe in this case it is the Cowes FC Old Boys), however as is, one of their teams is listed in the 17th level. I suggest you went and amended the page on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_league_system.html" title="English football league system">English football league system</a> if you think the information there is wrong. And if you want to genuinely contribute in a constructive manner to this page, please add your opinion on whether the article should be <b>kept or deleted</b>, (as this it the topic of discussion here).

<dl>
<dd>This is a historic club that is a household name in Cyprus. The only argument I see in deleting this article would be the fact that it comes from a small country, which in my books is a weak thesis. I would argue that on the basis of point 3 (above) alone, teams that belong to even lower divisions of the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_football_league_system.html" title="Cyprus football league system">Cyprus football league system</a> deserve to be included.</dd>

<dd>Do not compare Cypriot and English football league. Their difference is huge. Also there is global interest even for low divisions of English league. Don't forget also that is an english wikipedia. So english teams are in different case. If it was in Greek wikipedia, there would be no problem for me. I don't suppose teams from lower level of Cyprus deserve to be included because of the level of Cyprus.</dd>

<li>To clarify this KRBN, you are now arguing that an English amateur league team (17th division) should be included, whilst a Cypriot 3rd division team should be excluded on the basis of this being the Wikipedia version in the English language! I find this a ludicrous argument, not to be found in any Wikipedia guidelines. Had you read the guidelines, you would find that in the English Wikipedia there is no positive discrimination for clubs originating in English speaking countries.</li>

<p>This is a terrible article about an alleged subculture, which is actually just a flattering name for 'trendiness'. I culled a vast chunk of original research from the article (which I can testify from personal experience is a load of crap: metal has not 'stagnated' with 'nu-metal' which isn't actually metal), and truth be told the 'criticism' section is original research too, although largely valid. What is left, then, is a definition which largely mirror that found in the 'urban dictionary'. There have not, as far as I can see from Google, been sociological studies of 'scene' as there have of goth, punk, metal, etc. In short, this is not a verifiable topic, it is probably just a slang word of a particular sort of trendiness, and hence not a valid subject for an encyclopedia article, belonging more properly to a dictionary <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 21:05, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The 'newer' version is indeed more encyclopedic: less POV about trendy 'emo' 'fashioncore' nonsense. Only, it is, as it stands, largely a pointless fork of the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subculture.html" title="Subculture">subculture</a> article: while there is a semantic difference between the words 'scene' and the word 'subculture' (e.g. "I am part of the metal <i>subculture</i> but the metal <i>scene</i> is slowly dying"), clearing up this semantic difference is a job for the dictionary, not an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 13:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A term used to describe the current trend of social integration in youths. We do have pages on specific trends, its why we cover Mod era and punk.

<li>Rubbish. "Locksport" in this context is the name promoted by a single small organization via a single web site.

<li><b>Keep</b> Locksport is legitimate. I, and many other people, will be attending the annual Dutch Open in holland this November, as covered by wired magazine in 2004. There IS a distinction between locksport and lockpicking. Honestly? It's weird, that's true, but it's a legitimate sport, and not one endorsed by a single website. Please reference SSDEV, the german locksport group, TOOOL, the group in the netherlands, TOOOL US, (in america, of course) and LSI, (Locksport International) developed in Canada and operating throught North America. 20:55, 26 October 2006 <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">User:SchuylerTowne</a> <small>— <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">SchuylerTowne</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SchuylerTowne_6bf3.html" title="Special:Contributions/SchuylerTowne">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is a distinction between lock picking and locksport in the same way that there is a distinction between driving and racing.

<li>Locksport is a term much older than the aforementioned Locksport International. See as reference the Yahoo Group Locksports which started in 2002. It is also noteworthy that the single largest online community of enthusiasts, Lockpicking101.com, have widely adopted the term to represent the hobby. As well, consider that locksport encompasses much more than simple lock picking. - Josh Nekrep, 12:16 PM (CST), October 27, 2006</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.The arguments for deletion are baseless. The users making these comments, although very knowledgeable of wiki, lack any knowledge of Locksport, hobby lock picking or any notion of the sport there of. The term, although still in its infancy, is becoming a wide spread one. McClain’s Magazine have done an article, DefCon has a Locksport portion to its convention, as is the Dutch Open. The ability to define the difference between the act of lock picking and the sport seems to be incomprehensible by some.UWSDWF 17:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was just reading up on all of the AfD stuff, and reading up on Wikipedia in general. I apologize for not doing this before, but I will happily make it clear that I am on the board of directors of The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers, US branch. I'm also a proud member of the locksport community as a whole. Again, I'm sorry I didn't disclose that before, but I was just reading up on the process now, and I hope this can be seen as an act of good faith on the part of a member with few other posts. (I'm concerned that making some sort of winking, smiling face may, in fact, create some bit of executed code, so just know that I said that with a grin) I'm off to find other parts of the wikiverse that I've some expertise in. Hopefully we'll see a resolution to this issue soon, and hopefully I won't see myself and my peers alienated from this very interesting community. As someone else mentioned (an older wiki user than I) we're not trying to sell anything, we just thought we'd say "hello" with an article about our own community, I think this march to deletion surprised a lot of us. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuylerTowne_99c7.html" title="User:SchuylerTowne">SchuylerTowne</a> 15:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC) (I'm trying the tilde thing, let's see if it works)</li>

<li>I believe it is also worth considering that there is currently no wiki entry which describes the recreational side of locks, lock picking, bumping, or any such topic. The Lock PIcking page represents a technical representation of the physical act of picking a lock, but offers little information that there even exists a wide base of hobbyists. I can see no reason why a legitimate hobby, with a name for that hobby coined by and adopted by those who participate, should not be allowed to be described on a wiki page. Before removing this entry, serious though should be given to how wiki should describe the hobby/sport. - Josh Nekrep 17:45, October 28 2006</li>

<dd><b>Very weak keep</b> but <b>only</b> if condensed and cited. I'm torn on this one. I think a list/discussion of the topic is fine. It is certainly a more viable list-style topic than many others I've seen. And it's also something that someone might want to read up on. However as noted this article has very little by way of citations <i>except</i> that the productions themselves could be seen to be the primary sources. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:19, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> He is a very notable an respected figure in sports. What i included are just some of his personal accrolades. There are tons of titles under his belt(and i mean competition at its highest level) which i hope you guys can expand on it. Maybe some of you are not familiar with Karate.

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> No claim made of encyclopedic notability. Wikipedia is not a nightlife guide. Clarification - "Escape from Samsara" was not a nightclub in terms of a physical venue; it was one type of regular party night that used the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fridge_56c9.html" title="The Fridge">The Fridge</a> as a venue. I am not questioning the encyclopedic notability of The Fridge. A little more detail could be added to the Escape from Samsara mention there, but a separate article hasn't been justified. I originally attached a prod tag, but I saw that the creator had recently discussed this article, and seems to have created the article in earnest, so I decided to take it here for discussion instead. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
