<dl>
<dd><i>On the one hand ... there are claims of importance made, presented neutrally, and attributed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The references provided to support these claims were subjected to some basic scrutiny (not particularly rigorous), and failed to stand up. Most were trivial, and did not support the statements they were being cited for; one was circular, and was effectively citing the list itself for a contentious statement; one cited a "special thanks" note to the list's founder for something entirely unrelated to the list itself; one turned out to be demonstrably false. Many of these references were added by <a href="../../../a/t/u/User%7EAtulsnischal_985f.html" title="User:Atulsnischal">User:Atulsnischal</a>, who has a confirmed <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> with the subject.

With the exception of the two statements tagged {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}, the content of this version does stand up to cursory checking.</p>

The only mentions to the mailing list are all <b>trivial</b> single sentence references to it, which, according to notability guidelines, is NOT a proof of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. My first reaction when I saw the title was, "How on earth did this survive two AFDs?" Now I know.

<li><b>Keep</b> We have been here before. Major institutions of world-wide stature do not make indiscriminate lists of resources, The selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness. the references deleted were examples of this use--the battle to delete this list has been carried out on several fronts. I think most of the major researchers in the subject do use the list. There are many academic fields where the mailing lists are the main information sources--of course this requires a moderated list with significant editorial control. This is now the way the academic world--or at least large parts of it--now work. I would certainly have been here saying this without the least need of canvassing, by the way--I think it is not wise to do so, for it does arouse suspicion. I can thus understand perfectly well the reason why some might vote to delete. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Correction to above comment</b> - the "major institution of world-wide stature" you refer to would be the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Museum_of_Natural_History_8ac9.html" title="American Museum of Natural History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, which happens to be the one reference that was most dubious of all, what with it not actually being at the AMNH itself.

<li>So? I don't see any reference from AMNH even in your diff above.

<li>1. The jump to "notable" is an <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">assumption</a>; 2. That archived copy does not contain sufficient information to verify its authenticity and origin (date and time of transmission amongst others are missing).

</li>
<li>DGG, again, you are not taking into account the difference between trivial, and non trivial mention. Does ANY notable institution give it more that a "that too" type mention? Do you see the real AMNH mention this in a non-trivial manner? Even a single paragraph of text focusing on how useful this list is not there. All we have is simple one line mentions. Other references are forged.</li>
<li>Also, you need to take into account "Trivial mentions". For example, research papers often have an acknowledgment section where there are similar one-sentence "Thank you" notes on various persons, that by itself does not make those persons "cited". As for the "Battle", no WP is not a battle ground, but we need to keep the random crap away, as WP IS an encyclopedia and NOT a fanblog. Until we learn to clean out fancruft and triviality, WP will simply degenerate into a spamblog. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Now that it's clear we don't have reliable sources that really justify the importance of this mailing list, I think it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - If we're scrounging through faxes and trivial lists of links, I think its pretty clear there are reliable sources at this point. No sources - even if a notable museum links to another website, it does not make that website notable. That is pretty much the definition of a trivial listing, regardless of who is performing it. Even if we granted the faulty assumption that being in a list of links makes it notable, there's no secondary information on which to base an article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could you reword the above sentence such that it makes sense, please? "Signed in an official capacity"? "Seal"?

<li><b>KEEP</b>: This article is about something more then a mailing list, it is often referred to as the "NATURAL HISTORY NETWORK" of India or South Asia, it also serves as WILDERNESS TELEGRAM SYSTEM of sorts, the subject of this article has become an NGO in itself helping its members many of whom are grassroots workers in the fields of Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation, students, scientists, prominent members of other NGOs, many "News Makers" in these field report directly to the NETWORK, simultaneously or before commercial news channels report on the matter, discoveries, poaching, habitat encroachments, proposed government protected area notifications and the unfortunate de-notifications, illegal wildlife trade observed, wildlife trade seizures, Endangered Tiger &amp; Panther etc. etc. bone and skin seizures, proposed government policy changes affecting the environment before they come into effect, proposed dams which will submerge large chunks of the last remaining pristine forests etc are just a few things reported and debated by this NETWORK many a times bringing corrective action in time. This is a list dealing with issues faced by Indian Naturalists, conservationists, and NGOs who network on it thankfully, including members of related Government institutions, IT CAN ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OTHER LISTS OF THE REGION dealing with similar issues and it stands head and shoulders above the rest, most of the top people in the field in the region are subscribers or know of its reputability. It is a notable achievement in India in its field, please understand that before taking the argument around the world comparing ORANGES with APPLES i.e. with just other sundry mailing lists.

<ul>
<li>Argument 1: <i>The list is "Natural History Network", "Wilderness Telegram System", "NGO in itself"</i>: The claim that it is the "Natural History Network" is based on a book endorsement, where the creator of the mailing list <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" class="external text" title="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7601.html" rel="nofollow">mentions</a> himself as "Co-oridinator, South Asian Natural History Network". Other such assertions are based entirely on perception of the creator of the article. Even if such claims are assumed to be true, the subject of the article still fails <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>.</li>
<li>Argument 2: <i>The list has been mentioned on websites of notable organizations</i> or <i>the selectivity involved in adding this to their lists is an endorsement of its usefulness</i> or <i>the list has been "recommended" by <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_Society_of_America_fdb4.html" title="Ecological Society of America">ESA</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Conservation_Union_6f54.html" title="World Conservation Union">IUCN</a>, and people such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a></i>: All the "references" provided for these arguements are actually trivial listing among many other URLs. For eg., the "reference" being provided to assert that the list is recommended by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Museum_of_Natural_History_8ac9.html" title="American Museum of Natural History">American Museum of Natural History</a> is a <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" rel="nofollow">fax message</a> that mentions some useful URLs including these: <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~ramakris/indiacons.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://herb.biol.uregina.ca/liu/bio/idb.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://aw.users.netlink.co.uk/obchome.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/tax.html/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (many dead links) -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article on Wikipedia? Similarly, <a href="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.indianbirds.in/download/IB2005%5B1%5D.1%20FINAL%20web.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> mentions the list among eight others (most of them Yahoo! Groups). <a href="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" class="external text" title="http://www.apnic.net/mailing-lists/s-asia-it/archive/1999/05/msg00015.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a list of 100+ links that includes several tripod, geocities, freeservers, 8m.com pages -- do all these pages become notable enough to deserve an article because they have been "recommended" by a highly respected journalist (<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Noronha_ddb7.html" title="Frederick Noronha">Frederick Noronha</a>)? Other such "references" are also trivial mentions of list in newsletters etc.</li>
<li>Argument 3: <i>The list members are employees of notable organizations such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife_Institute_of_India_74b8.html" title="Wildlife Institute of India">WII</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service_4db6.html" title="United States Fish and Wildlife Service">USFWS</a></i>: The "references" provided for this are messages like <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc99html/ecoendf241108.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> (a Reuters news item forwarded to the list by a USFWS employee). How does this make the list itself notable enough for an article? I work with a very notable organization and I subscribe to many lists -- that doesn't make those lists notable. I'd vote keep if many participants of the list were themselves very notable or famous, which doesn't seem to be the case.</li>
<li>Argument 4: <i>The list that produced a number of noteworthy predictions</i> (the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Natural_History_of_South_Asia_mailing_list_%282nd_nomination%29_99f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Natural History of South Asia mailing list (2nd nomination)">2nd AfD nom</a> was closed citing this argument by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a>) -- the article doesn't contain (and never contained) any information about "number of noteworthy predictions". It contained information about speculation that a subscriber to the list <i>may have</i> predicted the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" class="external text" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10009225" rel="nofollow">The reference</a> doesn't assert notability of the list. It just mentions the list once, as a place where one can verify that the prediction was made before the earthquake occured.</li>
<li>Argument 5: <i>The list is hosted at Princeton/some of the list members are professors, so the list is notable in academic circles</i>: Just because some of the list members are professors doesn't make it highly notable in academic circles. All the "references" earlier mentioned in the article were trivial one-sentence mentions of the list. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 10:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
