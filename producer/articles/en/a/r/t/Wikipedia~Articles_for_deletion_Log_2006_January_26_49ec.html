<li>The google hits test is only a secondary indicator, highlighting as it does simply the number of times a given term appears in webpages... 991 google hits is on its own absolutely no indicator of notability (check out <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Notability</a>) and lends no credibility to a 'keep' vote without other evidence. The figure or search criteria also appears to be wrong, a google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22guido+gybels%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22guido+gybels%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"guido gybels"</a> returned 603 hits, 190 of which are unique.</li>

What I had typed here first (I erased my pervious entry on this page) was a reason why this page shouldn't be deleted. I don't really care though. Just delete it if you want. I mean, it's pretty relevant, if these guys get any bigger then they'll be as important to Alvin as Nolan Ryan once was (he moved apparently). Also, just because they're not listed on IMDB doesn't mean they're not important or anything, just go watch Student Film: The Movie on video.google.com and you'll see. <a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 14:53, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When these guys (which includes OtakupunkX, who founded the studio and created the article) get any bigger, someone else will notice and write an article. As it stands, there is nothing about S3 Films that warrants a Wikipedia article. Also, IMDB is considered the basic way of checking whether a film is notable. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 21:15, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, if somebody else wrote the article and something by S3 Films popped up on IMDB, would it be considered notable then? There are a lot of movies that aren't on IMDB, like, say, anything by X-Strike Studios. IMDB mainly just shows movies that got a commercial release somewhere. Nothing by S3 Films has gotten a commercial release because they release everything for free online via video.google.com, Google's video hosting service.<a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 15:29, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When someone unaffiliated with the studio writes an article, that article will be notable by definition. Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. I believe the Definition section is relevant to the S3 Films article. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 19:16, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What's the difference whether someone affiliated with the studio or not writes the article? Chances are someone in the studio will have a hand in the article anyway to make sure the information's not totally bogus. <a href="../../../o/t/a/User%7EOtakupunkX_9c3f.html" title="User:OtakupunkX">OtakupunkX</a> 14:26, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The difference is that articles written by the subject of that article himself do not conform to Wikipedia guidelines about <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. <a href="../../../e/a/e/User%7EEaefremov_7b22.html" title="User:Eaefremov">eae</a> 19:45, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I wrote the article to be informative but that also makes it a form of solicited advertising. All wiki I presume seek to inform so as to promote/demote various data to the utility of the reader. I attempted to write the article in a more neutral tone so as not to presume on the trust between the wiki and its readers. If what I wrote violates policy or offends the majority, my apologies and I accept the deletion.

<p><b>Keep</b> - This page should be kept. I don't understand why you would advocate deletion, especially after looking at all of your various user pages, which are instrinsically worthless themsleves. This fellow has done many a recording and is a serious engineer with well known work credited to his name . . . he IS a professional. If this page is deleted, I want your user pages deleted alongside it, epsecially since they're nothing more than an attempt at creating a temple to your personal cult of the individual. Im sick of seeing cheap displays of population control on the WWW. You who would be thanatopoliticians in your own bedrooms, if you had even such modicum of power, should stay out of creating a wiki-utopia. This man has attempted to disambiguate himself from the hockey player. Play with your puck in the privacy of your own bedroom. . . . not on wikipedia.</p>

<li>Actually, I'm wasn't terribly familiar with wikipedia, but while following a string on an artist came across a reference to myself (the potential deletion in question), which led to an article on the professional hockey player of the same name, which I thought was a bit confusing. So after taking a look around and finding 2 or 3 other references to my work (in articles not being considered for deletion btw), I took a version on me that I found under the hockey player string and reposted it under a less confusing and more distinct heading, so there you have it. Do what you will, but if a number of articles on musicians (which are apparently not 'vanity listings') link to a professional hockey player as their recording engineer or producer, how is that helping wikipedia? <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonward_bf92.html" title="User:Jasonward">Jason Ward</a>] 09:23, 27 January 2007</li>

<dd>Kaldari says there "My real hope is that we can migrate all the important NPOV content from the Memorial Wiki back to Wikipedia and then close, lock, or move the Memorial wiki so that it is no longer the lonely neglected step-child of the Wikimedia Foundation," but he's too impatient to wait for DRV, so this is an out-of-process recreation of deleted content. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 01:54, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You guys are great at assuming bad faith. I actually created this article prior to the request for undeletion of the other article. Check the timestamps. And I certainly didn't create this article to prove a point. I honestly did not believe that the ban against memorials applied to simple lists of names (but perhaps other people believe differently). I did not think there would be any controversy about either creating this article or undeleting the other one. It is you, in fact, who have violated policy for not assuming good faith. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 02:50, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also don't appreciate my words being taken out of context. If you read my entire request for undeletion, you'll see that I even say that I created this article first "to test the waters," not as part of a debate or to prove a point as you have accused. Why are you trying to attack me? <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 02:53, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The article which started this page stated that Ed Catmull will serve as president of the new Pixar and Disney animation studios. This was interpreted to be a new combination studio: ie: "Pixar and Disney animation studios". This is likely to be false, as the statement is ended with studio<b>s</b>. It most likely refers to Pixar animation studio and Disney animation studio, as the article in question stated that the main point in the negotiations was that Pixar would retain it's current identity seperate of Disney. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaFox_390e.html" title="User:MetaFox">MetaFox</a> 05:34, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I am the news director for Valley News Net which is part of TheOttawaValley.com. We are a legitimate news source for the Ottawa Valley and are well recognized in our area. Yes we were put on the map by bloggers but it doesn't mean we don't have good journalism. I corrected the link to the site and it works now. There is no reason this page should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I assume you're referring to <i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable.</i> Note the phrase "extremely notable". Thy Infernal is <i>extremely</i> notable?! I don't think Thy Infernal would even survive Afd so how can they be extremely notable? They don't even have an article here or else maybe I'd vote to redirect there. Actually, I would vote Weak Delete on Thy Infernal and Winter of Apokalypse <i>combined</i>. ‚Äî<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 05:15, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see the two together as one topic. I wouldn't make a stand-alone article on either band alone. I think one band name, should redirect to the other (e.g. old band, to this new band name). The phrase "extremely notable", in context, is necessary if you want *separate* artices for each band/group/person (as opposed to a merge). Combined they are a keep. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 05:24, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why would you merge to the older band. I never said <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thy_Infernal_3721.html" title="Thy Infernal">Thy Infernal</a> was more notable. I said, that combined, they are collectively sufficiently notable. Given the current name is <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_of_Apokalypse_9732.html" title="Winter of Apokalypse">Winter of Apokalypse</a>, that's probably where info on both belongs. <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thy_Infernal_3721.html" title="Thy Infernal">Thy Infernal</a> is now a redirect. Also, I've been able to add a few links, but it will take a person much more knowledgeable of this "music scene" to write substantial content (My next expansion of a musicians article will be for a pop star, not "black metal").

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a notable website within the fanfiction and livejournal community. It predates fanfiction.net itself, is the father of fanfiction snarking (once a niche in the Internet, now a common occurrence), and has been mentioned in numerous publications both on and off the web.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The "attack" concept is misguided. The point of the site is to allow people healthy release so that when they do give criticism to authors, it's constructive rather than destructive. Telling authors that their work is being attacked on GAFF is frowned upon by the community. In addition, it has moved more into a "general" discussion forum for other things that could be godawful (websites, movies, novels, popular trends, etc.).Spotts1701 03:12, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whatever else you think of it, GAFF IS an important piece of the history of 'fan fiction', as it was one of the first places of its kind. It deserves a place here. Ghost 05:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. If you're going after "non-notable" articles, there are far more to start with than this one. Google and Alexa ratings are not the sole determination of whether something is worthy of study, especially when you don't use the right search queries for the job.

<li>Note on Meatpuppet Attack: their forums are having a <a href="http://godawful.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=24823" class="external text" title="http://godawful.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=24823" rel="nofollow">mild discussion</a> on the deletion merits of this article (free registration required), which explains where all these anonymous and new chappies are coming from. While this doesn't seem to be calling out the vote, it is clearly, intentionally or not, acting as a magnet to draw keep votes from members of their forum. Also, I get called an idiot.

<li><b>Keep</b> You'd be surprised the kind of influence that site has had - both negative and positive - in a large section of the fanfiction subculture, notably and especially on the largest fanfiction archive on the net, FanFiction.Net itself. With thousands of members, though, most of whom have at least a cursory familiarity with fanfiction (if not actively reading and/or writing it on a frequent basis), that should not be surprising. Plus: it was actually reviewed in the New York Times (positively, I might add), as part of an article on fanfiction. A special mention in an article from the New York Times is not "merely being in the paper", I'd say.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lord Bob: you were labeled by one user as that precisely because you are letting your bias seep in - and rather obviously, at that, as it ("Also inaccurate, as it implies there's fan-fiction that isn't god-awful") was clearly an opinion, not fact. "Non-notable" is certainly up for debate, it seems, but "all fanfiction is godawful" is PURE opinion. Additionally, had you read the entire page in question, you would had noticed that it does not "imply" anything about the quality of fanfiction in general, it merely states that Godawful Fan Fiction was the first site dedicated to mocking badly-written fan fiction, and is a source of controversy in the fanfiction community. As such, I'd say it deserves a mention, if obscure comic books (such as Zodiac P.I.) deserve one. There are plenty of things that are less "notable" than the subject of this entry, and it seems to be quite balanced and neutral. Again - I vote keep, at least for now. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a></p>

<dd>It was a joke. If I thought that all fanfiction sites should be deleted, I'd have put <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.net.html" title="Fanfiction.net">fanfiction.net</a> up long ago. While stating such an opinion in serious form would be...stating an opinion...this was an obvious opportunity for light-hearted humour. I have in fact written bad Star Wars fan fiction in the past, for what <i>that's</i> worth. For that matter, even if I <i>did</i> hate all fanfiction, I'm not stupid enough to think that's a deletion criteria. I think <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is stupid and I wouldn't vote to delete that. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 00:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>as I've seen to many people with personal vendetas against certain Websites (IE: Stardestroyer.net) force articles into deleetion simply on the grounds of not liking either their methodologies, or policies. It is utterly assinine, and is a behavior that is being repeated here. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajin_Gojira_2efa.html" title="User:Majin Gojira">Majin Gojira</a> 21:54, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know that I personally only nominated this page because wikipedia is not a web directory. I certainly don't have any agenda against fan fiction. The only question at hand is whether and internet forum with 3,200 members deserves inclusion in an encyclopedia. If there were a consensus in favor of including such sites, I would not have nominated the article. I wouldn't have any problem with the page being turned into a redirect to fan fiction, as per Radiant. I also wouldn't have a problem with the page being merged into another article, if anything worthy of mention can be found. The problem is that almost all of the information, when sourced, is sourced to godawful fan fiction itself. I think UncleG summed it up pretty well in a recent comment on the talk page of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li>If <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Claire_fe7b.html" title="Cassandra Claire">Cassandra_Claire</a> gets one, then hell, why not "an internet forum with 3,200 members?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I've reconsidered this a bit, and while I'm not sure that an article on this subject has a place in Wikipedia, after considering what else is out there in Wikipedia I'd rather take the cautious route and <b>keep</b> the article, at least for now. I know that people want to remove "cruft" from Wikipedia, but if there are enough people who find the article useful, we ought to be careful about our decision. And plus, I'd think that if there can be an article on each and every Pokemon, then we can be pretty liberal about what we let in Wikipedia, as long as the articles are well sourced and not vanity. <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoIdeaNick_49e4.html" title="User:NoIdeaNick">NoIdeaNick</a> 22:28, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the reasons given against it are assinine and even goes against Wiki's standards. Last time I checked, googling and checking hits wasn't the sole determining factor of keeping pages, not to mention the senriority and overall influence it's had on large fanfiction communities. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaudeLv250_1c86.html" title="User:ClaudeLv250">Claude</a> 00:30, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Primary author.</b> The pdf article referred to in Swim SA you will note is by Jeremy Watson, I am Jeremy Watson and I wrote it for the Northern Territory branch of the Surf Life Saving Association for teaching purposes after two unexplained drownings in Darwin , I expect it will appear multiple elsewheres, I have no idea where, I know it's in the USA. I wrote it because I have not seen a clear explanation elswhere. I am a divemaster.

<li>Wow, we never thought making these postings would create so much discussion. Thank you for your comments. As the fastest growing national brand of peanut butter, we felt the company deserved an article. As for my own, I looked at the People Still Alive section of the Vanity test:
<blockquote>
<p>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more</p>
</blockquote>
Our cookbook has sold well over 5,000 copies, and we have more cookbooks in the works.<br />
Whatever you folks decide, thanks for the opportunity to carve out a little piece of Wikipedia for peanut butter! --<a href="../../../z/a/l/User%7EZalben_3ef2.html" title="User:Zalben">Zalben</a> 03:22, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep both.</b> I have added some additional documentation. This guy just released his book a few months ago and created quite a buzz; as much as you can within the novelty food biz. Please reconsider your votes. I also ask that this AfD be given extra time since I feel that Zalben, who wrote the entry, simply did not understand the Wikipedia style and failed to document his successs as we would wish and not one other person in the Wikipedia community assisted him with the article until today. The aritcle was AfD'ed within hours of him creating it. He is obviously clowning around in the photo, but he is clearly serious about the business and the brand that he created. He has worked for 8 years to build his brand which is now distributed to 4000 shops. The book is reported by Amazon at a rank of #84,196, but note that this number is computed daily <a href="http://weberbooks.com/selling/2005/12/amazon-sales-rank-and-its-impact-on.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://weberbooks.com/selling/2005/12/amazon-sales-rank-and-its-impact-on.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity page, Advertising and self promotion. The article was 90% written by the girls mother and fellow administrator of the site. Hongkongdongle 20:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no idea why this page was nominated. Notable, verifiable. From the site: <i>My site has been featured recently in the Washington Post, and several other large newspapers here in the United States including the Chicago Tribune and the Wall Street Journal. It has also been featured in several newspapers all over the world, most recently (May, 2004) in the Malaysia Star.</i> Ifnord 14:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I'm puzzled by the nomination. The web site clearly meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia guidelines for website notability</a> as evidenced by high Alexa rank plus media attention by national newspapers. I note the nominator and several of the delete votes have only edits on this specific AfD which makes me suspicious of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">puppetry</a>. Ifnord 17:55, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>In what way do you assert this article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines? Nowhere is Alexa rank mentioned. If this site's Alexa rank qualifies it for Wikipedia inclusion, then you, Ifnord, have a lot of work to do - there are 29,999 other sites to be added. You'd better get cracking. And then, at the end of that process, you will have made Wikipedia into a Web directory, <i><b>in direct contravention of the guideline you cited.</b></i> -Ikkyu2 09:28, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aside from Alexa rank, the article meets <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28websites%29_86b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (websites)">Wikipedia:Notability (websites)</a> guidelines. Media attention suggests notability (CNN, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post). Thomas 9:17 AM 28 January 2006

<li><b>Note from Lissa at Lissaexplains.com</b> One requesting deletion is actually a moderator that I removed from my forum considering his heinous behavior - the site was created by me alone, and the article was written by members of my forum. Relative is no longer a moderator, and really has as much to do with the Web site as all moderators do. I, personally, have never touched the article, and only recently noticed a slanderous comment within the article posted by two members who left my forum. I ran an IP search within my forum, and four users here are ex-forum members. This is an obvious case of trolling. 3:58 PM EST 27 January 2006

<li>This one is easier than most. Usually a lengthy search involving some effort is required to find the non-trivial published works from independent sources. In this case, <i>they are handily linked to at the bottom of the article</i>. (The article could be improved further by citing the initial article in the Australian newspaper, as well.) I've read the subset of the news articles that are actually legible, and they are not mere incidental mentions or web directory listings.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It wasn't vandalism. The article was updated to reflect the current state of the forum, and was factually accurate. Lissa is definately trying to influence the outcome of the vote by retaliating against those that vote against the article. I resonded to her first comment, but it was deleted. I pointed out that she was lying in her comments here, and since it was deleted, I feel as though she is being allowed to say what she wants (whether accurate or not), and nobody else is allowed to provide the truth- either because it will be removed or we will be retaliated against. If that's not "disrupting the credibility of the AfD process", I don't know what is. <small>‚ÄîThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.49.0.178 (talk ‚Ä¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.49.0.178_459f.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.49.0.178">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Thanks for asking me, Paul. I'm new to Wikipedia, so I'm somewhat uncertain about the value of my comments here. The phrase "in the red" is, obviously, a metaphor, and has been in use as long as I can remember.

<p>I haven't been able to make heads or tails of this article from the get-go. Notes on the Talk page and on the author's Talk asking for clarification, from me and from another contributor, have been ignored for weeks. If it's supposed to be a list of countries that still issue stamps, it it woefully incomplete: Moreover, that implies that there are countries which did, but no longer do, issue stamps. I'm not aware of any for which this is the case, and if there are, a List of countries which have ceased issuing stamps would seem to be a better way of addressing that. If it's just a List of countries which issue stamps, then it should be renamed, but it does not appear to me that that was the author's intent. As it stands, it is nonsensical and not at all helpful. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 15:30, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is most definately notable. Just because some people have not heard does not mean it is in vain. I personally think that we should give the writer a chance. As it says, they are releasing something to the mainstream soon. How can they fake that? Also, if you search your memory, one of the most successful rap groups ever, <a href="../../../n/2E/w/N.W.A_c176.html" title="N.W.A">N.W.A</a>, started off largely unknown until their 'Straight Outta Compton' album dropped. 16:08, 26 January 2006 (EST)</p>

<li>Well, performing AfD on this article and seeing how it pans out is <b>not</b> a fair test on whether the other articles should go. You'd be removing them for being "Not enclyclopedic", where as this one has the "Barely a stub" criteria as well. If you wanted to see people's concensus on whether the other articles are enclyclopedic, I would have recommended you put one of them through AfD. (Please try not to take my comments as aggressive, from reading them I can see how they could be interpreted that way. I assure you, they are not) -- <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Deskana</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">(talk)</a></small> 17:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not a fair test and it wouldn't decide if they were deleted or not, that would be a matter for debate. The point is that if this one fails (as you say, it has an extra dimension of lame content) it would be pointless listing the others. Creating an AFD takes time as there are three pages to be edited, and debates to be monitored (I could perhaps have listed them all in one go, and didn't think of that&#160;:)). I don't think you're being aggressive. Anyway! I think we've each had our say, let's see what others think. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 18:12, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As mentioned, it's only a matter of time until it's expanded like the other Elite Four articles. Notability of character is not in doubt, has appeared on the TV show, video games, and card game (probably the manga too, though I'm not 100% sure) and is known to millions.

<dd>Mh, this is no convincing manner from my point of view. Why is a so called hoax-writing the reason for not deleting another self-written vanity - namely Jaromil's? And: I rewrote the article Matze Schmidt, so there is no motive for another deletion. Matze Schmidt 21:14, 20 January 2006 (GMT+1)
<dl>
<dd>Others have raised the issue of vanity on his talk page, and I also don't like the fact that he wrote it himself. However, as the author of software that we have articles about, he's probably notable enough to keep. Once again, if you disagree, list <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaromil.html" title="Jaromil">Jaromil</a> for deletion, and I'll consider your rationale and vote appropriately.</dd>
<dd>Your first post was a hoax because all you did was take his article, change the name to your own, and add "did not" wherever it said "did."

<p>Aha, no "notable accomplishments". And you decided that I/Matze Schnmidt am/is not qualified for an article on Wikipedia, right? This is beyond your function I guess. What the IS the "right quality", what are the right skills to have an article on WP and why should I start a deletion of <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jaromil.html" title="Jaromil">Jaromil</a> to get the logic right between the one and the other article?

<dd>I believe that this non-<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">Edit war</a> is a good example for explaining the logic and structure of an encyclopedia and of WP itself: If you argue that WP has already articles about Jaromil's software and take this for proof of his article about himself, the structure of the logic is _one article supports and proofs the other_ in an 'endless' chain or net. But to start a series of articles (chain or net) has yet another reason or basis, and this basis is outside the Wikipedia! It is based in the imaginations of authors about a person or works of this person. Now "author of works that we have articles about" is not a thing outside the system of WP, it is only to find inside the network of the texts. So the inside of WP and the outside of WP are connected in relationships of persons called authors and text related to texts about authors. Matze Schmidt 21:44, 20 January 2006 (GMT+1)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> They seem (he seems) notable enough. I think the band/project is simply called 'Headgear', so the low google hits are misleading. For that reason, the article should be moved to Headgear (band) (or some such -- not entirely accurate, since it's more of a one-man project than a band -- not sure what the naming convention for such cases is). <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz">Dbtfz</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dbtfz_c6d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dbtfz">contribs</a>)</small> 15:57, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Weak Delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've added sources and a video of them playing on RT√â. Thus, they have been represented prominently in at least three popular media: radio (rte on mystery train), tv (the view), magazine (hot press). There is a page on <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:7z820rnau48x~T00|" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:7z820rnau48x~T00|" rel="nofollow">AMG</a>, just nothing on it yet. Also, Google "hotpress headgear" and you get a ton of results, as headgear have been featured a lot in this major (for Ireland anyway) magazine (you can't look at articles though, it's subscription only). Watch the performance on The View (link on headgear music page), John Kelly himself says "I play them a lot on radio" - he presents The Mystery Train on RTE Radio and The View on RTE TV. More links and sources added, check the page again. david47 00:12, 28 January 2006 (GMT)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe this page was written as a corollary to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_longest_movies_in_history.html" title="List of the longest movies in history">List of the longest movies in history</a>. The problem, as we've noted in the discussion page there, is that the information is almost completely without any evidence. A search for this director yields absolutely nothing in any language aside from reference to this work, and even then it is clear that every source has almost verbatim copied it from a single site. The technical details for the claimed "Longest Film ever" <i>Film Stock</i> are also incomprehensible - it is claimed that raw film stock was projected in massively quantities once, and then reused by others to make other films. This is impossible - you can't project the film without fogging each frame as it goes through the high-powered light beam of the projector. The film would be useless for any conventional exposure purposes. Unless something more substantive emerges, I don't think this article deserves inclusion. <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> 20:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Reactions" has a "further readings" section which would be worth merging with <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> (I'll do that shortly). And if there are any facts buried in the jumbled writing of "Reactions" itself I'll merge that too. But there can't be more than a sentence or two that's worth adding to <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCarthyism_56ee.html" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>. Since nothing except a Talk page links to "Reactions", there's no need for a redirect, so it seems a "delete" is the simplest action. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 23:03, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why do we need an admin? Do admins somehow inherently know more about voting systems? As the original nominator, I can confirm that a similar method has been proposed before. I don't know if it's the same proposer. It actually makes me want to write a page called Hybrid voting method, describing how many "new" voting methods can be created by combining rules from different methods, and how such methods are rarely used in actual voting.

<li><b>Merge</b>: the Clone Wars battle cruft needs to be merged into a list, IMO. I'll be willing to take care of the merge, although the list may look awkard with the sheer amount of white space because of the infoboxes. My philosophy is that fancruft be merged, and then slowly improved as new users are discouraged from creating small articles. It also keeps information in one place.

<p>Why dont you just marry google? Just because people dont know about it or it hasnt got any "google hits" doesn't make it any less real. It's just ignorance thats what it is.</p>
<p>I've never heard of this place and I've been in Liverpool all my life. Explain more otherwise of course it will get deleted.</p>
<p>"Not much has happened since" doesn't make it non-notable. It means not much has happened since. Doesn't make Da GV any less an integral part of society in the slums of old swan.<a href="../../../d/a/q/User%7EDaquios_7de9.html" title="User:Daquios">Daquios</a></p>

<p>Before considering its deletion at least allow me to develop the article into something informative and good and stuff.

Heh, if there's only talk about a team in the area, howcome pundits are already talking about them? Come on, put some effort in. Finish the article before posting.</p>
<p>Well let us at least finish it then. When its finished consider the deletion...</p>
<p>Or, you could finish it, then re-post it.</p>
<p>I could. But id rather not.</p>
<p>Then I support the move for deletion. --Church</p>

<li>WP defn of irony: requesting observation of NPA in response to an initial comment wondering whether a personal attack has been made. To start afresh: it seems to me that characterising a mild suggestion to retain the content of the article <i>somewhere</i> (rather than assigned to oblivion entirely), as "paperwaving", is off hand; a flippant and unconstructive rejection of another's POV. And the explanation itself didn't seem very considered: "paperwaving" is the subject matter of the very article under consideration for deletion. So now that we have established that no one is making personal attacks, can you explain your vote to delete, if it is not a vote to keep? <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EObey_365f.html" title="User:Obey">Obey</a> 11:17, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">User:Stifle</a>'s initial comment was not a personal attack, unless articles have turned into persons.

<li>I'm doing some cursory research and not finding much. First, to get a patent, they'd have to make their secret public after a couple of years, which would make it not very wise to get one. They'd be most likely to use trade secret protection, but as soon as someone reverse engineered it, they're through. Secondly, most of the stuff they do has been in the public domain for a long time, everyone knows it. Third, while they could surely copyright any of their performance, they wouldn't be able to stop someone from doing the same thing unless they wrote down the steps they took and then copyrighted it; however, at that point they're giving everything away again and since it would have to fall under "choreography" most likely, which would provide them minimal protection. I can no find evidence of anything aside from patents on specific magician devices and a case where Fox was sued for copying a show on another station where a "masked magician" revealed secrets.

<li><b>Delete</b> The topic is interesting, but the article was horrible to begin with, stuffed with original research and claims that was untrue (like the silly idea that it was possible to patent a magic effect). The title of the page said "intellectual rights" but not a single word on the page dealt with intellectual rights - instead it was all about something as esoteric and irrelevant as "secrets", as if any creator in the field ever thought about "secrets" when their creations were stolen, their names stripped from the work and had to see how others passed on their work as their own. The whole piece were just fiction designed to justify the act of taking material from people that were unprotected by law to begin with. In this field, it isn't necessary with any justifications - just take the works from the creators, there's no legal obstacles in the way. First I thought I just should delete the mess myself, but I edited it instead. Didn't become much better, almost the same amount of original research as before - but at least something that reflected a reality, instead of a fiction. So yes! Delete the mess. There exists no legal intellectual rights at all for creators in this particular field of artistic expressions - and it is deceptive to have a page that seem to claim that there is --<a href="../../../t/s/t/User%7ETStone_4b90.html" title="User:TStone">TStone</a> 23:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Completely unreferenced article, almost certainly original research. No references to show that the term "Latin-celt" is notable, or indeed in use at all for any ethnic group. The article consists mainly of information on Celtic, French and Mediterranean history and people -- all of which can be found elsewhere -- mixed together with a completely unsubstantiated theory about the colouring of Irish people. It appears to be similar to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Irish_7bed.html" title="Black Irish">Black Irish</a>, although that article correctly identifies the theory as a myth arising from the common misconception that only fair/red colouring is typical to "native Irish". <i>Note: I'm not suggesting the "Black Irish" article should be deleted - although it is a myth, the term is notable.</i> --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 19:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see any possibility for clean-up: even if it's cleaned up to featured article quality, that won't make the term <i>Latin-celt</i> worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia without its notability and currency being established. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 23:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Has to be <b>delete</b>d unless sources, references and notability are established quickly.

<li><b>Delete</b> because the article's subject has dubious notability and contains assertions that constitute original research.

In addition, the extended narrative of the blog's existence is not written in a style appropriate for an encyclopedia, and should, at a minimum, be considered for clean-up.</strike> (The statements previously mentioned were revised by another editor.)Skleinjung 19:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Looking over the notability guidelines for web content again, I still fail to see how this page meets them. There is no case for it meeting requirements 2 or 3. In addition, the article fails to provide proof that what it pertains to is the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works" via links or specific references. If we discount blogs and message board posts (as the notability guidelines require), there is but a single online source I could find that even mentions the blog (<a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5325241.html" class="external free" title="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5325241.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5325241.html</a>) -- I still have not located the Time magazine article mentioned on the page. While the recent cleanup edit was a vast improvement, there are still a number of statements in the article that are not sourced and cannot be verified, such as: the number of hits ('over a million visitors'), quotes by people related to the article (Quentin thinking it was "funny", Bumble Ward's reaction to the blog), the "unnamed Canadian website design company" being asked to produce a new website for the blog, and the dubious claims that this blog was 'one of the most-read' and 'one of the most imaginative' blogs to have ever surfaced. If it is decided that the page should be kept, then these -- and other similar -- statements can be removed, but I do not think that there will be very much verifiable content left afterwards.

<p>KEEP. Look, if YOU made a similar page, would you want it crushed while still being edited? I know the author of said page. He was still working on the legitimate article. Why do you care, anyway?</p>
<p>KEEP. Personally, I don't like Maselli1 very much, but it is a matter of principle. It's HIS word. Let others know about it. Ignorance will only lead to man's downfall. And besides, are there not freedoms of speech?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - as AaronS points out, this allusion is an attemp to promote a small set of bands as a revolutionary movement on par with the NWOBHM. Besides their questionable claim to notoriety, another issue is that the term "New Wave of American Heavy Metal" has been used before, many times, to refer to many different things. <a href="http://www.zondabooks.com/titles/nwoahm/" class="external text" title="http://www.zondabooks.com/titles/nwoahm/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, for example, is a book by that title that seems to be about a much larger set of american bands. My point is, I would not consider this a neologism. Despite the nonexclusivity of these bands' claim to the label, if they are _now well-defined and well-known by this term (and I don't know if they are), the page should be kept. I would prefer an article stating that it is an allusion to the NWOBHM and that these(...) are some movements that have claimed the title. Maybe that's what we'll end up with eventually if we keep it. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 06:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - Thanks for your comment. That book seems to have been published last month, with a sales rank of 165,000 on Amazon.com. Such a recent press and such a small market (and arguably poor sales) suggest that it should not have much, if any, on the influence of such an article on Wikipedia. Furthermore, many of the bands that it lists are bands from other genres, namely <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_metal.html" title="Speed metal">speed metal</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore.html" title="Hardcore">hardcore</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/_/Nu_metal.html" title="Nu metal">nu metal</a>, and others. Hardcore and nu metal are arguable not subgenres of heavy metal. Some of the bands, like <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantera.html" title="Pantera">Pantera</a>, are hardly "new". In my experience as an avid metal fan (and resident of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, which is apparently the birthplace of the NWOAHM), I can say that, in my experience, this term is nonexistent. I first encountered it on Wikipedia. To me, that seems like a neologism.
<ul>
<li>Coincidentally, I'm also a sometimes-MA resident and a NWOBHM fan. I suspect you're right about the lack of cohesion and notability of this group of bands. I brought up the book only as an example, there are many other diverse uses on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22New+Wave+of+American+Heavy+Metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22New+Wave+of+American+Heavy+Metal%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google</a>, though I'm not saying that any of them warrent inclusion either. If the term is neogolism, it is one that has been frequently, and probably independently, rediscovered many times. <i>NWOBHM</i> is pretty easy to lampoon. -<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 07:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To add my two cents to this. NWOAHM is a neoglism term used by verying fans of verying bands that originate from America. I have personally heard it used, most notably in my experience, by people from America, to promote any american band from any genre pertaining to metal in the media's eyes. It has only ever been used in my experience, with bands that the person using it likes. I can find no information from the world wide metal community about it being an actuall movement, at all. Most all the bands on that page are metalcore, and half of them arent even that new. The whole term is neoglism in my view, and the article easily warrents deletion. P.S. Nu Metal is a genre of Metal, with Metalcore's origination being elsewhere. Metalcore can be debated, and if such debates are going to be made on where genres belong, they should be made on the dicussion page of the article for that genre. ~~Leyasu</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. Argument for deletion is that "Llull winner" is a neologism and that the article is original research. Meegs has argued that the content is valid, but that the title is wrong. Stifle has argued that this can be redirected to to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_winner.html" title="Condorcet winner">Condorcet winner</a>.</p>
<p>I will not redirect this to the Condorcet article, because without any mention of Llull there, such a redirect may be confusing to the readers, and Meigs has argued that there are subtle differences. Also a link is provided in the article as a reference, so I am not convinced that this constitutes original research either. It is true that "Llull winner" does not Google, and is therefore an unlikely search term. "Llull voting system" howeverhas been used in at least one paper, so I am calling this a <b>move</b> to Llull voting system. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:41, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A neologism that means the same thing as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_winner.html" title="Condorcet winner">Condorcet winner</a>, by the author of Condorcet-Hare Method. 0 Google hits. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">…π…ô…ôds</span><span style="color: #63f;">…π</span></a> 23:42, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I just removed a complaint I had about the article's reference, because the reference turns out to be valid. Unfortunately, I did it on a computer where my girlfriend <a href="../../../c/m/o/User%7ECmouse_943a.html" title="User:Cmouse">Cmouse</a> was logged in. So this isn't a case of my comment being randomly altered by someone else. Please note that, ordinarily, Cmouse and I are different people. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">…π…ô…ôds</span><span style="color: #63f;">…π</span></a> 00:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are no hits for the exact title, so perhaps the article should be renamed, but the article is valuable and verifiable. In addition to the reference, you get lots of relevant hits about his voting system searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Llull+voting&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Llull+voting&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Llull + voting</a>. <i><b>√ó</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 04:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It means the <b>same thing</b> as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_winner.html" title="Condorcet winner">Condorcet winner</a>, as far as I can tell, and no matter what it means, it's original terminology that Wikipedia should not be used to promote. Also, <i>of course</i> you get hits when you look up Llull and voting; he's the earliest known voting theorist. Naming your original research after a notable person like Llull does not make it notable itself. Such an argument was made and withdrawn by someone at Condorcet-Hare Method, an article by the same author. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">…π…ô…ôds</span><span style="color: #63f;">…π</span></a> 07:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a description of a voting scheme whose winner satisfies the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_criterion.html" title="Condorcet criterion">Condorcet criterion</a>, but the system itself includes number of features (e.g. all-pairs voting vs. voting with a single ranking and allowing indifference between a pair candidates) that are not necessarily present in other systems fitting the criterion. As I said, I'd prefer to rename and keep the article about this system as it is notable and based on secondary sources, but I'll go-along with a merge (&amp; condensation) to any of several destinations including <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Llull_2f00.html" title="Ramon Llull">Ramon Llull</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condorcet_criterion.html" title="Condorcet criterion">Condorcet criterion</a>. <i><b>√ó</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 15:18, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Regardless of how much you like it, it's original research being used to define a neologism, which is not allowed on Wikipedia. The secondary source does not support the definition, it is only used in the article to cite the fact that Llull came up with the Condorcet criterion before Condorcet did (which is mentioned at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_system.html" title="Voting system">Voting system</a>). The fact that some random guy named a definition that nobody else on the Internet uses after Llull should not be part of the article on <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Llull_2f00.html" title="Ramon Llull">Ramon Llull</a>. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">…π…ô…ôds</span><span style="color: #63f;">…π</span></a> 17:17, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I do not want to keep the title which is an original creation.

<p>If the wiki article for <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyle_Miller_fdb1.html" title="Kyle Miller">Kyle Miller</a> can exist without a problem, there is no reason this article cannot exist as the fame is just as much (and if not Jason Lake's is more). Team Complexity is just as famous as <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>, Team Complexity has been featured in TV shows, magazines, etc just as <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_3D_82e5.html" title="Team 3D">Team 3D</a>. As this is the case, if the wiki article <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyle_Miller_fdb1.html" title="Kyle Miller">Kyle Miller</a> can exist without deletion, then Jason Lake should exist as well.
