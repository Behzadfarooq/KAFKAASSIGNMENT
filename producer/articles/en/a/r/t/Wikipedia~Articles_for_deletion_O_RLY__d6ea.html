<li><b>Keep for Academia</b> I am currently using this article in my paper for Sociolingustics in my discussion on Language of the Internet, and that alone I feel suffices for reasons to keep this article. It contains information pertainate to my research. Nearly all article are prone to vandalism and that is not sufficient grounds on which to remove an article. As for those who claim it as unencyclopedic, I ask that you please give me your definition of encyclopedic. If you mean something that would someday appear in a professionally published encyclopedia, then I'm afraid I disagree with you on the premise of Wikipedia. The nature of internet hypertext over print is that it allows for a much larger base of information, so while this information would not be pertainate enough to justify listing in a printed medium, it contains relevant information that seekers of knowledge would care to know. As for the person who claimed that there is no such thing as internet culture, I beg to differ. Even among professional circles it is recognized that there is such a thing as internet culture. I may not be a lingustics major, and I'm taking this class for fun, but I do know enough to claim that the internet does have a culture, and that the language used within the internet does have a history. Slang has literary significance just like any other language feature, and that of the internet is no exception. If you're really desparate for proof that I really am using this for my paper, look up Professor S. Dart at Macalester College a few weeks from now after I turn in my paper and ask if I discussed O RLY. --D. Ly 23:35 Dec 18 2005 (CST) <small>This user's third edit.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Wikipedia is genius because it providers a pretty reliable place where everyone can share knowledge or use it. Most of it is kept in real time and even if you have the littlest knowledge which may seem ridicolous and would never be ever needed, you can contribute. Since an encylopedia should cover pop culture, and this word is part of the rising Internet phenomenom, it should be kept as it can be useful to someone who is doing a report on the ever expanding and changing cyberworld. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandBoxer_f4c8.html" title="User:SandBoxer">SandBoxer</a> 23:14, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>O KEEP</b> wheres the vote botten, it needs to be expanded</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like others, I came here specifically looking for this entry. Few would say that internet memes represent a high point in modern culture but they nonetheless form part of the social background of the medium. --<a href="../../../m/i/z/User%7EMizake_c9f1.html" title="User:Mizake">Mizake</a> 12:44, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Where would people go to find out what these kind of, admittedly obscure, pop-culture references actually mean, if not WikiPedia? It is notable, and unlike other sources, the information listed; i.e. origin, meaning, history/evolution is encyclopedic. It may be a insignificant fad, but if it had no listing, how would you know?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with <a href="../../../m/i/z/User%7EMizake_c9f1.html" title="User:Mizake">Mizake</a>, this is a wonderful article on an obscure subject. This is one of the key components of Wikipedia, IMO. Not only informative, but a bit wacky.--<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroptone_9e45.html" title="User:Droptone">droptone</a> 14:47, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The meme is established and wide spread. It gets an extremely high number of hits on google and is thus notable. The article is appropriately sourced and is worthy of inclusion. — <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalerin_2c97.html" title="User:Falerin">Falerin</a><sup>&lt;<a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalerin_31b4.html" title="User talk:Falerin"><b>talk</b></a>&gt;,&lt;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Falerin_21b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Falerin"><b>contrib</b></a>&gt;</sup> 18:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As you guys can probably tell this is a really biased vote. I guarantee you most of the "Keeps" are users from YTMND. Let a group of admins decide on what to do with this. It's just silly. --Tykell 20:42, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's always fun to have your motives and background second guessed by someone who knows nothing about you. I've not cast aspersions on the motives of the 'Delete' voters, but then my interpretation of the vote here was not quite so cynical. <small>Yeah, that comment annoyed me.

<li><b>Keep</b> (Delete?! NO WAI!) This doesn't seem to violate any policies or anything... Besides, it's a useful article with helpful information! Think about forum newbies asking what this O RLY owl people keep talking about is- This really is the ONLY really GOOD source on the topic. <a href="../../../l/l/a/User%7ELlamapalooza87_62e0.html" title="User:Llamapalooza87">llamapalooza87</a> 22:03, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Usage is currently widespread enough to be worth coverage. If that changes, we can always re-evaluate the situation later, as others have noted in earlier votes. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 22:38, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It can be hard for those who only see the end products to figure out how trends, jokes, memes, etc. begin (Ever missed an episode of the Simpsons and subsequently failed to get a reference everyone else did?)- it's good to have an explanation. And it's a perfectly cromulent article. -- <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake_Nelson_33c5.html" title="User:Jake Nelson">Jake</a> 00:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, please. Someone just said that in an internet forum another day, and I had no idea wath it meant. Keep please.</b> 22 December 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The O Rly owl rocks. When future generations come to the internet, shouldn't they be allowed to do research on what an "O Rly" owl is?</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b> -- I fail to see the justification in whimsically deleting articles arbitrarily declared to be unencyclopaedic at the spontaneous and unsubstantiated decision of a small but loud group of misanthropes who do not understand the relevance of and importance of documenting the history and evolution of the internet. The O RLY owl is an important piece in the aforementioned history and evolution, and therefore ought to remain. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_Parnell_0923.html" title="User:Dan Parnell">Lumbergh</a> 04:56, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article should be kept, O RLY is a quickly growing internet meme and the phrase has been around for quite some time.
