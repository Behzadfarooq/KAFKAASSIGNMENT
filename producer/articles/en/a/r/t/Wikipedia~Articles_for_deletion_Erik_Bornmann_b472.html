<li><b>Neutral</b>: Bornmann is certainly notable for his involvement in the Liberal Party in BC, the public relations industry in BC and the Paul Martin Liberal Leadership Campaign. However it is obvious that this page was first created by persons interested posting libelous information about Bornmann with a clear view to discrediting him in advance of the criminal trial where he is expected to testify on behalf of the Crown. The continuous and malicious posts of one or two posters has compelled a number of us to return to this page on a regular basis to make corrections. At this point it is fruitless to debate who started deleting what first, but it is safe to say that the ensuing discourse has very much resembled that seen on many other pages profiling politically active persons. While others may have different ideas I suggest that the neutral Bornmann page, which was locked for editting by a previous Admin in the spring, be reposted and again locked for editting (maybe until after the trial) or that the page be deleted. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERascalpatrol_d018.html" title="User:Rascalpatrol">rascalpatrol</a> 21:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see no value in this entry until this person and his testimony shows significant importance and usefulness in relation to the other convicting evidence. User:The Teacher 101 18:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Comment</b> Both "The Teacher 101" and "Titus Pollo" have only contributed to <i>this page</i> and have no other presence in Wikipedia. This is typical of the manipulation of information by SPAs which has plagued the Bornmann page. I have been trying to shorten my vote/statement as it's fairly lengthy but may just post it in its entirety, as it explores the misleading and false claims made by such SPAs in the history of this page, and I do not put it past other supporters of Mr. Bornmann to create Wiki accounts to vote in this process <i>and for no other reason</i>, as The Teacher 101 and Titus Pollo have done. Such votes should be discounted as irrelevant. Deletion would only serve the interests of those who wish to conceal the record of information manipulation and censorship by covering-up their activities in undermining Wikipedia's integrity and content by systemic vandalism and POV opinionating.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Further comment</b> It's worth mentioning that the political party Mr. Bornmann belongs to is <i>well-known</i> for bulk membership drives in order to advance candidacies and otherwise manipulate party democratic processes. That they would seek to do the same on Wikipedia - signing up new members in order to influence a vote (see towards the end of <a href="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>- comes as no surprise to me at all.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, Restore, and Protect</b> This article’s uncensored, un-neutralized comments constitute<b>d</b> valid encyclopedia content regarding an important current legal case and political scandal which is in the news on a regular basis. I feel the suggestions to delete are redirect are based in the manipulated, "neutralized" content (to use rascalpatrol’s term) of its current status. I also feel rascalpatrol’s post above is manipulative and deceptive, as the materials he and others deleted from the page were not "libelous" but are immune from defamation proceedings by dint of being from public documents (police reports/press releases, court documents, news copy) (see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel#Privilege_and_malice" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel#Privilege_and_malice" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Issues of core wiki principles – non-censorship and freedom of speech as well as civility and other principals linked/appended below – should be critical in deliberating the value and survival of this article and those connected to it. It is not incidental that the "neutralizing" camp here has counterparts on <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">BC Legislature Raids</a> who regularly work to keep Mr. Bornmann’s name from <i>that</i> article as well, or indeed any significant and already well-publicized and well-documented details currently made vague or left out entirely, as well as entirely valid media links and cites which were deleted by the Bornmann faction (on the basis that, in one case, the author belonged to a different political party). The allegation that occurs repeatedly in <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EErik_Bornmann_9b71.html" title="Talk:Erik Bornmann">Talk:Erik Bornmann</a> and in edit histories of that page and its article is that a concerted effort is being made to discredit Mr. Bornmann, which is entirely unfounded, as are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Crown_Witness" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Crown_Witness" rel="nofollow">allegations by his supporters/promoters in the talk page that those attempting to add relevant materials are in league with “those criminaly charged” (sic)</a>, when in the course of posts on the talkpage rascalpatrol (now deleted, or hidden in deleted materials) describe themslves as a group of people who are actively seeking to patrol and “neutralize” the article. There is a fine line between neutralization and censorship, but "neutralization" as used by rascalpatrol <i>et al.</i> means nothing like what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is supposed to mean in Wiki; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> can be observed so long as only materials in police documents, court evidence etc or concerning the public interest are what’s there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To delete this article on the grounds that it (currently) contains nothing worthwhile would be to unwittingly collaborate with a campaign of active and admitted censorship of material that, although unbeknownst to you outside of BC, concerns the public interest and is not a personal matter as rascalpatrol and others maintain that it is. Redirecting it to <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">BC Legislature Raids</a> is currently a non-starter partly because that article has <i>also</i> been persistently "neutralized" (as rascalpatrol puts it) by supporters of Mr. Bornmann, and also because each of the principal players in the case will (eventually) have as detailed an account here as well.. Admittedly Mr. Bornmann is and was not an elected official as with other political bios, but he is still a prominent party supporter/activist as well as a corporate lobbyist involved with the sale of public assets and with companies doing business with the government – and the sale of assets in question (the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_corporation.html" title="Crown corporation">Crown-owned</a> <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Rail_8b62.html" title="BC Rail">BC Rail</a> was eventually sold to American-owned <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railways_eeab.html" title="Canadian National Railways">Canadian National Railways</a>, not Mr. Bormann's client <a href="../../../o/m/n/OmniTRAX_b004.html" title="OmniTRAX">OmniTRAX</a>) was and is a highly controversial sale the debate over which is still on the public agenda. Mr. Bornmann is a public figure whether he wants to be or not!! Backroom politics <i>is still politics</i>. Other lobbyists and party organizers in the US and Canada and other countries have valid Wiki articles that have not (always) been so "massaged" and worked-over.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The entire scandal is also framed by <a href="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" class="external text" title="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" rel="nofollow">mounting allegations of a cover-up</a>. The mutilation of the Bornmann article which has resulted in the circumstance of this AFD has greater consequences which should be considered in this light: i.e. deletion would be an unwitting cooperation with politically partisan cover-up efforts and "information washing" as much as tolerating the existing "neutralized" version of the page. It is not only Mr. Bornmann’s reputation that’s at stake here, it’s a matter of the public record and of civil democracy. Only POV material on Mr. Bornmann should be deleted (including the flummery that’s there now) - but NPOV <i>citable</i> material should be restored, <i>and protected</i>. Rascalpatrol and his allies also repeatedly and <i>falsely</i> alleged I am a returnee from previous edit wars on the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96914601&amp;oldid=96858857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96914601&amp;oldid=96858857" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and have throughout the history of the page deleted talkpage comments by their opponents (including the section linked in the second reference just previous, which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96915014&amp;oldid=96861110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96915014&amp;oldid=96861110" rel="nofollow">bulk deletion by Randy3</a> with the PAIN comment "a mind is an awful thing to loose" (sic), and this deletion was discussed approvingly and further disparaging comments made by Randy3, another Bornmann supporter or "patroller" like rascalpatrol and SaintNickIX and JGGardiner) claiming that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" rel="nofollow">I am just a returned former opponent in the page</a> (along with another disparaging comment), which is quite ridiculous and can be proven by an examination of my User Contributions as to the date I first edited the article, and admins could confirm that my IP address has not contributed to that article under any other alias. You'd think from my writing style they'd know that's not the case!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>NB: Deletion of this article will result in destruction of the edit history, which documents what constitutes a history of active and deliberate censorship, media muzzling and cover-up of the broader scandal surrounding the subject of this article by accomplices and allies of same – the story of the cover-up is itself becoming part of the <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">Ledgegate scandal</a>, and the attempts to censor this and related webpages can only be seen as part of that cover-up. Any deletion will, in effect, serve as part of the cover-up effort every bit as much as the euhemerization and bowdlerization of this article’s contents to its current state of flummery and irrelevance. The repeated deletions of any newscopy related to the case and their replacement by Mr. Bornmanns’ personal photo gallery speaks volumes as to the priorities and ethics of those who have been “patrolling” and “neutralizing” this page.

<li><b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a></b> Wikipedia is not a place to hold grudges, import personal conflicts, or nurture hatred or fear. Making personal battles out of Wikipedia discussions goes directly against our policies and goals. Every user is expected to interact with others civilly, calmly, and in a spirit of cooperation. Do not insult, harass, or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement. Rather, approach the matter intelligently and engage in polite discussion. If a user acts uncivilly, uncalmly, uncooperatively, insultingly, harassingly, or intimidatingly toward you, this does not give you an excuse to do the same in retaliation. Either respond solely to the factual points brought forward and ignore its objectionable flavoring, or ignore the relevant message entirely.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DEMOCRACY" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a></b> Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary method of determining consensus is discussion, not voting. Although editors occasionally use straw polls in an attempt to test for consensus, polls or surveys may actually impede rather than assist discussion. They should be used with caution, if at all, and may not be treated as binding.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Skookum1 should also be aware that wikipedia is not a soap box or news blog. The problem with many of the posts to this site, including those of Skookum1, is that they are simply incorrect. Many have been libelous. Sourcing to political blogs is NOT verification. As for whether Skookum is a person with an interest in the BC Rail criminal trial, the length and tone of his contribution above speaks for itself. Wikipedia should not be a forum for parties embroiled in a criminal trial. Delete this page with no redirect. --Omar Jack 00:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I am not soapboxing - I am standing up for genuinely NPOV principles and for "the right of the the public to know"; I do not have a partisan affiliation, unlike the SPAs who have perpetrated this fiasco, and only intervened in the interests of fairness and open information because of my interest in fully covering BC political history in Wikipedia, as part of my extensive contributions in history, geography, and biography as well as in many other areas of interest - I have over <b>12,000 edits</b> in Wikipedia and entire and extensive bodies of infrastructure/topic content are due to my participation. Omar Jack, rascalpatrol et al. have done nothing to contribute to Wikipedia other than violating several of the above-cited Wikipedia principles. This is not a partisan cause; it is a case involving open democracy and freedom of information, being painted by those seeking to conceal it as if it were simply a personal matter, and they regularly denounce anyone disagreeing with them with "soapboxing" and worse. The insinuation in Omar Jack's post above that "I am a person with an interest in the BC Rail trial", as if I were another principal or player in the case, is <b>outrageous</b>, as even more is <i>Wikipedia should not be a forum for parties embroiled in a criminal trial</i> - these are clear examples the <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> this cadre have perpetrated in the article's talk page and thoughout the edit comments of the article. It also makes a mockery of their various allegations that those seeking to present a complete article are indulging in slander and libel, as Omar Jack's comments clearly fall into that category (since I am not a party "embroiled in a criminal trial". Why should a citizen not be interested in the suspect sale of BC Rail and the police reports which document Mr. Bornmann's own admitted attempt to influence it on behalf of OmniTRAX? I am not a person "of interest" as Omar Jack implies (without directly saying so): I am citizen wanting the public record concerning these events, of which Wikipedia is a part, to be full and complete.

If you disagree with me, just say so. I think my post is rather uncontroversial, especially for this article.

Am I the only one who sees the hypocrisy of this user lecturing this discussion on the inappropriateness of using wikipedia as a battleground? I post on this page because it appears the only way to deal with the high volume of FALSE and OPINION information routinely added by a very small number of posters (Skookum1 included).

<li><b>Comment</b> As much as I'm tempted to not reply, given the absurdity of your counter-allegations, but speaking of "false" your allegation/insinuation above that I am one of the charged in the trial in question is <b>very offensive</b> and utterly <b>false</b>. It is not even opinion, it is <i>cant</i> and typical of the paranoid behaviour of the Bornmannite faction on the article's talkpage and in its edit history comments. It is also clear from the response of the other Wikipedians above that I am not the only one who wants to see this article dealt with properly, instead of shuffled off into the dustbin as you want it to be. You're not saving face at this point, you're embarrassing yourself. This is really getting tiresome; I'm not the first regular Wikipedian to work on this page, just the first to not give up when it became very evident that a "very small number of posters" (yourself included) have been attacking anyone who dares disagree with your version of what the article's content should be.

<li><b>Delete</b>: My two cents: the fact that "Skookum1" wrote <i>"It's worth mentioning that the political party Mr. Bornmann belongs to is well-known for bulk membership drives in order to advance candidacies and otherwise manipulate party democratic processes."</i> just shows how partisan his intent is. This is the Liberal Party we're talking about, not some obscure anti-democratic entity. Clearly the entry/profile of this one organizer is being used to tar the Liberal party and tie it to scandal rather than provide insight on relevant issues. The fact that after three years there are no entries for anyone else involved in this raid - including the people acutally charged - highlights the fact that this whole entry should be scrapped.

Are you serious? <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Globe_and_Mail_a135.html" title="The Globe and Mail">The Globe and Mail</a> as quoted above says, "..at the centre of one of the most riveting events in British Columbia's political history...". Oh PS The Globe and Mail is Canada's most widely read newspaper. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELangara_College_ac2a.html" title="User:Langara College">Langara College</a> 03:42, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Notable subject. Significant additional sourcing has been done since the initiation of this debate. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 07:34, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm a regular at this page. The back and forth is silly. Though I'm inclined to vote Keep, because the topic is as relevant as many other wikipedia bios, there is almost no way of verifying most, if not all, of what is written. The continued use of newspaper columns and blogs as sources is unacceptable. Until we have something conrete the page should go. --Randy3 05:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)<small>— Randy3 (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandy3_2e38.html" title="User talk:Randy3">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Randy3_f2ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Randy3">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Umm.. newspaper reports <i>are</i> reliable sources. CBC, CTV, Canadian Press, Globe and Mail -- all the major new outlets in the country have covered this story, 782 google hits can't be wrong. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 07:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Umm.. google hits??? an indication of truthfulness??? where/did you go to school? This is an encyclopedia, not a a newspaper. --Randy3 11:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
