<li>Indeed, they are not analogous.

<li>Likely according to both. A fifteen year old cartoon pales in cultural importance compared to the most important Western work of the past 2000 years. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 16:26 (UTC)

<li>But does a 20 minute episode of a 15 year old cartoon have less signicance than just 3 lines of a genealogy (e.g. <a href="../../../9/_/_/Matthew_1%7E9.html" title="Matthew 1:9">Matthew 1:9</a>, and if so, why? <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 16:34 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Well, the articles on Simpsons episodes appear not to focus on the scholarly commentary on the episode, wheras these do, which leads me to believe that the scholarly interest in Gospel verses is higher than scholarly interest in Simpsons episodes. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 16:47 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Tell me, how much time has been given between the simpsons episodes appearance, and the articles creation? There is plenty of time for 2000 years worth of scholarly content to be added. The bible has had 2000 years already. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 17:04 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okay, in 2000 years we can compare again, and maybe it will be the Simpsons that is the scriptural basis for the world's largest religion. Until then, it appears to be the Gospel of Matthew that has attracted the preponderance of scholarly analysis and cultural interpretation. It may be a systemic bias of Wikipedia that we have to judge things based on how they are today rather than how they will be two millenia in the future, but we'll have to live with that. (I'd also point out that claims that a single Simpsons episode is not analogous to a verse of a book are somewhat misleading. There are ~300 Simpsons episodes and ~1000 verses in Matthew, and 1/1000 and 1/300 are really not that different in terms of granularity.) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 19:08 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just being part of the <i>world's largest religion</i> <b>does not</b> automatically make verses <b>individually</b> notable. Also, please avoid <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>, there may be 300 simpsons episodes, and 1000 verses in Matthew, but there are about 30,000 verses of the bible, and the simpsons is in a 1:100 ratio here, comparable only with chapters.<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 20:02 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>; that is quite clearly not it. Moreover, you have ignored my point, that the amount of scholarly research on (and cultural and historical interest in) an average Gospel verse far exceeds that on an average Simpsons episode. Nor, you will note, have I made a case that every verse in the Bible deserves an article. I will deal with that with the time comes. You have nominated 25 verses for deletion, all of which are of above average importance. In any case, I've devoted about as much time as I care to this debate (which seems headed toward an unsurprising no consensus). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 20:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>False dichotomy is a situation in which one side inaccurately (i.e. false) alleges that there is a choice between two options (a dichotomy). <i>Di-chotomy</i> means <i>two options</i>. A <i>false dichotomy</i> is a situation in which it is not accurate to state that the two options given are the case, i.e. the dichotomy is false. I am a linguist, trust me on this. The option you give as second option is not an accurate representation of the situation, therefore it is a false dichotomy. This VfD is about whether it is right for every single Bible verse to have an article or not. If you do not think that they should, then you must vote to either <b>merge or delete</b>, to accurately represent that opinion. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 20:28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, I understand this. I would challenge you to present the two options I presented as exclusive.</li>
<li>No, this is not a VFD on that issue, as much as you might like it to be. For one thing, assuming these articles are deleted, it would not affect, say, <a href="../../../1/_/_/Matthew_2%7E1.html" title="Matthew 2:1">Matthew 2:1</a>. Moreover, articles on these very verses could be recreated if they had different content. No vote here will set a policy against the creation of individual Bible verses. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 20:59 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You may like to think that, but I assure you that that is not accurate. The recreation of VfD'd articles is strongly frowned upon and such recreations can be deleted on sight. The reason for deletion in this case would explicitely be the existance of the article all-together, and not their content, which would be merged elsewhere. Consequently, creating the article would contradict such a result from this VfD, and thus be a delete-on-sight instance. There is a good reason for not putting Matthew 2:1 etc. up for deletion in this VfD - so that we can get all the silly paper-thin arguments that disguise ideological votes out of the way first. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 22:30 (UTC)</li>

<li>My concern is that such articles as these are created by people whose religious ideology says that the bible is so significant that even every word in it deserves an article of its own. I believe Wikipedia should consider items significant of mention only if they are academically so. I do not see people offering <b>anywhere</b> courses about Matthew 1:2, or standard courses containing lectures solely about Matthew 1:7. This is, in my view, because they are not notable enough.</li>
<li>Academics do find some verses important, such as <a href="../../../1/6/_/Mark%7E16.html" title="Mark:16">Mark:16</a> and <a href="../../../2/1/_/John%7E21.html" title="John:21">John:21</a>, but I don't know of any serious scholar who thinks every single verse in the bible is worthy of note.</li>
<li>It strikes me that creating such articles is an attempt to turn a section of Wikipedia into an online bible. Wikipedia is not the bible, it is an encyclopedia. Nor should Wikipedia be a bible commentary.</li>
<li>Collectively, these articles also constitute a serious copyvio, as they would, in total, duplicate the entire <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>, <b>and</b> the other text that is in them (I forget which). To avoid this copyvio, you would need to not have a significant portion of the text within wikipedia, but this is totally unavoidable if we have an article on every single verse. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 19:54 (UTC)

<li>I think you are underestimating how well covered the Bible is by scholars. My library alone has some 350 commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew. Using only a half dozen of these I have found something write about every one of the first eighty verses.

<li>The answer to this is the great extent of scholarly work on each particular verse.

<li>I think the reason why some verses have been kept and others deleted is quality. Bible verses that have been deleted have often been low-quality articles (e.g. contained no real information, were too original-researchy, etc.). Bible verses of similar quality to Matthew 1:x have all been kept on three separate occasions; see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_20%7E16_8122.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_20_56c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20</a>, and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Matthew_2%7E16_a415.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 2:16">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Matthew 2:16</a>. As to whether all verses are notable, I don't think that they all are. However, lack of notability is not a reason for deletion. According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, the solution is to merge and redirect to another article (which is how I voted in the VfDs linked immediately above). Having said that, these articles are probably long enough that, for example, the first seventeen are likely better as separate articles than as a monster Matthew 1:1-17. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 2 July 2005 16:50 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: since most of us can agree that some bible verses are more significant/notable/important/whatever than others, it seems it would make sense to start with those, rather than just going chronolgically here. I seriously doubt we're going to see 30,000+ articles on these (to use someone else's figures; I assume they're basically accurate) so we might as well get the important ones first. Likewise I think it would make sense to have an article on the each chapter before we start working on the verse, and see what we can cover that way. The way we're going I see us having some chapters of the Bible with an article on each word, while others have no article or a stub like <i>Lambastatians is a book from the Bible</i> (yes I made up my own book for an example, don't give me crap about it). Wikipedia is inconsistent, but it needn't be <i>that</i> inconsistent. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 1 July 2005 22:10 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. No vote yet because I want to sleep on this one, but I just wanted to say that I'm appalled at the suggestion that we should have to identify ourselves by our religious persuasion to have an opinion about how a secular encyclopedia should be organized. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 1 July 2005 23:05 (UTC)

<li>It wasn't a compulsion, I was curious as to whether there was systemic bias on VfD (in general), which would, of course, be a serious problem (i.e. VfDs leading to inappropriate decisions which would not be made in a less systemically biased environment). Indicating religious background helps to identify whether this is the case or not when the vote is finally tallied. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 1 July 2005 23:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be utterly meaningless information unless you <i>assume</i> bias. If a Christian votes keep or an athiest votes delete, how could you possibly know if they were for reasons of religious bias as opposed to a logical decision about how to construct an encyclopedia? <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 2 July 2005 00:21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was for cumularive purposes, not individual, if there is a <b>statistically significant</b> difference between the majority (or non-Majority) of Keep votes when you include Christian votes (i.e. normal voting procedure), and the majority (or non-Majority) of Keep votes when you don't, then this would indicate a systemic bias. In a neutral environment, in a large sample size, such as here, there should be no such significant difference, I wish to know if this is the case. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 08:25 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The obvious disadvantage is that it would not tell us what kind of systemic bias we're looking at. Nor is the sample likely to be large enough to meaningfully extrapolate from moderate percentage differences. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 16:26 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Assuming you could even get a sufficently large sample size from this vfd discussion, which I doubt, would you distinguish between practicing and non-practicing Christians? Protestants and Catholics and Eastern Orthodox? Many non or former Christians exhibit a strong anti-Christian bias, are you concerned about this as well or just the bias behind Christian votes? <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 2 July 2005 17:37 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would only be concerned if it was statistically significant. What qualifies as statistically significant is dependant on the sample size (and mean, and standard deviation, although that isn't so applicable here). <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 19:59 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should also be pointed out that by asking only keep voters to indicate if they are Christian, you eliminate any chance to extrapolate statistical data from the information. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 2 20:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I can extrapolate whether there is a Christian systemic bias (as opposed to <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercorrection.html" title="Hypercorrection">hypercorrection</a>), this is the relevant bias that Wikipedia's demographic suggests would exist if any (limited geographic scope, and political bias are not really plausibly going to make a difference to the result). <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 2 July 2005 20:49 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No, the point is not that you are focusing only on the issue of Christianity, but that you are asking the question only of keep voters: "indicate, if you wish the articles to be kept, whether you are a christian." Because you would know nothing about the delete (and merge) voters, it would be difficult to extrapolate anything useful about the overall behavious without making major, probably weak assumptions about that unknown portion of the population. Such assumptions would be especially unjustified given that you had the chance to garner that data directly, but chose not to. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 2005 July 3 01:31 (UTC)

<li>A majority of the delete vote being Christian editors voting to attack the principle that all bible verses are intrinsically noteworthy is not a pro-Christian systemic-bias. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 17:57 (UTC)</li>

As a general priciple, individual verses of the Bible, or any religious text, do <i>not</i> deserve individual encyclopaedia articles. Notes on individual lines of a religious text is <i>not</i> exegesis, as is claimed by some editors. It is <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annotation.html" title="Annotation">annotation</a>, the sort of thing that one finds in a Study Bible, where every verse has footnotes. Wikibooks has an <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Annotated_texts_bookshelf" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Annotated_texts_bookshelf">Annotated texts bookshelf</a> that is just crying out for an Annotated Bible, if you want to write one. Annotated versions of books do not an encyclopaedia make, however. In contrast to book annotation such as these articles, <i>encyclopaedic</i> coverage of the Gospels would involve writing articles such as <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, Birth of Jesus Christ, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_talents.html" title="Parable of the talents">Parable of the talents</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_at_the_Temple_35d1.html" title="Jesus at the Temple">Jesus at the Temple</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Good_Samaritan_44bc.html" title="The Good Samaritan">The Good Samaritan</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Good_Shepherd_a272.html" title="The Good Shepherd">The Good Shepherd</a>, The Temptation of Jesus, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wedding_Feast_at_Cana_eea8.html" title="The Wedding Feast at Cana">The Wedding Feast at Cana</a>, and all of the other (mainly red) links at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Testament_stories_e0ab.html" title="List of New Testament stories">List of New Testament stories</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bible_stories_f3a5.html" title="List of Bible stories">List of Bible stories</a>. A proper structure would continue the same, and fill in those redlinks. Treating verses by <i>groups</i>, dealing with specific stories and narratives, sometimes spanning multiple chapters (e.g. <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>) is, after all, what most secondary sources actually do, and thus what Wikipedia, the tertiary source, should do too.
<p>And need I mention <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:naming conventions (common names)</a>? These parts of the Bible are <i>not</i> commonly known by their chapter and verse numbers. Most of the people who know them probably couldn't even tell you the chapter and verse numbers. They are commonly known by their story names, such as the "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_lost_sheep.html" title="Parable of the lost sheep">Parable of the lost sheep</a>".</p>

<li>I disagree with this scheme. You may not realize it, but there is actually a fair bit of controversy over how the text should be divided. For instance some, such as <a href="../../../w/2E/f/W.F._Albright_f347.html" title="W.F. Albright">W.F. Albright</a>, and Alexander Jones contend that <a href="../../../1/7/_/Matthew_4%7E17.html" title="Matthew 4:17">Matthew 4:17</a> is the end of the introduction to the ministry, and thus a summary of his entire preaching. Others, such as David Hill and T.S. France, see it as the beginning of the section about the disciples, and thus a far more focused piece of text. We discussed making arbitrary divisions when the project was begun at <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_20%7E16_bd72.html" title="Talk:John 20:16">Talk:John 20:16</a> but it was decided that we should avoid making up our own divisions because of the inevitable conflict and confusion that would result. Also many of these pages would be huge. <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a> is already quite lengthy and the section in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> is over 50kb, not to mention that there is another genealogy in Luke that is about twice as long that also needs to be covered in the article. Also I have so far only included a small fraction of the total information that should be given on each verse, e.g. I have virtually nothing on pre-modern, Eastern Orthodox, Feminist, LDS, or Islamic biblical criticism. Since I do not known Greek or Hebrew there is virtually nothing on the translation issues, about which there is a vast literature. Moreover almost every other reference work goes verse by verse, so I see no reason why we shouldn't. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 2, 2005 01:14 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The controversy with Matthew 4:17 that you describe is not the problem that you purport it to be. Beginning of Jesus' Ministry can simply state that some people think that it includes Matthew 4:17 whilst others do not, and explain the arguments. Problem solved.
<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a> is <i>not</i> quite lengthy. It's quite short (7 paragraphs plus a table). There's more than enough room for the text of the articles listed above to be merged into it, <i>especially</i> if the inclusion of primary source material in the originals is done away with by the merge, as it should be. (And note that the references, being identical, would not contribute to the size of a merged article as much as they contribute to the size of a collection of individual verse articles.) The series of Michelangelo paintings would also make much more sense.</p>
<p>The argument that "many of the pages would be huge" is belied by the fact that, as several editors have noted here, several of these articles have no content at all apart from primary source material.</p>
<p>The size of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> is irrelevant. I didn't suggest merging into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a>.</p>
<p>(Also note that <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> also includes primary source material, which it shouldn't. If you had followed <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a>, but simply linked to Wikisource where the primary source material belongs <i>and is</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> <i>would not be</i> "over 50KiB". You've created that problem by not following the guideline. It also includes text that would have been a start to The Birth of Jesus, which would have re-coloured a redlink blue at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bible_stories_f3a5.html" title="List of Bible stories">List of Bible stories</a> and fleshed out the existing encyclopaedic structure instead of creating more annotated book content.)</p>
<p><i>almost every other reference work goes verse by verse</i> — If that were true, which it isn't, there wouldn't be the "controversy over how the text should be divided" that you state that there is, as no-one would be dividing the text up into groups of verses. People <i>do</i> group verses. It would be daft not to. Treating the verses that form the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a> as just individual verses without referring to one another for context would make little sense. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 2005-07-02 01:57:14 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The universal standard in scholarly works is to go verse by verse when doing a detailed commentary. The current chapter divisions of the Bible were not added until the 13th century, and attempting to show how the author of Matthew intended his narrative to be divided is an important area of study. Going verse by verse does not preclude positing methods of grouping them. These groupings can also get quite complicated. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Brown_78be.html" title="Raymond E. Brown">Raymond E. Brown</a>, for instance argues that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_20.html" title="John 20">John 20</a>:2-10 is one section inserted in the middle of John 20:1,11-19. Of course many other scholars reject Brown's view and there are several other schemes for dividing John 20.
<p>I was not stating that the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a> article is over 50kb, I was stating that the verse articles on the genealogy when added together are over 50kb. I'm sorry for not being should have been clearer. The merged pages you are proposing would be huge, especially since a number of the topics you thought were uncovered actually do have substantial articles. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_of_Jesus_9d9f.html" title="Resurrection of Jesus">Resurrection of Jesus</a> is already 29kb and could no accommodate the content in the commentary on John, much less the unwritten information on the three other Gospels. Also your statement that "several of these articles have no content at all apart from primary source material" is totally false.</p>
<p>I fully agree that topics like the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temptation_of_Jesus_585b.html" title="Temptation of Jesus">Temptation of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_of_Jesus_b896.html" title="Baptism of Jesus">Baptism of Jesus</a> are deserving of articles, but the content of them would be quite distinct from the verse pages. For instance, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Jerome_a575.html" title="St. Jerome">St. Jerome</a>'s mistranslation of <a href="../../../2/_/_/Matthew_3%7E2.html" title="Matthew 3:2">Matthew 3:2</a> has pretty much nothing to do with the Baptism, but is still hugely important to Christian history. Similarly that <a href="../../../1/1/_/Matthew_2%7E11.html" title="Matthew 2:11">Matthew 2:11</a> mentions that Mary and Joseph were living in a house has nothing to do with the Magi, but is again important information. The general articles should, and those that exist generally do, give a summary of the verse articles and an indication of which verses in each Gospel cover the subject, the extra-scriptural information on the subject; and the differences and disagreements between the various Gospel accounts. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> July 2, 2005 06:38 (UTC)</p>

<li>Duh. I yam stoopid. My apologies for not checking on the status of the World English Bible. Knuth's book is NOT about <i>Matthew</i> 3:16. It's about <b>3:16</b>. He decided to study the Bible by using a sort of "stratified random sample" technique. He decided to make a close personal study of every verse in the Bible that is numbered 3:16. He acknowledged choosing 3:16 in order to be certain that his sample would contain at least <i>one</i> highly significant verse. He also (somehow) got the cooperation of many talented and famous calligraphers, and every verse is accompanied by a rendering in beautifully artistic calligraphy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 2 July 2005 21:06 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd vote keep for decent articles on Ayah 1,2,3,...,6000. The Qur'an is an important cultural influence, and if such articles would point out contradictions or present different interpretations that could be useful. The finger bones analogy doesn't work very well, I think. Knowledge about phalanges can be described in general terms, which is not true for, say, <a href="../../../1/6/_/Matthew_1%7E16.html" title="Matthew 1:16">Matthew 1:16</a>. David Sneek 2 July 2005 12:59 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is because phalanges is a general term already.

Granularity at the level of Bible verses is both unnecessary and distorting: verses are not units of meaning, but a means of making convenient reference: verse-by-verse analysis destroys context and obscures meaning: verses were first regularly added to Bibles in the 15th century, hundreds or thousands of years after the various source documents were written. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 2 July 2005 11:01 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't expect any Bible commentary can be constructed that will be NPOV; wikipedia would do better to steer clear. I tried to help balance a few of these at some point, but I predict that this verse by verse approach will be generally dominated by atheist 'academics' (note how many of them want this kept in), with an occasional pendulum swing in the other direction. Failing a delete, better to merge the material. But to give an example of bias, I would take exception to an article about David's prayer of repentance being at <i>Psalm 51</i> rather than <i>Psalm 50</i>, because the Psalm 51 chapter numbering is based on the Jewish Hebrew Masoretic texts, rather than the Greek Septuagint text upon which Orthodox Christians have been relying since the first century. So a simple thing like chapter numbering is a clear indicator of religious bias, or if atheist of the religious heritage you most allow to inform your studies. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 3 July 2005 03:20 (UTC)

<li>As for the first part of your argument, the "atheist", as you put it, but more correctly <i>agnostic</i> academic approach is the only one based in rational discussion and actual historical evidence, rather than the irrational beliefs of any single group. As for the rest, if we can't have an article on Psalm 51 at <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_51.html" title="Psalm 51">Psalm 51</a>, because that is the Jewish numbering and you (or some other people) disagree, we would never be able to have <i>any</i> articles on religious topics where Judaism and Christianity disagree, or for that matter topics where different branches of Christianity disagree. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 3 July 2005 08:14 (UTC)

<li>Yes we could, we would just choose a neutral title, e.g. The Miserere (the first word of the latin version of the text, and the title by which the psalm is commonly known - due to its use in music - e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegri%27s_Miserere_c65a.html" title="Allegri's Miserere">Allegri's Miserere</a>). <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 3 July 2005 17:57 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or Merge per Uncle G.</b> This Buddhist understands and acknowledges the importance and vastness of biblical scholarship to world history, including scholarship on individual lines of text and even single words. I also agree that schemes of classification do vary, so that any attempt to systematize passages into catagories as "stories" might be problematic. I agree with those who feel this discussion is large enough that should it take place outside VfD. My vote represents my view that these passages are significant even to non-Christians (who, in many cases, have been persecuted because of single lines) and that, until a deeper policy be reached, they should <i>not be deleted.</i> <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 4 July 2005 03:42 (UTC)
