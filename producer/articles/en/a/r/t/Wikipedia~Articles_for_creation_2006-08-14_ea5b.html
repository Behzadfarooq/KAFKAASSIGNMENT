<p>Ivan Doroschuk, also known as Ivan, was born in Illinois, USA and at a young age he and his family moved to Canada, settling in the city of Montreal, Quebec, where their mother became a much-beloved member of the music faculty at Montreal's prestigious McGill University.</p>
<p>In high school, in the mid-seventies, Ivan and his brothers Colin and Stefan formed a band called Wave 21. Once out of high school they changed the name to Men Without Hats. Over the next few years the band lineup changed around but Ivan was always present as the lead singer of the band. From 1980 to 1991 Ivan released seven albums with Men Without Hats. He also wrote Mitsou's first English-language song "A Funny Place (The World Is)" for her 1990 album Terre Des Hommes. In 1991 the band broke up and Ivan released a solo album called The Spell. In 2003 Men Without Hats reunited and released their newest album, No Hats Beyond This Point.</p>
<p>Since 2005, he lives in British Columbia with his wife and son.</p>

<p>Is considered a critic and hard contendor of many tendencies in fashion inside their topics and matters. Analytic and a documented writer, it is, perhaps, one of the most common qualifications that he receives inside the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_and_Communications_Technology_2c8e.html" title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</a> environment and the tied business to the ICT.</p>
<p>We can read in forums of Internet, contributions and discussions on diverse topics, from Free Software, the business of the SME sector to organization and marketing.</p>
<p>Creator of the concept of <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%ADndrome_de_Kafka" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%ADndrome_de_Kafka" rel="nofollow">Kafka Sindrome</a>, in general terms, this syndrome reveals reason oneself person it is in fact two profiles of buyers: one outside of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> and other inside. This is due to a metamorphosis in front of two different environments of purchases. These environments influence the person, besides diverse other factors.</p>
<p>On the other hand it has designed the Guide of Financial Development for the Adoption of <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICT_395b.html" title="ICT">ICT</a> in SME (EFFA-TIC) (graphic outline). A guide that is defined as a summary of recommendations on the way of granting support and financing to technology projects that have as beneficiaries to the small companies.</p>
<p>He has even written inside the fantastic literature, brief stories of science fiction like "Wine and Stars" (Libros en Red - Arg.- 2001), a story that captures the interest and it can be classified like an original history.</p>
<p>Its vision on the ICT has been guide in many cases, it is also a different and critical point of view, we can see part of its vision outside of the tendencies when referring to the technological indicators ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/costarica/pymes/issues/technology/performance/indices.mspx" class="external text" title="http://www.microsoft.com/costarica/pymes/issues/technology/performance/indices.mspx" rel="nofollow">Read in MS</a> ) ( <a href="http://www.noticias.com/articulo/15-02-2006/mauro-d-rios/indicadores-tecnologicos-telarana-desenredar-530n.html" class="external text" title="http://www.noticias.com/articulo/15-02-2006/mauro-d-rios/indicadores-tecnologicos-telarana-desenredar-530n.html" rel="nofollow">Read in Noticias</a> ). Appealing to their professor facet, he has made contributions clarifiers, these have been picked up in many websites of Internet, for example <a href="http://www.noticias.com/articulo/22-10-2005/mauro-d-rios/licencias-software-y-autoria-mirada-objetiva-4mgi.html" class="external text" title="http://www.noticias.com/articulo/22-10-2005/mauro-d-rios/licencias-software-y-autoria-mirada-objetiva-4mgi.html" rel="nofollow">Software Licenses</a>, investigator's profile is reflected in all their works.</p>
<p>He can describe the technology in a promissory way and also of critical way, but their works, in occasions, they also contain certain ironic humor in the plants you that he proposes, an example is "Toward the Technology without manuals" <a href="http://www.hugovl.com/articulos.php?idArt=60" class="external text" title="http://www.hugovl.com/articulos.php?idArt=60" rel="nofollow">(Read)</a></p>

<dd>Yeah!, finally!, a suggestion of a contemporary that is not trivial. I agree, include it in their country. There are enough sources to justify it. Valuable person, grateful and easy of verifying in Internet. --201.217.150.194 01:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-14_ea5b.html" title="Edit section: Slitherz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slitherz</span></h2>
<p>Slitherz is a variation of the classic snake game. It was written by Joshua Henize. It was originally created using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/l/i/Image%7ESlitherz_2.5.jpg_c4c7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f7/Slitherz_2.5.jpg/300px-Slitherz_2.5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" longdesc="../../../s/l/i/Image%7ESlitherz_2.5.jpg_c4c7.html" /></a></p>
<p>The first version was released August of 2005 as version <b>Snake variation 1.2.36</b>. It was extremely primitive and buggy, it was more like an experiment. This version has been lost and there are no known copies of the game nor screen shots of any kind. It featured a map that could be edited, although there was no map editor at the time. The map that came with the game was made by hand with a hex editor.</p>
<p>In <b>version 2.0</b> the name Slitherz was choosen over Snake variation. Slitherz 2.0 was a much more stable and funner game than 1.2.36. It was the first version to feature a map editor. The map editor was very slow and error prone. It was hidden in the game and could only be accessed through the Windows command-line. Slitherz 2.0 introduced porkypines as well as the food that has always been in the game.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.1</b> was rebuilt from the ground up with Visual Basic 2005. It used an object-oriented design that made the internal workings of the game much more reliable and maintainable as well as expandable. There is also a hard-coded defualt map that is loaded when a map file cannot be loaded. The map editor was improved greatly since the last version.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.2</b> is a rare version of Slitherz. It was stripped down to the core, although it still had an editable map there was no map editor included. Also the game itself was simplified by removeing the startup screen as well as many other small things. Version 2.2 was written in C#</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.3</b> brought back the map editor as well as adding a few improvments to the game play.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.4</b> was a major improvement to the games internals. The most notable feature is LiveEditing. LiveEditing allows you to edit a map while you play it.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.5</b> currently sets the standard for all future versions of Slitherz. It has a standardized map file architecture that will work in all versions of Slitherz after version 2.5. The file format improves safety that if it were not this way the game could easily crash by opening an invalid map file. Version 2.5 also features 'skins' and has much improved graphics over previous versions. Many other minor features were also added to this release.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.6</b> was improved over version 2.5 by enabling maps to have there own skins as well as using the default skin that is packaged with the game. The bitmaps are injected into the map file itself. The defualt bitmaps are packed into a file instead of having them spead out in the open.</p>
<p><b>Slitherz 2.6.1</b> added a map file converter that allowed users to play maps from older versions of Slitherz(2.3 and up). Maps made for Slitherz 2.5 are automaticaly converted when loaded. The games file structure is more compact than in all previous verisons. The main goal of Slitherz 2.6.1 was to be rock solid and uncrashable. There are some cases when the game can crash, but those are rare. An example of its reliability is if you 'cut off all its arms and legs' by deleting all its files it will still beable to run and be playable.</p>

<p>Scoop Scuba is the strange name of an old Canadian freedom fighter who was a Para-Scuba diver. According to folklore, Scoop would parachute from a bi-plane, land in the Atlantic, then search for German submarines or German Para-Scuba divers trying to sneak into the Halifax harbour during WWII. Scoop's real last name was originally National, but because of his great diving skills he was nick-named Scoop Scuba. He is occasionally refered to as Scoop National Scuba.</p>

<p>Anton Christoforidis was a Greek light heavyweight <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxer.html" title="Boxer">boxer</a>. He was born on May 26, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messinia.html" title="Messinia">Messinia</a> prefecture, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>. His first bout was against Francisco Garcia Lluch in Paris, France which he won by decision. He made his US debut on January 5, 1940 in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> defeating Willie Pavlovich. At that point Christoforidis settled in Geneva, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> in the USA.</p>
<p>Christoforidis was a very competent boxer who possessed good skills and got the most out of his ability. Since he did not possess heavy hands, having only recorded eleven knockouts in sixty-five fights, he relied on ring savvy and work-rate to get the job done.</p>
<p>He won the National Boxing Association world light heavyweight title on January 13, 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio by defeating Melio Bettina in a unanimous decision of a 15-round bout. Christoforidis defended his title successfully twice against Italo Colonnelo in Baltimore, Maryland and Johnny Romero in St Louis. He lost it May 22, 1941 to Gus Lesnevich by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Christoforidis fought his last bout on February 18, 1947 against Anton Raadik. He retired with a record of 43 wins (11 by knock out), 15 losses and 7 draws.</p>
<p>In November of 1985 he passed away at the age of 67.</p>

<p>A GLORIOUS 150 YEARS The following pages will take you down the memory lane; from way back in history, passing the present, and finally, to the future…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE BEGINNING</p>
<p><br />
The Roman Catholic Church had established itself in the Maritime areas from 1505. In 1820 the superior of all the Oratorians in Ceylon, Vincent de Rozairo, himself came as the first missionary to Kandy. He put up a church, which occupied the very same grounds whereon the present Scots Kirk stands. In 1828 the Scots Kirk site was found to be too small and hilly and accordingly a petition was submitted to the Governor - General Sir Edward Barnes who promptly presented the Catholic Church with a new site. It was roughly a square 152 ft. by 150 ft. upon which the second Roman Catholic Church was built. This is the very same site on which St. Anthony's Cathedral stands today.</p>
<p>It was realized that building churches alone would not contribute to the success</p>
<p><br />
Letter from Mgr. Bravi to Fr. Zoppi of the missionary efforts that commenced in 1820. In September 1843, an Italian Oratorian, Fr. Orazio Bettacchini was sent to the Kandyan mission who, during his missionary year 1843/44, opened a school in Kandy on the same premises. But, in August 1844, his successor Fr. Reinaud, who continued as missionary until 1848, began his missionary career by pulling down the school, which Fr. Bettacchini had put up. This was the subject of a letter of complaint made by Fr. Bettacchini himself.</p>
<p>Yet, it was not until November 1853, when Fr. Felice Zoppi, a Franciscan from the Chinese missionary field was sent to Kandy by Monsignor Joseph Maria Bravi D.d., O.S.B., that Fr. Bettacchini's complaint was looked in to. Fr. Zoppi promptly set about his task by opening a school for boys and one for girls at the house where he resided, in January of 1854, with a Mr. Van Twest as Head Teacher of the Boys School.</p>
<p>This was the birth of St. Anthony's School. Soon after which, Fr Zoppi obediently sent word to Mgr. Bravi through Fr. Leone Cingolani, informing him of his success in opening the schools. But the message was never delivered and Fr. Zoppi subsequently wrote to Mgr. Bravi who replied on 12th March 1854, officially acknowledging the opening of both schools, at the present premises of St. Anthony's Cathedral.</p>
<p>Although it is said that; Fr. Zoppi, being a Franciscan, chose to name the school after their illustrious Saint, there is also evidence that the Church had been dedicated to St. Anthony at a much earlier date. The number of students on roll at the inception was 62 boys and 28 girls. The Girls school was shifted to Katukelle in 1887, where a Convent was opened for Good Shepherd Nuns.</p>
<p><br />
THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Poorey took over the administration of the Boys School from Mr. Van Twest in 1855, contributing immensely to the efficiency and prestige the school enjoyed in its formative years. Fr. Zoppi left the country at the end of September 1856. In the absence of sufficient missionaries to take over the school, which was then a parish school, a succession of laymen in; M/s. F. Peiris, F. De Silva, K.A. Fernando, A. Staples, A.B. Geddes and O.D. Paul, carried on the administration until 1870. In 1867, St. Anthony's Boys' School was referred as the 'second best school in English' among all the schools established by the Missionaries.</p>
<p>In 1870, the Irish Christian Brothers John and Paul took over the administration, temporarily. In 1871, the school was run by Mr. W. Hopp, who managed affairs until 1872 and handed the administration over to Mr. J. Jorden, who held the reigns until 1875 when Fr. Dom Hildebrand Vanderstraaten O.S.B. was installed as Principal, marking the entrusting of the administration and management of the school to the Benedictine monks, who erected the Abbey of St. Anthony's in Kandy in 1874. Fr. D. Paul Perera O.S.B succeeded Fr. Vanderstraaten in 1876, in which year it is recorded that boarding life was first introduced, and in 1877 handed over to Fr. D.M. Craner, until 1879. In that year, due to the scarcity of missionaries, secular teachers managed the school with Mr. R.P. Jansz as Head Master from 1880 to 1892, working in harmony with the Benedictine Fathers over a period of twelve years during which time the school made very good progress. The student population by 1887 had grown to 92; 5 of whom were boarders. St. Anthony's Cathedral was built in 1876 on the initiative of Fr. Gingolani.</p>
<p><br />
Mr. R.P.Jansz Head Master 1880-1892 Upon Mr. Jansz's retirement in 1892, the Benedictines appointed Fr. Hilarian Leitan O.S.B., who had only been ordained a priest in December 1891, as Principal. He continued for a period of six years until 1898. Fr. Leitan was the first, of an unbroken line of O.S.B. Priest-Principals of the College, to date. During his six years in office, he had the services of a few other Benedictine monks - Dom Hildebrand Georgesz, Dom Patrick Mckelvie, Dom Dominic Direckze and for a short term, a Benedictine Father from Scotland, Rev. Ryan whose brothers were in charge of tea plantations. In 1894 the premises known as "Philips Coffee Store", now a part of St. Sylvester's College was purchased by Abbot Pancrazi for the school. St. Anthony's had no playing field then. The use of "Barrack Square" was secured in 1898, for the boys to practice sport.</p>
<p>In January 1899, Fr. Maurus Craner O.S.B. relieved Fr. Leitan as Principal of St. Anthony's. All aspects of higher education were included in the curriculum, that year. In the early days of Fr. Craner's stewardship, there were about fifteen boarders housed in a room under the belfry. Capitalising on the new extent of land available, he put up buildings including more space to house the boarders, which soon grew to number about fifty. Fr. Craner was a workaholic, and only slept for about four hours a day, in order to perform his duties as Principal, Teacher, Prefect of Boarders, Accountant, Clerk - all rolled in one. Cricket was introduced by Fr. Andrew Vanlangenberg O.S.B. in 1903, and a team known as 'St. Anthony's College Cricket Club' consisting of staff and school boys was formed under the Captaincy of Fr. Andrew himself. The inaugural match was played in Colombo versus Colombo Carlton Cricket Club.</p>
<p>The completion of the first fifty years was marked by the first ever schools cricket match involving St. Anthony's, which was played in 1904, against Dharmaraja College, with a 109 run victory for the Antonians.</p>

<p>THE SECOND FIFTY YEARS</p>
<p><br />
Old Red Brick Building -1910 This period of Antonian history could best be described as 'the age of maturity into a College of National Repute'.</p>
<p>In the year 1906, Fr. Craner was made to relinquish the post of Principal, which he did with a deep sense of sadness, but with a feeling of discipline and obedience, as his services were needed elsewhere. He had already groomed his successor, Fr. D. Philip Caspersz O.S.B. who was already a member of the teaching staff. After Fr. Caspersz assumed duties as Principal, his brother, Fr. James came in as Boarding Prefect. These two brothers, in a comparatively short time changed the status of the school, making it a College. On the 20th December 1907, the Annual Distribution of Prizes was held for the first time on a grand scale. The Rt. Revd. Dr. C. Pagnani O.S.B. - Bishop of Kandy, was the Chief Guest, and along with Fr. D.A. Pancrazi O.S.B., he distributed 100 prizes amongst a total student population of 275. The ceremony was held in what was called the "Big College Hall" measuring 100' x 27'. The programme opened with a rendering of the chorus 'Over the Hill' by the College Choir and ended with chanting of the 'Papal Hymn' and National Anthem. 'Electricity &amp; Magnetism' was introduced as a subject of the 'Cambridge Classes' in this year.</p>

Charlie Hamilton 10.12.1896-5.11.1909 Along with Fr. Van Langenberg who was prefect of games, Fr. Philip would spend most evenings encouraging and cheering on his students on the playing field at Barrack Square. The 'Cricket, Hockey &amp; Football Club' (CH&amp;FC) was formed to promote sports at College. St. Anthony's became the first College to play Hockey, in the year 1907. 17 matches were played with 10 of them won, 4 lost and 3 drawn. Amongst the opposition teams were the likes of Indian Rajput Regiment, Colombo Municipality and Bloomfield. Two Football matches were played, winning one and drawing one and five Cricket matches were played winning four and drawing one. The first 'Trinity-Antonian' cricket encounter was played in that same year, with the Antonians emerging winners by 14 runs. The irony of it all was that we lost the use of Barrack Square in that year, when debarred by the Military authorities. However, in 1908 the Kandy Municipal Council granted exclusive use of the Reclamation Grounds for College sports.</p>
<p>The roll of students increased to 300 in 1908. Two pupils secured passes in Senior Division and five in Junior Division 'Cambridge' exams. 'Physiology &amp; Hygiene' was introduced as a subject of the 'Cambridge Classes'. Athletics began to feature prominently in the sports arena, with two Antonian students; D. Vincent Silva and P.M. John, securing first places in the highest class of the Flat Race and the High Jump respectively, in the annual 'Empire Day' celebrations held in Kandy on 2nd May 1908. The College Sports meet was held on 4th December 1908 with a list of events described as follows; Flat Races, Putting the Shot, Throwing the Cricket Ball, Kicking the Football, Long Jump, Three-legged Race, High Jump, Hockey Dribbling, Egg &amp; Spoon Race, Hurdle Race, Bun-Eating Competition, Quarter Mile Race, Chattie Race, Obstacle Race, Zoo Race and a Thread &amp; Needle Race for Old Boys.</p>
<p>The first ever College publication was released as "St. Anthony's Manual", in 1908, featuring 53 pages of articles and comprehensive reports on all activities of the college. The old red building near the Bishop's Palace was soon replaced by new buildings that came up in quick succession in the area of the coffee store and the old cemetery.</p>
<p>The year 1909, ended in sadness for the whole school and most of Kandy, when College was robbed of one of its most promising pupils; the little 12-year-old Charlie Hamilton, who had represented the College First XI Teams in Cricket, Football and Hockey with some heroic performances in that year, before his untimely death on the 5th of November. The newly equipped Physical Laboratory was specially dedicated to the memory of little Charlie Hamilton.</p>
<p><br />
In 1910, Fr. Basil Hyde O.S.B., an old boy of the college who was a member of the staff, at the request of several old boys summoned a meeting for the 26th December 1910 at the College Hall, where the 'First Annual General Meeting' of 'St. Anthony's Old Boys' Association' was held. Very Rev. Fr. Bede Beekmeyer was elected the first President of the Association proposed by Fr. Hyde himself. In 1912, when Fr. Beekmeyer was consecrated 'Bishop', Fr. Basil Hyde succeeded him as President of the O.B.A. A total of 152 members had joined the association in its first two years. The first Branch of the O.B.A. was formed on 24th February 1912 as the 'Uva Branch', with Rev. Fr. D.M.Craner O.S.B. elected as President, at a meeting held at St. Mary's, Badulla.</p>
<p><br />
Bishop Bede Beeckmeyer In 1911, St. Anthony's College played its first inter-collegiate Football match, beating Kingswood College by two goals to nil. Boxing was introduced to St. Anthony's around 1914, at the same time that Royal, Wesley, Trinity and St. Thomas' took to the sport. The first ever Boxing Tournament in the Island was conducted in 1914, for the 'Stubbs Shield', and St. Anthony's was amongst the teams that participated.</p>
<p>Due to ill health, Fr. Philip Caspersz, who had been Principal for nearly a decade, was shifted to hibernate within the monastic walls of reclusion, and a younger man in the person of Fr. Basil Hyde, served as Principal during 1915, until a more permanent appointment was made. In November 1915, at the close of Fr. Basil Hyde's temporary tenure of office, Fr. James Caspersz O.S.B., whose association with the college began as Art Master before his ordination in 1906, was appointed Principal. He immediately engaged in the expansion of the College by meeting the long felt need for better and spacious accommodation. In October 1916 a new wing of the College was declared open by Mr. E.B.Denham, Director of Education, thus providing adequate laboratory facilities for Chemistry and Physics. In 1917, the Department of Education officially recognized St. Anthony's College as a 'Fully Organised Secondary School'. An Infants Department for children aged 3-6 years was inaugurated. The 'Prize Giving Day' was held on 15th December 1917, after a lapse of three years due the 1st world war, with the Honourable Chief Justice Sir Alex Wood Renton, presiding. Mr. William Gopallawa, the last Governor General of Ceylon and first President of Sri Lanka, was among the students who successfully completed the London Matriculation Examination during this year. The first telephone was installed in College during that year</p>

<p>The phrase is often used for various equipment or technology, and means a certain device is broken beyond repair, or "totalled," as is frequently the term used with cars. It comes from a relatively little known part of death, where a person or animal's bowels relax, releasing it's contents.</p>
<p>This term is also used for when somebody badly screws something up. In this case, the phrase seems to capture the embarassment of fouling up.</p>

<p>The Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) is currently one of the many state chartered law enforcement agencies. Formed in 1937, the OHP was the first state-wide law enforcement body responsible for administering vehicle laws on Oklahoma highways and roadways (municipal, state and federal). The first academy put out 125 fresh Troopers for Oklahoma's 77 counties, which had to contend greatly with motorists, because there had never been massive enforcement on motor vehicle operation within the state. Today the OHP has over 800 Troopers, with several subdivisions.</p>

<p>Troops A through M are known as field troops. Each troop office is immediately responsible for the area in which they are located. There may be troop detachment offices for each letter.</p>
<p>Troop ES is the Executive Security troop, which is charged with the protection and transportation planning for the state's governor, his/her family and the lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Central Institutions were a range of tertiary education institutes in 20th Century Scotland responsible for providing degree-level education but emphasising teaching rather than research. Some had a range of courses similar to polytechnics elsewhere in the UK while others were more specialised.</p>
<p>They included Colleges and Institutes of Technology, Art Colleges and Agricultural Colleges. Napier College and Glasgow and Paisley Colleges of Technology eventually changed their names to include the word Polytechnic.</p>
<p>The number of CIs varied but in 1988 the list included the following, several of which now have university status.</p>
<p>Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, Dundee (now part of the University of Dundee)</p>
<p>Dundee Institute of Technology, Dundee (now University of Abertay Dundee)</p>
<p>East of Scotland College of Agriculture, Edinburgh (now part of the Scottish Agricultural College)</p>
<p>Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh</p>
<p>Glasgow College of Technology, Glasgow (later Glasgow Polytechnic, now part of Glasgow Caledonian University)</p>
<p>The Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow</p>
<p>Napier Polytechnic (then University) of Edinburgh , Edinburgh</p>
<p>North of Scotland College of Agriculture, Aberdeen (now part of the Scottish Agricultural College)</p>

<p>Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh (now Queen Margaret University College)</p>
<p>The Queen's College, Glasgow (now part of Glasgow Caledonian University)</p>
<p>Robert Gordon's Institute of Technology, Aberdeen (now The Robert Gordon University)</p>
<p>The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Glasgow</p>
<p>Scottish College of Textiles, Galashiels</p>
<p>The West of Scotland College, Auchincruive (now part of the Scottish Agricultural College)</p>
<p>Another CI, Leith Nautical College, Leith, had been closed in 1987.</p>
<p>Some subjects were not taught at the CIs, for example teacher training was only carried out by the Colleges of Education which later merged with Universities, and Sociology was only offered by the Universities.</p>

<p>The Sifer's Candy Company is a Kansas-based independent producer of candy that was founded in 1903 by Samuel Mitchell Sifers as a producer of penny candy. After a few years, they began making candy bars, such as the now-discontinued Jersy Cow and KC bar. In 1931, the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valomilk.html" title="Valomilk">Valomilk</a> cup was created, according to legend because a candy maker added too much Vanilla to the Marshmallow batch creating a runny mixture, which was added to chocolate cups.</p>
<p>In 1970 the company was sold in a merger and became part of what was planned to be a national company, but it failed financially and the factory was shut down in 1981. In 1985, Russel Sifers started a new factory with the original equipment and began exclusively making Valomilks, which they continue to do to this day. The company stands out as being one of the few remaining candy companies to still make their candy by hand.</p>

<p>An (ultra)marathon group founded in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 1990 by Chief Slug Bruce Chituck and Lifetime President John Harper. This group organizes three ultramarathon events each year. All are welcome to come and participate, but the group's primary purpose remains to bridge that distance beyond the standard marathon of 26.2 miles (42 kilometers). By doing so it allows marathon runners the opportunity to expand their boundaries of achievement. The group has had nearly one thousand finishers since 1990, and approximately one hundred are actively practicing members. The group is currently based out of Dover, Delaware, USA; but has smaller practicing elements meeting in Key West, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina. Newcomers are always welcome; and the group may be contacted at www.teamslug.com.</p>

 The Invisible Thread Reel
</pre>
<p>The Invisible Thread Reel is a dispensing device for Invisible Thread. Invisible thread, although not completely Invisible is a very fine strand of Nylon that is used by Magicians to levitate small objects. What is so revolutionary about the Thread Reel is that it is the first device to not only dispense Invisible Thread, but also retracts it, and it keeps a constant tension on the line. Using Invisible Thread prior to this device was a nightmare. You had to strip the thread out of a bundle of strands, set it up before the performance, and if you were lucky it would still be intact when you were ready to present the effect.</p>
<p>The Thread Reel has many advantages compared to just using ordinary Invisible Thread. Be sure when you learn the effects to understand that you will be developing skills that you will be able to apply to your own idea’s etc. It is the techniques and theory you are after here so that you will be in a position to create your own routines etc.</p>
<p>The Thread Reel</p>
<p><br />
Easy to use!</p>
<p>The ITR is very easy to use. Children as young as 6 have successfully learned to present routines with the Invisible Thread Reel. The only real problem you may have with your ITR is resetting the thread. Even that has been eliminated with the release of the 2001 series thread reels. We hope that you take the time necessary to develop the skills required to become a successful ITR performer. As with any new undertaking it will require some patience and practice. Bare in mind that the Thread Reel itself is a very simple device and once you understand it, you will can solve almost any problem it may have. My only recommendation is that you may have to invest a fair amount of time into acquiring this knowledge, but know that it is well worth the effort when you see the look on the audience members faces, when they witness the miracles you will perform! Good luck and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and feed back.</p>
<p><br />
Sincerely,</p>

<p>"There is, however, another point of view which you may take up in order to understand the psychoanalytic method. The discovery of the unconscious and the introduction of it into consciousness is performed in the face of a continuous resistance (Widerstände) on the part of the patient. The process of bringing this unconscious material to light is associated with pain (Unlust), and because of this pain the patient again and again rejects it. It is for you then to interpose in this conflict in the patient’s mental life. If you succeed in persuading him to accept, by virtue of a better understanding, something that up to now, in consequence of this automatic regulation by pain, he has rejected (repressed), you will then have accomplished something towards his education. For it is an education even to induce a person who dislikes leaving his bed early in the morning to do so all the same. Psychoanalytic treatment may in general be conceived of as such a re-education in overcoming internal resistances." (Sigmund Freud, 1959/1904, pp. 261-262)</p>

<p><i>Secondary gain.</i> Although the term resistance as we know it today in psychotherapy is largely associated with Sigmund Freud, the idea that some patients "cling to their disease" (S. Freud, 1959/1904, p. 254) was a popular one in medicine in the nineteenth century and referred to patients whose maladies did not improve due, presumably, to the ‘secondary gains’ of social, physical, and financial benefits associated with illness (Leahy, 2001). Freud’s only contribution to that initial notion of resistance came as a side-effect from his larger, more revolutionary contribution to the field of psychology: The dissemination and popularization of the influence of the unconscious on human behavior (Hergenhan &amp; Olson, 2003). Accordingly, although Freud was trained in and familiar with the notion of secondary gain popular at the time (Freud, 1959/1926a, pp. 97-100), he came to see it as an unconscious phenomenon.</p>
<p><i>Primary gain.</i> Freud’s more specific contribution to the treatment of the mentally dis-eased was a model of human psychological functioning that offered an explanation of the primary gains that patients derive from their psychiatric symptoms (Fenichel, 1945; Wolitzky, 2003). This model explains that the symptoms represent an unconscious tradeoff in exchange for the sufferer being spared other, experientially worse, psychological displeasures (Unlusten). This conceptualization of primary gain is what Freud (1959/1896) labeled a “compromise formation,” (Kompromisslösung; p. 163). And while the distinction between primary gain (internal benefits) and secondary gain (external benefits) was not directly articulated by Freud, it was alluded to, for example: “In civil life illness can be used as a screen to gloss over incompetence in one’s profession or in competition with other people; while in the family it can serve as a means for sacrificing the other members and extorting proofs of their love or for imposing one’s will upon them….we sum it up in the term ‘gain from illness’….But there are other motives, that lie still deeper, for holding on to being ill…[b]ut these cannot be understood without a fresh journey into psychological theory” (1959/1926b, pp. 222-223).</p>

<p>So to Freud resistance was really an intrapsychic compromise arranged in order to avoid losing more. But with whom was the arrangement established? —And by whom? As the word’s definition suggests, a compromise is reached between two or more conflicting agencies. In this case one of the agencies desires to not experience discomfort. Freud (1959/1896) called this psychic agency “the repressing” (p. 163), or, later, “the pleasure-pain (Lust-Unlust) principle” (1959/1911; p. 14), which eventually came to be referred to as the “id” (Freud, 1959/1937a; Wyss, 1973). The other agency works to maintain contact with worldly experiences. Freud (1959/1896) called that psychic agency “the repressed” (p. 163), or, later, “the reality principle” (1959/1911; p. 14), which eventually came to be referred to as the “ego” (Freud, 1959/1937a; Wyss, 1973). The compromise they strive for is to achieve maximum drive satisfaction (“cathexis” or attachment) with minimum resultant pain (negative reactions from within and without). Freud (1959/1911) theorized that psychopathology was due to unsuccessful compromises: “We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality” (p. 13).</p>

<p>However, it is crucial to note that compromise formations reached by these two agencies were not theorized by Freud to be inherently pathogenic. They were seen as being inherently human. That is, the compromise formation leading to psychiatric symptoms was seen as pathological only because it led to psychiatric symptoms. The pathology was not understood as the act of compromise per se—because compromise between the different agencies of the mind (later named the id or unconscious sex and destruction drives, ego or reality principle, and superego or conscience) represented to Freud (1959/1937a) the fundamental human condition (Wyss, 1973)—but from the results of the specific compromise that led to undesirable symptoms. Similarly, a compromise solution was seen as resulting in “successful defense” (S. Freud, 1959/1896, p. 163)—against displeasure—as long as it resulted in “apparent health” (p. 163), understood as a lack of symptoms. But that was not the case for people who sought treatment: Their compromises were by definition not successful—otherwise they would not be distressed and seeking help. Thus, practically speaking, among people seeking treatment, the compromises they had previously reached were ipso facto pathogenic.</p>

<p>The key players in this Kompromisslösung theory of symptom production and maintenance present the core kernel of Freud’s theory of resistance. They are: Repression (often used interchangeably with the term anticathexis, to describe the force which counters cathexis, or drive satisfaction), defense, displeasure, anxiety, danger, compromise, symptom, and experience (either external or internal). Three of the terms occasionally were used interchangeably by Freud—resistance, repression, and defense—with subtle differences in meaning: Resistance often was used to refer to the behavioral manifestations of avoiding direct contact with distressing ideas (inclusive of affects), while defense was the higher order construct which explained the behavioral manifestations, and repression was the general act of denying awareness (Strachey, 1959). As Freud (1959/1926) wrote, “The action undertaken to protect repression is observable in analytic treatment as resistance. Resistance presupposes the existence of what I have called anticathexis” (p. 157). And, “The task of defense against a dangerous perception is, incidentally, common to all neuroses” (p. 159). Similarly, the terms anxiety, displeasure, and danger often were used indistinguishably, having the general meaning of negative affect, while occasionally having more specific meanings. The more specific meanings can be summarized as either experiences of helplessness and loss of object (also referred to as fear), or “signal anxiety” acting to warn of potential impending loss or helplessness (Freud, 1959/1926, pp. 169-172; Strachey, 1959; Wyss, 1973).</p>

<p>Although Freud (1959/1896) originally theorized anxiety as resulting from the process of repression (a theory which stemmed from his observations of hysterias, phobias and obsessions—entailing pathological manifestations of anxiety—and his striving towards an energy conservation model of the psyche; Strachey, 1959; Wyss, 1973), by 1926 he publicly abandoned that notion and assigned the role of anxiety to the ego, explaining repression as resulting from anxiety experienced by the ego (Freud, 1959/1926; p. 161; Strachey, 1959; Wyss, 1973). The “defense neuro-psychoses” (viz., hysteria, obsessions, and phobias; Freud, 1959/1894) then came to be understood as compromise formations negotiated by the ego, albeit still unconsciously (Freud, 1959/1937a; p. 341), to defend against the anxiety of becoming aware of distressing repressed material (Strachey, 1959; Wyss, 1973). This sea change is interesting because it hints toward initial movement by Freud from a strictly objectivist model of knowledge to a constructivist one, as the ego is transmuted from reporting on reality to arbitrating it. Similarly, in some ways Freud’s classic psychoanalytic conceptualization of resistance as defense against painful ‘realities’ exemplifies the modernist pursuit of veridical knowledge—including the metaphor of psychoanalysis as surgery or an archaeological excavation (1959/1937b, p. 360). In other ways Freud (1959/1904) seems to hint towards an appreciation of the constructive nature of experience—viewing resistance as part of a process of “the play of mental forces…which alone makes it possible to comprehend behavior in daily life” (p. 254) and demonstrating the human tendency to construct meaning based on past experiences and to interpret the past based on current experience. Freud (1959/1912) called this tendency “Übertragen” (p. 312), translatable as “carried over” or “carried forward” (Universität München, n.d.), but better known as transference. Freud (1959/1912) accordingly referred to transference manifestations as “stereotypes,” “prototypes,” or “clichés” (p. 313) people use to increase satisfaction of their wishes in their encounters with the world. Not surprisingly, Freud (1959/1925) came to understand resistance and transference to be circularly tied to each other, as resistance works to maintain transference while transference shapes resistance. Their occurrence in psychoanalysis was unmistakable to Freud, and important and frequent enough that they became the foundation of the entire psychoanalytic endeavor: "It may thus be said that the theory of psycho-analysis is an attempt to account for two observed facts that strike one conspicuously and unexpectedly whenever an attempt is made to trace the symptoms of a neurotic back to their source in his past life: the facts of transference and resistance. Any line of investigation, no matter what its direction, which recognizes these two facts and takes them as the starting-point of its work may call itself psychoanalysis, though it arrives at results other than my own." (S. Freud, 1959/1914b, p.298) Indeed, to this day most major schools of psychotherapeutic thought continue to at least recognize—if not ‘take as the starting-point’—the two phenomena of transference and resistance (e.g., Beutler, et al., 2002; Leahy, 2001; Anderson &amp; Stewart, 1983; Wachtel, 1982).</p>

<p>Having conceded libido (and its inherent motivation and agency) to the ego as well as to the id, and through the ego to the superego, Freud (1959/1926, pp. 157-160) then delineated “five kinds of resistances that are met with in analysis” (while stressing that the list is not exhaustive), three by the ego, one by the id, and one by the superego, listed respectively: 1. “Repression,” e.g. reaction-formation, obsession, phobia (i.e. denial or avoidance) 2. “Transference,” (i.e. projection) 3. “Gain from illness,” (i.e. secondary gain) 4. “Compulsion to repeat,” (i.e. acting out) 5. “Sense of guilt or need for punishment,” (i.e. self-sabotage) All of them serve the explicit purpose of defending the ego against feelings of discomfort, for, as Freud (1959/1926) wrote: "It is hard for the ego to direct its attention to perceptions and ideas which it has up till now made a rule of avoiding, or to acknowledge as belonging to itself impulses that are the complete opposite of those which it knows as its own." (p. 159) The first two forms of resistance work to prevent material from reaching awareness, while the last three work to keep material that was previously avoided out of awareness. Freud’s Treatment of Resistance Freud viewed all five categories of resistance as requiring more than just intellectual insight or understanding to overcome. He characterized psychoanalysis as comprising three processes of overcoming pathogenic resistances, “recollection, repetition, and working through” (1959/1914a, p. 366), and emphasized the crucial component of ‘working through’ in the change process: "This condition of present illness is shifted bit by bit within the range and field of operation of the treatment, and while the patient lives it through as something real and actual, we have to accomplish the therapeutic task, which consists chiefly in translating it back again into terms of the past." (p. 371) Working through thus allows clients “to get to know this resistance” and “discover the repressed instinctual trends which are feeding the resistance” (p. 375) and it is this experientially convincing process which “distinguishes analytic treatment from every kind of suggestive treatment” (p. 376). For this reason Freud (1959/1913) insisted that therapists remain neutral, saying only as much as “is absolutely necessary to keep him [the patient] talking” (p. 343), so that resistance could be seen as clearly as possible in clients’ transference, and become obvious to the clients themselves. The importance to Freud of working through in successful psychoanalytic treatment—and its requirement that the resistance be acknowledged and reassessed with the renewed recognition of past events—thus reiterates the inextricable link suggested by Freud between transference and resistance (“transference-resistance,” Freud, 1959/1912; Fenichel, 1945; see also empirical support in Patton, Kivlighan, Jr., &amp; Multon, 1997), and perhaps encapsulates his legacy to psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Claudine at St Clare's</p>
<p>In this fifth book of Enid Blyton's St Clare's series, the twins and their friends learn to be members of a higher form at the school. There are four new girls: the snobby Angela, who does not wish to have anything to do with most of her form, Eileen, daughter of the new matron, who is a sneak and a tell-tale, Pauline, who wishes to be thought of as rich and well connected but is in reality rather dull and Claudine, the amusing but unscrupulous niece of the French mistress, Mam'zelle. The book involves some shakes as the new girls learn to settle down and, in one or two cases, learn some hard lessons. Claudine learns the value of an English 'sense of honour' and Pauline learns not to boast and tell lies. There is a certain amount of class snobbery in this, as in most of Blyton's books but it is nontheless a readable and enjoyable look at 1940s children's literature.</p>

<p>The Zephyr (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)is a solar powered uav designed in the uk as a cheep alternative to spy satalite technology for use on the battle feild in the near future. each Zepher is expected to cost just £1 million , which is afraction of the cost of the current satalites used by the mod for the same purpose of observation on a battle field, which each cost around £15 million each to produce. The solar pannels on the Zephyr will allow it to stay airborn between 50000- 60000 feet for three months, powering two small electric turbine engins to do so. The solar pannels on the uav are so far unable to power the aircraft into the air on their own, and so currently require it to be launched either from a ballon, or in tests by running down a runway and releasing it into an oncomming gust of wind. The survalence equipment expected to be carried on the Zephyr should be able to resolve images up to ten inchs small, and relay messages from special forces operateing in remote areas. It is scheduald to be in service within the next two years, in operations over Iriq and Afganistan.</p>

<p>When a credit card company says there is no annual fee, but it also says <b>minimum finance charge</b> 50 cents or minimum monthly charge of $1 (or something like those two), what does it really mean? Does the minimum finance charge apply whether or not a person revolves on their credit card balance?</p>
<p>A <b>minimum finance charge</b> is based on you carrying a balance. If there is a minimum finance charge of 50 cents and your finance charge for the month is 37 cents, the credit card company would charge you the minimum finance charge. If there are no balances subject to the finance charge, or no finance charges that billing period, the credit card company won't charge you 50 cents.</p>
<p>A minimum monthly charge applies to the merchant who accepts the cards, not the credit card holder. It's the minimum that the credit card processing firm charges the merchant each month for access to processing.</p>
<p>If you pay the bill every cycle within the grace period, don't carry a balance and don't use the card for cash advances, you shouldn't generate any finance charges. With no annual fee, you don't even have to pay for the privilege of carrying the card. The credit card provider still makes some money from the merchant transactions, but you're not one of the company's more profitable accounts.</p>

<p>The Eksund is the name of the I.R.A. gun running vessel that was intercepted by the French coastguard as part of a british intelligence operation to thwart the supply of arms to the Provisional Irish Republican Army from Libyas colonel Quadafi which had begun in 1985. The Eksund was a former grain transporter which was purchased by the Dublin entrepenuer Adrian Hopkins, who had previously smuggled weapons for the I.R.A. from Libya, to move an unprecedented amount and variety of weapons and explosives from Tripoli to Ireland. The ship s crew included James Coll and James Doherty, both of Donegal, Joseph Murray, Henry Cairns Hopkins business associate and Gabriel Cleary from Dublin the I.R.A.s cheif of engineering. It was loaded in Tripoli docks by Libyan naval personel on the 13th and 14th of october 1987 with an astonishing 150 tons of ordnance including 2 tons of semtex explosive, 1,000 ak47 assault rifles,1,000,000 rounds of amunition, 12 RPG launchers with hundreds of grenades and rockets 12 DSHK heavy machine guns,thousands of detonators and fuses, a hundred general purpose machine guns, flame throwers,and most importantly more than 50 SAM-7 missiles needed to bing down British army helicopters, particularly over border areas like south Armagh thus making the suply of army bases in remote areas very difficult and reducing the border to little more than a line on maps. The crew of the Eksund became nervous early in their return voyage when they were over passed by an unidentified plane an incedent that was to be repeated every day thereafter. The Eksund had suffered various mechanical problems since setting off from Ireland and on the 27th of October the ships steering failed and it began drifting toward the coast of Brittany. High speed boats were spotted coming toward the ship from the french coast and the spotter plane again flew overhead.Cleary, realising the operation was now untenable, decided that the only option was to scuttle the ship to prevent the British discovering its cargo in line with his orders.Cleary had prepared semtex charges in the Eksunds ballast compartments,in Tripoli, that would sink the vessel very quickly. The crew prepared the escape dinghy while he went to set the timing devices. It was at this point Cleary was sure of what he had begun to suspect there was a traitor on the Eksund. The carefully prepared explosive charges had been damaged beyond repair.Cleary, one of the I.R.A.s most experienced bomb makers, knew he would not have time to prepare another charge before the Eksund was boarded. The crew including the traitor were arrested by the French coastguard and the ships interception was the biggest British single success against republican arms smuggling of the troubles.</p>

<p>The <b>Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary</b> on the island of <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinos.html" title="Tinos">Tinos</a> is an <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> and the most popular Christian pilgrimage site in the Eastern Mediterranean. The church is most commonly referred to in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> as <b>Panaghia tis Tinou</b> (the Tinos Madonna), the <b>Megalochari</b> (She of the Great Grace) or simply <b>I Chari Tis</b> (Her Grace).</p>
<p>The church was built mostly of white marble in Renaissance style, in 1823, following the excavation of an old <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annunciation.html" title="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, purportedly made of colored wax by the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">Apostle</a> <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Luke_488b.html" title="St. Luke">St. Luke</a>, which was discovered following the vision of a nun, Pelagia, who was lated sanctified. The church was inaugurated in 1830 and occupies the site of an older <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleochristian.html" title="Paleochristian">Paleochristian</a> chapel of St. John, which was in turn built on the ruins of a temple of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>.</p>
<p>Although the church's eponymous holy day is on the day of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annunciation.html" title="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, on March 25th, the actual pilgrimage takes place on August 15th, for the Feast of the <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dormition.html" title="Dormition">Dormition</a>. The annual pilgrimage is made in honor of the holy icon of the <b>Panaghia Evangelistria</b> (Our Lady of Good Tidings), believed to still perform miracles. The icon is by now almost completely encrusted in gold, silver and jewels, and it is formally paraded through Tinos town on that day. Both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic inhabitants of <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinos.html" title="Tinos">Tinos</a> participate in the August 15th celebration.</p>

The second album from The Scooters, I Can See Your House From Here, is warm, likeable pop from the Cardiff, Wales quintet. With melodies that linger and well-crafted songs, backed by the solid production of John Mastro, this effort should get the band some more attention from the buying masse</p>

<p>If I had to put a date to my musical journey- it probably began in the womb. My mother is a singer and I dont doubt that the first notes that slipped into my pre-natal consciousness were hers. She and my father were my greatest inspiration and I fed on the creative expression that was innate to them. As a 2 year old, I would follow my father into tabla class and during these wanderings discovered my natural inclination to the instrument. This inclination turned into a passion and at the age of 7 I started learning Tabla. For me this meant devoting a minimum of 7 hours daily, for the next 12 years! It has since helped me carve a niche for myself in this beautiful world of music.</p>
<p>Although training was rigorous, it was a 12 year buzz. At 8, I had my first public performance with mom and by 13, I was working with All India Radio on numerous recordings. I won all my school, inter-school, inter-college competitions, performed local gigs and simultaneously worked with the Gujarati film industry. In 1998 I won the Classical Tabla Solo competition at national level in India.</p>
<p>My work with Bollywood followed this, and it was amazing to play with the artistes and Directors that I had grown up admiring. Alongside studying for a Bachelors Degree in Commerce.</p>
<p>Although it was an exciting period I began to feel limited by the scope of music and wanted to push those boundaries to explore further. My first UK tour in 2001 was a timely catalyst, and I came back from India to read for M.B.A. So it was as a student here that I began flirting with international music. The raw exposure to such diversity of music and musical traditions felt completely surreal. It was a concert that led to a job offer as Music Tutor for Ealing Council and I took this on after graduating.</p>
<p>Teaching kids at schools in the Borough was a challenge in itself and teaching a classful of autistic kids has been as deeply satisfying as it has been challenging. I also design and lead workshops to promote South Asian music. I have also stood as one of the Directors of International Music Week - coming to the UK has caused the kind of musical work I do to broaden.</p>
<p>My fling with international music has become nothing less than a full blown affair!</p>
<p>Being a percussionist, I have played different forms of percussion with a number of bands including Fusing Naked, Rebel Uprising, UKTransculture and Strings spanning spiritual world music, fusion, indo-jazz, hip-hop and African drumming. Playing the BBC Summer Festival 2004 was again a motivation for me. The on-going projects have been as diverse: from playing at the Winterthur International Film Festival 2004 in Switzerland to portraying Mahatma Gandhi's life through music at "SOAS". Played concerts in various countries like France, Italy, Belgium, Russia, Germany, India, Spain, Switzerland to name a few. The fun doesnt stop, I look to introducing my own style, both Eastern and Western to the borderless WORLD of MUSIC.</p>

<p>The Fat Shits are a comedy-rock band from the Isle of Wight; a small Island off the South Coast of the UK. Amoungst their entourage of songs, are classics such as "Lexi the One-Eyed Sheep Shagger", "Cheese Monster" and "Pissing in My Pants". The band was formed in 2003 by a group of High School students, and were originally named "Mr. T and The Fat Shits", and has developed over the years, changing in members and audibly hideousness, to be what it is today. The band still consists of two of the original members - Rubber Ducky, and Fat Chris.</p>
