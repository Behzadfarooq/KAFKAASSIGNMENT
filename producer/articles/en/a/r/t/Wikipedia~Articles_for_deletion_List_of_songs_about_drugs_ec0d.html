<li><b>Keep</b>Are you kidding me? This article is probably the ONLY useful list of songs... my sister had to do a research thing for university and she had to talk about songs relating to drugs, however she knew none! If it hadn't been for this list she would have been toast. And just because it's ARBITRARY doesn't mean it's UNINTERESTING. Crazy people! 70.51.205.175 21:40, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Listcruft. Are we going to have lists for every song about love? death? politics? Keeping this leaves open the door for all lists of songs based on every conceivable subject. Furthermore, as Resolute mentions, it's absolutely unmaintainable and very open to original research. There are many, many songs that can be interpreted to be about drugs without explicitly saying so and there'd be NPOV and OR arguments about each and every one. Plus, the shear number of songs about drugs would make for a very, very long list indeed. Actually... aren't all songs about drugs&#160;;) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:20, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The deletion notices for all the listed articles refer to this, which appears to be a discussion about a list of songs about drugs.

I believe, for example, that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_Chicago_601a.html" title="List of songs about Chicago">List of songs about Chicago</a> is more encyclopedic and more feasible to maintain than a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_about_drugs.html" title="List of songs about drugs">List of songs about drugs</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Either all of these articles should be kept, or all should be deleted. People are arguing that there's too many up for deletion, but I don't believe this is the case. Either we're going to accept all lists of songs based on topic or we delete them all; there is no logical means of saying some song topic lists are ok while others aren't so we can't justify keeping some and excluding others. Personally, I have already stated that I strongly support deletion; this is a terrible precedent to set and leads to totally random lists that aren't worth having. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 02:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I think a mass listing is a bad idea - has anyone here looked at <i>all</i> the articles to make an appropriate assessment based on the merits of each? I think some that I am familiar with are interesting and useful, it is also useful to have such lists to redirect information that would otherwise clog up main article space. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelburnian_8c45.html" title="User:Melburnian">Melburnian</a> 02:57, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sure some of these are no good, but there are some that are, and there's no way to properly deal with them all in a single AfD. As pfctdayelise says, you shouldn't create policy by AfD; if there's a need for some standard on list topics in this area, then write it up somewhere. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 04:39, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nomination is a violation of process and vastly over-reaches with its list of unrelated articles. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 05:46, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - these articles fit in with the "culture" sections of major songs on large cities, and other items. I think, rather than this mass deletion, someone should go through and pull out any arbitrary lists, so we can vote on them individually, rather than for a whole lot. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 07:35, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, much as I despise pointless and unverifiable listcruft, this nomination is far too broad, and I can't possibly check all those articles. At a rough guess, I would support deletion for 80% of those articles if they were nominated individually, but as others have said, a few might actually be useful in some context or other. The notion that if one songlist is bad (or good), then they all must be is sheer nonsense! <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:04, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I figure the results would be fairly similar if this batch of lists were nominated separately, and the fact that over a third of the articles were kept (some repeatedly), should give the nominator pause for thought that mass nomination is really inappropriate and unsuitable in this case.

<li><b>Delete the originally nominated list</b> as unsourced and unverifiable and unmaintainable. Keep the many other lists until either (1) a general policy discussion is held and comes to some consensus, or (2) they can be nominated in small closely-related groups instead of an indiscriminate horde.

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of these lists are interesting and informative. A few may deserve deletion, but certainly not the main list.

<li><b>Comment</b> In addition, your reasons for deletion make no sense. A biography of a currently living person is incomplete, but that does not mean you should delete that biography. There are currently disclaimers are the top of all of these lists that informs the reader that the list may not be complete.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There are lots of other things on Wikipedia that are not comprehensive. This is also something Wikipedia is pretty good for -- saving time for people looking for all x of type y.

<li><b>Technical Keep</b>; this one bundles altogether too many articles. please renominate individually over a longer period of time, or at least grouped in bunches of no more than a handful, grouped by theme (e.g. nomination of lists of songs about various wars). I have no opinion about the articles; it's just that in order to put some sanity to the AfD process you <i>don't</i> bundle bazillion and six articles with exceedingly little in common with each other in one AfD. Remember the esoteric programming languages AfD that went bazquoncs. And that "all 200 articles in the Naruto episodes category" one. If you bundle AfDs, please at least make sure it's entirely possible for an editor to take a look at each of the articles in one (quick) sitting. And finally, "precedent" there may be, but each of these still needs individual consideration. You know, like all other articles up for deletion. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
