<li>Ankit Fadia is a self-proclaimed hacker. None of his claims have ever been verified from reliable sources Silina 12:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Silina (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Silina_b053.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Silina">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small>
<ul>
<li>Ankit Fadia's biography must be deleted since he is a self proclaimed hacker and none of his claims have been verified. Some of his claims have been published by various media but never the less they aren't sufficient evidence.
<p>A hacker is acknowledged as a hacker if and only if his name figures in various high-standard technology sites or technology books. On the contrary most real hackers consider Ankit Fadia as a script-kiddie.</p>
<p>Silina 12:33, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The question here is not whether most of the other hackers in the world call him a script kiddie or something worse, but whether he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is the most notable "hacker" in India and is accepted by the media as such. A search for "ankit fadia" gives 30000+ ghits. The article cites BBC which says the same thing. His first book "The Unofficial Guide to Ethical Hacking" was a best-seller. A look at the history of the article sill show that this user has a strong bias against Ankit Fadia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=70419979&amp;oldid=70419381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ankit_Fadia&amp;diff=70419979&amp;oldid=70419381" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, (assuming that all the IPs belong to the same person).

<li>Did you look at the contents of those articles.

<li><b>Should be Deleted</b> - I feel Ankit Fadia should be deleted. If deletion is out of question, at least he should be removed from the category of 'Indian Hackers'. He is not acknowledged as a hacker by the "Hackers Community". There are various reasons of this. He has never submitted a bugtraq or exploit. He is not a good programmer since the world has never seen an exploit or a hack written by Ankit himself.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.54.176.51 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.54.176.51.html" title="User talk:202.54.176.51">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.54.176.51_23d2.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.54.176.51">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Ankit Fadia is not recognised by any Notable Hacker or Security organisation, other than as a fraud. As Per the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" class="external text" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" rel="nofollow">hacker how-to</a> (a hacker document by ESR, one of the first, and well reputed hackers) there are 3 things one must do to call himself a hacker
<ul>
<li>Do you speak code, fluently?</li>
<li>Do you identify with the goals and values of the hacker community?</li>
<li>Has a well-established member of the hacker community ever called you a hacker?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ankit Fadia cannot code, or at least, has never done so in public. The Second Question cannot be verified or not. However, Fadia does not qualify on the last count. No one has called him a hacker, but himself, and the media. ESR adds a note in the howto on people such as Ankit Fadia
<p><i>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.</i></p>

</li>
<li>I agree with most of the people out here that Ankit Fadia is a self proclaimed hacker. There is no proof that he has really worked in security field. Rather he uses tools developed by other eminent hackers without giving proper credits to them, which is against the hacker ethics. He also uses the tools which damage not only the security, but also the integrity of the computer system, which is also against the hacker ethics.About his books, he just provides tips and tricks to tweak a computer which are already documented and calls them hacks. - 203.129.199.148 17:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC) <small>contribution moved to chronologically-appropriate place.

Please help in the great community effort to delete him. Please provide valid reasons in the above link. Because the wikipedia admins would delete it only if the reasons are valid, not if the number of headcount is more. Why I am particularly concerned about this is because we have better hackers than Ankit Fadia in this community. If there is a biography on Ankit Fadia, then we must put up biographies in Wikipedia on some really good hackers who are present in this community.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Ankit fadia is not acting professional security persion also. Leave the pint of he becomming a hacker. First of all I would like to add that i have read his book ethical hacking. Which is just copy paste from the web sites. He has pasted even hundres of pages as virus code. His book is not increasing knowledge and the things specified in his book are very old none of them is uptodate. He has also started a course with the named CEH by Ankit Fadia. Lots of ppl have fooled by the name CEH considering CEH form EC council and doing his certification but his certification dont have value in india also leave the rest of the world. So he is just fooling the newbies. He dont have any achivements in hacking field. Just media has created fame for him. So I recommend that this artical should be deleted.</li>
