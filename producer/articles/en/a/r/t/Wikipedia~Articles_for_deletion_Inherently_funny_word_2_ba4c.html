<p>No word is inherently funny, it is culturally constructed. This article is biased in concept and largely original research in execution. Plus, it doesn't include "pig" which I think is hilarious, but it does include "giggle" which is not even mildlly amusing, conjuring thoughts of vacuous gum-chewing schoolgirls on buses. If anyone can find me an article in any paper encyclopaedia, however big, on "inherently funny word" I will withdraw this nomination. Unless it's the Encyclopaedia Cruftannica. In which case we'll have found a copyvio. Survived VfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Inherently_funny_word_2fde.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Inherently funny word">back in 2004</a> on the grounds that it was funny - as far as I can tel this is no longer policy, I checked WP:FUNNY and found nothing. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span></a> 00:05, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Based on some of the references, it seems like this article could exist, albeit in a possibly different format. The fact that funniness if social constructed, for me at least, increases the need for an article which discusses that, provided it can be referenced. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:15, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't find the words in the list funny, therefore they are not <i>inherently funny</i>, therefore the article is false and it must be deleted. --<font style="background: #0000AA" face="verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion"><font color="white"><strong>Ruby</strong></font></a></font> 00:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Everything that is unreferenced should of course be removed, but the use of certain words as "inherently funny" by comedians (and the response of their audience) can be documented, and probably there is some more research on humor that can be cited to source this article better. The intro might need a complete rewrite, though. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 00:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but not as is</b>. This article is one of the centerpieces of wikipedia's humour section alongside <a href="../../../u/n/u/Unusual_articles.html" title="Unusual articles">Unusual articles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unusual_deaths.html" title="List of unusual deaths">List of unusual deaths</a>, but it's a messy article and needs work. Somebody needs to give it a thorough cleanup. Add some sources, and delete everything unsupported by references. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 00:35, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - for some reason the idea of this article gets under a few people's skin. But it's a legitimate concept to discuss. Unfortunately, it's also a concept that draws a lot of fly-by edits (<i>I know something funny - let's add it!</i>), hence the messiness. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 01:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Whether there is any such thing as an inherently funny word is irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted. Otherwise one could make the same case for deleting <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">Ghost</a>. The point is that certain words have been characterized as being inherently funny, as the article documents quite well. Unusual articles like this are part of what makes Wikipedia cool. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 01:19, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and smak JzG will some inherently funny word like Pantyhose, bubbly or giggles... because he I feel he may have skiped a couple steps. You know, some wise men once said to me, if you think it need verifying, then put the verify sign on it. Don't just delete it. If you think it's NPOV then put that one on it too. And only delete it if you really want to. However I may be swayed for other reason to delete this. For example this may simply be an enumaration of several words.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It a number of people lack the required sense of humour. But I doubt even they can deny that, for example, banana is a word used often in jokes and the like (without a suitable context, just because of the word and nothing else). Basically the word has to be trivial in meaning (and thus it's meaning isn't funny at all), it usually sounds "awkward" or "foreign" or plain silly. And if you mention it at one point in a conversation for no reason at all it should be funny. Replacing it with textdocument or something equally mundane should not be (as) funny. In any case, there's comedians who believe in them...there are plenty of other people who "believe" in them, and hence it should be pretty obvious that an explanation is required for those that come across it without knowing what it is. Not to mention many, many articles reference it for good reason. Rygir 04:20, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It is neither Original Research - all of it is what other people have said are inherently funny words - nor POV.

<li><b>Delete with extreme prejudice.</b> This has to be one of the five worst articles I've read on Wikipedia, and I hated it before it was brought here. There's no excuse for this kind of garbage. It's original research, it's stuff made up in school one day, it's not notable, it aims to be a how-to on stand-up comedy. This is a pile of reeking garbage that would make Satan weep. It makes this encyclopedia look like it was written by moronic nosepicking fourth-graders. I can't emphasize enough how bad this is. BrianGCrawfordMA 15:11, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Conditional keep</b> - this article is highly misleading. If the article can differentiate between "inherently funny words" as an attempt to be funny. There is a huge different between that and scholarly language and psychology journals stating that this concept is true. So, I believe the subject may have been broached by enough comedians to merit its inclusion as a well known joke... but as a truly scholarly subject I have seen no evidence yet... and if this article doesn't differentiate between the two then it's seriously misleading. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 18:05, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but somehow this article needs to be 'steamlined' and broken into a few sub headings. Inherently Funny is a legitimate comedic concern and valid considertion for many comedians. Steve Allen has written on the subject and I recall Milton Berle mentioning it as far back as the 1960s. Cincinatti is a funny word, Dallas is not. Maybe "k" is funny by association: Shecky Green, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye, Ernie Kovaks.

<dd><b>comment</b>: Yesterday's <i>Globe and mail</i>, february 20, 2006, page A14, Section, <i>Social Studies</i> (A daily miscellany of Information by micheal Kesteron (<b>MKesterton@globeandmail.ca</b>)) cited Harold Geneen in his <i>Though du jour</i> and stated:

<dd><i>"The reliability of the person giving you the facts is as important as the facts themselves. Keep in mind that facts are seldom facts, but what people think are facts, heavily tinged with assumptions."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Again, <i>Hard facts are really rare.</i> What we most commonly have are opinions from people. (POV's) Inherently most articles are full of POV's. Does that give us the right to delete them? I don't think so. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:41, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b>: perhaps, "table" is a funny word for you, but if you have not written a published book or can't find a published book on that subject (ie.: on the inherent funnyness of that word) than it wouldn't meet the wikipedia standard of inclusion based on the WP:NOR (Wikipedia No original research... and if that is or was the case then we should nullify this entire process, start an entirelly new deletion process with those accusations.) --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not quite sure what you're driving at here, but there are no sources attesting to the inherent funniness of words mentioned in the article, "weasel", for instance, which, IMHO, makes most of this article OR. If this article is to be kept, it needs serious editing and sourcing. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 01:29, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but edit drastically. It should exist where 'Inherrently funny word' is a quote rather than a topic, as comedians have spoken on this subject and given examples. I suggest it should begin with something like 'An 'Inherrently funny word' is a concept which has been proposed by many comedians, including (etc), and featuring words like (etc)'. No word is inherrently funny, it's all relative. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELuke44_0bb4.html" title="User:Luke44">Luke44</a> 21:41 22 February 2006 (GMT)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting article, though per Luke44 and others it could use a little cleanup/organization. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font face="Arial" color="#D47C14">OhNo</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie"><font color="#7D4C0C">itsJamie</font></a><a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 04:46, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article holds a great deal of information on a concept which clearly has been addressed many times in popular media, as seen in the number of sources it cites. It doesn't try to establish a deffinative list of all "inherently funny" words, although the opinion of profession commedians could probably be taken as expert opinion, and thus qualify for inclusion, as has been done. If someone feels that the article is trying to create an inherently incomple and potentially POV list, then it could be cleaned up, but since it is clearly a subject that has been addressed there is no reason to delete it. After all, there are articles on consipracy theories, alien abduction and pseudosciences that may not actually physically exist, but the idea is prevalent enough that in can be reasonable addressed. After all, all of these quotes are verifiable. I've read Dave Barry's piece where he claims weasel is an inherently funny word, for instance. He certainly qualifies as an expert, and thus it's not OR. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 20:31, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not a member of Wikipedia. I'm pretty sure I signed up for an account before, but I don't remember my user name or my password. I have to say that I have the <i>exact opposite opinion</i> on this article that Mr. Brian G. Crawford has. The argument here seems to be that, if this article concerns the subject of silliness, then the article itself must be silly. Nothing is empirically funny, at all, ever. It is -ALWAYS- culturally constructed. That is the nature of humor itself. The fact is that humor is difficult to analyze because you don't know whether something is funny until it makes you laugh. "Inherent funniness" is the concept by which something is simply considered funny, and therefore preferable to things that are not funny. In the satirical online game, The Kingdom of Loathing, the clothing choices for player characters are "pants" and "hat". I am not aware of an official stated reason for clothing being limited to those items, but it is my opinion that experts on humor will agree that "pants" and "hat" are the funniest names for articles of clothing. Certainly, some people may argue that "socks" is funny or that player characters should be allowed to choose "galoshes" or "underpants" or something similarly silly. In this respect, humor can be considered entirely objective. Some people may not find any words to be inherently funny at all, just like how I am fairly sure I have not laughed at an episode of "Seinfeld" at all, not even once. Those who want this article deleted seem to be convinced that humor is not worthy of intelligent analysis because of its subjectivity or its strong ties to the culture of those involved with both producing the humor and laughing at it. I myself firmly believe that it is because of these things that humor is a worthy topic of discussion. There won't be articles discussing in detail every form of humor in legitimate mainstream paper encyclopedias, because humor is a very difficult topic. However, if this article ends up being deleted (being edited to conform to a higher standard of quality is quite acceptable) it will severely hurt my faith in humanity. I just thought I'd throw in my own two cents. --65.13.17.229 07:00, 24 February 2006 (UTC) [Some guy named Dave]</li>
