<li><b>Keep</b> Camp Massad is unique as the only Hebrew immersion camp in Western Canada, has been serving the Winnipeg Jewish community for over 50 years, and the article is sourced through links to the Camp Massad website and news articles written about the camp by various Jewish periodicals, all reputable sources. --Darknightonight 03:29, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Uniqueness is generally not particularly sufficient. I see that it has been around 50 years which is pretty good, but I'm sure that a lot of ethnic/religious youth groups have also been around that length of time and are not regarded as being notable. I agree that the sources are reliable, but I'm also sure that many regional religous/ethnic group magazines will make a noticeboard section about their youth programs so to speak. What is the size of this camp, for instance. Did it win awards for its social work? At the moment the articel is long but seems to have been inflated by large amounts of material which seems like a camp programme/manual/calendar/schedule.`<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">review me</a> 07:26, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I did create my account only yesterday; long time user of this site, first time member. I use Wikipedia as a reference, including looking at the page <i>Camp Massad</i>, an organization I do have some familiarity with. When I saw that Camp Massad was up for deletion, I created this account in order to give some credence to my arguments as to why this article should be kept. I can understand how that can be misconstrued as sock-puppetry, but I assure you it was only done to speak up against efforts to remove this article. --Darknightonight 21:24, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I hold a personal bias as a member of the camp, and the original author of this entry, but the reasons to keep this article far outweigh the points to delete it. A run of the mill camp does not have the <i>only</i> synagogue in Winnipeg Beach. The same camp would not be the <i>only</i> Hebrew immersion camp in Western Canada. The same camp would not be the <i>only</i> sleep-away Jewish camp in Manitoba. If this article reads to much like an add, it needs to be cleaned up, not deleted. Per above, and per my own, this article should no doubt be kept, and this ridiculous summer camp crusade should come to an immediate end. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESens08_d2e8.html" title="User:Sens08">Sens08</a> 19:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The camp is known through most of North America, though it is a Canadian camp a lot of Americans have attended and are attending. The fact that the small Jewish community of Winnipeg has a summer camp that attracts kids from all over North America is worth keeping. A camp like <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Massad_68d5.html" title="Camp Massad">Camp Massad</a> is unique in its programming and location, therefore the article should be kept so that other people that might hear about it can look at the article and know what the camp is all about.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Without repeating all the previous information, I agree that camp massad is an important aspect of the Jewish community of Manitoba and Canada. It is a great place for children to connect to their Judaism to help teach about their own religion. It is very important this article stays posted since it discusses the programs and everything that occurs and is very informative on it. This is the most positive information I have seen on one camp in a long time. It is very informative without being too personal. Please consider this for the camp's benefit before you take it down.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wow, i can't believe you guys would take the editing of wikipedia seriously enough to ban the products of the hard work and time spent by the writers of this this aticle. When you speak of something as wideranging as wikipedia, who's to say that one article is more significant than another. This page and this camp are obviously important enough in the lives and history of the many people who have passed through it's gates in the many years this camp has been around. It is also a wonder how those in favor of deleting this article came across it in the first place, and it's a shame that the feelings like these couldn't be used for more constructive purposes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.79.136.83 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.79.136.83_e6b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.79.136.83">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Some of the brand new users seem quite confused about what makes something a legitimate Wikipedia topic, for instance 24.76.228.13 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.76.228.13_2ada.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.76.228.13">contribs</a>) and 142.161.26.22 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.161.26.22_60c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.161.26.22">contribs</a>). This is an encyclopedia. General interest to readers (which is lacking in this topic and this article) is a reason to keep. The "benefit" of an organization is not. And as for slapping a clean-up tag on it, I'm becoming more and more dubious of further inflating the already huge category of useless stubs with cleanup tags that nobody is doing anything about. Go clean it up already, and it'll surely be kept. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:26, 24 May 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Too much trivial information on a non notable subject. This article is seriously embarrassing to the project. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 21:33, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I am proud to say that I do in fact "take the editing of wikipedia seriously enough" to want to keep only articles that (a) belong in an encyclopedia and (b) meet Wikipedia policies. Point (a) is debatable for this article; reduced to stub length, it would be like one of 10,000 other harmless little articles on the fringes of notability. Point (b) though, makes me a litle nauseous when I read through this thing: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, two of Wikipedia's most critical content policies, have been wildly, thoroughly ignored; ignoring those to such a degree inevitably creates conflicts with the third, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as well. I sympathize with the work that went into this and I encourage the creators to move this material to another website before it is deleted, but this is not material that belongs in Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 21:59, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Although some page about a notable and rather large Jewish summer camp can be kept, I express dismay at the excessive amount of original research that is put into this. A summer camp does require so much information that isn't even going to really concern many people. I suggest a cleam up and a reduction to stub length. - <a href="../../../x/x/5/User%7EXX55XX_7f22.html" title="User:XX55XX">XX55XX</a> 18:51, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article provides fun facts and interesting information as well as the actual, technical details of how the camp is run, which makes it entirely unique. It is imperative that it be kept up and running. - Susan &amp; Liat --84.229.46.95 20:17, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Complete rewrite needed - delete for now.</b> I see potential if someone removes the POV and every advertising aspect in this article. It's a close call on notability, but that can be resolved on rewrite. The article is way too long for its purpose and subject matter. This article will be deleted unless someone steps forward and cleans up the mess that is there right now. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 12:48, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
