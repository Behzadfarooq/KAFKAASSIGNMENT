<li><b>Review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a></b> No, this nomination for deletion was a bald-faced attempt to get rid of an obvious POV fork, as both NawlinWiki and Friday, users with substantial and good contribution histories have agreed with me about. If you HONESTLY BELIEVE that the article needs to exist, please express that here. Using AFD to enforce the best solution to articles that need to go is righteous - using excitable language like you use above requres me to note that, "your conduct definitely "fanned the flames" rather than calming them. If I had to guess, from examining your conduct, I'd say that you were very emotionally upset because someone altered your preferred version of one of your favorite articles." <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">JBKramer</a> 18:20, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do believe Winnie the Pooh is a sufficiently notable character that there is room in Wikipedia for <i>two</i> articles about the subject, one on how he was originally envisioned by A. A. Milne, and then one on how he was later re-invented by Disney. So I'm going to say <b>k33p</b>, and also for the three others below. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 18:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

That said, if at some future time the amount of information necessitates a fork, I would urge the forking parties to actually come of with a reasonable name for the article... something like Winnie the Pooh (Disney). If this survives AfD I would urge a move to that namespace as the current title is overly cumbersome.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Winnie the Pooh (Disney) was already created and merged back, if I am not mistaken. I support the notion of separating out the Disney characters from the A. A. Milne original for this and the other ones below as they are different enough to merit it. The unseperated article was rather muddied up by not keeping the distinctions completely clear in my view. <b>Keep</b> ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:05, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>This is probably just a judgment call, but the article name is a bit odd and the creator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72511243" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Winnie-the-Pooh&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=72511243" rel="nofollow">said</a> Eeyore is "first and foremost" a Milne character. First, certainly, foremost is more of an opinion. One could argue that far more people know about the cartoons than the original books. Anyway, we're not here to decide which version is best or more important. I don't <i>think</i> anyone is suggesting bad intent on the part of the author tho- I certainly see no reason to assume such. But, there were (or so I thought) subtle indications of "The characters in the books are the real ones, the cartoons are a pale imitation". Of course, one man's POV forking is another man's attempt to correct existing bias. I wouldn't focus too much on the "POV fork" tho- the question is, it is a desirable fork? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, as a general rule, any time there's two major ways to look at something, I think we're better off explaining and contrasting both in one article- when you split them, they tend to become "sympathetic point of view" over time instead of neutral. Notice we don't have things like Evolution is a liberal myth and Evolution is scientific and correct. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:08, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
