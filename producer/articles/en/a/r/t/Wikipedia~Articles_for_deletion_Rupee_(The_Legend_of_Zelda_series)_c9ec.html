<li>I'm going to agree with <b>Merge</b>, but not on the basis of notability or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>--I imagine the unit of currency of one of the world's most popular video game series is inherently notable and inherently encyclopedic. But what else could possibly be added to the article as it stands? We know nothing about the material from which Rupees are made, nor how the Rupee came to be so widespread in the Zelda universe, nor any <i>other</i> aspect of Rupeean history, nor what bank guarantees the value of the Rupee, and so on. We can't provide any information about the currency <i>itself</i>, and so we shouldn't have an independent article about it. --<a href="../../../r/a/e/User%7ERaeven0_cf07.html" title="User:Raeven0">Rae</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/a/e/User_talk%7ERaeven0_1e95.html" title="User talk:Raeven0">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Raeven0_f698.html" title="Special:Contributions/Raeven0">Contribs</a>)</small> 04:00, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't disagree with you, but for future reference, nothing is "inherently notable," and the only topics that are encyclopedic are notable ones. We have a set of objective criteria for notability: read about them at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 09:44, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, but if WP:N were strictly applied in all cases, then we couldn't have articles on <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebes.html" title="Zebes">Zebes</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fox_3805.html" title="Great Fox">Great Fox</a> or every episode of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Chicken_07e1.html" title="Robot Chicken">Robot Chicken</a>, simply because no one cares enough to write a book about them.

The same is true for the few episodes of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Chicken_07e1.html" title="Robot Chicken">Robot Chicken</a> I looked at. Being tangentially related to a notable topic (Zelda, or Metroid, or Star Fox, or Robot Chicken) does not make the related articles (Rupee, Zebes, Great Fox, the RC episodes) notable. These are superb illustrations of what Wikipedia should not be: a place for people to type up information they "already know." <a href="../../../n/r/s/WP%7ENRSNVNA_d83b.html" title="WP:NRSNVNA">The presence of reliable sources is non-negotiable.</a> - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 00:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm not trying to be ornery, but I read the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a> article that you are referring to, and I don't remember game manuals being brought up either as acceptable or unacceptable.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Parts of the article are inappropriate for wikipedia, but the solution for that is to remove those parts, not delete the entire article. This article should probably be 1/3 its current size, and only include appropriately sourced information. As noted above though, this virtual currency exists in dozens of games and that's easily verifiable from good sources. This should have been tagged for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a> not deletion.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 22:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not "virtual currency" and it's not important to the Zelda universe. It's simply a "colorful" way of representing an in-game measure of the character's money. It's of equal importance to Zelda as coins are to Super Mario games. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a place to house gaming trivia, which everything except the first sentence is. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 00:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would argue that if Mario collected "Mario Ingots" then that would also be deserving of an article. I would suggest looking at an AFD for something like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goombas.html" title="Goombas">Goombas</a>, AFD here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Goomba_4ab5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Goomba">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Goomba</a>. Similar to the Goomba, the Rupee is an iconic part of the Zelda universe. Anyways, I've said my peace. My argument that it should be kept is well-taken as is Chardish's argument that it should be deleted. No need for never-ending rebuttals of those we disagree with.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 04:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't place the Rupee on the same level as the Goomba. That level of notability is reserved for the Tektite or Octorok. Also Mario Ingots, if they exsisted, would probably wind up in the Mario Series article, just like the Rupee.&#160;:<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckwheatjones_99f0.html" title="User:Buckwheatjones">Bucky</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; I was going to say merge, but it's all pretty much irrelevant information.

<li><b>Merge</b>; The people up top are right. This deserves a section (or even a subsection) in the Zelda Series article, not it's own article. I've started the merge process already; I hope it's okay.<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckwheatjones_99f0.html" title="User:Buckwheatjones">User:Buckwheatjones</a></li>
<li><b>Merge (not just redirect and forget)</b>: This currency has had enough of an impact on popular culture and is quite important in regards to the Zelda series, so the information should be retained, but it shouldn't get its own article. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 21:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Questions: What impact on popular culture? (Remember, we're talking about popular culture, not internet gaming forums.) How are rupees important to the Zelda series? (Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if they were called "gems" or "crystals" instead of rupees.) And most importantly, what do the different values of rupees and the size of Link's wallet have to do with either of those? - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 06:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Other video games, for one pop culture example. They're very important to the Zelda games. Have you played any of them? You wouldn't be able to beat the games without them, and they're even used in puzzles sometimes! They're NOT called gems or crystals. We're not talking about the name ("Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if they were called "gems" or "crystals" instead of rupees."). We're talking about the monetary units themselves. A better hypothetical situation would be "Ask yourself how much the games would be different in plot, theme, gameplay, and appeal if there was no money system." The answer to that would be "a lot."&#160;:) I'm asking for a merge. There's not enough real-life consequence to the rupee to have an article, but there is tons of consequence in regards to the Zelda series, so the information should definitely not be deleted. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 22:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Other video games" could be a trivia thing in the main <i>Zelda</i> article. The fact that Zelda games contain a monetary system is of minor interest to the <i>Zelda</i> games - a few sentences in the main article would do this topic justice. "Zelda games frequently feature in-game currency known as <i>rupees</i>, which appear as crystals of different colors and are found over the course of the adventure. They can be used to buy items and powerups, and are occasionally used to pass certain required game objectives." And find a good source. That's it. Everything else is trivial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, for your information, I've beaten four Zelda games: the original, LttP, OoT, and TTP. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 22:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to again mention that work on merging this into the main Zelda Series article has begun. If you can find a source for what you just mentioned, I'd be glad to add it. By the way, TTP refers to <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twilight_Princess_b9f7.html" title="Twilight Princess">Twilight Princess</a>, Right?&#160;:<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckwheatjones_99f0.html" title="User:Buckwheatjones">Bucky</a> 01:33, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
