<p>Well - over 50% is not original research. However, it deals with information that are not even <i>close</i> <i><b>relevant</b></i> to the subject - or <i><b>incorrect</b></i>.</p>
<p>For instance, it says <i>Red Croatia (Latin: Croatiam Rubeam, Croatian: Crvena Hrvatska), was a name that several medieval documents designated to the initial Slavonic states in southern parts of Dalmatia: the duchies of Hu===m/Zahumlje, Pagania/Narenta, Travunia, and Duklja.</i> However, as you can see on <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagania.html" title="Pagania">Pagania</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duklja.html" title="Duklja">Duklja</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travunia.html" title="Travunia">Travunia</a> and <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahumlje.html" title="Zahumlje">Zahumlje</a>; Pagania is no where mentioned as a part. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 12:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Duvno field was the site of the crowning of Croatian king Tomislav in the 920s.

<p><i>In Chapter 32 of the De Administrando Imperio, the description of the Serbs suggests that the Serbs were not regarded as an ethnicity but rather as a social class. The Byzantines regarded the Serbs as social servants and even slaves.</i></p>
<p>Review that chapter of DAI - it says that <i>Serbs</i> means <i>slaves</i> in the language of the Romei (Greeks) means <i>Slaves</i> and not vice-versa as presented in the article.

<p>I don't want to even get near the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_Research_bdeb.html" title="Original Research">Original Research</a> (and unsourcedness) of this paragraph. It also claims that <i>Croat historians and most Bosniak historians put faith in the document especially when it regards distribution of land among the peoples of the early medieval Balkans.</i> If you see <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_1c9e.html" title="Talk:History of Bosnia and Herzegovina">Talk:History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> - you will see that Bosniak historians discard the document as valuable.</p>
<p>This contrast <i>Some may argue against the authenticity of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja.</i> and <i>Many believe that the De Administrando Imperio is written from an obvious Byzantine bias.</i> - is obviously taking a side.</p>
<p><i>The Priest was not a Croat either but he was fluent in the Croatian language. He lived with Croats and thus was able to translate the Slavic chronicle of De Regno Sclavorum into Latin.</i> The Croatian language was created in the late 18th century - all Slavs spoke the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Slavonic_a24f.html" title="Church Slavonic">Church Slavonic</a> up to then, and when the article was written, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Slavic_91cb.html" title="Old Slavic">Old Slavic</a> was still in some usage. Additionally, if you see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicle_of_the_Priest_of_Duklja_ff06.html" title="Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja">Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja</a>, you may notice that it was written in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar%2C_Serbia_and_Montenegro_0302.html" title="Bar, Serbia and Montenegro">Bar</a> at the very end of the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> - If one views the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Serbia_946b.html" title="History of Serbia">History of Serbia</a> - he/she will notice that Bar is deeply inside <b><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a></b>; so he would've spoken fluently the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_language.html" title="Serbian language">Serbian language</a> - just, like I said - <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> didn't speak a different language back then <i><b>and</b></i> it is Original research anyway. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:11, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>An old place name in modern-day Bosnia (which part of was geographic "Surbia") has the name Servintium (modern-day Bosanska Gradiška). This name was already designated before any Croats and other Slavs appeared on Balkan soil.</i> This (irrelevant to the subject) - as many of the previously-mentioned - are dealing with showing of the article is to show that Serbs didn't live there - and <i><b>not</b></i> <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Croatia_7047.html" title="Red Croatia">Red Croatia</a> - which is the article's subject. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:14, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Should the article's name even be "Red Croatia"? --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:18, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Croat historians argue that the De Administrando Imperio gives direct contradictions. Many other historians also agree that the settlements described in chapter 32 of the Serbs seem like a copy of an earlier written chapter 31 of the Croats. Croat historians also accuse the De Administrando Imperio of having a Byzantine and pro-Serb bias in the later chapters 33 and 34 where it designates Hum and Travunia as Serb lands. They also argue that there are no historical documents prior to the 11th century that designate Duklja (large part of Montenegro) as a Serb territory. Croatian historians believe that Montenegro was forcefully conquered by the Serbs in the 12th century and Orthodox religion was forced on the populace. Croat nationalists believe most of the Orthodox Montenegrins and Herzegovians to be descendants of Red Croats and therefore "Orthodox Croats".</i></p>
<p>Ehm - what does this have to do with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Croatia_7047.html" title="Red Croatia">Red Croatia</a> - it deals with <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Administrando_Imperio_1509.html" title="De Administrando Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a> - and should not be present here (not the subject). --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:22, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Serb nationalists declare Montenegrin separatism as a direct product of Greater Croatian ideology. In the later half of the 20th century, a prominant Serb historian Dr. Slavenko Terzic had extreme criticism against his enemies whom he considered "Red Croats" particularly against the work of a Montenegrin Croat named Savic Markovic Stedimlija. Stedimlija between 1941 and 1944 in the pro fascist Independent State of Croatia published several books and articles promoting pro-Croat Montenegrin nationalism as well as several articles on the promotion of the "Croatian Orthodox Church." Stedimlija is accused of the systematic sabotage of Serbian history in Montenegro by Terzic due to Stedimlija's publishing of Red Croatian history which Terzic alleged was made only for the purpose of negating the Serb roots of Montenegrins.</i></p>
<p>Today, Montenegrin separatism is less based on Croatian nationalism and more due to economic problems facing the union between Serbia and Montenegro. There are still many Montenegrins today who declare themselves Serbs and very few that declare themselves Croats.</p>
<p><i>Today, Montenegrin...</i> - what does this have to do with Red Croatia? Anyway - the third paragraph to the up mentions that <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahumlje.html" title="Zahumlje">Hum</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travunia.html" title="Travunia">Travunia</a> were Serb lands (again) - when DAI (De Administrando Imperio) actually says that Pagania and Zahumlje were Serbian lands (like I explained before). Travunia is the area of Serbian rule. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 13:25, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This appears to be a content / POV dispute, not a question of whether an article on this subject should exist. If you think the article is in error, change it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:24, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Arguments are clearly about the content. However, low marks on the Google test, and the article seems to put into doubt the very existence of "Red Croatia" (in a way that suggests it isn't a major controversy either), suggesting the article may be based entirely on original research. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 08:30, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and rewrite.</b> Delete only if cannot be rewritten. Copy HolyRomanEmperor`s comments to discussion page of the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMaNeMeBasat_c312.html" title="User:MaNeMeBasat">MaNeMeBasat</a> 15:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
