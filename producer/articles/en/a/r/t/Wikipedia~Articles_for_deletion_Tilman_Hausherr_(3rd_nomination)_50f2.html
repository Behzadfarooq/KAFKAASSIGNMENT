<p><b>Nomination statement</b></p>
<p>This article previously survived 2 AFDs. In both the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tilman_Hausherr_072b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tilman Hausherr">first AFD</a>, and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tilman_Hausherr_%282nd_nomination%29_372e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tilman Hausherr (2nd nomination)">2nd AFD</a> - the result was <b>Keep.</b> Recently, a discussion was brought up to merge the entire article into the article <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a>. The discussion is at <a href="../../../o/p/p/Talk%7EOpposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements_b659.html" title="Talk:Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Talk:Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a>.

<p><b>Comments on nom statement</b></p>
<p><b>Comment on nom statement</b> - While the stated purpose of this AfD as a discussion of a merge is decidedly odd and may be misuse of the AfD process, I think that there is sufficient question as to the notability of the subject to warrant this AfD, irrespective of the outcome of previous AfDs. It is odd that an AfD is being brought by a nom that thinks the article should be kept and, again, I wonder if it is a misuse of the process. It might be more appropriate if this AfD were resubmitted by an editor that feels that the article should be deleted and perhaps this AfD should be "shelved" pending such a submittal. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 17:05, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Response:</b> - No, actually it is a used practice to send an article you think is notable to AFD, in order to "test" its notability as a standalone article. This is most certainly appropriate, specifically because "Merge" discussions commonly take place <i>within</i> AFD discussions. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee</a> 18:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>COMMENT:</b> -- As nom, I will not "vote" a particular sentiment, though I do think the subject is notable and the article is certainly adequately sourced with reputable secondary sourced citations. However I will state that this action of the merge discussion at <a href="../../../o/p/p/Talk%7EOpposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements_b659.html" title="Talk:Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Talk:Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a>, and the placing of the merge tags at the 2 associated articles and the constant re-adding of them amounts to a revenge/harassment tactic, as delineated by the subject of the article, <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a>. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee</a> 07:42, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Keep <small>Since <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> and I have worked/are working together this isn't a formal vote, even though an AfD isn't supposed to be a "vote" anyway.</small> If <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> were only a critic of Scientology, I'd agree with the merge proposal. After all, he would belong in such a category if that was all that could be known for. In my opinion his software development and the coverage it has received clearly makes him notable for more than being a Scientology critic.
<blockquote>
<p>Hausherr's Xenu's Link Sleuth software was called the "fastest link-checking software" by PC Magazine.</p>
</blockquote>
To be fair though, since he did include the name "Xenu's" I understand why some Scientologists may feel he is a full time critic. However such people are most likely forgetting that the bulk of time spent on the application involves programming/coding, the name is almost an afterthought. (Which means if a person spends 100 hours developing a program, and then takes two seconds to call it the <u><i>no FAT chicks file manager</i></u>, said person <i>could</i> be called insensitive but would <u><i>have</i></u> to be called a developer. Especially if the software <i>works</i>.) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 10:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, he is notable in the anti-cult world, and the article is adequately sourced from third party publications. I'd argue that the article is keepable on this basis alone, irrespective of the notability of Hausherr's software. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 12:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- no new arguments that weren't already examined and rejected in the first two AfDs, which frankly makes this seem quite like an attempt to get around the results of the first two AfDs. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:26, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> Why would you propose a deletion (AFD) to settle a merge debate. Wouldn't a merge be prefereable to a deletion? I still support a merge with a redirect from <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman.html" title="Tilman">Tilman</a> to <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults.html" title="Opposition to cults">Opposition to cults</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Non-notable critic of Scientology with a couple of minor mentions; also he has a website and a lawyer sent him a letter (dime a dozen). Non-notable developer of one bit of non-notable software that got a magazine mention <b>five years ago</b> (again both are dime a dozen). The non-notability of <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu%27s_Link_Sleuth_409d.html" title="Xenu's Link Sleuth">Xenu's Link Sleuth</a> is abundantly pointed out by the fact that, other than the five-year old magazine mention, the main "source" to establish notability is of the sort; "someone actually used it". --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 16:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was likely featured in PC-Welt magazine sometime in fall 2006, since they asked me for permission. Your "five years ago" theory is because that was all you could find. I suggest you look further, and also at google print. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;q=%22link+sleuth%22&amp;btnG=Nach+B%C3%BCchern+suchen&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;q=%22link+sleuth%22&amp;btnG=Nach+B%C3%BCchern+suchen&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 21:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>(Tilman added a Google Books search to his existing comment so I will speak to that) Add Xenu to the search as in Xenu+"Link Sleuth" and you get five hits <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Xenu+%22Link+Sleuth%22&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=Xenu+%22Link+Sleuth%22&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>There are different ways to write "Xenu's", that is why. Some don't write His name at all: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1578203120&amp;id=FYhCYgblDqoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;ots=BbbfVy3FxR&amp;dq=%22link+sleuth%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sig=foyC1-wP01_W02Eh7_Xv6BSrTb8" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1578203120&amp;id=FYhCYgblDqoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;ots=BbbfVy3FxR&amp;dq=%22link+sleuth%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sig=foyC1-wP01_W02Eh7_Xv6BSrTb8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. These books mention the shareware that is relevant, i.e. notable. The hit counter (which is administered by the ISP software, not by me) of the Xenu page is at over a million. <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 22:17, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The page illustrates my point - non-notable software in a sea of similar non-notable software. The hit counter is illustrative of the synergy <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> developed by linking unrelated software to the internet <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> of Xenu. I do not know if <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> is notable for being the first to promote the criticism of another person's religion by means of naming an unrelated software program (I will spare you the analogies I can dream up) but I doubt that we will find RS crediting <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> with that "honor" anyway. (Not to mention the software and this article promoting <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a>'s reprehensible attempts to blacklist and cause trouble for ordinary public Scientologists.) --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 22:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Is notable enough to have a fair few pages linking to him, and since the article (briefly) covers both his work as a software developer and as an anti-Scientology campaigner, a merge to either would be confusing. <font face="verdana"><a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 22:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>; it is true that most of Hausherr's notability derives primarily from his anti-Scientology campaigning. However, as per Iridescenti's point above, the fact that his program has received notable coverage as well means that a simple redirect would be inappropriate. I also applaud Mr. Hausherr for handling this in the proper fashion and avoiding <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. — <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKrimpet_8927.html" title="User talk:Krimpet">talk</a>/<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Krimpet_c408.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Krimpet">review</a>) 01:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> I certainly don't think a merge is appropriate.

<li><b>Delete</b>, propaganda, but a week delete&#160;;-)...

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -NOT merge- and desperately ask for vandalism protection. I don't know anything about Tilmann Hausherr besides what the article points to, but from all the discussion I've seen, he must be a Golden God for warranting so much hostile attention.

<dd>What's sarcasm?&#160;:D Is there an agp talk page??&#160;:| No, really, I'm determined to learn more about Tilman (one l) Hausherr. Please observe my <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaudeReigns_db0d.html" title="User:ClaudeReigns">philosophy</a> of wikipedia. For all I know, Mr. Hausherr, having only 5 Yahoo hits, might be a figment of our imagination, or a very important figure in understanding the methods of Scientology against its critics. Only time will tell. There is plenty of time to decide whether he deserves enshrinenment as a cultbuster or urban legend. Sweeping information under our electronic rug will not serve either such purpose. Please allow me time to <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaudeReigns_db0d.html" title="User:ClaudeReigns">eat</a> Mr. Hausherr. For myself, it is only day 17. I find comparisons between Hausherr and misshapenly and developmentally disabled sex offenders to be ROFL amusing but a highly <i><b>inappropriate</b></i> personal attack against the alleged Mr. Hausherr.

<li><b>Keep</b> Let's discuss the article, not each other. Notable scientologists are appropriate subjects for WP articles.So are notable opponents. This article is about a particularly effective <s>proponent</s> <i>opponent</i>. It is adequately sourced, and the notability has been fully shown. There's also notability in other fields. Just as it is unfair to lump all scientologists into the same group, so it is unfair to do the same with the opponents. <small>—<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b> - Xenu Link Sleuth is popular free software for findng broken URLs on web pages. The subject's personal web site is also an information resource about cults in the German language, as well as in English. I note also there is nothing in the WP article about the OPC or harming tourism, thus no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> exists to support this commonly spammed libel about the subject. Article meets <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Finally, it is inappropriate to merge this article into <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_cults_and_new_religious_movements.html" title="Opposition to cults and new religious movements">Opposition to cults and new religious movements</a> since the subject is just as notable for Xenu Link Sleuth as he is for publishing data about cults which pretend to be religions. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 08:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small><b>Weak keep</b> It's not clear <i>how</i> notable a living person has to be in order to be "notable", beyond being the subject of verifiable published references. Wikipedia includes hundreds of articles on minor and ephemeral figures in the worlds of sport and entertainment; considering Tilman's conspicuous presence on the web over the past decade, he is surely more notable than some of these. Wikipedia has a role in answering questions like "Who is Tilman Hausherr, anyway?" <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCooke_e6b0.html" title="User:DavidCooke">DavidCooke</a> 03:31, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Keep</b>: as others have said, notability has been estabilished in more than one area, so a simple merger is not appropriate. Breaking up the information into articles on the separate subjects would make it harder to determine who Hausherr is. -<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleta_51a2.html" title="User:Aleta">Aleta</a> 00:37, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
