<p>This article is kind of fun but hardly encyclopedic. Wikidepia is not a collection of trivial information. Also, it is not for <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">ideas made up in school</a>. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 00:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"I think that it's a trivia.", the rationale used by several editors here, isn't a reason for deletion, conversely. A proper rationale would address the purpose of the list, per <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>, the scope of the list, per <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>, and our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policies. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> says that stand-alone lists should be made only for encyclopedic information, and an assertion of triviality is (essentially) an assertion that the information is nonencyclopedic. At least, that is how I interpreted it. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 04:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would be a circular rationale: "It's unencyclopaedic because it's trivial. It's trivial because it's nonencyclopaedic." If one is asserting that something is unencyclopaedic, one should at least articulate what the relevant policy that one is thinking of is. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I meant that trivial things are unencyclopedic, and unencyclopedic things don't belong in wikipedia. <s>It's trivial because it isn't important.</s> In particular, I mean that this list isn't notable by itself. A condensed version in the main article for calculator spelling may be worthwhile, but there is already a link to a list of calculator words in the external links section. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 05:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

The main point of an entry in an article's "External links" section is to link to content that cannot or may not be included in the actual article. But you yourself have just stated that a list of calculator words <i>can and may</i> be included in an article. Since you yourself have just argued that a list of such words is acceptable content for an article, what is your basis for arguing that this article should be deleted? It cannot be that the list is non-notable. (If it were non-notable, why have so many separate people compiled and published such a list?) It cannot be that the list is unverifiable. (One can verify it against the several lists that have been linked to both in the article and in this discussion.) It cannot be that this is unacceptable content for an article. (You've just argued that a list of calculator words <i>is</i> acceptable.)

<li><b>Keep</b>, though I was the main organiser of the article, so consider the bias. However, also consider the article (before I messed with it) dates back more than 1.5 years, and before that, other articles on a similar topic had similar content.

<li>The purpose of the list is clearly informational. The scope of the list is well-defined, and is not excessively broad, given that there is both a limited alphabet and a limited word length. All verifiability and original research concerns appear to be a matter of cleanup, not of deletion, given that the article is verifiable from many sources who have already done the research of determining what words can be made, such as <a href="http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/calculator-word-game-upside-down-list.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/calculator-word-game-upside-down-list.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://homepages.strath.ac.uk/~cjbs17/calculator/calcwords.html" class="external text" title="http://homepages.strath.ac.uk/~cjbs17/calculator/calcwords.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/calculatorwords.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.langmaker.com/calculatorwords.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li>According to the article, that translates to "fool". Fortunately, we don't base our decisions upon what Wikipedia editors personally think to be foolish. That would result in the deletion of quite a lot of articles about various systems of belief, for starters.

<li>I didn't mean that the article was foolish, however that the entire idea of basing an article on such a topic was perhaps ill conceived.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>- Hm. I remember being amused by this when I was younger. A condensed version in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a> article, along with maybe an external link to a more extensive list, would suffice to explain the concept. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia- it's purpose is to <i>describe</i> and <i>explain</i> a subject, and it should only continue to accumulate data on a subject as long as doing so still sheds light on what it's about. This article has well and truly passed that point. It ought to go, simply because it is just a mindless heaping of data.

<li><b>Delete</b> as nom. I always thought <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> was a dangerous thing to have lying around. I strongly feel that it should not apply in determining wether material should be included in Wikipedia mainspace articles. In this area the rules are crucial- everyone is bound to want to save there favourite unencyclopedic articles on the bases of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> which just becomes <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> on a policy footing. These words were <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">dreamed up in school on many days</a>. Sometimes such ideas can become widespread and popular amongst those of school age, but that does not make them worthy of an encyclopedia article where there content is unimportant and not notable (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Common_room_cricket_d507.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Common room cricket">Common room cricket</a> for an example of a recent AfD of this sort).

<li><b>Comment:</b> This whole list is available on websites linked to from the article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a>, and it should be noted that many of these words aren't words that <i>anyone</i> ever used before--they're just all possible words. There may be some value in this list, for some purpose, but for the purpose of the encyclopedia I think that we should just pick the most common calculator words to place in the main article on calculator spelling, and remove the list. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 13:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And what source are you proposing to use for determining what are the "most common" words? Or are you proposing that editors perform <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>? The sources that we have don't say which words are the common ones. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:09, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Addendum:</b> I want to state clearly, since I'm not certain people recognize it, based on comments: there is already a page about the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">practice of spelling words on a calculator</a>. The arguments that have been used about how everyone knows about spelling words on a calculator, etc are arguments in support of keeping the article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculator_spelling.html" title="Calculator spelling">Calculator spelling</a>, but what we are concerned with here is the article List of calculator words. The practice of spelling words on the calculator is notable enough for an article, but the list of all words doesn't merit an article of its own. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESopoforic_c2a5.html" title="User:Sopoforic">Sopoforic</a> 13:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Long, long ago, a list like this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calculator_spelling&amp;oldid=39899393" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Calculator_spelling&amp;oldid=39899393" rel="nofollow"><i>was</i> present on the page you cite</a>. Note the list's arbitrary nature ('donkey' in German...a great intro to calculator spelling!), and also its absolute uselessness. Any longer and it becomes useful, but unwieldly; any shorter or at that length, and it is manageable but pointless. It absolutely requires a separate article.
<p>I would, however, lightly agree that attempting to list <i>every</i> word in <i>every</i> language is a futile task. When some non-arbitrary boundaries ('your favourite calculator word sucks' doesn't cut it) can be agreed upon by the community, I will gladly bring the list down to something sensible yet useful. I will always be strongly in favour this article's continuation, but I do understand criticism of its length. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpamguy_4135.html" title="User:Spamguy">Spamguy</a> 19:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yeah, that works for me. My main concern was with duplicating what's out there already. You've provided a few sources that list calculator words - there's no reason we can't list a fair bunch of examples in the calculator words article, then link to those outside pages as web resources which provide a full list of words. By doing that, Wikipedia readers will still have access to the full list - we just won't have to maintain it. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 01:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>AFD is not a vote. Pointing to sources counters claims of unverifiability.
