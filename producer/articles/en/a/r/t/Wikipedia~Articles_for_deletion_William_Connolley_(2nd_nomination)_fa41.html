<p>Consensus is obviously to keep. Let me point out, though, that Wikipedia is still too young (at 4 years old) to have created a policy on articles about contributors who are somewhat well-known outside of Wikipedia. I only know of 2 or 3 other notable people who have contributed, like that guy who started <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinfopedia.html" title="Disinfopedia">Disinfopedia</a> and some minor gay celebrity. The other 99.99% of us are just amateur volunteers.</p>

<li>NB. The nominator of the previous VfD didn't actually vote, so there were only 4 votes, of which 3 were "keeps" which <i>would</i> be a consensus (and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> should not have edited the closer's conclusion in the archive to change it to "no consensus"). However, I would feel the same way if it survived a 3:2 vote that was called no consensus. There are better things to do than put up articles for deletion over and over again. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 30 June 2005 22:59 (UTC)

<li>Just to show my good will, here are some hints: was he elected to lead some organizations/committees, etc? Are his articles frequently quoted (as opposed, to plain graphomaniacs)? Was he honorably awarded for his work? If you cannot provide any of these, sorry folks. Keep him if you like, but I detest such "friendly" attitude.</li>

<li>Please answer my questions about your notability (assuning you are the man). Just point where the ifromation is, and I will gladly update the article. Unless I see this, I have no reasons not to question the notability.

<li>Its not "someones" POV. Its my POV, of course. Its a direct quote from me, hence entirely appropriate in the article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 2005-07-03 21:00:42 (UTC).</li>

<li>We don't normally let people vote on themselves. [Dunc, presumably]
<ul>
<li>Sez who? I'm expressing my opinion, which is that this re-listing is pointless.

<li>I don't believe there is any rule that says people can't vote on articles relating to themselves. There is a prohibition on <b>writing</b> autobiography but that's an entirely different matter.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am really bothered by the fact that Connolley has contributed to the article. He really shouldn't, and it weakens his position here in voting on this VfD, as it brings with it the suggestion of vanity. Secondly, I read over the link Dunc provided, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_Academics_ec11.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Academics">Wikipedia_talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Academics</a>. It is not an official policy nor an official guideline, indeed, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> merely describes it as an alternative test that has been proposed. VfDs like this one always confuse me. Jimbo states that the 2 primary rules are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Connolley appears to be entirely verifiable, and the article does not actually read like vanity, per se. I really wish WP had a stronger set of <i>official</i> guidelines for situations like this. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 1 July 2005 17:24 (UTC)

<li>What makes it worse is that, as Wm Connolley has admitted to me, Ed Poor created the article in order to bolster his position in a Wikipedia edit war somewhere on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_environment_change.html" title="Global environment change">global environment change</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 2 July 2005 10:51 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - for involvement in "Real Climate" alone he is more notable than a minor Pokemon character or an episode of DS9. His pubs make him (look) more notable than the "average" colllege professor (since this is based on American standards, and third author on a <i>Science</i> paper blows most of them out of the water). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 1 July 2005 22:18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I think WMC is notable for his position as a scientist involved in public advocacy (e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/a/RealClimate_de5a.html" title="RealClimate">RealClimate</a>), but I would really appreciate seeing something more tangible than a list of publications for the purpose of establishing notability as a scientist.
