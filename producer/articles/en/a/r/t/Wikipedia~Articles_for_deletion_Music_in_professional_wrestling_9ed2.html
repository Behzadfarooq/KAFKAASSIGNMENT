<p>The result was <b>keep.</b> There appears to be a lot of support for improving and verifying the article to the best of our ability -- that sounds like an excellent idea. Some people think splitting the article between different articles would be the way to go; could give that a shot, and either redirect, disambiguate, or re-nom for deletion, if you like.

<p>Nothing more than listcruft/fancruft...sorry to be blunt but I fail to see how the big list serves much purpose beyond that. I propose that the big entrance theme list be deleted. Have no problem with the intro beind kept, but the list is all unsourced. However, these theme songs are an indiscriminate list of information which is specifically said to not be accepted on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>).<a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubyredslippers_fbe2.html" title="User:Rubyredslippers">Rubyredslippers</a> 03:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep, but provide more references</b> "Listcruft/fancruft" is not a valid reason for deletion. Entrance music is particularly important in professional wrestling, and many of the wrestlers and shows on this list are extremely notable. In addition, this list indexes a great deal of information that can not be easily cataloged within other existing articles or the category system. Therefore the list is both useful and notable. However, that all being said, it does currently suffer from a large lack of references. The songs are most likely correct, but to meet citation standards someone needs to provide references verifying the information in the article. I have therefore flagged the article requesting references. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Its a valid reason - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:FANCRUFT" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:FANCRUFT" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:FANCRUFT</a></p>

<dd>No, it's not. Even per the above referenced <i>essay</i> (not guideline or policy), "Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, <b>but it is not the actual reason for deletion.</b>" In other words the perception of something being "fancruft" might contribute to people wanting to delete it, but it is <i>not</i> used as the reason for deletion. There is no policy or even any guidelines against "fancruft". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And to put it another way, you should <i>never</i> see an admin delete an article with the official reason being "fancruft". It might be deleted for lack of references or a notability issue, but you should not see articles deleted if the <i>only</i> complaint on the afd is "fancruft". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And again, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> does not mention the word "fancruft" once.

<dd>Actually I'm not ignoring anything, as I already described above that in my opinion the information in the article is notable and useful to readers, but that it does have a problem in that it currently lacks references. My complaint is that "fancruft" is, frankly, an unfortunately all too common and inappropriate phrase for afd and cfd discussions. I would much rather nominators not use that term at all since whether or not something is "fancruft" has no bearing on whether or not I'll support deletion. It's a waste of time to use the phrase in a nomination for deletion, and also is rather insulting to otherwise good faith article authors. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S.

<dd>P.P.S. You'll also note if you read the section you highlighted titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, that the section is actually quite limited in scope. "While there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries, current consensus is that Wikipedia articles are not simply...", followed by a list of consensus areas which are inappropriate (ie Lists of FAQs, Travel Guides, Memorials, etc). Lists such as this one are not included in those categories, so that section of that policy does not necessarilly even talk about this type of article. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Difficult, this one. The psychological aspect of music in relation to crowd "heat" at wrestling events is pretty large, as the characters are quite closely tied to their themes in the mind of the audience, so there's a reasonable amount of potential for an article on that side of things. However, sourcing is definitely missing, and the list seems to be overdoing it. <b>Weak delete</b>; possibly merge the information in the first couple of paragraphs to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestling</a>, but axe the list (despite my finding it useful once or twice) as being nearly impossible to source. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Serve the same purpose as soundtracks listings of discographies (different from those of an artist's). Same as List of songs performed on The X Factor (UK TV series) or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_songs_in_South_Park_480b.html" title="List of songs in South Park">List of songs in South Park</a>, which are also musical lists related and belonging to highly different categories and apparently has no informational values apart from gathering them in one page. But that's not a reason for deletion for me. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font face="Lucida handwriting" color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup> 22:49, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As per above. Also I like to add that if I was interested in any of the songs by wrestlers, I find this an excellent article to browser for the artist, find out the song name. This is a good article and it runs like a catalog. Maybe it also requires a category to run with it. <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 12:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> In its current state it contains large amounts of mostly unverifiable original research. If the article is kept I recommend the list of songs is deleted and started again from scratch with each song being properly referenced, otherwise the article will always have major problems. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 13:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually a surprising amount of the information is verifiable, although the references aren't yet included. You can typically verify what theme songs a wrestler or PPV used in a few ways. First, some of that information appears on the wrestling promotion's official website. Second, the major promotions release periodic official music CDs which feature the theme songs for their wrestlers and PPVs, including listing on the track list which song is for which wrestler. Just using those two sources, you could probably provide accurate citations of either official internet postings or from official CDs that verify who uses what. The remaining uncited songs could be either removed or tagged with "citation needed". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I'm prepared to give the benefit of the doubt on notability, per arguments above. Verification is poor to non-existant; ideally, each entry on the list needs a source. Assuming a consensus that this is notable, we would want to keep the list for those cases where an article about the wrestler does not yet exist, or does not include this information. May be appropriate to <b>keep, mark for verification</b>, list on relevant Projects, and revisit in a month. If verification then remains flimsy, I would be minded to delete, but let's give the workers a chance. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 18:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Split and Re-Write</b> This info belongs on the wrestler's pages, and doesn't need a page of it's own. The prose can stay, but the list doesn't belong here. If someone wants to know the name of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries's</a> enterance, they'll go to his page to find it. While the info here is valid and varifiable, the collection is messy and invites the inclusion of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">non-noteable</a> information. A good way to decide if the enterance music is notable, is if the wrestler is notable. If they don't have their own page, they don't deserve an entry here. If we are going to use that logic, why not just put the info in their page, and throw on a catagory on it to group wrestlers with distinguished music? -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickSentowski_243d.html" title="User:NickSentowski">NickSentowski</a> 20:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
