<p>REPLY: I wrote the piece because it was supposed to be in Konkani. For it's understanding, I further translated it in English (on the spot). Just to decline the article is mean from you. Listen, for your information: "native speakers" doesn't mean a thing. I just wanted to tell you that, if you don't yet know. Anyway, it's a pity and I wont waste my time.

<p>Dalem Lake is a small community located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The name Dalem Lake has been applied officially to the area since approximately 2002 when the name of the area was officially changed. Previously this community was known in the 1800’s as New Dominion, and later as part of Big Brasd’Or.</p>
<p>The community of Dalem Lake is situated on Nova Scotia's eastern edge on Cape Breton Island, and more specifically the island of Boularderie. The community is within the county of Victoria.</p>
<p>Dalem Lake borders on communites of Big Brasd'Or (North), Millville (east), Boularderie Center (West) and Black Brook (South).</p>
<p>A provincially managed picnic park (74 hectares) surrounds the almost perfect circle of the Lake known as Dalem Lake (or sometimes referred to as Round Lake). The park has a small sandy beach, picnic area, 1 km hiking trail and is suitable for paddle boats. Trout fishing is also popular in the lake.</p>
<p>Dalem Lake is approximately 20kms from the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal to Newfoundland, 40 kms from the city of Sydney, and 40kms from the community of Baddeck. The Transcanada (Highway 105) runs through the community.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-13_6142.html" title="Edit section: 1st &amp; Ten">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_%26_Ten_64b6.html" title="1st &amp; Ten">1st &amp; Ten</a></span></h2>
<p>1st &amp; Ten is the yellow line that a TV viewer sees during a live broadcast of a college or professional football game. It goes the width of the football field and indicates where the 1st down marker is located. The goal is to make it easier for television viewers to follow play on the field. There is also often a red/pink line that is used to identify the line of scrimmage. The 1st &amp; Ten line is made available by a private company called Sportvision and was developed in 1998.</p>
<p>This is roughly how the 1st &amp; Ten line is made visible on the television screen:</p>
<p>Each football field has a unique contour (not perfectly flat) so it needs to have a 3D model made of it prior to the game. It also has a unique color palette, typicallyl various shades of green, depending on the type of surface (i.e. fake or real grass) and the weather (i.e. bright, shady or even snowing).</p>
<p>There are a number of cameras on the field, each one has a computer with it that monitors how the camera is used during the game (pan tilt, zoom, focus and extenter) and transmits that info live to the Sportvision production truck 30 times per second. This info helps keep the yellow line in the proper place without being distorted whenever the camera follows the players or the ball.</p>
<p>The first computer in the truck gathers all the separate readings from the cameras and transmits a single consolidated data stream to the central computer.</p>
<p>The central computer takes these readings, the 3D field model &amp; color palette, the knowledge of which camera is on the air, and together using a geometrical calculation determines which pixels in the video frame would make up the first down line. All pixels that are obstructed by a player, a ref, the ball or any other object are identified and not included in the calculation. This will ensure that the 1st &amp; Ten line will be behind all the action. The only object that is covered by the line is the field.</p>
<p>The only pixels that should change are the ones that are the same color as the field, typically several shades of green. There are two situations that are difficult. One is when the players uniform color nearly matches that of the field (i.e. Green Bay Packers jersey on a bright sunny day). The other is when the field itself changes, like during a rain/snow storm or if the grass field gets real muddy. In those cases, the field's color palette would need to include brown and/or white shades.</p>
<p>After the central computer has determined which pixels represent the 1st &amp; Ten line, the final computer takes that pixel information and draws the yellow line in video format at 60 times per second.</p>
<p>The data collection and computation requires time. The audio feed goes to an audio delay to be synchronized with the delayed video. The total delay for the viewer from the live feed ends up being about 2/3 sec.</p>
<p>There are seven computers in total and a crew of 4 people. Two crew members, one inside the stadium and one in front of a computer, communicate the position of the real first down line to make sure everything is working. Another crew member is a troubleshooter. The last crew member monitors the various colors that will make up the color palette onto which the line is drawn.</p>

<p>Sportvision is a private company that provides various television viewing enhancements to a number of different professional sporting events. They work with NFL, NBA, NASCAR, NHL, and MBL broadcasts. They also work with college football broadcasts.</p>
<p>In 1996, Stan Honey, the company's current president and chief technology officer, developed a way to track hocky pucks with a red dot as seen by television viewers. It was assumed at that time that viewers had a hard time keeping track of the puck. Ultimately, it was not a success but it was the start of what eventually became 1st &amp; Ten and the formation of the Sportvision company, both in 1998. That was the year that 1st &amp; Ten became a major hit with television viewers when it was in the Super Bowl broadcast. It has since become part of the all standard football broacasts.</p>
<p>Another popular Sportvision product is seen with broadcasts of NASCAR races. It is called RACEf/x and creates virtual flags above the cars to make them easier to follow by the viewers.</p>

<p>Via Lucis is the Way of Light or Stations of Light, a counter part to the Lenten Stations or Way of the Cross (Via Crucis). The Way of Light is a reflection on the events following Jesus' death, from Resurrection to Pentecost.</p>
<p>Like the Way of the Cross there may be different versions with different numbers of stations and different texts for reflection. Following is one version:</p>
<ol>
<li>The empty tomb</li>
<li>The Emmaus walk</li>
<li>The upper room</li>
<li>The doubting disciple</li>
<li>The sea of Tiberias</li>
<li>The Damascus Road</li>
<li>The Ascension</li>
<li>Come Lord Jesus</li>
</ol>
<p>A different version with 14 stations to match the number of stations in the traditional Way of the Cross can be found at <a href="http://www.aodonline.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.aodonline.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aodonline.org/</a> a web site sponsored by the Archdiocese of Detroit.</p>

<p>Terry Valderas aka DJ Stretchy aka VERNIXX was born in San Francisco and raised in Texas. He grew up listening to progressive rock like E.L.P., Yes, Gentle Giant, &amp; King Crimson along with early punk like Wire, The Clash, Talking Heads, &amp; The Ramones. Learned musical notation, composition, and classical percussion in public school as well as through private tutoring.</p>
<p>As a teen-ager, formed the seminal Fort Worth improvisational/psychedelic/progressive rock group E.S.P. in the late 80's with best friends from school. They played underground illegal clubs, warehouse "raves", and happenings which they organized. After much local notoriety, many parties, &amp; lots of shows, the band splinters to his dismay. Undaunted, was immediate grafted into the original line-up of legendary Dallas aggro-rock band THE TOADIES in 1989. They played the big shows as openers. Moved into headlining slots locally very fast. They flirted with record labels. Played their first out-of town shows. In 1990, was extracted for lifestyle differences with them, while they go on to national chart action.</p>
<p>Disillisioned with rock music &amp; the lifestyle, moved to Portland Oregon for five years. Watched grunge hit, saw indy-rock sprout...but was musically-bored. Switched to electronic-based music in 1994 after hearing the first Underworld singles and seeing San Francisco's Wicked DJ's (Garth, Marky, &amp; Jeno). Learned electronic production and DJ skills at once! Co-managed Portland (and now legendary) DJ TONY RUIZ while learning the industry &amp; dance scene. Then, his life literally fell apart and he knew he must find his way back to his roots, sadly leaving the love of his life behind.</p>
<p>After serious lifestyle revelations, he abruptly moved back to Texas in 1997. Met his future Wife. Reconnected with his old friends. Began his life again. Formed two new bands at once. First was THE GIDEONS...a garage-punk expolsion of sound, attitude, and mayhem. They stormed the Fort Worth scene, drank lots of adult beverages, and never failed in having a total blast on stage. THE GIDEONS played on through 2001 and won a legion of fans and hecklers. He also simultaneously formed Fort Worth's hugely popular trip-hop band PARASITE LOST with old &amp; new friends. Stormed the Dallas/FT Worth music scene, won awards, made recordings; got hyped beyond belief. Flirted with labels. Played the big venues. Ate from the VIP deli tray. Then, egos took hold and the band broke-up...after a brilliant 1998-1999 run.</p>
<p>He also DJed at many many raves playing Hard House, Techno, Trance, and Nu-NRG as well as Drum &amp; Bass in the Southwest US as DJ STRETCHY from 1997-2002. He recorded three EP's of electro-pop-noise-goth-techno rock as STRETCHY from 1999 to 2001. He felt the call of the solo beast and took the charges...</p>
<p>Moved to North Carolina in 2002. Co-Hosted Saturday night hard dance/drum &amp; bass show RPM on WZMB FM, Greenville (2002-2003). Began recording "high energy" dance-music hybrids as VERNIXX in 2002. Released an 80-minute album of techno/noise/intelligent beat called "Fused Music" as THE GOLDEN TALISMEN.</p>
<p>Moved to Oklahoma in early 2004. Continued the VERNIXX profile, gaining international DJ play, radio airplay, club rotation, and success. THE GOLDEN TALISMAN profile became TERRY VERNIXX in early 2005 and began anew by tailor making music for magick rituals, esoteric film soundtracks, and psychedelic fireside dancing. VERNIXX signed to new House label URBAN FLUX in 2005 and is promoted in Europe by Aftershock Records. He continues to DJ and produce House music in 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-13_6142.html" title="Edit section: Submarine Fleet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Submarine Fleet</span></h2>
<p>Submarine Fleet is the collaborative effort from members of Trance to the Sun, Nocturne pdx and Blade Fetish. Submarine Fleet combines dreamy high frequency shimmer, deep range melodiousness, and hypnotic rhythms to set the stage for passionate male vocal works with surrealist leanings.</p>
<p>Submarine Fleet has often been compared to the likes of 1980's <a href="../../../4/a/d/4AD_bed5.html" title="4AD">4AD</a> label artists such as <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocteau_Twins_6450.html" title="Cocteau Twins">Cocteau Twins</a> (primarily with respect to their heavily layered guitar work). However, upon closer observation, hints of things more reminiscent of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blonde_Redhead_b70c.html" title="Blonde Redhead">Blonde Redhead</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/And_Also_The_Trees_1354.html" title="And Also The Trees">And Also The Trees</a>, and Ummagumma era <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> become recognizable. Add to that their generous song lengths, which build and maintain their resonance through a well crafted intensity, and one comes up with a sound that is at once psychedelic, intriguing and mysterious.</p>
<p>“In a Case of Fire”, Submarine Fleet’s debut E.P., was officially released on July 26, 2005.</p>
<p>This entirely self-produced and self-released CD includes 5 songs from their all-original live repertoire; a catalogue of songs which has begun to engage and endear a respectable following amongst the concert-going crowds of Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>On July 22nd the band, in ship-shape from the studio, performed a very well attended CD release party at Portland’s Ash Street Saloon. This event marked a definite high point in the band’s first nine months of playing live, months which have included appearances with other Portland artists such as Dorien, The Divided, The Gentry, The Prids, and nationally touring acts such as Collide and Girl in a Coma.</p>
<p>Submarine Fleet has its roots in its members’ previous (and in certain cases ongoing) projects.</p>
<p>These include&#160;:::</p>
<p>Dan Canty: drums (Nimbus {Eugene, OR})</p>
<p>Mark Linder: vocals (Blade Fetish {Santa Barbara, CA})</p>
<p>Lauren McKenzie: guitar (Saturnalia Trio {Portland, OR})</p>
<p>Ashe Ruppe: bass (<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disekt.html" title="Disekt">disekt</a>; The Elysium Facade; Low Spin Complex; Nocturne pdx {Portland, OR})</p>
<p>Ashkelon Sain: baritone guitar &amp; synth (Blade Fetish; Trance to the Sun {Santa Barbara, CA})</p>
<p>Submarine Fleet was first conceptualized in the fall of 2001 by Ash Sain, following the conclusion of his critically acclaimed, though largely overlooked group Trance to the Sun (which had had a seven album run with the Tess, Ambulancia, and Precipice record labels). Sain began the new Submarine Fleet project by exquisitely recording nine CDs worth of solo ambient improvisational music concerts, several of which were made available to fans. In the spring of 2002, he relocated to Portland, Oregon for the express purpose of launching a full scale version of the group to be known as Submarine Fleet. An experimental period followed where, performing under the preliminary name of Electromagnet, the exquisite talents of bassist Ashe Ruppe and Guitarist Lauren McKenzie were integrated (Ruppe had toured with Trance to the Sun in ‘97). And after much deliberation over who might be able to fill the shoes for this group vocally, it was decided to import Sain’s former band mate Mark Linder from his seclusion in Arkansas (Sain and Linder had recorded and toured together previously under the name Blade Fetish). When Linder arrived in the summer of 2004, a new phase of song writing and demo-ing began in earnest. Then, in the fall of 2004, just at the point when it was most critically needed, drummer Dan Canty appeared through a chance meeting during a pre-dawn taxi trip to Portland International Airport. In the space of a single rehearsal, Canty left no doubt amongst the others that he was the ideal drummer for the job. The new members became quickly acclimated to each-other’s tastes and quirks, and finally the ideal incarnation of Submarine Fleet was up and running.</p>

<p>By Nightfall is a melodic/death/metalcore band that originated in Candiac, Quebec in the small garage of Jeremy Vocina. They were all friends for a long time, and Jeremy and Vincent already played guitar, and were all big fans of heavy metal. So, Todd picked up a bass, Matthew got some drums, and Corey got a mic and they started to play. After a while, their musical tastes expanded and they became much more interested in Melodic/Death Metal and heavier riffs. They are currently unsigned to a record label, but are looking to get signed to <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a>. They have been considered the kings of underground death metal.</p>
<p>"We all really hate the fads, and hardcore and sh*t," said Todd, "it's just so stupid. All these cores, and everything. It's ridiculous"</p>

<p>Seicentois the Italian word for six hundred, and is the standard Italian term for the 17th century (not the 16th century, but the years beginning with 16). It is used in English mostly to refer to art-historical and architectural movements and styles of that period.</p>

<p>Indwelling is the death metal project of three ex-members of the seminal Christian hardcore/metal band Overcome. Started in 2000 by Jason Stinson, Ethan Pujak, and B.J. Ovsak. Thomas Washington was added to the lineup shortly after. Indwelling started playing a brutal brand of death metal akin to secular acts like Suffocation, Death, and Deicide. After five months Ovsak left the band, leaving Thomas Washington to fill in bass and vocal duties. Their lone recording, And My Eye Shall Weep, was released in 2003 on Facedown Records.</p>

<p>Born in Middletown, Connecticut August 21, 1757, he received a college education at Yale. An energetic (possibly temperamental) guy, he became City Clerk of New Haven and started a newspaper, now known as the New Haven</p>
<p>Gazette, which was used to argue for Federalism. He passed the bar in 1783 and after a brief stay practicing law in Bermuda became a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Yale in 1794. Leaving Yale (his federalist sentiments were disliked by the loyalist incoming Yale president), in 1801 he became the 2nd president (and 1st teacher) of what was then Franklin College, but is now known as University of Georgia. He was forced to resign the presidency of UG in 1810 due to disagreements with the Board of Directors, over his desire to separate science and religion.</p>
<p>He then moved to Washington and became U.S. Surveyor General and then 2nd Commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office in 1814 (this evolved into the BLM) focusing on midwestern territories such as Illinois. In 1817, the year following the famous "year without a summer", he ordered the various land offices to collect meteorological observations, and thus started the second effort to collect systematic meteorological observations in the US, the first being started by the US Army medical corps a few years earlier. Apparently the original observations have been lost. He was also 2nd president of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, an early but unsuccessful precursor to the Smithsonian Institution. He was one of the original trustees of Columbian College, now George Washington University. In 1820 he was also part of a successful effort to introduce national vaccinations for smallpox. He died in 1822.</p>

<p>Nicholas Fontana is a a current teenager born on january 13 1992. He had a rather happy childhood until his parents divorce on November 10th, 2001. That led to very many social withdrawls, and also caused him to have stressful relations with his parents. He soon fell into the grunge movement of seattle, and using his knowledge of musical theory learned the guitar, drums, and bass. With this he gathered few friends and formed a band (The Crows) in 2005. After many frusterating attempts, he finally settled with a 4 man crew, with alternating drummers and bass players.</p>
<p>Now he is a complete maniac, and also has bouts of depression and pushes even his best friends away. His band is unsucesful, but no body even cares.</p>

<p>They're Coming To Take Me Away Ha-Haa was a song performed originally by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_XIV_fb73.html" title="Napoleon XIV">Napoleon XIV</a>(AKA Jerry Samuel) in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. Jerry used the pseudonym for the release of the song, whiched reached #4 in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Singles_Chart_3b11.html" title="UK Singles Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> the same year. The melody of a marching beat using <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a>, tamborines, and a siren sound, along with the voice of Napoleon XIV, proclaiming to the world how his lover drove him to insanity. The siren comes into the song near the end, which would be the "nice young men in the clean white coats" who are arriving to take him away, to a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_hospital.html" title="Mental hospital">mental hospital</a>. Although the pitch of his voice does change throughout the song, there is never any singing, but more of a desperate man pleading, and giving a "Look what you did now" speech.</p>
<p>It was released originally on <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> as a single, with the track on the A-side of the album. On the B-side, you could hear the track in reverse, which may make a psychodelic experience for some, although more have considered this track to be more unlistenable than anything else. There are no known hidden messages in the reverse version of the song as of yet.</p>

<p>Mark Higgs (born Aril 11, 1966) is an American football running back in the NFL. Higgs spent one season with the Dallas Cowboys (1988/89), before joining the Miami Dolphins as a Plan B free agent in 1990. Higgs then spent four full seasons with Miami (1990-93), before joining the Arizona Cardinals during the 1994/95 season. Higgs played one game for Arizona during the 1995/96 season, before retiring from the NFL. Higgs led the Dolphins in rushing during the 1991/92 (905 yards, 4 TDs), 1992/93 (915 yards, 7 TDs), and 1993/94 (693 yards, 3 TDs) seasons. Higgs replaced former Miami Dolphin running back Sammie Smith as the Dolphins’ primary rusher after Smith was injured during the 1991 preseason. He was eventually replaced as the Dolphins’ starting running back himself by rookie Terry Kirby, who was considered a better receiver, during the 1993/94 season. The emergence of running backs Irving Spikes and Bernie Parmalee during the 1994/95 season spelled a significant reduction in Higgs’s role with Miami.</p>

<p>Bob Hauer is a veteran newscaster, known for his journalistic integrity and lovable personality. In 2005, Bob fulfilled a life-long career goal, when he was named as the morning anchor for WHP Talk Radio 580 in Harrisburg, PA.</p>
<p>Bob's love for the news profession was first evident at age 10, when he began authoring and publishing his own newsletter, "The Sh'mokin Gun." In its infancy, the publication drew national acclaim for its writing, and caricatures of local political leaders, each done in crayon.</p>
<p>An amatuer inventor, Bob is the holder of several U.S. Patents. His greatest invention, "The Chintee," is a facial hair style designed to help younger men look older. The design has yet to be marketed in the continental U.S, but has become popular in The United Arab Emirates and Curacao.</p>
<p>Bob's passion for dogs has landed him guest roles on several national radio and televison shows. Industry insiders know Hauer as "Boxer Bob," due to his love of the breed. His segments on healthy breeding have become regular features on Animal Planet, and "At Home with Gary Sullivan."</p>

<p>In 1860 in Orange, Massachusetts, chair manufacturers Thomas H. White and William L. Grout realized that there was a future in sewing machines. They had $350, three employees, a lathe, a planer and a drill press. With these, they began manufacturing “New England” model sewing machines, making 6 at a time and then loading them onto a horse-drawn wagon to be sold door-to-door for $10 each.</p>
<p>Over the years, the company grew and gained investors. In 1867 it was incorporated as the “Gold Medal Sewing Machine Company” under Andrew J. Clark and John Wilson Wheeler. A decade later, they began production on what would become their flagship model, the patented “New Home” machine. By 1870, it was being marketed and sold worldwide. On the basis of this success, the company was renamed the “New Home Sewing Machine Company” in 1882.</p>
<p>Throughout the following decades, the company continued to produce the New Home and other models, using assembly line techniques to produce 500 machines a day in 1884. They added woodworking and needle manufacturing facilities to their plant, and by 1907, production was up to 150,000 machines a year. The company now had 743 employees, and Mr. Grout held numerous patents for sewing machine parts and manufacturing techniques.</p>
<p>In the 1920’s, the company began to experience financial difficulties, which eventually led to the decision in 1930 by the board of directors to sell the company to a competitor, the “Free Sewing Machine Company.” The entire contents of their plant were moved to Illinois, where some New Home models continued to be manufactured. In 1937, it was estimated that over 7 million New Home sewing machines were in use worldwide.</p>

<p>According to Frantz Fanon, the third phase of violence in the Algerian War but also in any colonial occupation. The Year of the Boomerang is the point where the violoence of the aggressor turns on him, yet the oppressor does not understand the process; he knows no more than he did in the first phase when he launched the violence. Because the oppressed are always defensive and the oppressor always aggressive, the oppressor is surprised when the people turn back on him with the force he has used against them.</p>

<p><b>How it all began</b></p>
<p>RaGEZONE was created in 2001 by a welsh teenager by the name of Daniel James, during that time he was still in school and into numerous sports but intended the use of RaGEZONE to be a news related sport website.Numerous months later Daniel who became known as MentaL at a later stage had started to play a game which had been been just released in Europe called Legend of Mir 2. Shortly after his time playing the game he had made numerous friends and one which included a person who had obtained the files from the official ftp of WEMADE entertainemt (company who had developed the game) to run their own server.</p>
<p><b>It has begun</b></p>
<p>After obtaining the files, Daniel aka MentaL had decided to run his own public server for Legend of Mir dispite the possability of any lawsuit or issues between himself and the Game-Network company. The server became synonymous with Legend of Mir players to this day and after five years online still currently runs the largest Legend of Mir server in existance.</p>
<p><b>The Threat</b></p>
<p>Everybody knew that private servers came into existance during the time RaGEZONE was around and the hosting company disliked this and saw it as a financial threat and had sent out a warning to remove the files or face criminal charges, later on the server was taken down but only to be brought back online and ignored all warnings from the Game-Network staff and set the standard to what is now known to be Legend of Mir.</p>

<p>After a year of being online RaGEZONE had a reputation of being unique, they had managed to obtain more server files for games such as Mu Online which had brought them the current fame to this day and is now the largest English MMORPG server file developers in existance in the English language. RaGEZONE are responsible for the release of files including the previously mensioned Mu Online, Lineage 2, Myth of Soma, Chronos, Repent online and many many more (numerous files also where released by the chinese to which RaGEZONE had reintroduced to the english market, titles also include BombGame, Navyfield, A3 and lots more)</p>
<p><b>It continues</b></p>
<p>RaGEZONE still operates to this day and the forum has numerous development sections for games such as World of Warcraft and new titles. Members contribute their work and release custom and official files through the forum and is visited by over 8000 unique MMORPG fans every day. RaGEZONE also includes off topic sections are much popular and are now seens as much more than a general MMORPG related website. RaGEZONE currently provides its own free IRC server and free EMAIL to members and includes subscriptions to unlock features via the forum.</p>

During his time playing the game he had made numerous friends and one which included a person who had obtained the files from the official ftp of WEMADE entertainemt (company who had developed the game) to run their own server.</p>
<p><b>It has begun</b></p>
<p>During the time of obtaining the files, Daniel aka MentaL had decided to run his own public server for Legend of Mir dispite the possability of any lawsuit or issues between himself and the Game-Network company. The server became synonymous with Legend of Mir players to this day and after five years online still currently runs the largest Legend of Mir server in existance.</p>
<p><b>The Threat</b></p>
<p>Everybody knew that private servers came into existance during the time RaGEZONE was around and the hosting company disliked this and saw it as a financial threat and had sent out a warning to remove the files or face criminal charges, later on the server was taken down but only to be brought back online and ignored all warnings from the Game-Network staff and set the standard to what is now known to be Legend of Mir.</p>

<p>After a year of being online RaGEZONE had a reputation of being unique, they had managed to obtain more server files for games such as Mu Online which had brought them the current fame to this day and is now the largest English MMORPG server file developers in existance in the English language. RaGEZONE are responsible for the release of files including the previously mensioned Mu Online, Lineage 2, Myth of Soma, Chronos, Repent online and many many more.</p>
<p><b>It continues</b></p>
<p>RaGEZONE still operates to this day and the forum has numerous development sections for games such as World of Warcraft and new titles. Members contribute their work and release custom and official files through the forum and is visited by over 8000 unique MMORPG fans every day.</p>

<p>[Radio Wazee], online since 1998 is dedicated to the exploration of music, technology and community. [Radio Wazee] broadcasts its radio programming over the internet.</p>
<p>Radio Wazee receives fresh music weekly from the same sources traditional radio stations get their music. This means Radio Wazee has access to many songs and versions that are only available to broadcasters - in most cases long before the music is available in record stores or anywhere online. Unlike its over-the-air counterparts, Radio Wazee's new music is online as soon as we get our hands on the stuff. You're likely to hear new releases on Radio Wazee 4-8 weeks before it will hit the commercial US airwaves and sometimes months before its available in record stores.</p>
<p>You'll find Radio Wazee listed prominently on all of the major radio sites including Windows Media, Real Audio, AOL/Shoutcast and Audiorealm. We're listed as a pre-set station in top media players like Apple iTunes and Sonicbox imTuner.</p>

<p>Najmeh Najafi was a social aid worker in Iran. Born in Tehran, she went to college in the United States. While there, she told author Helen Hinckley about her childhood, which resulted in the writing and publication of the book <i>Persia is My Heart</i> in 1953. She then moved back to Tehran, working to help small villages achieve financial independence. She mainly worked in the village of Sarbandan, trying to help the village set up a small carpet and clothing factory. Her hope was that all of Iran's small villages would have their own business co-operatives, which would bring steady income to the poorest citizens of Iran. She eventually wrote two more books describing her life and work, <i>Reveille for a Persian Village</i> (1960) and <i>A Wall and Three Willows</i> (1967).</p>

<p>Slafting</p>
<p>I live and work as part of a small community of slate workers in North Wales. Slate has traditionally been used as a roofing material, being a shale/rock easily split into sheets of 3-4mm thickness. Slafting is the name miners and slate workers in Gwynedd and some parts of Powys use to describe spliting the very thinest of pieces of slate. A Piece of slate is considered ready to use when it is less than 6mm thick, slafters think that slates as thin as 5mm can be split again. If you've got slate tile roof built in the last fifty years it's more than likely that the slates on your roof have been slafted.</p>

<p>Plants that eat other creatures? It sounds like a genetic experiment gone awry. But there's actually nothing unnatural about it; carnivorous plants have existed on this planet for thousands of years. There are more than 500 different kinds of these plants, with appetites ranging from insects and spiders to small, one- or two-cell aquatic organisms. To be considered carnivorous, a plant must attract, capture, kill and digest insects or other animal life.</p>
<p>One carnivorous plant in particular has captured the public's imagination: The Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). Many people first see this amazing plant in action during their elementary school years, and are fascinated by its strange dietary habits and unique appearance. It is green.</p>
