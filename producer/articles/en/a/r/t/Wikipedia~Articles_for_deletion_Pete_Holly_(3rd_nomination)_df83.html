<p>This article is about a musician with claims to notability including Grammy Award nominations ... the problem is, most of these claims are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>.</p>
<p>This article has been up for deletion twice before. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pete_Holly_b5f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pete Holly">first time</a>, it was deleted. After that, it was created in the Wikipedia namespace for some reason, then moved into the main namespace and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pete_Holly_%282nd_nomination%29_5548.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pete Holly (2nd nomination)">nominated for deletion</a> again, where it was closed as a "no consensus keep". In response to the "no consensus keep", I added {{fact}} templates to the article in hopes of encouraging the subject's fans to improve the verifiability of the claims. However, that was over three months ago, and nobody has made a single edit to the article since then until it was nominated for AfD.</p>
<p>As to the substantive claims in the article, Pete Holly's web site says "-4-GRAMMY NOMINATIONS FOR "PETE HOLLY III"- -INCLUDING ONE FOR THE VIDEO "HEART OF GOLD"-in 2006-" yet his name never appears on the most recent year's <a href="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/Annual_Show/48_nominees.aspx" rel="nofollow">list of Grammy nominees</a>. The article only claims that Holly has "received 4 first round nominations from "The Recording Academy"" but there is no such thing as a "first round nomination" in the Grammys. Entries to the Grammys are screened to determine eligibility, but the Grammy web site explains that "The purpose of screenings is not to make artistic or technical judgments about the recordings, but rather to make sure that each entry is eligible and placed in its proper category." <a href="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The only recordings that can be considered "nominees" for the Grammys are those which make the final five choices in each category, which I don't believe Pete Holly has ever done.</p>
<p>Maybe Pete Holly really does meet one or more of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria, but the article really needs verification from reliable sources, because I have never seen a musician's web site blatantly lie about his receiving Grammy nominations in the same way that Holly's does. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete and protect</b> - looks like some kind of joke. <a href="http://www.bestprices.com/cgi-bin/vlink/musicartists/cds-by-artist-Pete-Holly.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bestprices.com/cgi-bin/vlink/musicartists/cds-by-artist-Pete-Holly.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> supports the notion that such an artist exists, but they all appear to not be in stock (suggesting self-published at best). All other hits point to out-of-date wikipedia mirrors (!) and myspace/sites that point to myspace. My first guess is, serial hoax. Someone named Pete Holly does have some albums, but a grammy nominee's CDs would be in stock *somewhere*. The link I provide there shows him as the producer and sound engineer, suggesting self-released. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 05:09, 11 September 2006 (UTC) - addendum - since this has been deleted so many times and notability hasn't been verifiably established, <b>salt the earth</b>. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 05:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Did you look at Amazon? They have his albums in stock. Besides, having an album out of stock in an online store and a crappy website are not criteria for deletion. BTW, this is only the 3rd nomination for deletion. The previous ones were closed as no consensus. It hasn't been deleted before. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 13:47, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I stand corrected. But that is still not a reason to delete and protect this version.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Malber's comment regarding three albums on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orchard_%28music_label%29_8539.html" title="The Orchard (music label)">The Orchard (music label)</a> is problematic to me. If one goes to their website, one will find that The Orchard is, as near as I can tell, a distributor of albums for independent musicians and small labels - but it is not a record label, producer, etc. They distribute more than 14,000 artists. I would suspect I could get distributed by them if I were to record something and pay them enough. The artist thus fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 16:35, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
