<dd>In some cases yes. However except for a few saints and maybe pop singers whose notability comes even partly from being a virgin? Many of these people are noted as eccentrics, but not specifically as virgins. Plus not doing something is not all that much of an accomplishment. We do have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_teetotalers.html" title="List of teetotalers">List of teetotalers</a>, which is an oldfashiony name for "List of non-alcohol drinkers", but in least there's some kind of political or historical justification. Possibly, in line with the eccentric one, it could be renamed ""List of people known for being virgins" as that's a bit more ambiguous.(You can be known for it without it necessarily being true) Or the most appropriate names could be put in the article on <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">Virginity</a>.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>BTW-I am aware there is also a List of people who claimed never to sleep, but I haven't checked it out for months. It seemed interesting as an idea at first, but it seems to be going nowhere. I don't really want to put it on delete, I'll avoid that after this as I rarely do deletes right, but if it were I don't think I'd vote to keep it either. Although in least it does modify it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just plain silly. If this was a list of people who are <b>primarily</b> known for their virginity, I might buy it, but that would be a pretty short list (The Virgin Mary. Period.)

Some people just don't talk about their sex lives, it doesn't mean they don't have one. In other cases it's even more out there.

<dd>Okay. On the litany of what they aren't, "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics such as quotations, aphorisms or persons. If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project Wikiquote. Of course, there is nothing wrong with having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic. Wikipedia also includes reference tables and tabular information for quick reference." Now did Tesla significantly contribute to virginity? Was he some sort of activists for it? Likewise if it turned out Newton fathered a bunch of illegitimate kids would it effect his role in history much or at all? The only cases where I see this matter is where they were advocates for virginity, like religious figures, or they were in a famous legal case showing they were a virgin(like Ruskin), or in cases where it lead to unproven allegations of homosexuality.(Which in the nineteenth century and earlier could be dangerous) If it could be whittled down to such people I could maybe see it. As for the Virgin Mary I think the dispute there is that in many Protestant faiths it is believed she was a virgin when she had Jesus, but not afterward. That Jesus had siblings and that these came through the union of Mary and Joseph. Orthodoxy I think teaches the "brothers" mentioned in the Bible are children from an earlier marriage of Joseph. Catholicism states they were cousins. I don't think Islam is concerned with the issue, but I believe it does state Mary was ever virgin until death. Still in the English speaking world the Protestant view is quite important and their concerns couldn't be dismissed without getting POV.(Although a better word then "disputed" might be used. Maybe "not universally accepted" or something)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 13:23, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Its funny how the virginity of the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_7f1f.html" title="Blessed Virgin Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> is <i>disputed</i>, but not that of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, to cite two eminent figures on this list.

<li>I don't even know why Britney Spears is on the list. I think she was on it a while ago, and then someone removed her, and apparently someone's put her back on? Silliness. And I have no problem with putting "disputed" tags on everyone listed, but what we should do is have a link next to each "disputed" leading to a source that has actually disputed it, and do the same for the opposite side: require noteworthy sources to include any contentious individual on the list. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm pretty sure this was a bad faith nomination (T. Anthony's made a few of these nominations to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> recently because some lists he's worked hard on have recently been VfDed), but maybe it just seems that way to me because I can't find a single valid reason on this entire page to actually delete this thing. Odd. "Hard to verify" is no more a qualifier for deletion than "possibly absurd"—we have plenty of absurd Featured Articles, for god's sake!
<ul>
<li>A few? I've only done two others in my whole time here that I recall. Putting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> on AfD was bad faith and I've repented of that in a huge way. The only other truly bad faith nomination I made was <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationmaster.html" title="Nationmaster">Nationmaster</a> to shock them from their snarky edit wars. This was partly bad faith, but partly not. Because how is this <b>not</b> a random association of people with almost nothing in common? What does Brittney Spears have in common with Samuel Tilden? How did these people contribute to virginity? How are they well known for being associated with it? This was bad faith in the sense that if it hadn't been for that spate of deletions I wouldn't have cared. However when I was working on it I really did think this was pointless and silly. Or at the very least I think it needs renamed to "List of alleged virgins." Also I've argued for deletion here, in cases where I was acting in bad faith I at most gave a non-committal "maybe I was doing the right thing for the wrong reasons" kinds of statements.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>"I'd never heard that Newton was a virgin before this and frankly I still kind of doubt it." - Comments like this are a better validation for why this article is valuable than any argument I could make.&#160;:) This stuff is interesting, and not common knowledge. Newton is indeed relatively famous for his virginity (though obviously no hard evidence exists that he remained a virgin, just as there is no hard evidence for most general information on historical figures), but the fact that it's not totally mainstream knowledge makes the more <i>more</i> useful than if everyone already knew everything on it!
<ul>
<li>If this is so then most lists on the basis of little known facts should be kept. For example List of cat haters should've survived.

<li>"List of cat haters" was deleted because it was trivial and POV, not because it was "hard to research"&#160;:) "Cat hater" is a POV expression, and a list of people who dislike a specific type of animal is not significant (possibly "List of people famous for hating a species of animal" or similar in the future). Virginity, on the other hand, <i>is</i> a valid and long-lasting topic of great historical interest, and noteworthy people who have been very strongly considered virgins, either today or in the past, are a worthy encyclopedic topic. Also, "cat hater" is relatively unencyclopedic because it's much, much harder to falsify than virginity: people change their interests over the course of their life, and being <i>cruel</i> to cats at some point doesn't necesarily mean you "hate" them, so unless someone wrote a treatise on how horrible cats are, how can we establish them as "cat haters"? Most of the entries in "cat haters" were based on a singular event where a person wasn't especially nice to cats, whereas most of the entries in "list of virgins" are based on a <i>lifetime</i> of apparent celibacy that was marked enough to make that individual famous for it afterwards. And even if it was all just an act, as long as we provide sources for all the disputable entries on the list, there's no reason whatsoever not to provide that information, anymore than there's reason to not provide information on <i>any</i> disputable, but noteworthy, topic. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:54, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Just plain silly. If this was a list of people who are primarily known for their virginity, I might buy it, but that would be a pretty short list (The Virgin Mary. Period.)" - Isn't cultural ignorance swell?&#160;:3 Yes, the only person famous for his/her virginity in all of human history is the Virgin Mary. Whee. And Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas!</li>
<li>And, incidentally, the day this article is renamed to "List of famous virgins" is the day I quit Wikipedia forever.&#160;:) That is positively the worst suggestion I have ever heard in my entire life, and betrays a shocking lack of understanding of Wikipedia lists, categories, and articles in general that would require us to do silly things like changing every "YEAR deaths" to "Famous YEAR deaths" ("famous 1887 deaths" instead of "1887 deaths"), every "Category:African-Americans" to "Category:Famous African-Americans", every "List of sexual positions" to "List of famous sexual positions", and hundreds of thousands of other pages besides. All lists are inherently assumed to only include noteworthy and famous entries; including it in the title of the page would be the <i>worst</i> kind of redundancy possible. .. I'm glad we're thinking, though!&#160;:D -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 07:43, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oops I hadn't seen this was you Silence. Sorry if I sounded snarky above. Anyway I don't think I agreed with naming it famoud virgins, because I think that sounds silly. However when it comes to uncertain things it has become common to add purported or considered. Like List of people widely considered eccentric or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a>. I'd prefer purported or considered be added, but I don't support the "famous" word being added.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li>Sometimes that's the case, but then, look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_agnostics.html" title="List of agnostics">List of agnostics</a> and many similar lists.&#160;:) If we mention <i>in the article</i> where there's concerns and cite plenty of sources and describe each entry properly (as I've recommended for this article above, and is a good way to start cleaning up the article; sorry if I was too snappy above, it's just that I'm starting to get a bit tired of people nominating lists for VfD every time they see a problem <i>with the list text</i> rather than with the subject matter—a cleanup tag is so much more helpful than a VfD one!), then we can leave the article at its current name just fine. Plus if we don't do that, we could set up a precedent where people will start changing every list of people into a "list of purported X" even when there are only a couple of people listed who are disputed and everyone else on the list is certain. "Purported" should be reserved for things like retrospective diagnoses on autism and epilepsy (as it is now), since those are the truly speculative things, trying to apply recent terminology to historical individuals; the science of virginity, on the other hand, has changed relatively little since thousands of years ago.&#160;:) -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 19:54, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"a cleanup tag is so much more helpful than a VfD one" I very much agree. I wish some of the lists I'd worked on had been given verify or cleanup first. In many cases I wasn't given any sense there was a problem until they were put on a delete vote. I would've in least liked a warning in the talk page.</dd>

<dd>That said this list has received warnings before. I failed to mention it, but this was not the first time this was placed on VfD. Also the subject itself does strike me as kind of weird and unencyclopedic or unreferencelike. I've seen lists by religion, race, ethnicity, and in modern times sexual orientation in reference books. I don't think I've ever seen lists concerning virginity anywhere. Also by the logic of allowing this list it seems to open the door on general sexual behavior lists. Do we really want List of people with over a 1000 sexual partners or List of people who fathered kids after 90?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.
