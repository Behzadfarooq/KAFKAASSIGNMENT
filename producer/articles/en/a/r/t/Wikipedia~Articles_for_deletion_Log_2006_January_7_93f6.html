<li><s><b>Comment</b></s>: Let's hold on just a moment here. The article as written is (by virtue of the source) OR, but Professor Google says that Johnkannaus is "a West African fertility ritual associated with the yam harvest and revolving around a cast of colorfully-costumed dancers.". So maybe there is some potential for an encyclopaedic article here? That said, this is not that article. and any unrelated sources are proving elusive... - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:02, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with the logic above. As nom states, each battle has its own article. A reason therefore needs to be provided to justify an additional article that does nothing more than recapitulate the content of the separate entries. There is none implied in this article, nor can I see how one could be given; additionally, further work on these engagements would be better focused on their individual pages - this is a distraction that adds nothing.

It seems to be popular with 5th, 6th, and 7th-graders. Though I can't stand the video nor the song personally, my son and most of his friends love them, right up there with Al Yankovic. Because of its widespread audience, it is a notable achievement, and the creator(s) of the music video deserve mention (and rotton tomatoes). In relation to the video, "backtothefuture" comes up 741 times on Google, crediting him with creating this animated piece of ____. Therefore, due to the widespread distribution and viewing of his creation, I believe backtothefuture qualifies as a notable individual as per Wikipedia policy.

<p>This is a completely idiosyncratic nontopic. It verges on original research because, unlike <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Ivies_e052.html" title="Public Ivies">Public Ivies</a>, there is no definitive list of which schools are included, and no objective standard for which schools qualify. A few sources are cited but they do not demonstrate that the phrase is a true idiom with a well-defined meaning. The phrase simply consists of the combination of a metonymic usage of "Harvard" (to mean "exceptionally good school") with the name of a region of the country, followed by mostly unsourced opinion about which are the exceptionally good schools of the Midwest. Midwestern Ivy League was, properly, deleted; this is just another attempt to reinsert similar material in a different guise.

<li>AFD <b>is</b> a debate; that's why it had its name changed from Votes for Deletion to Articles for Deletion. The problem is that often there can never be a winner, because there are bound to be crucial things which are simply a matter of opinion, and not fact. For instance, that perennial bugaboo, notability. Some people refuse to even accept it as a legitimate reason to delete, while others have different definitions of notability. For instance, this article is notable, IMO, because it compiles a list of different slang words regarding sex without necessitating the creation of a few dozen/hundred articles on each of those slangs, many of which are probably in themselves notable. You, on the other hand, disagree. It's purely a matter of opinion. This is why debates have limitations when it comes to real solutions to real problems. AfD is currently a hybrid of a debate, a vote and something else entirely. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>On the contrary, Voice of All's nomination does not rely on notability one inch. It cites several bases in policy, not a one of which has been challenged by those saying "keep, because, oh well, because I can't be bothered to work on it myself by detest deletion of lists on principle".

<li>Indeed. While I believe that notability is what stops this encyclopedia from ballooning in size by 100 fold with cruft, that cost money to mantain on the servers, that is not the only reason I listed this.

If there's an issue with the content, and the content is salvageable (which at least some of it is), the appropriate action is to tag it for cleanup.

<li>You can't expect editors to follow up their AfD votes like that, watching articles to see if they're cleaned up, re-AfD'ing them after a time if they're not, perhaps contacting the other Keep-if-cleaned-up voters. It's too time-consuming. Also, its inefficent for each voter to follow up their own vote. Here I have done a batch follow-up for all these votes. They made their wishes clear at the time, and it's been <i>six months</i>. I think that's long enough to qualify as "cleanup was not implemented" for the purposes of <i>those</i> (August) votes. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:30, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You must be joking. As you know, proxy voting is not allowed.

<li>Keep does not equal "Keep if cleanup up". The condition has not been meet after 6 months. Now, I do not believe that they still hold 1:1 weight with new votes, but they do have significant weight. What is "insulting" is to just dismiss the conditions of people who had optamistic votes.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">Voice</font> <font color="darkblue">of</font> <font color="black">All</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_da05.html" title="User talk:Voice of All(MTG)"><font color="blue">T</font></a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Voice_of_All%28MTG%29_2563.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Voice of All(MTG)">@</a>|<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">ESP</font></a></sup> 22:19, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>A little humor isn't going to cause AfD to burst into flames. It highlights how ... unserious the concept of voting on behalf of random people is. Sorry, Voice of All, but I don't find your assertion that we need mind theoretical votes by hypothetical voters (who can't be bothered to be <b>here</b>, now) to be credible.

<li><b>Comment</b> To expand on my keep vote earlier, and directly address the nominators concerns:
<ul>
<li><i>WP:CITE and WP:V</i> -- I maintain that the items on this page *can* be verified and cited, thus the problems of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are cleanup problems for individual items on the list, not the page as a whole. If it turns out that every item on the page fails WP:CITE and is thus removed, then the page can be deleted at that time for having no content.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> 1.1.1</i> -- which says <i>please do not create an entry merely to define a term</i>. This is a list of terms, not a definition of a single one. While some may only be "dicdefs", they are important in the context of the page.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> 1.2.3</i> -- which prohibits <i>lists of such definitions.</i> However, this page is more than that: it has text at the top, references, and most important, many of the terms are hyperlinked to actual articles (thus, it is not just a list of dicdefs).</li>
<li><i>This list includes terms from several languages with nothing to assert their validity</i> -- They should be removed if not validated, regardless of the language: see above.</li>
<li><i>While some of these are obvious actuall terms, most are likely just cruft and made-up nonsense</i> -- an argument for cleaning up, not deleting.</li>
<li><i>...the last AFD was ridden with numerous sockpuppets</i> -- that's a matter for Deletion Review. The article should be evaluated as it exists, not because it somehow "escaped" AfD deletion earlier.</li>
<li>Overall, the "no lists of dicdefs" is the only real argument here, but that fails if for no other reason that there are items on the list that link to genuine established non-dicdef articles. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 03:22, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That would make sense if there is good evidence that Comerica City is normally associated with the Penuts strip. A Google for "Comerica City" Peanuts reveals precisely one hit - and that's the author's edit to add this list to the article on <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanuts_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Peanuts (comic strip)">Peanuts (comic strip)</a>. As far as I can tell (and I am not a Peanuts weenie) the name Comerica City was made up by the author and is not used elsewhere, certainly not in the strip itself. If this is wrong then I will change my vote to merge for all verifiable information - but here again we may have an issue since the only source I can find for any of these names is the author's Wikipedia articles. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Since the article was re-written as a stub, I struck out my original opinions. Now I just say its non-notable and non-encyclopedic. A game hack? From 1989?

<li>I think what he's saying is, there's lots of software in the world. A particular piece of software with no indication of importance doesn't need an article. Putting whatever sources are available into the article would surely help, but IMO just because it's reviewd on a website doesn't make it encyclopedic. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 05:10, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> The concept is not recognised nor in use. There is no political party that makes this supposed movement a part of its platform. A google search for "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" in English, Bosnian, and Serbian, comes up with zero results, aptly illustrating the fact that this alleged movement is unknown even locally. The sources used to justify the alleged movement nearly all come from highly controversial radical serb sites with obvious agendas (i.e. SrpskaMreza), or succumb to logical fallacies. It is a clear case of "partisan screed, or opinion masquerading as fact", which is listed as one of the basic reasons why an article should be deleted. For instance, the article states that the political goal "is often hidden behind the pro-European and pro-democratic rhetorics of the Bosniak politicians..." - the article's lone author clearly making an opinionated judgement of the "<i>real</i>" intentions of politicians who promote the exact opposite of this alleged policy. Furthermore, none of these "ethnic Bosniak politicans" described in the article would ever agree to be supporting this idea. There is absolutely no valid reason to keep this article; the topic is not grounded in reality and is a clear attempt to insert a highly controversial POV and bias into wikipedia. The few valid facts that the article might have should be integrated into existing and undisputed articles where they would belong. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 06:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - for all reasons above. Interestingly the article appeared while high profile negotiations are taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding constitutional changes that need to re-define the structure of the country.

<p>Yes Dado this article is certainly part of their Greater serbian conspiracy! now they want to influence negotiations through Wikipedia! It should be deleted!!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The name of the article was changed into Bosniak nationalism, and I do not think that anybody would deny that such nationalism exist. If we have articles about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_nationalism.html" title="Croatian nationalism">Croatian nationalism</a>, why not about this one too? Is it a taboo or what. Also, I wrote this article for the sake of the neutrality policy of Wikipedia, since much is written on Wikipedia about Serbian nationalism with the purpose to demonize Serbian people. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> article is much larger POV that this, but I do not deny that some small number of Serbs support this idea. Who can say here that only Serbian nationalism exist, and Bosniak one not? For the NPOV policy, both nationalisms should have their own articles. As for my sources, I posted them here: Talk:Bosniak nationalism. Can you explain why these sources are not credible? You just used word "not credible", with no explanation why. For example, here are excerpts from the "Islamic declaration" written by Alija Izetbegović, a former Bosnian president: <a href="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/licnosti/izetbegovic.2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/licnosti/izetbegovic.2.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> This is simply an inflammatory piece of Serbian propaganda. The original concept that was the originall title does not exist as per the talk page for the piece, and later edits are an attempt to imply that Bosniak political parties want a mono-ethnic "Greater Bosnia". Whilst there is a mountain of evidence to suggest the reverse is true, the author has been unable to demonstrate that mainstream Bosniak parties actually espouse this view. Vague references to "Bosniak nationalism" from mostly Serbian propaganda sources are not enough to make the case. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlihodza_8f58.html" title="User:Alihodza">Alihodza</a> 11:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> Bosniak nationalism? does such a thing exist? no it does not! and it is a totally ridiculuos attempt to remove attention from serbian nationalism by insolently accusing bosniaks of the same thing. Bosniak/bosnian authorities or goverment has never expressed any nationalism, as far as I know it is the serbian jugoslavic goverment who are the ones accused of ethnic cleansing and agression on countries in the balkans. All bosniaks did during the war was to defend Bosnia from being split up between neighbouring countries. And all bosniaks do after the war is to keep the country together. Therefore such a thing as bosniak nationalism does not exist, if you doubt please then look at the war datas from the war and you will see that bosniak civilians died 30 times more than serbian or croatian civilans.

<li>Or we can view it as I have helped repair those articles by removing term that is clearly disputed (at least until it is decided if the term "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" should remain on this Wikipedia). Your attempt to make a political issue of this voting is not wellcomed. Your attack on my intentions and my right to vote and be equally respected here have been noted as a personal attack.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs a lot of work but the checking that I have done has discovered some Bosnian politicians who have made arguments which are along these lines.

Cohen, p. 144). I have also seen characterizations of Izetbegovic's earlier writings such as the Islamic Declaration which are of the nationalist kind. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 20:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Alija Izetbegovic's "Islamic Declaration" does not mention Bosnia or Bosniaks once, while the Sandzak comment in no way supports the alleged "irredentist" nature as it has nothing to do with territorial ambitions seeing as it took place at a time when all the regions were one country.. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 20:30, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, Islamic Declaration has nothing to do with the subject. <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Malcolm_acfc.html" title="Noel Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> explained in his book "Bosnia: A Short History" (Chapter "Bosnia and Death of Yugoslavia: 1989-1992") that the book has nothing to do with neither fundamentalism nor nationalism. He explained how Serb propaganda took same quotes from the context (there you can read some examples) trying to present this book as something it is not. For instance the main part of the book is about moral values in Islam. It is generally about muslims all over the world. The second thing is that the user who first created this article as "Unitary Islamic Bosnia" has himself stated that "This article is crap" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bosniak_nationalism#I_give_up..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bosniak_nationalism#I_give_up..." rel="nofollow">[13]</a> because he thought that Serbs were demonized in every discussion.

<ul>
<li>My vote was the first on the top of this page. As far as I'm aware, moving a page to a new location as soon as its brought up for deletion isn't exactly an established practice on AfD either. I merely added a comment to my original vote to reinforce my point following your bad attempt to save an inherently POV article.

<li>The quote is taken out of context. The user wrote <i>The article is crap, as most other articles related to Bosnia and Herzegovina (this country is a lost case for the goals of Wikipedia).</i> Apparently, he refers to state of the article after your edits and Dado's edits (you are responsible for that situation in BH-related articles).

<li>You forget to mention that right after he noted that the article was "crap" he explained that he created it as a form of retribution to percieved bias against Serbs elsewhere on wikipedia. And what "situation in BH-related articles" am I responsible for? Getting them featured on the front page? What exactly have you done to improve the state of BH-related articles? Better yet, what haven't you done to make the situation worse? Every BH-related article you have touched has turned into an edit-war. From being struck down in your <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrupt_bargain.html" title="Corrupt bargain">corrupt bargain</a>-like nomination for administrator due to extreme bias and nationalism to runing everything you touch, you are not one to talk about responsibilty for the current state of balkan-related articles. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 22:02, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Despite this, supporters of keeping the article (nearly all of them users from the Serbian language wikipedia) claim that it should be kept considering the presence of other "(people name) nationalism" articles on wikipedia. Ignoring for a second the giant logical fallacy in this argument (Should wikipedia also have articles on "<a href="../../../f/u/r/Fur_%28people%29.html" title="Fur (people)">Fur</a> nationalism" or "Nationalism in <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichtenstein.html" title="Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein</a>"?), or the fact that all such articles about nationalism in the region were created by these same Serbian users, it should be noted that a google search for Bosniak nationalism finds less than .5% of the total number of sites a similar search for "Serbian/Serb" nationalism does, while a serbian language search finds a whopping one article (a wikipedia discussion page). No matter how persistently its twisted or presented to appear acceptable, this was and still is a poor attempt to force POV into wikipedia. I thus hope that well-meaning members of our community will join the effort to not let Wikipedia's credibility be ruined by inherently biased and irrepairable articles put forward by proponents of the by now infamous Serb radicalism. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 20:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Some users here said that Bosniak nationalism doesn't exist. An example of it which recently stirred much controversy is a statement by Bisera Turkovic, Bosnian ambassador to the US, and one of the founders of Bosniak SDA, together with Izetbegovic. She said that "it will take time, but people in B&amp;H will certainly stop calling themselves Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks and they will all inevitably become Bosnians"<a href="http://www.vjesnik.com/pdf/2005\11\19\10A10.PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vjesnik.com/pdf/2005\11\19\10A10.PDF" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. (If you don't understand how is this a statement of Bosniak nationalism, you should note that "Bosniaks" actually means "Bosnians" and hence Bosniaks speak, not Bosniak language, but Bosnian language. Naming of the language is intentionally chosen as a step towards this goal.) I am adding this in the article at some of the places where citations are needed. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:43, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are again spreading incorrect information, as you did before and do now in Bosnian-related articles. I have just read her statement. First she said it was her personal opinion. Second, she said that Bosnia should follow USA model. It means that Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats should identify themselves with their own country Bosnia and Herzegovina as Americans do identify themselves with USA. Also, she says every man has right to preserve his/her ethnicity, religion, culture etc. Third, this is actually argument against "Bosniak nationalism". If someone says that Bosniaks should call themselves Bosnians it is not Bosniak nationalism, it is anti-Bosniak nationalism. <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniaks.html" title="Bosniaks">Bosniak</a> doesnt mean <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnians.html" title="Bosnians">Bosnian</a>.

<dd>Oh yes. Saying that when outside of the country people will present themselves as Bosnians instead of Bosniaks and then making sure to clarify that this is your personal view rather than a political policy is a wonderful example of Bosniak nationalism.

<li><b>Keep but edit</b> - Although he does seem to have a history of this sort of thing, I think user ‘Archibald Wednesday’ has actually written a genuine article here, although it perhaps needs a little revising to make it more accurate. The ‘Hillard Library’ isn’t really a library in the sense of a building, but a private collection of medieval texts actually kept in Buxlow Manor, which is closest to Snape in its postal address. The only reason I know of it is from an article I remember in the local newspaper from when I lived in Suffolk, where the British Museum were pushing for the texts to be released to the general public. I assume it was then opened to the public, although I’m surprised that there is nothing on Google about it. Perhaps they want to keep it quiet! Have you tried any of the other search engines? - Charles Bingham 10:54, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nah. Personally I think your evidence is strong enough that at best the article will be kept and expanded, and at worst it'll be merged and redirected into <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a>. But having the AFD discussion now will get that out of the way <i>before</i> you spend any significant amount of time expanding it (afterall, it'd suck if you spent a week or two expanding it, only to have it deleted again). BTW, my general feeling is that it should probably be merged into <a href="../../../p/o/d/Podcast.html" title="Podcast">Podcast</a> with <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godcast.html" title="Godcast">Godcast</a> redirecting there. (i.e. - give Godcast it's own section in Podcast for now). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 13:09, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>lol christianity what, that's not what I was talking about. Nobody cares how many lycos hits it got in December, that's not something that belongs in an encyclopedia article, and I presume it isn't some kind of all time internet record that is notable by itself. The whole article is basically talking about how popular it is, it has like 2 lines of information apart from that. Which could be merged into another article. The article simply has no substance.

<li>The article has just been created, and as I have asked repeatedly for time to write a good entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> with rewrite. Bear in mind as you consider my opinion that I'm the guy who coined the term. It's been in use, however, since the end of October, 2004 (only a few months after "podcasting" was coined) and is now widely accepted by both the media and the general public as the term used to refer to any type of religious podcast. And while it's true that news.google.com currently points to only 10 active references in the media as someone else pointed out (two of which are CNN and UPI), it has been referenced in hundreds of online and print articles over the past 14 months, starting with TIME Magazine in 12/04. So while I agree with those who argue that the entry needs to be rewritten from its current form, I don't buy into the argument that the term remains a neologism.

<li>Zoe, I've already said a disproportionate amount on this particular article, but I find this comment close to indefensible. What does it matter what an editor chooses to contribute to? If he'd done some copyediting or edited established articles that would have nothing to do with the worth of this article. Agenda?

<li>Gee, I don't know, telling people that their votes to keep the article deleted don't count, then when those voters object, they're told "eat me?" <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not evidence of an agenda (apart from trying to keep your own work on Wikipedia if you think it doesn't violate policy, which I would have thought we all have), that's ignorance of process and incivility.

<li><b>Keep</b> I found it useful when checking to see if any if my Spanish aquaintances had died</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; I am the person who made this article. I just want to explain why I think the English Wikipedia should have such an article. However, of course, if you think that this page should be deleted, go on. (Interested people can check this information in the Spanish version, if they understand Spanish.)
<ul>
<li>1) Most people argues that <i>"Wikipedia is not a memorial"</i>. Well, <b>this article should not be considered as a memorial page</b>, but as a page with additional information about the Madrid bombings. If you consider that the names of the people who died in Madrid are not relevant for Wikipedia, you can delete these names, but at least keep the information about the victims (for instance, why does usually appear the name of Francisco Javier Torrenteras between the people who died, although he did not die in the bombings; or why at first officially the media spoke about 202 casualties, instead of the real number, 190; or the fact that died people of 17 nationalities... etc). If this page is deleted, I think that this information should be added to the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, but, in order not to excede the amount of information that appears there, I think that the better solution is a page about the persons who dead there.
<p>I understand that, as the names of the victims takes up most of the article, many people could think that it is a memorial, but if you read it, you will see that there is more information (that has to be emproved and expanded, I know).</p>
</li>
<li>2) Before I made this article, I saw that someone (I don't know who), added in the <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings_1d6c.html" title="11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings">Madrid bombings article</a>, in the "See also" section, this hidden line:
<p>&lt;!-- * [[Casualties of the 11 March 2004 Madrid bombings]] --&gt;</p>
(as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=33405611" rel="nofollow">you can see in this edition of an <b>old version</b> of the article</a>), <b>claiming for such an article</b>.</li>
<li>3) <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_7486.html" title="User:Pádraic MacUidhir">P.MacUidhir</a> argues that <i>"Bombings are not unusual, and certainly not usually notable"</i>. I agree, bombings are not notable. But not all bombings are the same! Sadly, <a href="../../../e/t/a/ETA_5e56.html" title="ETA">ETA</a> is responsible for most bombings in Spain, but <b>the Madrid March 11 bombings were not at all usual</b>. It was the worse Al-Qaida attack in Europe. There died almost four times more people than in the <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July London bombings</a>. Millions of persons took part in the demonstrations against terrorism the day after (more or less the 28% of the Spanish population). Many poeple think that there was a political change in Spain because of these bombings (they happened three days before the March 14 general elections), and that the authors aimed this change; other people think that the former goverment lied supporting that ETA was the author of the attacks until the last moment, as they could lose the elections because of their support to the Bush' invasion of Iraq (it is still a very hot subject, and I don't want to give my opinion here, I just speak about the opinion of many people). I only want to say that obviously the Madrid bombings are, sadly, once again, a historical event, not only in Spain, but worldwide, such as the London bombings, the 9/11 or the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings_9e25.html" title="1998 U.S. embassy bombings">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a> in Kenya and Tanzania. I am not speaking in this point about the number of persons who died, but just about the importance and consequences of the event.</li>
<li>4) I saw that there was an article about the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualties_of_the_7_July_2005_London_bombings_233a.html" title="Casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings">casualties of the 7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, with the names of all the victims, and I thought that <b>there should be an equivalent article with the Madrid victims</b>. I don't want to think that nationalism should be so important in Wikipedia (when we speak about worldwide events), and the terrorism victims in England should not be more or less important than those who died in Spain. I saw too that there is an <a href="../../../../es/v/%C3%AD/c/V%C3%ADctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres_579e.html" class="extiw" title="es:Víctimas_de_los_atentados_del_7_de_julio_de_2005_en_Londres">article about the London victims in the Spanish wikipedia</a>, without the names (in my opinion this article lacks those names). Nevertheless, in the 9/11 died thousands of men and women, and I think that it is better there an external link, not because those persons were less important, but just because it would be too large; but maybe some persons who died in the 9/11 should appear in wikipedia (the many firefighters who died there? People who saved other people? For instance, William Rodríguez became famous, but he didn't die there). I think that the queston is not as simple as "there should appear all victims of terrorist attacks or none of them".</li>
<li>5) I made the article, as every article, thinking about it as a starting point. So, it should be extended and improved by other wikipedians. For example (as in the July London attacks), who died in each place (the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atocha.html" title="Atocha">Atocha Station</a>, or El Pozo, or Santa Eugenia, or the Téllez Street)? How many? Where were first carried? What does <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilar_Manj%C3%B3n_1578.html" title="Pilar Manjón">Pilar Manjón</a> (president of the Association for the victims of 11-M) think about the political reactions? These questions maybe could be too much for the principal article, but not for an article about victims, and it could contain interesting information for wikipedia. I think that <b>there should be a page of the same quality as that one about the London attacks</b>, and I hope that it will be so. I only contribute with my knowledge. I don't know many things about the London attacks, so I can't speak about them.</li>

<li>On re-reading the article's actual content, <b>keep</b> the article but the list/memorial/whatever you want to call it should be deleted. Keeping it would lead us to assume that you can't have a list of victims if the death toll is too small to be 'notable', and you can't have it if it's too big to include without disrupting the article.

<p>Delete. GSNForce is a relatively insignificant community with little cultural importance, and the article is a heavily biased advertisment for the site with no important, relevent, or factual information.</p>

<p>Suzanne Olsson is a published author, but beyond her one book she is neither notable nor enclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While the article is poorly written, the book seems somewhat notable. The article could probably benefit from being stripped back significantly and rebuilt. This can be addressed on the Talk page.
<ul>
<li>I don't want to appear to be persecuting this article--I promise I don't have anything against it personally!--but what evidence do you have for the book's notability? All I could come up with was 17 Google hits for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Jesus+%22Last+King+of+Kashmir%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Jesus+%22Last+King+of+Kashmir%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">'Jesus "Last King of Kashmir"'</a>, the most liberal formulation of the title I could think of, and all of them are either bookshop links or mentions on sites advancing Jesus-in-Kashmir theories themselves. - <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix">squibix</a> 23:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would disagree with the above opinion because if you google further, you will realize she remains in the public eye (and news) through two of her ongoing proects: First, she continues to build momentum for obtaining the DNA of the graves, DNA she will have compared with that found on the Shroud of Turin. Second, she continues to struggle against the theft and desecration of the ancient sites. She is working with world reknowned authors in the same genre, who are all seeking to stop the desecration before the sites go the way of the Bamiyam Buddha. She is an activist for this cause, and duly noteworthy for these reasons...I say let the page stay... Nandi</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. My vote is not objective though - I work for 24SevenOffice. The article is about the application not the company. 24SevenOffice is the most comprehensive web based application available and I belive that makes it notable enough for an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I understand the effort to reduce the presence of what are essentially adverts from wikipedia. However, if the article provides tangible and useful facts about the software, and is written in an impartial manner, I see no reason why - as an encyclopaedia - we cannot include such articles. They have their uses. It is one of the few places where one can find publically editable information about an application. There seem to be those who would not allow any articles about software just because a traditional encyclopaedia would not include them. There are also those who try to quantify importance, often using 'Google hits' or other such indicators. I believe that this is wrong.</li>
</ul>

<dd>My opinion is... allow articles for Software - no matter how small, PROVIDED that the software exists (not vapourware), the article is likely to be of use to someone researching the software and that any editors known to be linked to the company behave responsibly with regard to link inclusion. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_cowie_0ddd.html" title="User:Rob cowie">Rob cowie</a> 17:23, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The first three paragraphs make sense, but really need to be rewritten to be more accessible.

<li><b>Rewrite</b> The author really needs to determine the audience for whom the article is to be written.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I'm only a casual observer of physics, but the material seems to be legitimate, and Googling a couple of terms matches. I think the suggestion to <b>Rename</b> is good, but I'd suggest "Scalar-Tensor gravitation" as shorter and just as valid, since everything in physics is a theory.

<li><b>Keep</b> The format and information in the page was changed by now, so that it is more comprehensible than at the beginning. Moreover, the name scalar-tensor theory (maybe scalar-tensor theories of gravitation) should be the right one (such theories are found under that name in physical journals). The name describes a wide amount of different theoretical models that use these scalar fields along with tensor fields. I think, other kind of scalar-tensor theories, should come here, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>This theories (as models for nature) are surely used mainly on gravitation, but it might not have to be like that, although I don't know any Lagrangian of that form in other fields of physics. However, such Lagrangians (the basic of the theory) could certainly be used on other non-gravitational fields (I know, tensor calculus and metrica of General Relativity are used to work on sand and things like that), as part of phenomenological models (what would not say they are gravitational). However, it would be good if it is worked on the article... 141.70.111.178 15:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your argument is not making any sense. DeathMatch Pro was deleted as a non-notable game mod article to HL2 video game. Dystopia is another game mod article to HL2 video game. You have already said that Dystopia is "as notable as any other popular Half Life 2 mod." Therefore, if DeathMatch Pro was non-notable as a popular HL2 mod, Dystopia is also non-notable as a popular HL2 mod. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me rephrase. If, by your logic, <i>Dystopia</i> is non-notable because another "popular" <i>Half-Life 2</i> mod was deleted, then that still leaves many more <i>Half-Life 2</i> mods out that are considered notable, hence it is as notable as <i>them</i>. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 19:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You cannot make the statement that the other HL2 mods are considered notable as the notablity of those articles has not been tested. I can however say, that DeathMatch Pro, a HL2 mod was non-notable, because it's notability was tested and the result was that it was deleted as non-notable. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:22, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Consider this. DeathMatch Pro was only edited by two anons and one registered user whose main purpose was to advertise the mod. Now take a look at the Wikipedians who have edited an article like <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry%27s_Mod_2f9d.html" title="Garry's Mod">Garry's Mod</a>. I'm sure most of them feel it to be quite notable, tested or not. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 19:31, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't know the names of most of the video games out there, I don't really play many video games (I do own some), but in this particular case, since these articles were mentioned in the DeathMatch Pro Afd debate, I am following up the results of that debate to insure that the editing across Wikipedia is <b>consistant</b> (a constant problem for Wikipedia, consistancy of editing, I am just trying to help), at least in regards to the HL2 articles in the recent Afd debate. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's ridiculous. Counter-Strike is a mod of a game and <i>millions</i> of people play it. Are you really going to say it's non-notable?! There's a gradation of notability between game mods like Counter-Strike all the way down to an unreleased vaporware mod some people made up. Obviously the former belongs in Wikipedia and the latter doesn't, and the issue at hand is where in the continuum do you say "this is an acceptable topic for a Wikipedia article and this isn't"? Personally my criteria are thus: if the mod has a playable released version, has a website, and at any given time there are many people playing the mod, then it is "notable" enough. Dystopia meets these criteria. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 06:29, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Dystopia may be a relatively minor piece of human knowledge, but it is a significant piece nonetheless. As a relatively unique mod, and as a mod that has a fan base (small, but growing), it is as valid as any piece that is played, watched or viewed. It may be in the beginning of its life, but it has a following. If cult movies and TV shows have a place on Wikipedia, mods that have a following have a place too. If it can be (and is, or needs to be) referenced to, it belongs on Wikipedia. Where in the lifespan of a cultural item does it become a valid thing to be referenced? One million users? Two? After it has been around for a significant amount of time? As long as it is being followed (or had a period of significant following), it should be referenced. As long as it is unique, it should be referenced. --<a href="../../../t/s/s/User%7ETssha_fe4e.html" title="User:Tssha">Tssha</a> 12:02, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is asinine. I have a hunch that this AfD is simply the work of someone who feels their own mod is threatened by Dystopia. 'Notability'? Dystopia has been downloaded, what, 200,000 times? It's got over a million unique hits on the webpage? It's been in <b>HOW MANY</b> professional magazines? <a href="../../../u/r/a/User%7EUranium_-_235_0651.html" title="User:Uranium - 235">Uranium - 235</a> 04:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The online gaming scene is a cultural phenomenon, which over the last 5 years has quickly grown to be a socially acceptable and widely spread past time. This scene has been driven by modifcations for commercial games; Threewave CTF for Quake, Rocket Arena for Quake, Quake 2 and Quake 3, OSP for Quake 2 and Quake 3, and of course the best example: Counterstrike for Half-Life. To attempting to draw a line in the sand and say that ALL mods are "non-notable" is ridiculous. As for Dystopia, it's the 2nd most played 3rd party modification for Half-Life 2 with a user base of some 100,000 players. Lets at least put forward some scientific measure of what is considered notable, rather than putting things forward for deletion based on the feelings of someone who admits to have no interest and no knowledge on the topic. (Full disclosure: I am the project leader for Dystopia, thus incredibly biased. However, neither myself or any other development team member has edited the Dystopia page. The entry isn't here for advertising, it's here because obviously our fans feel that it's a worthy and notable contribution to the game modding phenomenon. It is a free product for which the developers recieve no monetary return, we are simply dedicated to creating a cool game.) Fuzzwah 04:39, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This mod is just like the Sourceforts article, it is a contributing member of the Half Life 2 Community. Is the Article on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_the_United_States_3325.html" title="Economy of the United States">Economy of the United States</a> a notable article, or should it be included in the basic article of the United States of America. this is a valid entry, and should stay. also, Dystopia mod is NOT a basic rip-off of HL2 Deathmatch, but a very unique game. If you play it, then you will see, this is as much of a diffence as HL2 Deathmatch is from Counter Stike Source. Dystopia is notable because it offers the Innovation of a truly dynamic style of play, and the ablility to fight in literaly two different maps at the same time. Also, a vote of Four against a pretty dead mod should NOT be the deciding factor on EVERY mod for Half Life 2. 4 people, as said in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SourceForts_b729.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SourceForts">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SourceForts</a>, is LESS than 1% of the total Wikipida viewer base. also, if you say Dystopia is Not Inherintly notable, than Counterstrike Source, Day Of Defeat Source and Half life 2 Deathmatch artilces should also be deleted, as they are "Not Inharintly Notable" Because they all were once mods! ~Kylegar</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a SourceForts dev and longstanding member of the community, I find it absolutely ridiculous, if not offense, that GestaltG thinks a four person vote on ONE particular mod gives him mandate to mark ALL HL2 mods for deletion, regardless of their popularity or uniqueness. HL2DM Pro was not notable because it made negligible changes to HL2DM, a game released by Valve. Dystopia, like many other HL2 mods ARE notable because they make HUGE changes to the game which the mod is built on, making it an entirely new and unique game. GestaltG's argument is that a mod's status as a mod is enough to negate its creative and unique aspects, and I think we can all see how such an argument is totally ridiculous, if not laughable. Someone should mark his Beastmaster article for deletion, since it's nothing more than "useless fancruff and an advertisement", such a thing should be saved for a fansite by his logic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I find it quite odd that anyone would consider a mod of this popularity "non-notable". Hell, there was a point where members playing dystopia outnumbered members playing HL2 deathmatch. I think this attitude is honestly coming from overly conservative thinkers that do not realize that just because a video game is made on the same engine as the source engine does not mean that it is inherently the same game or somhing lesser. If that were the case then Quake 4 articles should be deleted because Quake 4 is really just a mod of Doom3.~Somniloquist</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Mods can be notable, depending on creativity, uniqueness, or popularity. Hidden:Source may not be the most popular mod, but it is certainly creative and unique. Absolutely no reason to regard it as not notable, when many retail games that are not mods are less creative or unique, and are regarded as notable. --EntRo 23:20, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As was agreed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro</a> debate, individual mods for video games are not inherently notable and don't deserve Wikipedia articles, no matter how colorful and well written. SourceForts is another HL2 Mod article and on this same principle, I move it for deletion as non-sense. Additionally, this article and game mod articles of it's kind are advertizements stuck into Wikipedia and are matter more suitable for fan sites and game promotional websites, neither of which is a function of Wikipedia. I nominate this page for deletion as useless fancruft and an advertizement because of these reasons. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 18:45, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> 4 votes does not a precedent make. Each article must be handled on a case by case basis and in this case I think SourceForts is sufficiently notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I just don't see the logic on stating that a mod's wikipedia entry is an 'advertizement'. I guess an encyclopedia entry on soft drinks is an 'advertizement' because it mentions Dr. Pepper. Plus, our article is more of a history of our mod, rather than an overview of its key features. - <b><a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStieffers_7365.html" title="User:Stieffers">Stieffers</a></b> 22:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, If this is an advertisement, are you going to get rid of the CS:S article too? The first version is the most popular online game ever, but if this "precedent" is to get rid of any mod pages, I guess that will have to go, too... Finnegar</li>
<li><b>NOTE</b> As a developer of SourceForts I may be considered biast, hence this is not a vote. However, I believe SourceForts to be representative along with Gmod of a new genre of construction games based on physics simulations. It would seem to be a shame to lose a record of what may prove to be a starting point in gaming history. - Voltaire 22:11, January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Voltaire" has a good point here. It seems to me that the people voting "Delete" have not played this game. If you had, you'd realize how revolutionary it is. It's pretty much the first FPS where you build the map in-game and then go on to fight in it. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 22:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, It's absolutely ridiculous to use such a broad interpretation of "adverti<b>s</b>ement". The SourceForts article contains an overview of the mod's history, and while you may not find it particularly interesting, community members do. Likewise, I don't find the history of Bolivia's economy very interesting, but many might, which make it a legitimate encyclopedic entry. I'm curious why you're focusing your efforts solely on Half-Life 2 mods, and not Half-Life 2 itself, or other games. Further, I'm curious as to how you can consider your article on the Beastmaster series, GestaltG, anything other than an advertisement if you consider this article to be such. SourceForts stands as a unique game, offering unique gameplay experiences that defy current genres, and it's certainly one of the first to do so, which may very well turn out to be a landmark in computer gaming history. That alone is plenty reason to consider it a legitimate encyoclopedic entry. -EntRo 22:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, From a personal perspective I use wikipedia as a first port of call for information on anything. The article is a history and description of a somewhat revolitionary mod rather than any advertisement. -ICR 22:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I feel this article is worthy of keeping. The article is fairly well written and encompasses not only a description of the mod's features but also of its <i>history,</i> making it more than a mere advertisement. In addition, it is worthy of note as a modification, breaking previous definitions of gaming genres/modes. It is a landmark in mods. 00:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This is probably the best and most well designed mod available for HL2 right now. If you delete this, get rid of the [Counter Strike] article.. after all, CS is a HL1 mod. Why should preference be given to it just because it is larger then SourceForts?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This mod is Very origianl. Granted, Deathmatch Pro isnt very original, just a group of people making small changes to a game already released by VALVe. Sourceforts, on the otherhand, is on the same line as mods such as Dystopia, Art Of Acencion, Counterstrike(when it was a mod), Day Of Defeat (when it was a mod) and coutless otheres that brought in ORGINAL content into the game and making it fun. Also, as a Sourceforts Community member, i see this article, not as an advertisement for the mod, but as a informative article about the History of Sourceforts (which i was around for most of it and can verify its integrity) and how far the mod has come. Kylegar Jan 9th (9:22 PM PST)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This article is just as meriotus of being here as any other mod article, and you don't see event the most trigger happy deleter suggesting that all mod articles get removed. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthdavid_2ec2.html" title="User:Darthdavid">Darthdavid</a> 05:23, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Wiki pages are not free web hosting for mods, nearly all mods have sites up before distribution, not to mention distribution servers. If a mod has the ability to host several hundred megabytes of digital content in distribution packages per download then it is able to host it's own web space. Mods are not the game that they modify. Game engines are incredibly open ended and what can be done with an individual game engine. Mods entirely or partially create all new game content and play styles, and have completely separate communities from their senior engines and often the general modding community. Mods are not a lower form of gaming then a retail project such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Vampire%7E_The_Masquerade_-_Bloodlines_935f.html" title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> which is a full length real time role play title made using the HalfLife2 engine. The only notable differences are licensing, profit distribution and the fact that the development teams are armature led and unpaid. The Source Forts wiki page is informative encyclopedic and contains a relevant development and community history as well as purely non-technical facts about the game. It's also the first mod or game to combine base defense game play with capture the flag in a full open 3d environment. The Source Forts wiki page is no more free advertising for Source Forts then any other wiki page is for any other retail release or project. Wikipedia is for everyone. People who don’t play games should not be telling gaming communities information that is highly relevant to us is not valid Wikipedia material. <a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwiftSpear_ffca.html" title="User:SwiftSpear">SwiftSpear</a> Jan 9th (12:58 PM PST)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I also do not see why mods of games may not be on WikiPedia. Why would this article be removed? I dont see this article violating any rules. Please state why you want it to be removed, except for your own personal oponion. Because you are against the modding of games, doesnt mean it shouldnt be on WikiPedia. Mods are video games too, just as much as other video games, so they should have the right to have their articles. TommieV 16:07, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I thnk its good to have a wiki page on all these mods as its a good way to get across information about these mods to people who dont know much about them and its more presentable <a href="../../../w/e/l/User%7EWelsh_c865.html" title="User:Welsh">Welsh</a> 16:40, 10 January 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This article is nor an advertisement, or a 'personal website'. The link to the SourceForts true homepage is neither highly opressive, or for that matter standing out against the rest of the material. The article is non-biased, and in one of the first, if not THE first entirely-third party based game modification in which physics simulation is the most prominant feature, then this may infact provide interesting background for future readers into the past of physical based games. <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhuskan_1294.html" title="User:Khuskan">Khuskan</a> 20:51, 10 January 2006</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Firstly, This article is not an advertisement. It explains the history and evolution of a revolutionary mod. If this is an advertisement, then wouldn't the McDonalds article ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcdonalds" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcdonalds" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcdonalds</a> ) also be an advertisement. After all, it speaks extensively of the food that they have and thats there for no reason other than drawing people in. Secondly, the "agreement" that GestaltG speaks of was made by four people, less than 1% of the people that read wikipedia. Also, no 1 agreement can be made for game mods allowance on wikipedia, all are different. If there was 1 agreement then mods such as Counter strike and Day of Defeat would have to be deleted same as Half-Life 2 DeathMatch Pro. Monty (13:58 PST), 10 January 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, First off, this is a unique game, many ideas have never been seen before, or if they have been present if past three dimensional games, this is a definitive new blend of creation and destruction. Theres my view on the game, as far as the legibility for deletion is concerned i am staunchly against it, and any other well written, informational pages of Wikipedia. You must ask yourself, where is the harm is this page? Where is the slander? The lies or the "it's the best game of the century" slogans? There are none, this is no more damaging than the wikipedia page for rubber ducks! Furthermore i think it is rather ignorant to believe one topic in one forum discussed by a limited population can, with immediate results create a sweeping and generic moral high ground against all game mods. I would consider such things as being blind to reason and bowing to a mob mentality. At the very least take the time to individualy inspect each case rather than go on a crusade against all mods. After all there are many who say that murder is wrong, yet when war or self-defense is considered people change their minds. No sweeping statements are ever correct. So just let this page be, so that Wikipedia users can find out about this mod if they should so CHOOSE to, nothing here is being forced upon people. Is this advertising? I think not. Once again using the same example, this page makes people want to play (its free anyway) the game no more than the rubber duck page makes people want to buy little bath time ducks. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreols_ac03.html" title="User:Freols">Freols</a> 16:51 GMT, 11 January 2006</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>NOTE</b>, I'd just like to point out that GestaltG's effort to get the Dystopia article deleted has failed, with many more people voting on that one than the HL2DM Pro article. If GestaltG thinks that a four person vote on the HL2DM Pro article creates a precedent where he can assault other articles, than surely the results of the Dystopia article remove such precedent. --EntRo 18:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>NOTE</b>, What has me laughing the most is the pure ignorance of the three users posting in favor of the deletion of this article. It is now clear that many users have found this article useful and interesting. Not only have we stated our opinions clearly, and concisely, but we have also provided supporting details to back our opinions. GestaltG, you have taken a broad and sweeping generalization and tried to use it to your power. Not only were you almost completely wrong, but you have now made a fool out of yourself. As well, the two users posting in support of removing this article have been completely disproved, although I'm not sure how you can disprove the argument of "per nom" stated by Thesquirrel. Those in favor of deleting this article are either completely ignorant to the point where they do not comprehend valid arguments, or they are following a mob mentality of which the mob is extremely small. For the sake of your reputation GestaltG, I am asking that users refrain from posting further arguments as to respect the already downed original poster. -<a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStieffers_7365.html" title="User:Stieffers">Stieffers</a> 19:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As was agreed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Half-Life_2_DeathMatch_Pro</a> debate, individual mods for video games are not inherently notable and do not deserve Wikipedia articles, no matter how colorful and well written. Plan of Attack (computer game) is another HL2 Mod article and on this same principle, I move it for deletion as non-notable matter. Additionally, this article and game mod articles of it's kind are advertizements stuck into Wikipedia and are matter more suitable for fan sites and game promotional websites, neither of which is a function of Wikipedia. I nominate this page for deletion as useless fancruft and an advertizement. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 18:49, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "precedent" you all are citing is nothing; four votes out of hundreds of thousands of users establishes a precendent? Yeah right. These delete votes need to be handled on a case-by-case basis, not by phony precedent. I'm voting for KEEP because this is a released mod with many players and has been featured in PC Gamer. <b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 06:17, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The idea that a mod does not deserve an article simply because it is not a complete game is bull.

<li><b>Keep</b> A mod called 'my-first-little-mod' adding a weapon that shoots 50% faster does not really add anything and a page of it should be removed.A mod like plan of attack however is pretty much an entirely new game with a new community.Deletion of this would be ridiculous.~@BLOODy</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> This company is a part of American pop culture. Probably every person in the Western world has heard their radio jingles at some time.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Once an article has been nominated for deletion, I don't think there's any procedure to just de-nominate it. If there's an overwhelming consensus in one way or the other, the discussion can be declared over, but we don't have a clear consensus here, if for no other reason than not that many people have voted at all. Hopefully once the latest five-day voting period is up, an admin will declare the vote as "keep but cleanup" and I and others can work on rewriting it. I'd start rewriting it now, but I'm not going to waste my time as long as there's even a 1% chance that it's going to get deleted. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:56, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Biography that reads like a hoax. Taking up arms against the Soviet Union in 1994 doesn't sound very convincing, because it had ceased to exist. Buying a book for a cheap price isn't a claim to notability either, and even that is unverifiable. The article is closer to a hoax than patent nonsense so it's here. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 20:23, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That would make sense if there is good evidence that Comerica City is normally associated with the Penuts strip. A Google for "Comerica City" Peanuts reveals precisely one hit - and that's the author's edit to add this list to the article on <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanuts_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Peanuts (comic strip)">Peanuts (comic strip)</a>. As far as I can tell (and I am not a Peanuts weenie) the name Comerica City was made up by the author and is not used elsewhere, certainly not in the strip itself. If this is wrong then I will change my vote to merge for all verifiable information - but here again we may have an issue since the only source I can find for any of these names is the author's Wikipedia articles. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_AfD_78f4.html" title="User:JzG/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 13:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Personally I would say she is a celebrity already and so wholly meritous of remaining in Wikipedia. After all, Faria Alam is famous for having slept with Sven and his former boss! Shes appeared on a TV programme and is commanding alot of press attention as a result. Shes the star of the programme, and good luck to her.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, what an absurd comment. The page has never been edited by Willy on Wheels (or is that possible seen as the user appears to have been banned for over 10 months). I also cannot see any reason to call it vanity, as vanity would probably apply Chantelle herself writing the article. As the article appears to have been started after BB started, that is also impossible as there are no internet connections inside the house. This whole list of brand new users who's first (and often only edit) is to vote on this user page is not going to make those votes count as much as those (both in favour of delete and keep) from long standing members. I'm not sure if they are the work of the same person or numerous people. But if it is just one person, I do ask them to stop wasting their time in creating new names to vote with. You've made your point and getting angry will not help you further your point of view.<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 16:46, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The term exists in print (as noted in the article) and on 270 pages that make no mention of the originator, Mr. Carson, whatsoever <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22vulgar+libertarian%22+OR+%22vulgar+libertarianism%22+-wikipedia+-%22Kevin+Carson%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22vulgar+libertarian%22+OR+%22vulgar+libertarianism%22+-wikipedia+-%22Kevin+Carson%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. - Nihila 22:16, 7 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know people other than Carson have used it, but <i>they don't use it the same way</i>. Ergo, it doesn't count toward the total for this use of the term. Like I said, the first link <i>after</i> Wikipedia and Carson's blog is someone who uses it to mean something else <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/print/articleprint1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/print/articleprint1.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.

<dd>Can you please clarify which Wikipedia <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#afd" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">problem category</a> this article falls into? The fact that you find it non-notable / in limited use does not make it a candidate for deletion unless it is a "<i>Completely idiosyncratic non-topic</i>" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#afd" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#afd" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.

<dd>It's not that I don't <i>find it</i> notable. It <i>isn't</i> notable. You can't just invent a term on your blog and then put it in Wikipedia. The third hit on Google, after the Wikipedia article and the blog that invented it, is it using the term in a different context. So in the <i>extremely</i> limited use that this term has gained <i>outside</i> the inventor, a <i>different meaning</i> is the most dominant. If you want a specific policy, among many, there non-notability, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>.

<dd>I understand your concern about the term's notability, but I'm not sure what your basis is for the claim that I invented it. I am not Kevin Carson. - Nihila 05:33, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't say you invented it. I was using "you" in the general sense, i.e., "you can't bring a horse to water and then expect it to drink" does not mean I think you brought a horse to water and expected it to drink. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 05:34, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then I don't understand your claim that this violates "<i>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</i>". The three points listed under that heading are "<i>Propaganda or advocacy</i>" (I have not seen any disupute about this article being NPOV), "<i>Self-promotion</i>" (I didn't coin the term) and "<i>Advertising</i>" (there is no link in this article to Carson's blog or published work). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> - Nihila 01:17, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you understand what it means to use Wikipedia as a soapbox. It's not limited to the three things they're specifically enumerated. Any attempt to use Wikipedia to popularize something that hasn't caught on on its own is using it as a soapbox. Carson started usin a term on his blog, and then someone added it. If we had to add every jargon anyone invents for their blog that hasn't caught on, we'd have disambiguations for everything. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 01:37, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This list is inherently POV, factually innaccurate and not worthy of inclusion. We already have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Young_Earth_Creationists_093f.html" title="List of Young Earth Creationists">List of Young Earth Creationists</a> which are most of the modern players. This is different it is a list of supposedly famous scientists of the past who were young earth creationists (Oh and bizarrely, two famous actors and a deceased astronaut). Probably sourced from <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_M._Morris_7d3c.html" title="Henry M. Morris">Henry M. Morris</a>, <a href="http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=185" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=185" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> (though not even Morris was foolish enough to include the actors, darling). Note young earth creationists, not creationists, which is interesting because <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/bios/default.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/bios/default.asp" rel="nofollow">Answers in Genesis</a> identify <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Agassiz_1837.html" title="Louis Agassiz">Agassiz</a> as an "old earth compromiser".</p>
<p>Anyway, basically it's an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a>, made even better because dead people can't protest. Given the lack of evidence in favour young earth creationism, they do resort to such silly lists. Mosts of them aren't even biologists, though to the credit of this list it excludes those who died before the 1858 publication of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Russel_Wallace_2ef5.html" title="Alfred Russel Wallace">Wallace</a>. However the modern YECist movement arose in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> (led by aformentioned the hydraulic engineer Morris) in response to the secularisation of society and all (apart from the actors and astronaut) predate this.</p>
<p>Some on the list are demonstrably false; see <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html" rel="nofollow">There have been many famous scientists who believed in special creation in the past</a> and the subclaims relating to <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_4.html" rel="nofollow">Babbage</a>, <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_10.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_10.html" rel="nofollow">Fabre</a>, <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_1.html" rel="nofollow">Kelvin</a> and <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html" class="external text" title="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html" rel="nofollow">Pasteur</a>. The rest I don't know so much about (except for Mendel and he most probably was't), and given the propensities of the YECists to bearing false witness, proper secular references are in order, and they are missing. — <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 21:42, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There needs to be very clear verifiable evidence provided before such a list can be created, especially when listing people who are no longer alive. As nom indicates, many of these people died before the YEC movement arose.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am a new user, and I am very sorry to have offended the Wikipedia community. The only reason I have listed this body of suggestions on Wikipedia is because it has come up in a number of discussions on various forums discussing the improvement of Sid Meier's Civilization. I thought Wikipedia could serve as a standard reference. Since that is apparently not acceptable, feel free to delete if you wish. I will be more careful in the future.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, Trade-peror. Please don't feel you've offended anyone; it's just that this isn't the sort of article we usually keep here at Wikipedia. I don't do a whole lot over there, so I don't know for sure if this would work, but Wikibooks has a near-empty page on Civilization. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Civilization_IV" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Civilization_IV" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. Maybe they'd be able to use your content over there? At any rate, I'd go ahead and copy the article right now, before the page is deleted, if you haven't already. I see you put a lot of work into wikifying it. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 01:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Usually I'm not a deletionist, but, really, IMHO it is quite stupid to make articles of every final match. Just relevant ones, like the 1966 world cup final, and, for example, Italy-Germany 4-3 (1970 world cup semifinal, considered among the most amusing matches ever). But, please, not every final, or semi-final, match! --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelo.romano_5e58.html" title="User:Angelo.romano">Angelo</a> 00:55, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It seems that if at least 20% of the population of a Hungarian conubation are of an ethnic (possibly only Romanian, but I cant work it out) minority, they are entitled to bilingual signs. Mapquest recognises Baciu. <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;country=RO&amp;addtohistory=&amp;city=Baciu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;country=RO&amp;addtohistory=&amp;city=Baciu" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> but not Kisbács. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 08:32, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Thanks for the research! Actually, Baciu is the Romanian name. Mapquest recognizes it and not Kisbács (the Hungarian name) because it's situated inside the borders of Romania. Note that if you Google Kisbács, you find a number of Hungarian-language sites. Also note - the letter "k" doesn't exist in the Romanian language (except where they borrow words from abroad), and neither does the letter combination "cs", which combines to make the equivalent of our "ch" sound in Hungarian(or something like it.) Thanks again. --128.192.209.61 15:28, 8 January 2006 (UTC)The guy who put up this entry.</li>

<li><b>comment</b>I agree with that. There is already a link to the Romanian name of the village. I am unaware of the existence of a German name. (Although it's certainly true that most towns in Transylvania (Siebenburgen) have Romanian, Hungarian, and German names.) --128.192.246.117 20:01, 9 January 2006 (UTC) The original author of this entry.</li>

<li>Yes, it doesn't belong in the article namespace but please userfy it. The man has passed away and the user who wrote the article is probably his relative. Moving it to the user's space would, I hope, be more gentle than deleting it outright.

We do have detailed descriptions of individual pokemon. Why should we treat silly pop cultural topics differently depending on whether the target audience consists of teenage geeks or middle-aged uneducated women?
