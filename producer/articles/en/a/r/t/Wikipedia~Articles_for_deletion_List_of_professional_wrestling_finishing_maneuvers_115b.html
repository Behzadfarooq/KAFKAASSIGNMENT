<li><b>Keep, but update references to be in-line</b> "Listcruft/fancruft" is not a valid reason for deletion. Note that finishers are an important part of professional wrestling as a sport; they are the signature move most identified with the individual wrestlers and often times serve to help define them. Listing them also allows readers to compare wrestlers who use similar finishers or, on occasion, share the same finisher. The article does appear to be referenced with four different external links to finishing moves as well. The only thing I see, therefore, is that it would be useful for verification purposes to provide inline footnote citations for each move pointing to a source that can verify the wrestler uses that move. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Soft Delete</b> This is a long list and has obviously been worked hard on. But my problem is it is repeating two things. The first being that every wrestler article already contains the information. The second is the actual move itself already has a page and is described on that page. This is less like a catalog and more like a list. The good note I can only think of is for those who are actually starting up wrestling can view this list and decide what kind of signature finisher not to do or what to do! <a href="../../../g/o/v/User%7EGovvy_b92c.html" title="User:Govvy">Govvy</a> 12:28, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Just to reply, the purpose the list serves is to reindex the information found in the wrestler articles. Let's say a reader wants to compare for historical purposes wrestlers that have used a particular move or type of move as a finishing move. It would be extremely difficult to figure out who did which move by simply perusing individual wrestler articles. By having this information in a list format, though, it provides a single source the reader can visit.</li>
<li>In fact, <i>all</i> list articles have redundant information with other articles. A list of movies or books or games or people will always be constructed using information found in the associated main articles. There are probably no lists on Wikipedia that use information not already found in the corresponding articles for individual entries. The point of lists, then, isn't to provide "new" information, but is rather to reorganize and summarize existing information in a form that is useful but not easily accessible by reading the individual articles themselves. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:00, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a case of having two different ways of indexing the same information. One is to list all wrestling moves, and then next to each move list wrestlers that use it as a finisher. The other is to list all wrestlers, and list all the finishing moves that wrestler used. Note that it's possible for a reader to want to use either method to find information. For instance, they might be thinking of a few wrestlers they like and want to look at their moves in one article. It's also possible for a reader to be interested in a particular move and want to find people that might have used that move at some point. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure you understand my point here. I'm not debating the value of having a list of moves that identifies which wrestler uses them and wrestler pages that list their moves. What I'm doubting is the necessity of having a separate section devoted to finishing maneuvers when we already have lists of maneuvers under three other articles, and which could be merged with this one into one comprehensive article identifying the move, whether it's a hold/attack or throw, whether it's used as a finisher, and who uses it as a signature maneuver. Surely we should have one page devoted to maneuvers, not four? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Batsnumbereleven</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/t/User_talk%7EBatsnumbereleven_ca60.html" title="User talk:Batsnumbereleven">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Batsnumbereleven_0ccb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Batsnumbereleven">contribs</a>) 23:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC).</small> Oops, sorry, should have signed it! --<a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsnumbereleven_aa67.html" title="User:Batsnumbereleven">Dave.</a> 23:40, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, ok, that's actually an interesting question. I think what we both seem to agree we should focus on is the question "What is the best way to organize information about wrestling moves for Wiki readers?" Splitting information between three or four articles has the disadvantage of making it harder for the editors to maintain, and also makes it possibly harder for readers to navigate. Consolodating the information into one or two pages makes it easier to find the pages, and avoids duplication of maintainence, but in the case of extremely large articles can make the articles unwieldy to read and use.
<dl>
<dd>Personally I think a good set up is to have one article that lists all wrestling moves sorted by type and then alphabetically by name. The move article probably would have to be split, though, into two subarticles since there are hundreds of moves, which might make that article too large. Then have a seperate list article that only lists the names of the moves sorted by wrestlers who use them as signature moves, possibly with a two or three word descriptive notatation, and links those moves to the main move article(s). I'm pretty sure this is similar to the set up we have now, but thinking from scratch that's probably how I'd set it up if I were doing it myself. It would allow readers to search for moves by name or by wrestler, but detailed information about the moves would be restricted to a single article and thus would be easier to maintain. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps some of the various I-don't-know-how-many millions of pro wrestling fans there are worldwide? If even 5% or 10% of wrestling fans were interested in reading about signature moves, that would represent possibly hundreds of thousands of people. I'm not a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> fan, and I'm not personally interested in knowing every little detail about it, but that doesn't make it any less notable or important to the people who <i>do</i> care about Pokemon. You don't see me going around calling people "geeky" because they are interested in reading <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torchic.html" title="Torchic">Torchic</a>, a previously featured article. Just because something seems silly or pop culture doesn't mean it isn't valuable for a large number of potential readers. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to comment, the article does appear to list <i>some</i> sources at the end. However, it doesn't do in-line citations, so it's very difficult to tell which information is referenced and which isn't. Therefore I think the references need to be cleaned up to make them more readable and useful, but I don't believe this would be a case where the article is impossible to verify or no references exist. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Absolutely an indiscriminant collection of information. The clause has traditionally been given a fairly broad interpretation on AfD. Also pure listcruft, but commentators above are right that that is a weak deletion reason at best and fairly subjective. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 11:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"The clause has traditionally been given a broad interpretation" is an incorrect assumption, as evidenced by the current discussion at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Inappropriate_use_of_Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information_on_afd.2Fcfd" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Inappropriate_use_of_Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information_on_afd.2Fcfd" rel="nofollow">the WP:NOT talk page</a>. Most of the editors who have replied in that discussion on this section of policy agree that there is a common misconception on how broadly that part applies. It is specifically written as to only indicate areas of broad consensus, and does <i>not</i> imply that other types of articles fall under the qualifier of "indiscriminate collection of information". Of course, policy can change, and an article can fail to meet other standards like notability guidelines or verifiability. But as written it is incorrect to say that an article violates the "indiscriminate collection of information" section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> unless it falls under one of the types of information described there. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
