<p>This article actually is Shiite Muslims view of PBUH and other PBUH(Islam) article of Sunni View i wanted to merge that article into that one, so that one article has comprehensive information on the PBUH issue which is the " Real " issue . The origin of Shiite and Sunni Divide, it's not the issue of using different words for praising Muhammad by one Group of Muslims, it is complete article but i guess should be under PBUH (Islam) but fellow Sunni Muslims brother never want World to know .. What's the real story behind&#160;? Islam was hijacked rather than religion of Hijackers right after the death of Muhammad (SWT) therefore Muslims like Osama (Wahbi Muslims) are very much opposing Shiite Muslims for prasing Muhamamd's Family as Muhammad's Family was against them and infact Killed by Wahbi Islam's leader Yazid. Home of Wahbi Islam is Saudi Arabia and Shiite Islam is Iran. There are two Islams. Muhammad's Islam and Ummayad's Islam(Terrorist). Dont' you see so many people being killed on daily basis in Iraq - Sucidie bombers coming from Saudi Arabia and killing Shiite and US forces! it may seem propoganda but this is what is happening around us. I ask the World ... Prove any Shiite Muslims invovling in " Sucicide Bombings "&#160;?--<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahdi7_b6c0.html" title="User:Mahdi7">www.mahdi.ms</a> 03:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, the large number of google hits occur because his first name and last names are very common. Narrow it down to "shahid bokhari", it gives out 571 hits. Google "Shahid H. Bokhari", it says 11k hits, but go to the 18th page, and the rest of the pages are duplicates. (Incidentally, now almost any one gets at last 8,000/9,000 hits (I myself get 9,000 hits in google).

<p>its not abt the talks that he gave or the google hits that he gets. There may be others that may have similar credentals as Dr Bokahri..but he has done some of the pioneering work in the field of parallel &amp; distributed systems and computer architecture. He has over 1000 citations and as i recall, one of his papers had more than 300 citations... This amount of pioneering work and this many citations....are crowning achievemments... I am sure there wont be any newly appointed assistant professors...having over 1000 citations... FAHAD SAEED</p>

<p>to the above comment, i would like to say did you even read the article? obviously you did but you just didnt understand it. the chav article claims the music to be called new monkey can you honestly tell me that there is a genre called new monkey?? but you would want that article to be deleted would you. The new monkey is a nightclub, i was educating people like you that it is a common misconception. YOU JUST CANT HELP PEOPLE THESE DAYS.</p>
<p>go ahead delete it if you like and re write it yourself because obviously you have a much more in-depth knowledge of bouncey spanish techno music and north england rave scene than i do.</p>
<p>P.S. The article is called new monkey (music) as that was the default name that was already set on the chav page, so this is no fault of my own. i am simply here to educate, or at least try to so take it easy will you.</p>

<p>I came across this article scouring through the Wikify backlog, and at the time it was mostly unformatted, copy-pasted text from <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~engtt516/" class="external free" title="http://www.umich.edu/~engtt516/" rel="nofollow">http://www.umich.edu/~engtt516/</a> , the source of the hoax (possibly done as vandalism in an attempt to validate or provide another credible source for it). I quickly tidied up the article to return it to being a proper, factual account of the hoax and added some references, but, while the subject is somewhat interesting (I love the idea of a classroom of kids copy-pasting from the internet and then being told everything they wrote is baloney), I still don't believe this qualifies as a particularly notable hoax on its own (certainly not on the level of <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonsai_Kitten_9206.html" title="Bonsai Kitten">Bonsai Kitten</a> and other well-known sucker-bait) - Google returns fewer than 300 hits for his name, most of them linking to the UMich site or the assignment plan<a href="http://www.saskschools.ca/~ischool/tisdale/integrated/wysiwyg/teacher.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saskschools.ca/~ischool/tisdale/integrated/wysiwyg/teacher.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Therefore, I nominate this for AfD as a non-notable minor hoax. Also, to pre-empt any comments, I'm well aware of the irony of this article having only one or two credible sources - the very lesson it was trying to teach! If this had become a more widespread hoax, there would be more references out there than mere links to the source website. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 14:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. An interesting article, but I believe it fails WP:HOAX: "Hoaxes must be notable to be included in Wikipedia – for example, a hoax may have received sustained media attention, been believed by thousands of people including academics, or been believed for many years." Actually this AfD is recursive, because if you admire the hoax and wish it long life, you should delete the Wikipedia article as a courtesy (per Eusebeus), since otherwise the next round of gullible students would Google the Wikipedia article and get tipped off. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 04:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this article should be deleted due to lack of biographical notability. The article seems to claim significance in being listed in Who's Who's. I don't believe Mere listing in Who's Who warrants a wikipedia article. When I follow the link I am unable to find the subjects name. Regardless of verifiability, This article needs to explain what the subject did in order to get into Who's Who. If that information is already in the article then there is a strong case for deletion of this article. I also suspect this to be a vanity page. A google only revealed posts in forums. <a href="../../../z/u/d/User%7EZudduz_5236.html" title="User:Zudduz">Zudduz</a> 15:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Excluding the person's own posts on forums and his e-mail address which is firstname.surname@etc, he basically gets no Google hits. And even with all those unrelated and self-achieved hits, the count is at 52 (22 unique). The correct Finnish name is <i>Mäkitalo</i>, but that gives even less results. Besides, both Asko and Mäkitalo are common names in Finland. Who's Who claim is unverified and probably not notable enough on its own.

<li>This "Publisher of Who's Who in America since 1899" is the real one, there has been another fake book with same name (or sound like?).

<li>I agree that this listing alone would not grant notability, but with Genealogy aspect it does. This kind of information serves Genealogical Reseachers.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack007_74e1.html" title="User:Jack007">Jack007</a> 15:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>. The link provided above states that complete who's who db "features biographical profiles of 1.2 million of the most accomplished individuals". 1.2 million is too many people to consider their mere inclusion notable. We must instead examine what one has done in order to get in to who's who in order to determine notability. The article does not note anything remotely notable in science and engineering when held up to wikipedia notability stadards. Also the genealogy work is only a hobby. I'm glad you enjoy and excel at it but merely being good at a hobby is not notable.--<a href="../../../z/u/d/User%7EZudduz_5236.html" title="User:Zudduz">Zudduz</a> 16:56, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article is factually incorrect. If one Googles for it, where it's related to theology you'll most often find it as a rhetorical term used in <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a></i> arguments against the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, not as something someone thinks Christians actually believe. Or someone uses to describe what he feels is overly intense devotion to a figure like the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Mary_d301.html" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, but again as part of an argument and not a genuine "misconception". As such the term might be discussed in articles like <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontrinitarianism.html" title="Nontrinitarianism">Nontrinitarianism</a>, but there's not enough to say even about its correct meaning to merit an article. (In fact, Islam is well aware that Christians worship a Trinity; the Koran mentions it a number of times.) <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 08:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>How</i> does it still look like an ad? I'd like to fix it, but no one has stated what about it makes it an ad - so far the article consists only of a corporate history and doesn't include any information at all about specific products, testemonials, or anything of that nature that could be considered biased. In fact, the advertisement page actually recommends adding more information about products and services, something I thought would have made it look even more like an ad. Also, I get 655,000 google hits with a search, and 962 with a "unique" search - I don't know what the magic number is for these, but that seems pretty high in general, with the unique search discounting a lot hits based on "Albion (sword name/type) Sword". I suppose even though it meets the criteria specifically as written, it's up to the communities interpretation of what really counts to decide what stays and what goes. Does that criteria page ever get changed or edited - it might be worth it to prevent future complication and misunderstanding.

<dd>There was no intent to argue. I just wanted to collectively represent the sources that have been gathered - I actually thought you had overlooked the others and noted only the newspaper article, as you made no mention of the others at all, neither dismissing or confirming them. I now understand your position and hope you can see how I could have been confused and my reasons for clarifying. I am somewhat confused how one can ignore specifically mentioned requirements (published books) but that individualism and freedom of interpretation is what gives Wikipedia its character. -- <a href="../../../x/i/l/User%7EXiliquiern_de49.html" title="User:Xiliquiern">Xiliquiern</a> 04:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The above is missing the point. The statements <i>No awards, it looks like they only had one album</i> are correct (Simon Wright <b>was</b> a notable member) but overlooks the fact that the band was influential within the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_Of_British_Heavy_Metal_797d.html" title="New Wave Of British Heavy Metal">New Wave Of British Heavy Metal</a>. I suspect that the above two gentlemen are not authorities on this genre of music. If they were, they would not be making their arguments. Indeed, the origin of this disputed article was an attempt to add to and expand upon the list of bands including bands even more obscure than A II Z already cited as significant NWOBHM bands in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NWOBHM_artists_cdaf.html" title="List of NWOBHM artists">List of NWOBHM artists</a>, written by someone (not me) who <b>is</b> an authority. I would add that another NWOBHM band not yet on that list and with even less success was a band called BLITZKRIEG, who no less than <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> cite as an influence, and who covered their one significant track (also called "Blitzkrieg"). I intend to create an article about Blitzkrieg in the near future. To summarise, my argument is that this band was a significant force within the NWOBHM, which in general launched heavy metal as a major musical genre, and therefore historically represent along with contemporaries a turning point. The article actually needs upgrading by NWOBHM experts, not deletion, which I would view as the censorship of knowledge. I would like to read the views of genuine rock historians on this issue, particularly NWOBHM eyewitnesses and former NWOBHM journalists.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that the band is unknown outside of Britain is irrelevant because the NWOBHM was by definition a British phenomenon. The majority of NWOBHM bands never became known outside of that country. Several of those however, of which AIIZ should be included, were genuine originators of the sound which ultimately launched heavy metal as a worldwide genre. If this band is deleted as an article, then by implication the majority of the bands in the section <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NWOBHM_artists_cdaf.html" title="List of NWOBHM artists">List of NWOBHM artists</a> are not eligible either. I am also therefore wasting my time researching those bands as it was my intention that every one should have their own article. Wikipedia would then have been a full reference for the history of this significant genre, a "one-stop shop" for everything there is to know. Thus there is more at stake here than the issue of this particular band. My understanding of the underlying principle of Wikipedia that it should indeed be such a one-stop shop of knowledge. Am I mistaken in this? Is finer detail to be excluded? If this is the case, which I believe would be tragically short-sighted, an alternative would be to give summaries within <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NWOBHM_artists_cdaf.html" title="List of NWOBHM artists">List of NWOBHM artists</a> or to link out to external info sources (defeating the point of Wikipedia IMHO). I would be interested in other opinions from authorities of hard rock and heavy metal on this issue and indeed what my next move should be. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeadshaker_dad8.html" title="User:Headshaker">Headshaker</a> 07:11, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> With regard to the first point, unless you can truthfully say you are an authority on the NWOBHM, the adjective is a statement of fact, not an insult, obviously limited to the context of this specific subject. I clearly never meant to imply you or the other two were unknowledgeable in general. Regarding the second point, yes you are of course entitled to your opinion, but I am equally entitled to challenge the credibility and credentials of your opinion. Regarding the third point, by this invalid argument bands such as UB40, AC/DC and JJ72 would also be "unencyclopedic". Regarding the fourth point, the answer is that people researching the NWOBHM in general would learn of the band at general articles such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_NWOBHM_artists_cdaf.html" title="List of NWOBHM artists">List of NWOBHM artists</a> and seek to find out more detail.

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with the nominator, <a href="../../../g/a/y/User%7EGay_Cdn_0b6b.html" title="User:Gay Cdn">Gay Cdn</a>, that they do not meet the criteria in WP:BAND. I see that three specific claims are offered in the article: (1) that they are especially popular amongst NWOBHM fans, (2) that their music is archetypal of the genre, and (3) that NO FUN AFTER MIDNIGHT is a NWOBHM cult classic and much-sought rarity. I think that WP:BAND makes (2) be a proper claim, so I'd be willing to listen if someone could offer third-party confirmation of that fact. But then they would apparently need to be a leading or most popular member of NWOBHM, and I didn't hear that anyone was claiming that. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I respect the above for attempting to argue the case within the correct context, i.e. the genre of NWOBHM. With regard to the issue of third party confirmation, I've tried to provide this by greatly expanding the references, which now includes one literary source. The defence now rests and makes its closing remarks. I would ask the arbiting administrator to consider carefully the implications of the decision, as it affects the whole purpose of Wikipedia, as either an introductory reference to a field of study or a complete "one-stop shop". It feels wrong that I as an authority and a fan of the NWOBHM should now have to be fighting to defend an article as a result of the actions of someone who is neither. I perceive it as an attack on knowlege, and any attack on even small details of knowledge is to me reprehensible.

<li>For what it's worth, I agree with you, but in this case, with the lack of sources, I know it'll probably be deleted. That's why I'm hoping a Re-direct will emerge instead.

<li>Well, of course it's a description of my personal views and biases. But this is one of the many AfD nominations that do not fall into a specific WP deletion policy. Thus, users' personal views and biases do serve as justification as long as a consensus is reached.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 16:16, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Again, I appreciate that you are stating your own personal biases. However, this is not relevant to this or any other article.

<li>Hey, I do read the articles before taking a position, biased or not!&#160;:-) And I disagree that my statement was not explanatory. If I'm a school deletionist, it's obviously because I believe that the overwhelming majority of schools are not notable enough to justify inclusion. Anyway, if you prefer a more robotic justification that does not make assertion to my personal views, I may just add: delete per nom (fails to assert notability).--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 16:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> You did need say more.

<li><b>Comment</b> Sure- Because there isn't any evidence that there is anything inherently notable about this school and no reason to bother keeping it at all. Merge implies some reason that we want the information here, I have seen no reason to think that (I don't mind mergers in general and won't mind a merger too much in this case but it would make much more sense to just delete it). And I note that the above does not constitute a response to explain Bahn Mi's assertion which is still unanswered.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Why attack indviduals for their belief that school articles are worth keeping when they only serve as counterweights to your own deletionist biases? Are you suggesting that you would delete information about this school if it were merged into <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Unified_School_District_93cb.html" title="ABC Unified School District">ABC Unified School District</a> as nonencyclopedic? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are being ridiculous. First of all, I didn't make this an attack about "individual beliefs" (if anyone you did by responding to my inquiry for logic with an essentially unrelated inquiry. If you had put your inquiry where my deletion comment was that would have made sense, but the placement here seems to be some sort of <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack, in that the implication seems to be something along the lines of "oh look, he has what might be an extreme view, therefore his request for further information should be ignored" (and before anyone makes noise about it, this is ad hominem in the technical sense, not a personal attack and I'm not claiming otherwise). And no I wouldn't delete such information from the school district article because a small summary of a little info about each school in the district is not intrinsically unreasonable (see my above comment wherein I say that I won't mind a merger too much). I also object to your claims that I have "deletionist biases" - thinking something should be removed when you think it should stay doesn't magically make me habe "deletionist biases" and claiming that is ironic since you are in fact attacking individuals even as you claimed that I was doing so. Finally, none of this is at all relevant to the basic question to which I have not yet recieved an answer- why is this school "important"? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Schools are "importatnt." They certainly are more important than "corner stores and retail outlets". My community taxes me a few thousand dollars a year to run each and every school in our public school system, presumably because society in general feels that schools, and the education they provide, are notable. I had put my comment asking for more details regarding your position, but it was ignored, hence my confusion at your failure to respond while pumping others for details of their justifications. While it doen't mean that all schools merit a Wikipedia article, schools are inherently important. After all, even deletionists went to school somewhere. And if they didn't, it explains a great deal. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 20:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A variety of issues- first I didn't notice your above remark immediately below my initial delete comment (my apologies). Second, as to schools being important- there seem to a number of issues here. One, you may be engaging in the fallacy of confusing a part for the whole, just because a collective is important it does not make every individual in that collective important (to use an analogy, humanity as a whole is important, that doesn't make every human important (or if you have an issue with humans, use <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roaches.html" title="Roaches">roaches</a> ). I'm glad that you agree that "importance" in some sense doesn't mean that each merits an article- but that is then an issue since that is precisely what seems to be what Bahn is trying to argue - that they are somehow important enough to merit articles and no argument for that has been given, as to your gratuitous swipe at "deletionists" (who seem to be some sort of boogeyman more than actual people anyways) possibly not going to school, one has the same problem- in fact, we have all gone to corner stores and retail outlets as well. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I also went to my corner grocery store, but I never graduated from there. It wasn't accredited and the daily lunch menu of Doritos and Coke just didn't appeal to me. I feel -- and many others, including <a href="../../../b/a/h/User%7EBahn_Mi_d240.html" title="User:Bahn Mi">Bahn Mi</a> agree with me -- that there is a significant essential claim to notability possessed by any individual school that any individual corner store (or individual human or individual roach) will never have. While I agree that this does not mean that every school merits a Wikipedia article, and I agree that this particular one does not, I am among the majority here that seems to agree that this information for this comparatively less significant school belongs somewhere and should not be deleted. This is why I chose Merge/Redirect and feel reassured by the majority that agrees with this approach. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Joking aside, simply asserting that there is an essential claim to notability for schools is a statement which doesn't have any backing and neither Bahn nor others seem to have attempted to back it up other than the argument that everyone has been there. Nor does the above in any way distinguish why corner stores would be different (we have articles on many unacreddited schools and I don't see how accreditation is relevant to notability) or if one wants something other than corner stores, one could make the same argument for hospitals (we are all born there) graveyards (we almost all end up there eventually and then stay there) power plants (we all get electricity from them). Simply saying that one is in the majority does not by itself constitute an argument. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Society seems to have this thing with education and schools that confers an inherent notability for all schools in general, and each particular one. We are taxed to fund universal public education and required to send our children to school for an education (or to educate them independently). The corner store meets none of those criteria. It's funny that you mention it, but I have created dozens of articles for cemeteries, several articles for hospitals and a power plant or two, and I would argue that hospitals, cemeteries (and even power plants) do have greater inherent notability than your corner store. Again, I do not believe that every school ( or hospital / cemetery / power plant) deserves a Wikipedia article, I do believe that any one of them starts with a leg up on notability than does any individual 7-11. While I acknowledge that being a part of the majority "does not by itself constitute an argument", it is sort of how democracy works and it's pretty much the main factor that the closing administrator will have to base his/her decision on. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:11, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm in almost complete agreement with the above. Part of the issue here is that you are defending a position different from that of Bahn, indeed a far more reasonable position. I would agree that "hospitals, cemeteries (and even power plants) do have greater inherent notability than your corner store" but I think it is important to establish why this should be so and more to the point when this makes an entity inherently notable or whether it is more a reflection of these entities more easily gaining notability. I suspect from Bahn's comments here and elswhere that when he says that "this is an important school" he has some other meaning, that is, that <i>this</i> school is somehow important and to that I have yet to hear any backing. (I don't incidentally think how we are taxed to fund schools makes the schools somehow notable by themselves, again part for the whole problem). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 03:20, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While this article could be improved, the phrase "motif of harmful sensation" does in fact have a standard meaning in folklore and narratology, where it does in fact refer generally to the harmful effect of unpleasant experiences such as seeing Medusa's head, reading the <i>Necronomicon</i> or watching <i>The Ring</i>. What's there now could be improved, but it's a reasonable start. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The very reason that I recommended this article for deletion was because I tried searching for a definition and explanation for the term in order to clarify the article but could not find anything to suggest that this was a standard term with a standard meaning (everything I found on Google seemed to be derivative of this very article, and some quick searches on JSTOR and Google Scholar yielded nothing at all). Indeed, I actually like the idea of the article very much, and I would be delighted if, as you say, this is an accepted term with an accepted definition. The suggestion that you make further down that the Aarne-Thompson motif index be consulted is an excellent one, and I will try to go down to the university library and do that later in the week if I'm still in town. So far, though, I haven't found any evidence that suggests that term wasn't invented by the article's original author. - <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcohn_61ff.html" title="User:Mdcohn">Mdcohn</a> 19:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To follow up, I did consult Thompson’s motif index, and there is no equivalent category that I can find. There are, for example, entries for the Looking Taboo (C300-399), which includes such cases as the sight of a deity and the Lady Godiva incident; the Death Giving Glance (D2061.1.2.1), which includes tales of gorgons, basilisks, and a reference to the evil eye (which, in my opinion, is not a case of the Motif of Harmful Sensation); and Extraordinary Madness (F1041.8), which includes madness from seeing an ugly ogre, madness from hearing a prophetic voice, madness from seeing a beautiful woman, etc. But as far as I can tell there is no motif or class of motifs that generally refers to harm caused by perception. The best that I can think of is the nebulous F1041 group, which deals with extraordinary physical reactions. Most of the examples in the Wikipedia article would fit here, but there is a great deal that is unrelated. This, of course, is only proof that the Motif of Harmful Sensation isn’t attested in and has no direct analog in Thompson (at least that I could find). I will try to continue looking, though. - <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcohn_61ff.html" title="User:Mdcohn">Mdcohn</a> 00:05, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Though I enjoy this article (and have edited it in the past), I agree with the nominator that the term "motif of harmful sensation" is a neologism, and the article is an example of original research. The original author has <a href="../../../m/o/t/Talk%7EMotif_of_harmful_sensation_6ae4.html#Confession.3F" title="Talk:Motif of harmful sensation">pointed out these issues</a> on the article's talk page (notice also the old <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Motif_of_harmful_sensation_c7d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Motif of harmful sensation">peer review</a> for this article), with no real resolution. Granted, this is a pretty well-researched article and does provide a useful neologism -- however, neologisms are unencyclopedic and Wikipedia should not contain original research. If one could find a term or concept currently in use that is equivalent to "the motif of harmful sensation," and create a new Wikipedia entry for this non-neologistic concept, then the article could be salvaged, as this new entry could probably incorporate much of this article's current content. However, until that time, our duty (sad though it may be) is to delete this article as original research.

<li><i>Clarification</i>. Though the original nominator correctly points out that "many of the examples of this motif do not match the definition provided," that's not really pertinent to discussions of article deletion. A good edit of the article could clear up these problems ... however, you'd still end up with a well-edited article based on original research, which is sufficient for its deletion. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 14:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it turns out that the phrase "motif of harmful sensation" had its origin here, it certainly has gotten around since then. Next time I am at the big library, I will check and see if there is anything in the Aarne-Thompson motif index that this might be retitled as. It might also be profitably related to Frazer's <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Bough_1300.html" title="Golden Bough">Golden Bough</a></i> discussion of taboos, the famous "Not to touch the Earth, not to see the Sun" line springs into mind. It may be that all that is needed is a change of title, perhaps to something like Taboo in folktale and literature. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:03, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you believe that the motif of harmful sensation is a subgenre of the taboo, then you may want to consider proposing that this article be merged with the article on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Taboo.html" title="Taboo">taboo</a>. Personally, I believe that the motif of harmful sensation, as defined in the article, is explicitly separate from the taboo "motif". To avoid clogging up this thread, let's take that discussion to the article's talk page. Why don't you start a section there on this subject? I think it would be a useful discussion, and might clear up some of the arguably overbroad inclusions in the article itself. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 16:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, if you <i>can</i> find a verifiable source (preferably offline) that uses the term "motif of harmful sensation" as a term of art/science, that would be great. Then we could use that source's definition of the motif as a starting-point for a less-OR rewrite of this article, and I'll happily change my vote to <b>keep</b>. -- <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocether_44df.html" title="User:Docether">Docether</a> 16:26, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. While the concepts this article discusses may be sound in some form, the article as it exists appears to refer to a neologism and is definately original research. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 16:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A fascinating and well researched article. The demand for deletion seems to stem from the title being a neologism. The notion of harm from looking at or hearing something is obviously not OR. By that standard many articles have neologisms as titles. The article gives many instances of fiction or legends where harm comes from seeing or hearing something. The Mark Twain "Punch conductor, punch with care" story cited has been a favorite all my life. So do not read the title as a neologism, read it as the title of an article! There should be a Wikipedia somewhere (Deleteopedia?) for excellent articles like this when they get the boot from wikipedia by overzealous deletionists. I have saved a copy of it for future reference, but it should not be necessary for anyone to do so.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And just how can you call this article well-researched when not one source is used to justify the name given to the article or the definition ascribed to said term? All I see is a user-defined term and a bunch of randomly selected occurances that do not all fit the definition. You also have completely misunderstood the reasons people are asking for deletion. To say that the concept of harm coming from seeing or hearing something is not original research would be correct. To say that this concept has the precise definition suggested by the article title and body and that this definition is accepted by the academic community without sources to back that up is original research until proven otherwise. At least one user has attempted to find proof that this is a valid term of art and failed. Either provide a reputable source or two that shows this term is valid and generally accepted or save comments like "well-researched" for an article that deserves it. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>. It could use a tag requesting citations, but I don't see that as a reason to delete this article. I find the article interesting, whether or not the title might be a neologism. .<a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><font color="#0000FF">Talk</font></sup></a> 00:43, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that it’s interesting, but the very problem is that there are no citations to be found, as far as I can find. Google searches, searches on academic databases, and my own research with the Thompson Motif Index have yielded nothing. How can we go about defining this term when it has no academically accepted definition, and what authority do we turn to when we wonder whether the definition is correct or whether an example used in the article is truly an instance of this motif (as you can see, there is some small debate over some of these things on the talk page)? We are supplying our own definition, and that is certainly original research (as interesting as our own definition may be). <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcohn_61ff.html" title="User:Mdcohn">Mdcohn</a> 16:55, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is precisely why we have templates like {{references}}. It's better to request citations than simply delete an article because it doesnt have them. If deleting articles without citations was a good idea, I would have nominated <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> a couple weeks ago. Instead, I added the {{references}} template and began adding some citations. Within a few days, other editors did the same. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><font color="#0000FF">Talk</font></sup></a> 01:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is not that the article doesn’t have any citations; the problem is that no references or citations for this motif seem to exist. Indeed, the article’s original creator long ago <a href="../../../m/o/t/Talk%7EMotif_of_harmful_sensation_6ae4.html#Confession.3F" title="Talk:Motif of harmful sensation">admitted</a> that he invented this term because he didn’t know what to call it, and nobody has ever been able to provide any references to any kind of literature regarding what it should actually be called and therefore what the definition should actually be. In fact, there was a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Motif_of_harmful_sensation_c7d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Motif of harmful sensation">peer review</a> over two years ago to address this problem, and it failed to provide any references, citations, or conclusions on the subject. It is not as though this is a well-established idea and some references are missing – this term and its definition were invented because the original author was unsure about what to call it, and as far as anybody has said there is no attested motif that would be a good analog. <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcohn_61ff.html" title="User:Mdcohn">Mdcohn</a> 04:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the primary arguments being advanced is that the phrase "motif of harmful sensation" is not already in use. I suggest that while the premise may be correct, the conclusion is misguided. Suppose there were two words that described concepts suitable for a Wikipedia article; each word has a long history of usage in the literature and so there is no question of either being a neologism. They also happen to be describing the <i>same</i> concept. Do we create independent articles, each one on a different word for the same concept? No, and this is my point: Wikipedia has articles on <i>things</i>, not the labels of those things. Nobody may have yet come up with a good word for the common factor between the Gorgons and the shriek of the mandrake and the Zahir and Monty Python's joke-warfare sketch, but that does not mean that there is no subject there. As for whether it would be original research to collate extant examples of that common factor, I think insisting on that interpretation would be at the very least pressing the letter of the rules to the detriment of their spirit; it strikes me as not unlike protesting an article on Celebrities who have had wardrobe malfunctions on the basis that, even though reliable sources can be found verifying that each celebrity on the list meets the criteria, no reliable source can be found that previously placed all those celebrities on such a list. (There <i>does</i> seem to be original research in the article, as well as a number of examples of sensation that is <i>not</i> harmful but led to harm, such as Actaeon being blinded, not <i>by</i> peeping at Artemis, but by Artemis as punishment for peeping. These are cleanup matters, though, not valid arguments for deletion.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:11, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I aborted a PROD of this article and have escalated it to AFD since the creator of the article is currently blocked and I assume would have contested the PROD if he could have. The article is about the son of a US president, who died in infancy at the age of 3 days. I assume the creator of the article would assert this baby is notable since he was the son of a president. A note in the article about the president seems reasonable to me, but an entire article about a baby who died 3 days after birth seems ludicrous to me. I'm hoping bringing this article to AFD helps convince the creator of this article that deleting this article reflects a consensus opinion. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 02:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Second to the first point, the original author, and indeed, some other&#160;!voters, thought that the information is wrong.</li>
<li>Is there more than one Infotech Strategies? Perhaps, and if so, a disambig page would be useful, but in the meantime, it doesn't help to have a mish-mash of information on two or more companies residing in the article history, especially when the information on these two or more companies are merged to appear as one.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether the information is correct, this company might not be notable enough for an article. There are arguments for and against keeping this article solely on the basis of notability, but most of the arguments are that this company is not notable enough.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these are the reasons I decided to close this article as delete.

<dd>They seem to be pumping millions of dollars into lobbying US politicians and getting their clients on national TV networks. I think such activities are significant. Of course it would be best if we can dig up more data on them, but I think we should at least tellg readers that "Information and Communication Technology consulting firm" means "lobbying group". <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 06:29, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hello everyone, there seem to have been some misunderstanding. I began the page as a project and the information currently on the page is completely wrong. I would like to delete the entire page because the information currently on is incorrect. Most of the people listed with the company where never employees of the company, and info tech never took over any corporate entities. The company is also not a lobby group. I apologize for the whole mix up, and I would grateful if this page could be deleted. I am trying to avoided damaging a good company image with faulty information.:- KHNY 3, October 2006 EST</li>

<li>Might there be two "Infotech Strategies"? It is a rather vague and uninformative name to give a business, and that unfortunately seems to be the fashion these days. If there are two, the lobbying business is much likelier to be the one worthy of an article. At any rate, a consensus seemed to be developing to delete the networking or consultancy business and keep the lobbying business article. If there are in fact two, the article needs to be revised to say so, use the correct logo. If both have some evidence of notability (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) so that both should be kept, and a neutral, encyclopedia style article (no advertising) can be written about yours, this is a job for a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_page_1257.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation page">Wikipedia:disambiguation page</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

They're a public relations and lobbying firm. Of course, its hidden behind a lot of weasel and buzzwords. The fact that the company has spent millions speaks for itself. The article you wrote KHNY even included "Outreach to Decision Makers" What decision makers are we talking about here? "Infotech Strategies also help’s its clients develop long-term relationships with policy makers" is probably the most clear cut indication of the company's intention to lobby, just on behalf of companies that hire them. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 21:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The lobby thing is not the issue. The issue is does the information posted accurately portray the company? I just took a look their website and it all about technology and education. The company’s client list on their website does not include the clients listed on the posting. Are there two Infotech strategies?</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually, the whole article (now that I reverted your changes) is fully sourced, and it seems clear that there is a company called Infotech Strategies that the article accurately (and surely incompletely) describes.

<li>That rationale is clearly not based upon reading the article, which cites one source that is a 33-page document about the school, that is an in-depth report on things ranging from the school's Young Enterprise program to its deficiencies in the teaching of art, music, and drama. Moreover, lacking assertions of significance is not a deletion criterion for anything except certain <i>specific</i> categories of articles, which does <i>not</i> include articles on schools.

<li>Analysing sources is what we <i>do</i> here at Wikipedia. It's a fundamental part of the task of writing an encyclopaedia. If you don't want people to point out where your analyses are wrong, or clearly not based upon reading the sources concerned, then Wikipedia is not for you. Moreover, any editor who finds 33-page documents on subjects to be trivial has a completely skewed idea of what constitutes a source for an encyclopaedia article. The notability criteria on <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> describe what the triviality criteria are <i>actually</i> aimed at, which are sources that are simple name+address directory entries with no real meat to them.

<li>How you managed to construe my concern with the Ofsted report on this school (which, as far as I know, are made on every registered public school under their purview, and thus is not a helpful factor for determining which schools have received significant mainstream attention) for a concern that the report was not extensive enough, I do not understand. It's great that an entity had a job to report on this school, but I do not find that sufficient to assert that this school has the thinnest claim to notability because of it. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 13:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't consider the school inspection report a sufficiently important mainstream source. Every school has one, and this does not distinguish this school from any other. This one clearly states that this school is average in almost all aspects. In fact, most companies, shops, clubs, ... have numerous official reports (work inspection,; food inspection, whatever): would you include articles on all these entities if those were made public as well? If all you have are official, obligatory inspection reports, then you have nothing of value on its own (though they can of course be used as additional info on notable schools, if needed). I don't think this school is (or for that matter, most schools are) notable, so I have no interest in expanding the article. And if you need to expand the article by including that an equally non notable local cricket club uses the school cricket ground as their training ground, then that is for me a reason more to delete it, not a reason less. As for deletion policy and criteria, one of the criteria is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscrimante collection of information, which states that "there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries". Schools obviously are one of those classes, and to me they do fall under WP:NOT. These discussions are an ongoing attempt at consensus forming, and implying that one cannot vote delete because there is no consensus for it is circular reasoning. There is no policy or guideline that says schools should never bne deleted, and there is none that says that schools should always be kept. Applying more strict interpretation of WP:NOT or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for schools is the right of the individual editor and the only way to perhaps, one day get a consensus by precedent.

<li>Your thinking is confused and erroneous. What is necessary to consider about sources when writing an encyclopaedia article is not their <i>importance</i>, but their <i>provenances</i> and their <i>depths</i>. (Some very confused people talk about "notable sources" and "important sources". There are no such things. It is <i>subjects</i> to which the two distinct concepts of notability and importance apply, not sources.) A 33-page document produced by someone who is not only independent of the school but officially so, has depth and is clearly not sourced from the school itself. Your argument that companies have reports like this is also wrong. They do not. (If you wish to demonstrate otherwise, please point to the reports for Conflict Computer Limited (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Conflict_Computer_Limited_4c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Conflict Computer Limited">AfD discussion</a>). You will find that you cannot.) Not even all schools have such things written about them.
<p>You are also abusing "not an indiscriminate collection of information", a criterion that is <i>not an indiscriminate criterion for deletion</i>. It is <i>not</i> a simple synonym for "I think that this should be deleted.", as it is sometimes abused to be.</p>
<p><i>if you need to expand the article by including that an equally non notable local cricket club uses the school cricket ground as their training ground</i> — The information is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, and encountered when I looked to see what sources existed for the school. If you think that editors should not include verifiable information that they come across, and cite their sources when including it in articles, you have a very odd idea of how to write a verifiable encyclopaedia. If you think that it has a bearing upon notability, then you should re-read <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which makes no mention of cricket clubs) and this discussion (where you yourself were the first person to mention it). Please don't use straw men.</p>
<p><i>implying that one cannot vote delete because there is no consensus for it</i> — Please don't start the "stuck record" arguments over schools again, and please don't use yet more straw men. You were doing quite well in addressing the sources, which is the proper study of encyclopaedists, until you reached that point. The criteria for schools are <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, whose primary criterion is the <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> that focusses discussion upon the provenances and depths of the sources that exist. This article has at least one source of suitable depth and provenance. You have yet to show that that source is unsatisfactory for the purpose of writing an encyclopaedia article. The only arguments raised against it so far have been your argument that other such sources exist to support other articles, which is clearly fallacious, and <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a>'s ridiculous argument that one cannot use government published documents as sources for encyclopaedia articles because numbers are copyrighted. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The notability criteria for schools are <i>not</i> <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, which is only a proposed guideline. The notability criteria for schools are undefined and hence up to the interpretation of the individual editors. Your criteria may well be <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, mine aren't. As for the cricket quote, I did not say that it was unverifiable, just that it is a prime example of things that can be verifiable (and thus correct wrt <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and in this case <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), and still of such extreme obscurity that they are very much not of encyclopedic value. Probably all results of all matches some team of the school ever played can be sourced to some local newspaper, but I don't think that means that they are of any value to the encyclopedia. This is just a prime example of why notability is a concept that should be a guideline. Other points you raise: it aren't only confused people that talk about important and notable sources: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (a policy) says that "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy". The next paragrahp even talks about "reputable" sources. To parapharse this as "notable" or "important" sources seems not so confused to me. By the way, your sources can, according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, be considered primary sources, which are not allowed as the main sources for an article. Certainly the "cricket" source is, on top of being about a very non notable subject, clearly unacceptable as a main source of information according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:13, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is confused. Please learn the difference between "reputable" and "notable". And, again, please don't use straw men.

I suppose that means that you find this info important, not trivial, and that you consider the source a reputable third-party source.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Re: the arguments above about whether the gov't report demonstrates notability: (1) With respect to <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, the existence of sources of depth and provenance clearly pertains to verifiability of deep and provenant facts, but not so clearly to notability of the subject. To assert that the existence of deep and provenant sources automatically implies notability presupposes a particular outcome of a long-running and unresolved general debate among Wikipedia editors. (2) With regard to the question in this case of whether the gov't document establishes notability: As Uncle G writes in his <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">essay</a>, "A subject is notable if the world at large considers it to be notable." The existence of gov't published documents about a school doesn't show that the world at large deems the school <i>notable</i>, just that people care about the quality and specifics of institutions of gov't education, hence the gov't mandates reports on schools. Likewise, the gov't issues reports on local businesses (for example health inspection reports on restaurants), but these reports don't imply that local businesses are notable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:42, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, I wouldn't say that my argument is built on that premise. Essentially I'm saying that the burden is on your side to explain why this (or any) primary school is notable. And the gov't report, even if it is deep and provenant, doesn't show notability. I would argue that in general, one has to look at the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the source, as well its content, to determine notability of the subject. In this case, as I explain above, the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the gov't report is not that anybody, or the world at large, considers the school notable. Contrast the mandatory gov't report with a hypothetical press report that Whitstone School, say, consistently produces kid geniuses. That press report would be issued because an editor would make a judgment that the school's feat makes it sufficiently notable. So the issuance of such a report might show notability. Not so the mandatory gov't report. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 20:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The report cited here is independent of the school itself because such reports are <i>required</i>, by law, to be independent. "Trivial" in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is specifically dealing with the depth of material in the source. Directory entries are trivial. 33-page reports that discuss the subject in detail are not.
<p><i>are we going to develop articles on all restaurants because of government-mandated health inspections?</i> — Your argument is based upon the false premise that all restaurants have the same sort of things published about them as what is cited in this article about its subject. That is not the case.

Your argument is fallacious and falls apart from its foundations upwards.</p>
<p>I suggest that editors who have made the "a 33-page detailed government report is trivial" argument ask themselves why xyr convictions have caused xem to adopt the patently wrong position of arguing that lengthy and detailed government-published documents on subjects do not constitute sources for encyclopaedia articles. If one's convictions take one to a point where one is making an argument that would clearly not hold water for any other subject, such as articles on drugs (which reference government reports from approval agencies) or towns (which reference government census reports), then it is time to question one's convictions. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The report may be technically independent of the school, but the fact that it is required by law is what makes it trivial as a source. If every school has such a report, then its existence says nothing in particular about the noteworthiness of the school. If the school is noteworthy for other reasons, however, then the report may indeed contain useful and relevant information for the article. I don't believe that was in dispute. On another note, all restaurants (in many countries) <b>do</b> have information "independently" published (by government agencies) about them, along similar lines as this (though perhaps not in quite as much depth). I do concede that Conflict Computer Limited probably does not have such health inspection reports, however, as it doesn't sound like a restaurant to me. Why you think that fact is relevant to my example, I couldn't say. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:32, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If the school is found to be notable enough to warrant inclusion in this encyclopedia, then the school inspection report is a useful source for some information. But to use an obligatory inspection report, made for every school in many countries (and, while not so often made public, made for many companies in many countries as well), as evidence that the school is notable is incorrect. When some source is produced for a very large number of similar subjects, that source becomes trivial as an indication of notability. Similar inspection reports are made for daycare centers and nurseries (see e.g. these pdf's<a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=169464" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=169464" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=115977" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/index.cfm?fuseaction=ccreportpdf&amp;id=115977" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. I can write a sourced, verifiable, NPOV (but short) article on L'Oven Fresh Donuts based on e.g. their five food inspection reports I can find here<a href="http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/foodinspection.nsf/Index?OpenAgent&amp;city=c&amp;prefix=L&amp;start=31&amp;pages=3&amp;valid=y#" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/foodinspection.nsf/Index?OpenAgent&amp;city=c&amp;prefix=L&amp;start=31&amp;pages=3&amp;valid=y#" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, and the same goes for many thousands of similar places. I could make quite a long historic overview of the reports of e.g. the specific Macaroni Grill in Denver (not the whole chain) from reports like this one<a href="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=get_insp&amp;est_id=3093&amp;dte=5/18/2006" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=get_insp&amp;est_id=3093&amp;dte=5/18/2006" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> (29 reports in 6 years, this has to be important!<a href="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=inspections&amp;est_id=3093" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denvergov.org/eh/search.asp?mode=inspections&amp;est_id=3093" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>). Does this source makes the subject notable? Of course not. So, until now, the only claim to notability this school has is that the local cricket club trains on a school field. Apart from that, it is a completely average school, as indicated by the inspection report. And so, this article should be deleted if you feel that schools must have some notability to be kept, and should be kept if you feel that all schools are notable. And that, obviously, is why I have supported a deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This involves the word "trivial" in the proposal, which means "worthless" or "without value". When it comes to writing an encyclopedia, these inspection reports are of little value. However, due to their breadth, OFSTED reports are of significant value towards writing an encyclopedia. Because schools are written about in OFSTED reports, they are "notable", which literally means "worthy of writing about". <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Trivial" does also mean "commonplace", "ordinary", which perfectly fits the Ofsted reports: they are made for every school and even for some non-schools, so they are commonplace.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Whitstone_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Whitstone_school&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. And a commonplace source which says that the subject is average on top can hardly be used to show that something is notable, which is also "prominent, important or distinguished": this school is neither of the three.<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/notable" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/notable" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> 05:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I won't contest the main list (at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Daily_Show_guests_b91c.html" title="List of The Daily Show guests">List of The Daily Show guests</a>), but this list is quite non-NPOV and fairly redundant. It's just the inclusion of "notable". Why should these listed be notable and others are not? Aren't most of the guests in general notable enough to be on WP?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> per nom. The term is almost always applied to Grant Peterson, an extremely well-known (in bike circles) frame builder with a curmudgeonly attitude towards technology. <i>Retrogrouch Grant</i> gets me a couple hundred unique ghits, but many irrelevant. People who appreciate top-notch bikes will know the term, but it's not much more than an in-joke.

</ul>
<p>No delete. Google brings up LOTS of posts, so, lots of people are using the term, and, by definition, users are reliable for dicdef's. Some urls are almost 10 years old. My personal recollection is from the 80s, but I have to dig up some old bicycling magazines to proove this. So, this is not a neologism, the page is accurate; the only debate is shold this be moved to a dictionary page.</p>
<p>here are two citations suggesting that retrogrouch is used outside of bike circles <a href="https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=typo-l&amp;T=0&amp;P=28924" class="external free" title="https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=typo-l&amp;T=0&amp;P=28924" rel="nofollow">https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=typo-l&amp;T=0&amp;P=28924</a> <a href="http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2002-January/035803.html" class="external free" title="http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2002-January/035803.html" rel="nofollow">http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2002-January/035803.html</a></p>
<p>The first url uses "retrogrouch" in a non bicycle contex, "As a long-time retrogrouch who thinks HTML has fallen into"</p>

<dd>I'm currently writing this article and take it very seriously. Marvin Kwitko was a great leader in my feild of study; ophthalmology. I have recently read his book "eyes" in my classes, which is a leading book on eye surgeries. Following this, I had the opportunity of meeting his daughter and found out a lot about his exploits. He was married to a steinberg for a period of time, the family that owned a pretty big chain of supermarkets. He was also the first ophthalmologist to bring lazer eye surgery to canada. He was knighted by the queen herself for his advancements in medical science. He's very well-known in montreal for his work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Although his page is not completed yet, it simply needs a little more time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How can I buy more time to complete the article and prove its relevancy to wikipedia as a whole, but mostly within the ophthalmology sector? --<a href="../../../b/e/u/User%7EBeuh_pudding_306e.html" title="User:Beuh pudding">Beuh pudding</a> 08:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, so i corrected all the grammar, wrote the full biography and filled out all his accomplishments and books. I'm working on the references to prove what i wrote, and they should be up by tomorrow. Look it over again now, and go right ahead and google everything in there cause not a word of it is made up or fictitious.

<p>I know that a lot of the its just some moron writing about his pet fish, but this is a serious article about a man who did great things and helped a lot of people. The books he wrote helped a lot of people learn how to treat eyes and surgeries he did saved a lot of peoples eye sight. I hope that you all take this article seriously, and once the references are up, you'll see that none of it is untrue. Thanks again.

<p>Also the first 5 minutes the page was up I just wrote a bunch of stuff real quick that was admittedly untrue. I just wanted to see what the page editor looked like. These are the things that are quoted in the first statement above. About 20 minutes later I posted my actual biography that is all 100% true and verifiable. thanks.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> I'm keen to see references for the long string of letters after his name, but I did check out the book "<i>Eyes</i>" on Google, and the a couple of the scholarships, and they are true.

<p>Ok, so It's referenced that he was knighted in the order of st johns. I've referenced most of his books now (I found all the other ones, im just a little tired of writing the references for tonight). Two of his scholarships are referenced. I noticed above that you pointed out how the book "eyes"is for young people. I dont really see the relevance of that since the rest of his books are all medical books. The long stream of letters is as follows: Medical Doctor,&#160;?, Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, Fellow of the International College of Surgeons, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Knight of the order of ST Johns. The second one I got off of here <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/11/1312" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/11/1312" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. I'd really like to thank you guys for helping me find references. I think at this point its pretty clear that Dr Marvin isnt invented or anything.

<p>So what exactly does it take to keep it from being deleted? Now that it was nominated, is it almost certain it won't make into wikipedia? If I had posted it with all the citations and references right from the start, and it had never been elected for deletion, would it have stayed permanent? I dont know if im all that clear on the process. If you guys have any info I'd really apreciate it.

<dd>I think there are sufficient supporting references now to ensure the article will be kept. Dr Kwitko was clearly a remarkable man. 5 days after nomination this <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> will be closed by an administrator.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and clean-up. I think the claim that Kwitko "pioneered in cataract surgery and laser eye surgery" might be a bit of a stretch. Per <a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_Sandbox1_f11a.html" title="User:AED/Sandbox1">my essay</a>, the claim that he was the first in a particular region (i.e. Canada) to use IOLs or perform RK is not impressive to me. However, according to PubMed, I feel Kwitko has a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;itool=pubmed_AbstractPlus&amp;term=%22Kwitko+ML%22%5BAuthor%5D" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;itool=pubmed_AbstractPlus&amp;term=%22Kwitko+ML%22%5BAuthor%5D" rel="nofollow">sufficient number of publications</a> to meet the guidelines at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 16:28, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Evidently a senior professor with publications in international refreed journals, apart from his books and numberous awards, including one from India. Definitely notable. Needs cleanup though - like this line is somewhat hard to digest "Kwitko has also written well over 100 scientific articles, making him one of the world’s most prolific medical writers." <b>World's most prolific</b> doesn't suit here, since many more people from medicine have written much more.

<p>Thank you so much for the help so far. I understand what you mean by cleaning up, and I see now that some of it is overstating him a bit. I'll be sure to change some of it around. A lot of it was originally written by his daughter and mother, who were likely to be biased in saying how "amazing" he was. I really don't want this article to be biased though, and am completely willing to change it. I really appreciate all of the help all of you have given me thus far. I think his page will be a great addition to wikipedia, specifically in the ophthalmology field. Thanks again so much.

I'd wrap it up now since notability has been established (actually the verified <a href="../../../k/2E/s/K.St.J_0f26.html" title="K.St.J">K.St.J</a> would probably be enough), but the article still reads like part <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">obituary</a>, part fluff piece. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is also a key provision for Wikipedia.

<p>All the statements in the article are now referenced and cited to peer reviewed journals. The fact that he was an important canadian ophthalmologist is cited, as well as the facts that he was the first in canada to do his repsective procedures. Every single one of the books he wrote is referenced to their buy websites on amazon. Its referenced to the Knights of the Order of St Johns that he was knighted. Two of his scholarships are referenced to their websites, the second reference may not be perfect but makes reference to someone winning his scholarship that year which is proof that it does indeed exist. I beleive the first one may be discontinued which is why I cant find it anymore, but it did exist. If it really needs a reference to be there I'll remove it. I think its obvious at this point that he was very influencial in his feild and that he helped a lot of people. I hope at this point the articles deletion nomination will be removed and it can stick. I really wanna thank everyone who helped me write this page and I think it really turned out perfectly. --<a href="../../../b/e/u/User%7EBeuh_pudding_306e.html" title="User:Beuh pudding">Beuh pudding</a> 05:58, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Honestly, the criteria for what is considered a "non-notable candidate" is very subjective. Scot Ross did receive significant media coverage in WI.

<p>Not clearly notable. A few films that have been nominated for notable awards, but did not win. No clear indication that the awards that have been won are notable. So <b>delete</b>, pending an indication of notability. Regards <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 11:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Strongly <b>Keep</b>. I've never heard of him, or his films, but that doesn't mean he's not notable! So his films didn't win 'notable' awards. How many other directors have not won awards, but have articles in Wikipedia? Nominated at Sundance for a Grand Jury prize and nominated for an Emmy impresses me. His films also have wiki articles and, while I note that Kirkman himself has contributed to all of these articles, they have been on wiki for some years. No reason to delete, unless you happen to be Jesse Helms. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> I'd like to see sources for the claims in the article, specifically the Emmy nomination. If that's the real deal, and if someone can show a source for the Sundance information, then this is definitely worthy. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 20:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Strongly Keep!I don't think this should be deleted on the grounds of "un-notable" awards etc. I think that is a matter of opinion- I am quite sure the people that have enjoyed his work find him quite notable whether he won awards or not.</li>

<li>Will do, my apologies. Trying to learn this as I go. As I posted for short time, I'm going to see how this develops within my community and the internet as a whole. If I "jumped the gun" the entry needs to be deleted, but since it's a hot topic in society right now I felt it was deserving. Between the Truth in Video Game Rating Act, Net Neutrality, and Internet Addiction, I think the more references, resources, and discussion we can get about these sort of topics is in our best interest.

It is already the subject of YTMND wowcameron.ytmnd.com/ as well as a forum set up in the last few hours to find the online identity of ACA Kid. It is currently occupying nearly the ENTIRE General Board of the Official Forums, as well as several non-official WoW related sites. img134.imageshack.us/img134/5247/acact5.png As the story aired within the last 24 hours, we'll just have to see how this develops. I will continue to update the entry over the next few days to help determine if this is something worthy of Wikipedia.

<li>Now, see, some of that's just unneccessary. I'm an avid use of Wikipedia because it has info on nearly everything. It's not always Brittanica quality, but it's a start. I appreciate the moderators that legitimatedly want to filter and ensure quality on Wikipedia. MER-C seems to be one such. He raised a concern, I addressed it by simply saying we'd use the 5 days to see if the article was deserving of Wikipedia. No insults, no snide remarks, just a professional concern, and an earnest response. Your comment on this simply managed to offend me. Sadly, at this point I'm warring with myself over whether to get into this and essentially flush the entry down the toilet, or refrain from commenting. I'll compromise. Let me re-write your comments: ••I'd suggest you first review: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a> and see if your original entry falls in that category. There is a news section for news stories located: <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="n:Main_Page">here</a>. Another possible destination for you to "discussion [...] about these sort of topics" because it is "in our best interest" might be the Usenet location: <a href="news:///rec.games" class="external text" title="news:///rec.games" rel="nofollow">here</a>.•• See how easy that was?

<li>There were no insults in what I wrote, either, just straightforward explanations of what Wikipedia is not, and pointers to more appropriate venues if you have come to Wikipedia for the wrong reasons.

Your own information reveals your group to be extremely tiny, and possibly just a vehicle for the vanity of its founders. The sources you mention are too small and too few to be a worthwhile basis for this article and its continued existence (many people get mentioned in local newspaper articles and they certainly are not worthy of Wikipedia articles).

The only similar religious articles that I could think of would be those about some of the modern day pretenders to the Papacy, and those have become rather more noteworthy due to the public/media interest in such people.

<li><b>Delete</b> It is really not worth the fight. It does not matter our notability nor our size, but rather that we are a "fringe group". It seems this is an unspoken policy just like the fact that a newspaper must be bigger than the New York Times or Washington Post to be considered a verifiable source. So just delete this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> You really shouldn't be upset that your article is being removed, the removal of such useless vanity articles makes wikipedia a better "place". As someone who seemingly tries to engage himself in the Wikipedia community then surely you can see the logic in removing bad articles? <a href="../../../n/j/w/User%7ENJW494_b41d.html" title="User:NJW494">NJW494</a> 21:55, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't consider it a vanity article, but that is a matter of opinion. You believe it is and rallied enough support for your point of view. I just don't have any friends here that would rush to my aid. It is that simple. It is politics. But then again isn't everything? I really am sorry, I hope there are no hard feelings. I misinterpreted many of the comments as personal attacks, like the one claiming we would become a suicide cult. But obviously that was not a personal attack just as statement necessary to make sure the vote counted. --<a href="../../../k/f/4/User%7EKf4bdy_6b95.html" title="User:Kf4bdy"><font color="red"><b><i>Kf4bdy</i></b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/f/4/User_talk%7EKf4bdy_529d.html" title="User talk:Kf4bdy"><font color="blue">talk</font></a></sup> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kf4bdy_1b98.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kf4bdy"><font color="black">contribs</font></a></sup> 21:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article and discussion here evidence a group on the size of an individual house of worship (and one of the smaller ones at that), rather than a true denomination. We don't have, so far as I can tell, an article on the group from which it split, which is a informative but not dispositive sign. References aren't online and available (for free) for quick and easy testing, but the quotes from them in the article indicate passing mentions, not articles primarily about the AAC. It therefore is <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>, and does not meet our policies requiring <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and prohibiting <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 23:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even non-controversial moves normally wait until the discussion is closed, as it can get quite complicated, even for experienced users, to ensure all the links continue to go to the right place. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:34, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>This is 62 kilobytes of unsourced (perhaps unverifiable? Original research?), unencyclopedic matter.

<li><b>delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a book in etiquette. You may easily fill 50,000 pages with various indicriminate faux pases, old and new. Some faux pas are interesting and may warrand separate articles, and may be listed in a traditional wikipedia way of lists of articles on topic. Also, the subject is very blurry and the "inverted"/"negated" presentation ("of what's not") is a source of the folloiwng problem. Suppose an etiquette says: "Thou shalt piss only into a <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">toilet</a> bowl". Now what, shall we list here "thou shalt not piss in a dining room", "thou shalt not piss in an elevator", "thou shalt not piss into the pocket of thy neighbor's pants"? <b>Any</b> violation of an etiquette is a fauz pas. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> remove unsourced. This deserves to be cleaned-up, not deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b>, it is almost impossible to source such things and even when sourced to otherwise reliable sources, the sources used by the reliable source are often poor. For example, a newspaper writer may write about his experiences in a single town on a one day stay and apply the apparent faux pas to the whole country. He may mistakenly think that something is a faux pas when it is not or he will think that one thing was a faux pas when it was really a different thing, especially if he does not understand the language very well, or at all. Also, the faux pas of one town may not apply to the rest of the country. This type of source will produce even less reliable information than unsourced contributions from residents of the country. In addition, there will be disagreement about what things are faux pas in different countries and no way to settle the issue in many cases, especially without original research ("I do that, or I've seen it done, all the time and nobody minds" kind of thing). Some of the things listed for the United States, where I live, are completely foreign to me and I would dispute that they exist outside of enclaves, if at all. Finally, it is written in a travel guide style and people have worked in personal and national/cultural pet peeves (I hate that term, but it works the best here), and I do not think a national/cultural pet peeve would technically be a faux pas. An example would be the talking like Steve Irwin and "throw a shrimp on the barbie" faux pas for Australia. Other examples would be ignorance of topics that do not have anything to do with behavior. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:47, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I can't believe this one is up for deletion actually! This article has a lot of flaws, including its existence as a "list", and would perhaps do better being split up into pieces, but I find it very useful and important. While it might be factually inaccurate (I have some reservations to the faux pas attributed to my country), there should be a place for an article like that in Wikipedia, especially now that we have more content on Pokemons than on <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this article could be source and with some tidying to alleviate OR concerns. I have already started to add a few.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I can see where someone would like to see more cleanup and verification, this page by itself is extremely useful. I've travelled to many countries and occasionally committed a faux pas because I didn't know the customs. Many of the things I've seen listed are correct and important for others to know. A page like this is an undeniably useful resource to anyone who travels or just wants to learn and better understand other cultures. It's even good information if you just want to be respectful to someone of a different culture since many societies today are multicultural.

<li><b>Comment</b> Substantial changes have taken place to the article since it was nominated for deletion-including the additions of 87 references and the deletions of many of the crufty and unreferenced items. More can still be done for clean up (like removing the first person tone in some areas) but I think the changes demonstrate that this article has merit in Wikipedia. My hope is to eventually get everything referenced with reliable sources to discourage additions of unreferenced or unreliable sources. I am going to drop a note on the talk pages of the editors who voted delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although I understand the arguments of the original nomination, (ie unsourced, improvements were never made since 2005), I believe that to warrant more effort; the concept behind the article I see to be a relevant and interesting one. In terms of its unverifiable material, it would be more advantageous to cut out, then remove the whole article. As Lasenna says, its useful for travelling, and even otherwise its provides an interesting insight into a specific aspect of various world cultures. I do agree that it must stick to its mandate however, and not expand beyond faux pax, and due to its nature as a potential conduit for stereotypes, be completely verifiable. As for the latter of these, it appears that much has been done in recent days anyways. In terms of the first person tonage, I will do my best to chip in because there is obviously more work to be done here. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorof_12a0.html" title="User:Gregorof">Gregorof</a> 06:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Follow-up</b>. Since leaving my comment above, the article has been revised and I've been invited to re-read the article. I still have to say "delete". The key problem is that it is still <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate list of trivia</a> (although a great deal still remains unsourced or unverified). As a list, it is of indeterminate length (and is already far too large). This is not an article; it's a collection of loosely connected facts put together. Purhaps the problem is that it's far too easy to make lists rather than write articles. I would have no problem with "Etiquette of France", "Etiquette of Japan", etc. as <i>articles</i>, with properly formed sentences and paragraphs. In a properly written article format, care could be taken to clarify some of the alleged errors of etiquette (i.e. that a certain social rule is of a certain region or group or demographic of the country; the meaning and origin behind the social convention, etc.). In its present form, this is not encyclopedic and is just to crufy. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 17:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see your point there, but if this is to be done then I strongly suggest <b>at least</b> keeping this page as a table of contents for quick references that link to the MANY etiquette pages that would have to ensue. Besides that, things like local/national customs are very hard to document but that's why something like Wikipedia should exist - because the citizens would know. They're locally understood, like colloquialisms. How many documented references are there to things like what it means in France to rub the tip of your chin? (On a side note in my defense, I created this account to contribute to the "sound" page, not just comment here.) Lasenna</li>

<li><b>Followup</b>: To me the rewrite had shown a reason why I still think such list is not maitainable on WP and should be deleted. Locating the Czech Republic and Slovakia in <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a></i> is one of the gravest faux-paux a foreigner could make there. Only placing it into the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> could be worse (so the Serbia link looks pretty funny).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The content "<i>Being late for an evening party is acceptable, but never for lunch. It is considered to be rude</i>" is quite new for me but one learns something new every day. The traditional faux-paux documented in the old "how to behave well" books has been mostly swept away by influence of the Americanized TV culture and collecting of the new ones (like the eastern-europeaness-phobia) does not fit very well into current model of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 21:34, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Under Spain, it says "<i>Giving money (for the petrol) to someone who gives you a ride home.</i>" Does that mean one should, or should not give money? The section for United States says not leaving a tip is bad, but how much? In some places, less than 10% is considered an insult. (A foreign born waiter in Boston cussed at me in Chinese when I left a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_two-dollar_bill_03d1.html" title="United States two-dollar bill">$2 bill</a> as a tip for a $15.00 meal ... guess he thought it was fake money.) It's poorly written, it needs more citations, it's unencyclopedic ... <i>and it's not going to go away</i>. So just content yourself by adding {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags and correcting bad grammar ... or remember this article and add a citation when you stumble across one Some Place Else. —141.156.240.102 (<a href="../../../1/4/1/User_talk%7E141.156.240.102.html" title="User talk:141.156.240.102">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.156.240.102_bc0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.156.240.102">contribs</a>) 23:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: it is better than before, but as I said above, otherwise reliable sources use unreliable sources when it comes to faux pas. An example of what I would consider a reliable source for faux pas is a sociologist who has studied the culture in question extensively. A well done <i>scientific</i> survey of faux pas would also be acceptable. However, it is unlikely that suitable sources could be found for all of the countries listed and most sources would probably only give a couple of faux pas each. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. At least in the current state it is more-less valid. The "Rozkos bez rizika" organisation is tiny and not influential. The failure of legalisation so far is due to technicalities, it is not topic of political discissions in the Czech Rep and the groups opposing it have no political power or media presence. Doesn't mention child prostitution in border areas. Doesn't mention that most of the trade is controlled by organized crime. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 23:01, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I never claimed this was a featured article yet. Yes, R-R is a small group, but since it seems to be the only group doing positive things in the area, it merits inclusion. It would not meet notability outside the article though, and that's why I haven't written a full article on them. As to the legislation, you raise a good point, and I can definitely include that fact in the article. But just because something isn't a current events issue, doesn't mean it's not encyclopedic. Child prostitution is definitely something I will be adding more information on in my next go at this article. The organized crime aspect is a bit more difficult to verifiably write about, since the nature of organized crime makes it difficult to quantify objectively. I actually wrestled with that point, trying to come up with a verifiable NPOV take on it, before deciding to leave it out in this edit.

<p>This is a long list, composed mostly of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Whilst many records in this list are indeed true, many are unverifiable or really insignificant - "Most records set by an October hurricane" for example. The article's talk page explains some of these problems in more detail.

<p>A whole series of articles about un-notable British motorcycle club racers, all written by Domcann who is this years champion - see his self written article at Dominic Cann. I can't think of any substantial reason why they should have been inserted into Wikipedia in the first place, except vanity! I am also nominating the following related pages for the same reasons as stated above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin Ellis (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Phil Huntley (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Andy Johnson (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Ian Leah (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Paul Payne (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Andy Roberts (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Geoff Spencer (motorcycle racer)</li>
<li>Chris Wood (motorcycle racer)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also nominate Dominic Cann for deletion - wiki rules state you shouldn't write your own Biography. Rgds, <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrident13_2792.html" title="User:Trident13">Trident13</a> 20:11, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

According to WP:N the following qualify as notable: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports.." This criterion is not met here, because there is no documentation that this is the highest level of motorcycle racing in the UK. It seems this is an amateur club of people who ride this brand of motorcycle. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 03:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: the fact of a game being not yet released is not a sufficient criterion for deletion. For many precedents, see uses of {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_game_5940.html" title="Template:Future game">future game</a>}}. Lack of a fixed release date, lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and, most importantly, lack of notability per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> (which is not a ratified guideline, but has a lot of support), are stronger reasons to delete, in my opinion.

<p>Vanity article about a non-notbale book, published by a vanity press (PublishAmerica). Book is listed on Amazon, however has a sales rank of over 180,000 <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 20:16, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This is an actual published book that has sold over 500 copies so far. It can be found in bookstores in Iowa, Washington, and North Carolina. It can be ordered from Barnes and Nobles bookstores and is now located in some libraries as well.</p>
<p>The page being contested was not written to promote sales of the book. In fact, there is nowhere that states where the book can be purchased. It is merely an informational piece. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mundxanth (<a href="../../../m/u/n/User_talk%7EMundxanth_2e21.html" title="User talk:Mundxanth">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mundxanth_6f3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mundxanth">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>Delete</b> This is a vanity advertisement of a book. I can't rationalize keeping it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Perhaps it is a bit of vanity that the novel is listed here. But isn't that what makes Wikipedia better than the Britannica? That *any* information is available here? Having read the novel, I found it delightful in the traditions of McCaffery and Lackey. I was pleased to see it listed here on Wikipedia as I do use this site for researching and the random informational article. Where is it stated that a writer must have a certain number of sales to list the information about something? For a relatively unknown pair of writers, 500 is pretty good. For you to require sales of 10K is somewhat unrealistic and unfair. It would exclude a number of informative and educational articles.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused by your statement and your summary. You think the article SHOULD be deleted, yet it's a shame it IS being deleted?

This book clearly does not have that, and as a book that has only sold 500 copies, is not nearly notable for an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 17:09, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not convinced that winners of a national dissertation award are encyclopedically notable. It's a feather in her cap but its not an indication of a key contribution to her field. Wikipedia is not an honor roll or dean's list. The second "award" is a <i>grant</i> of the kind academics apply for all the time as a matter of routine (one of the main activities of an academic is writing grant applications).

<p>I've had this page on my watch list since I don't know when. I originally tagged it as an article of dubious accuracy.
