<p>Makemi, You might have waited until you read my response to your posting on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETim_Folzenlogen_9664.html" title="Talk:Tim Folzenlogen">Talk:Tim Folzenlogen</a> - which I wrote immediately after you posted it without getting up from my computer - before sending this to AfD with erroneous information ([addition]: but I see from the edit conflict that you have corrected some of it). I am not the subject of the article. I am a highly educated professional who has taught at the college level for almost a decade, and I would certainly not have taken the time to write an article about Folzenlogen if I did not genuinely believe him to be a notable artist. It is true that I know of Folzenlogen through our both having a past association with the Unification Church, and that almost all of my edits have been on related topics. It is also true that the Manhattan Times is not a big paper; I was surprised myself when I saw that it has no entry in Wikipedia. There may be better sources out there; I put this initial attempt at an article together today based on what I found on the web. Please read below the discussion from talk page of the article in question.</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<p>Before commenting here I would just like to ask editors to read the article carefully. I think there is enough information in the article already to make clear that Folzenlogen is a sufficiently notable artist.</p>
<p>There are a large number of artists (in the broad sense of the word, including painters, writers, musicians, etc.) who have a page on Wikipedia in spite of the fact that, unlike Folzenlogen, they are not sufficiently successful to support themselves full-time. A fair measure of a living artist's abilities and popularity is whether people are willing to pay large sums for his or her work. The fact that even Folzenlogen's small paintings command <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/media/mtimes.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/media/mtimes.html" rel="nofollow">4-figure prices</a> and that he has sold over 1000 paintings is an indication of his significance.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Museum of Art</a>, an "on-line exhibition illustrating major achievements in painting, [etc.]," the page on Contemporary Realism states "After 50 years of being practiced in the wings of the artistic community, Contemporary Realism is making a reappearance," and <a href="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/hallofartmovements/contemporaryrealism.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/hallofartmovements/contemporaryrealism.org/" rel="nofollow">Folzenlogen is listed as one of the 11 references of Contemporary Realism painters</a> or web sites which list painters or discuss Contemporary Realism. Folzenlogen is an important figure within this reemerging genre.</p>
<p>Although I am fairly new to Wikipedia, and am not knowledgeable of every aspect of recommended procedures, I have read much of the material on proposed deletions, but little of it seemed to apply in this case. Because the template instructs "You may remove this message...if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason," I am doing so in good faith. I welcome debate on the issue, however, especially any advice on how to improve the article. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 04:40, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you read the guidelines on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Autobiography</a>? This seems to be an autobiography, and it seems that it is being used as a platform for a very very poorly sourced attack (that's not quite the word I want, perhaps assault?) on Hyun Jin Moon and the Unification Church. Do you realise the amount of vandalism, slander, and attack that will earn you? Are you prepared to put up with that? You could remove the notice, go through AfD, and it's <i>possible</i> that it will be kept, as notability is a difficult issue, and many people are far more willing to have more in the encyclopedia than I think wise. However, you should seriously think about whether you actually want an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 04:53, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, now I understand why you nominated this article for deletion. No, this is not an autobiography! I am not Tim Folzenlogen. I do not even know him personally, though I do know of him (and I am genuinely impressed by his work in addition to my knowing of him because of our both being members of the Unification Church). I didn't know a lot of the details, however, so I did have to do some research on the web to get a lot of the references and quotations, most of of which I didn't know before today. In fact, the reason I put the stub section tag on the "Thought behind the art" section is that I wasn't confident I was encapsulating his thought adequately, and if not I hoped someone would give a more representative quotation.</dd>

<dd>As to the issue of his run-in with Hyun Jin Moon, this is already well-known within the church. Members who spent any time on the Internet have been hearing about it since the mid-90s, and there are several Wikipedia pages which mention it and several web sites where Folzenlogen's letter to Rev. Moon is posted (though I don't think he has it on his web site; he seems to be free of resentment over his experience while a member). I also harbor no resentments, and am not interested in making personal attacks; I explained my rationale earlier today on my user page for the minority of edits which are unfavorable toward the church but that I hope will lead to reforms. My purpose in choosing the username "Exucmember" was because my original motivation for editing (and the character of my early edits) was to counter the religious bigotry toward the Unification Church. I thought it would be a plus in defending Unificationists against such bigotry for it to come from a clearly identified ex-member. I realized recently that the username is significantly detrimental in making any edits that seem critical of the church. Before you jump to conclusions about me, you might want to look at the explanation on my user page and some of my edits on pages such as <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonies.html" title="Moonies">Moonies</a> and pages that link to it or used to link to it, favorable comments about my edits from Unificationist <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> on <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESun_Myung_Moon_b61d.html" title="Talk:Sun Myung Moon">Talk:Sun Myung Moon</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolli_Kangron_8635.html" title="Wolli Kangron">Wolli Kangron</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Theological_Seminary_8885.html" title="Unification Theological Seminary">Unification Theological Seminary</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hope_Academy_64b4.html" title="New Hope Academy">New Hope Academy</a> (which originally sparked my editing, and where you can clearly see from the talk page that I live in the Washington, D.C. area, not New York), <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_bombing.html" title="Love bombing">Love bombing</a>, etc. If it were not for bringing some of the problems into the daylight with the (barest) hope of future reforms, I might well have been accused of being a Unificationist posing as an ex-member. So you really needn't worry about my being attacked. And in fact, before I'd read what you wrote above I had already revised that paragraph in a way that toned it down significantly, feeling that it was disproportionate to the level of detail I had about Folzenlogen's personal biography. I would certainly not have taken the time to write this article if I did not genuinely believe Folzenlogen is a notable artist. I would appreciate any response or suggestions you may have. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 06:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Disregarding the Unification Church issue, most of the text in the article is just an argument why the artist should be seen as of any relevance (and thus as worthy of an wikipedia entry). "compared to Edward Hopper" ... "50 solo shows" ... "popularity is reflected" ... etc. Is he on <a href="http://www.artnet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.artnet.com/" rel="nofollow">artnet.com</a>? No. Is he on <a href="http://www.artfacts.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.artfacts.net/" rel="nofollow">artfacts.net</a>? No. Relevant for contemporary art?

He is claiming notability based on her popularity as a writer, however almost all of the 116 ghits relate to her connection with the Jewish religion or their treatment by the Nazis, and the article contains a link to the subject's indictment of an officer in the camp (who according to Frank's diaries from an earlier year engaged in repeated surprise beatings of Frank), which I think is going to come back and bite someone on the ass (it is at least unwise).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming Makemi is being honest in the first paragraph above, and it doesn't make sense to me. Of course, her first objection was that the article was an autobiography (which it is not), but this assumption still underlies the rest of her comments (except that the Manhattan Times is not a big enough paper).</p>
<p>She seems to imply that a second area of notability, Folzenlogen's being involved in an important incident with a top leader of the Unification Church and subsequently writing about it, somehow makes the article illegitimate. On the contrary - he is notable in two areas, either of which is sufficient in my opinion - and certainly both areas together are sufficient. For comparison, more than 25 "famous whistleblowers" are listed on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistleblower.html" title="Whistleblower">Whistleblower</a> page on Wikipedia, most being famous only in relation to the act of exposing of the misdeeds of powerful people and organizations; only 3 of these do not have their own pages. Folzenlogen doesn't fit this category precisely IMO, but the comparison is helpful. Present and former members of the Unification movement are concerned about the leadership of the second generation, and some believe Rev. Moon has had a tolerant attitude toward the violence of his 3 oldest sons (the second by proxy - I'll explain this if anyone's interested). This genuine and important concern should be addressed by both sides by discussing the facts. It is not appropriate for Makemi to suggest that the issue cannot be mentioned because people will respond vengefully. Besides, this part of the article is very low-key.</p>
<p>Without coming out and saying so, Makemi seems to be implying that Folzenlogen's notability as an artist is just a smoke screen for his notable involvement in violent responses from Unification Church leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep - 2 areas of notability.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise without coming out and saying so, [User:Jbirken|Jbirken] implies that there is something nefarious or suspect about naming accomplishments of a professional painter in a biography. Obviously, naming accomplishments is very common in Wikipedia biography articles. It is as though Jbirken is continuing the same argument that Makemi is making, using the same erroneous assumptions. When I saw that Jbirken had only 5 edits before jumping into an AfD with bold and emotionally charged comments, it took all the goodwill I could muster to trust Makemi and assume Jbirken is not a sockpuppet. Perhaps s/he is a friend who thinks alike, who Makemi asked to contribute to an AfD, or maybe some situation I haven't thought of (but fervent contribution to an AfD on the first day must be unusual for someone with 5 minor edits who hasn't even been welcomed to Wikipedia yet!). The 3 facts s/he cites were in the same newspaper article (normal biographical writing for a profile in a paper); was the author of that article in cahoots with me several years ago just to set up this opportunity? And naming a couple web sites where Folzenlogen's name doesn't appear doesn't impress me.</p>
<p>For the lazy, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">guideline for notability</a> (the <i>only</i> reason this article is being considered for deletion) says: "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious)." The guidelines are clearly uneven; the line right above Painters says "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work" - a far more lenient guideline that would include vastly more people. One "alternative test" says: "Verifiability -- Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now?" Yes, but Makemi argues that the newspapers I got the information from are not important enough. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 01:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I tend to be very picky in regards to my sources, aka <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. The main problem I had with the Unification church part of the article was that it was based on a geocities site, and I never appreciate geocities as a source. The other sources are equally lame. Re: the more lenient guideline, I see no mentions of awards, and I wouldn't count any of the sources given as "reviews", but community interest puff pieces.

<li><b>Comment</b> So, we're talking about an artist here, which makes both sites I mentioned a lot more notable than any article in a local newspaper. Folzenlogen is neither represented by any major gallery, nor is he part of any mayor collection, nor was he part of any major exhibition (please, correct me if I'm wrong). This makes him an rather irrelevant artist, and this has nothing to do with him being member of one church or the other. OK, I'm not a regular WP user, but as an art historian I thought I could contribute something on a topic while idly browsing the AfDs. --Jbirken 10:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more than half a million sites that mention the Unification Church, but very few (that have substantial information) are balanced or neutral. <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/" rel="nofollow">ReligiousTolerance.org</a> is a neutral one, but it represents a superficial perspective and contains errors. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/" rel="nofollow">Geocities.com/Unificationism</a> site is balanced rather than neutral, and its quality is apparently appreciated, as it comes up first when "Unificationism" is typed into Google.</p>
<p>The guideline I mentioned is not "the more lenient guideline"; it is the guideline for "authors, editors and photographers," as I said. My point was that the guidelines vary too much across fields, not to apply a guideline to a different field. I know of award-winning writers with <i>many</i> reviews of mutiple books who have never been able to support themselves financially from only their writing. Folzenlogen's paintings are sufficiently valued that he has supported himself entirely through his art for 30 years. I will comment within 24 hours on his shows, gallery affiliation, and prestigeous clients.</p>
<p>I didn't make a "sock/meat puppet assertion"; I said I assumed the reverse (read what I said). I also said "<b>unusual</b> for someone with 5 minor edits" (rather than "irregular" or "suspicious"). And Godwin's law doesn't apply; did you really not understand my point, Makemi? I could just as easily have used the analogy of Moe and Curly, except that Curly didn't put his complaint in writing. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 19:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I don't know a great deal about art, but geniuses (even in fields that are less subjective) are frequently under-appreciated in their own lifetimes. I don't know whether this fellow is a genius, but perhaps he ought to be given a chance considering that some people think very highly of him. I'd like to respond to the Unification Church issue; I'm a psychologist (Ph.D.), and I read widely on New Religious Movements (for a paper I never finished) some years ago, especially the Unification Church, Hare Krishna, and Children of God. There are some criticisms which seem to be groundless, such as the one about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church#Political_activities" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church#Political_activities" rel="nofollow">Unification Church having been founded as a front group for the Korean CIA</a>, and others where there seem to be legitimate grievances. Nansook Hong's writings about Hyo Jin Moon's violence toward her, and Tim Folzenlogen's writings about Hyun Jin Moon's, are an important addition. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>Do</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DoctorW_9e6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorW"><font color="#007040"><b>c</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorW_8300.html" title="User talk:DoctorW"><font color="#800040"><b>t</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>or</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><i><b>W</b></i></font></a> 22:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (notability as an artist):</b> Folzenlogen was represented by Allan Stone, who personally bought many of his paintings. (For those who don't know, Stone also represented Wayne Thiebaud, whose work at that time commanded the highest price of any living artist.) Folzenlogen became the favorite of Stone's biggest client, the President of Morgan Stanley. Other prestigious clients include Procter &amp; Gamble, Barclays Capitol, Bill &amp; Charlotte Ford, etc. His more than 50 solo shows were mostly in New York; take a look at the <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/bio/bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/bio/bio.html" rel="nofollow">list</a> (fyi, Bunkamura was the premier exhibition space in Tokyo at the time). Folzenlogen dropped out of the gallery world in 2002, and focuses on public art projects now. Take a look at his <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/" rel="nofollow">web site</a> - it's pretty impressive. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 05:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
