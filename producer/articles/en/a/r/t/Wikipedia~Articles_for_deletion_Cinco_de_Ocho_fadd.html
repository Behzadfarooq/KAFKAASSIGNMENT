<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand with what substancial evidence you back up your disrespectful and ineffectual qualms... I would be very interested to see what (if any) evidence demonstrates a lack of cogent content. For a holiday that I have several times participated in (and know my town is not the only), I find it disgraceful that you would throw such rag-tag nonsense about. The claim that this is a hoax is not just false, it's disrespectful and insulting. Mastab

<li><b>Source</b> Mexican Immigration &amp; Popular Culture by David Maciel cites Cinco de Ocho, I believe... I am sorry I cannot provide a page Mastab

<li>Both of these are unsigned edits by User:Mastab, whose edit history primarily includes promoting the Cinco de Ocho holiday and having his edits reverted (though, to be fair, most of said RVs were undertaken by <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a>). Aforementioned book does exist, but Googling for "cinco de ocho" brings up nothing useful. <b>Delete</b> badfaith hoax but willing to change mind if presented with solid evidence. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Marblespire</a> 05:10, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> At least give me some time to provide further evidence. The information provided in the article is a conglomeration of various beliefs, myths, and traditions observed by people both in my town and about the wider global community. I have provided this article with the best intentions, and would appreciate it if people could be a little more lenient in their rulings... as soon as a find a chance to investigate more in depth, I will do so. I plan to make a trip to my local library early tomorrow morning so as to provide you all with verifiable quotes from assorted texts. I hope you all have the patience and maturity to act rashionally, as you have thus far. - Mastab Will someone please tell me how to set a Tag!?

<li><b>Delete</b> as nonsense hoax. Mastab, do you really think that you are going to convince anyone that there is a holiday in Mexican mythology based upon the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frito_Bandito_814c.html" title="Frito Bandito">Frito Bandito</a>? --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 16:26, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Quite possibly yes. By the way, it is not a holiday in Mexican mythology as you have stated, though it now marks a new occurence within the mythological realm. I concur, that would be nonsensical garbage, as the Frito bandito wasn't around until the 1960's. However, it is a "holiday" that is celebrated every October the 13th in various homes across the country and in the wider global community in protest to the discontinuation of Frito Bandito. The mythological story that comes along with the holiday may be infactual, however, I don't see anyone providing better. As I have stated before, the contents of the pages "is a conglomeration of various beliefs, myths, and traditions observed by people both in my town and about the wider global community". I am now off to the library to gather about further resources to support my claim. I cannot believe I am spending so much time defending an article who's deletion would not affect me, but rather thoughs who feel they may gain something from the information provided. I will return shortly. Thanks by the way for the advice Anetode. Mastab 16:49, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Thanks for the Contribution Seniore Eddie Willers of Tampico Mexico. I ecspecially appreciate your statement.. of este es una chinga de mierda. Spanish or not, that translates to "this is a 'fuck of shit' ". I do not believe that kind of language and disrespect is in order in this setting. Regardless of the dialect in which it is spoken. I will cease posting/editing further articles to comply with the many complaints I have recieved as a result of my first (and last) contribution to Wikipedia. If you guys cannot appreciate the practices of another generation, then it's your loss. Whether it's a matter of faith or morals, the fact that you people would dare to critisize these practices is undermining to our society and the common good of the people (minority or not). Thanks.

<li>You refer (several entries above) to "Mexican Immigration &amp; Popular Culture" by David Maciel as your source which cites this holiday. This appears to be a reference to the book "Culture Across Borders: Mexican Immigration &amp; Popular Culture" edited by David R. Maciel and María Herrera-Sobek (Amazon.com finds no other similarly titled work by this or any similarly named author). Fortunately, Amazon.com makes available online the entire index to this book. There is no entry in the index for "Cinco de Ocho" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0816518335/ref=sib_rdr_idx/002-9815340-1719228?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S009&amp;j=0#reader-page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0816518335/ref=sib_rdr_idx/002-9815340-1719228?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S009&amp;j=0#reader-page" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. By the way, the article under discussion claims that "The crisis hit rock-bottom when, at one point, <i>four out of every three</i> Mexicans was a bandito" (emphasis added).

<li><b>Comment</b> Also not mentioned in the index is Cinco de Mayo, a celebration into which the book delves substantially. As the saying goes... don't judge a book by it's cover... Don't judge it by its index either. Agreed the four out of every three Mexicans is unrealistic... a sentence structure mistake. Forgive me for my crime against humanity, that will be corrected to as it should be... 3 out of 4. Keep throwin the hardball... Mastab 16:54, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
