<li><b>Redirect</b> - Could also be "Make Impartial". I think this is a fair vote, and while some people have most certainly been vandalizing and behaving in a childish manner, it doesn't detract from the arguments that others are making. The page in question is of lower rank, and while it does have fans and interests, I don't believe it can be argued to be notable (note I am not suggesting it is necessarily non-notable either, just that notability is not an argument for preservation here). In addition, there is certainly questionable impartiality on this page that makes it borderline vanity, in my opinion. The whole thing takes place as a description of the fantasy world involved, without any noticeable distance or acknowledgment as such. Things such as comic history, controversies that may have arisen in the past, art style used, etc., seem more appropriate for wiki. A 'Comic Summary' (with an appropriate spoiler warning) should be a section, *not* the entire page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 132.198.147.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.198.147.195_e1a0.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.198.147.195">contribs</a>) 18:55, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>No, only that when there are suspicions of sockpuppetery (or someone asking on a forum for everyone to go and vote), comments from new voters and anonymous users don't count. I believe yours is legitimate; looking at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ToucheGnome_f4d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/ToucheGnome">your contributions</a>, one can see quite easily that your account, while being new, was not made solely to stuff the ballot here.

<dd>I know what you mean, but remember that the same applies to every site listed on Alexa. Alexa doesn't count the Firefox(etc.) hits of its #135,056-ranked site, but it also doesn't count the Firefox hits of its #135,055-ranked site, or its #1-ranked site, for that matter. The only way I could see this really making any difference is with sites which are specifically about other browsers. Spreadfirefox.com is probably ranked lower than it should be, for example. Even if we go ahead and assume that Drowtales is a full one-third behind where it should be, it would still only be just barely in the top 100,000... which still isn't really very high. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:46, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment:</b> I can only comment on this, since I made a vote. I know I am not a member of wikipedia, heck I'll be called a "sock puppet". But on the argument of this Alexa, I move that it should not be considered part of validity because it's still only 67% at most, and not even everyone with IE use Alexa. Also, when comparing page results on "Drow" in general on google, Drowtales is still the second on the list to pop up on results. Now take into factor the international audience of the comic as well, and that Alexa is considered a minor search engine when comparing to Google, Yahoo, and even Altavista, though there seem to be a lot of biased for this search engine by some members here. Currently this is the first time I've ever heard of Alexa, and when asking others, only a few knew of it. As an associated webmaster, this comes as a surprise that if this were such a good traffic rating tool, that I never heard of it, in my humble opinion. So my argument on the Alexa results are their true validity to the argument. There are well more websites now then their are people in the world, and being in the top 100K doesn't really matter anymore, once again, in my humble opinion. As for who I am, I'm only a member of Drowtales, member name "Ravinous". That's just incase you are curious so I don't come off completely nameless. --66.82.9.17 16:58, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia guidelines on vanity pages</a> indicate that "Lack of fame is not the same as vanity." "The most significant problem with vanity pages is that they often discuss subjects that are not well-enough known for there to be multiple editors." Page history shows there are indeed multiple editors making useful contributions.</li>
<li>Finally, I see nothing in the Wikipedia candidates for deletion that point to this page being out of place here. Additionally, I notice that the nomination was made by someone without even having an account here. --<a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7EToucheGnome_4d24.html" title="User:ToucheGnome">TouchGnome</a> 20:07, 2005 Jun 16 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As one of the people who have worked on the page in question, I will abstain from voting, even though my vote wouldn't be taken as seriously since I'm not a logged user. However, according to the description of a vanity page, this is not one. The author of the web-comic has not been participating in the creation of the article as far as we know. The editors that I know of have been people who are not paid nor associated with the comic other than as fans. While I admit that there is some issue with professionalism, it is something that has been discussed and is being worked on, and any contrabutions are welcome. As the author has been spending his time trying to get a work space to try and get the comic running more professionally, I personally find it unlikely that he is using sock-puppets to create it. Lastly, in argument for the article, I have noted that in other votes a google count has been used for validity of an article. Therefore I submit that Drowtales has a Google count of 6,790. 64.136.26.228 04:10, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
