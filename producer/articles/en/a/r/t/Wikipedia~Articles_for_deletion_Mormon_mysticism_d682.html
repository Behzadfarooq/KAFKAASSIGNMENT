<li><b>Delete</b> In reviewing the each of the references, there is not a single reference that supports the claims of the article. Almost all of the "See also" refer to blogs or blog-like sites directed by Tsuzuki san. There is a marked difference between a Mormon having an interest in the occult and Mormons having an interest in the occult as is being portrayed by this single editor. This is a subject which I have studied for many, many years, the thesis is made out of whole cloth. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 23:15, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b> I checked the history page and find it interesting that those voting to Delete are systematically deleting the article part by part already. It's hard to call this a good faith Afd. Otherwise, it'd be a weak keep, because I have doubts that the secondary sources are available to back up this as a movement within a movement. If they want to take this in the direction of Mysticism as an important element within Mormonism, then this article has real potential. But the abuse of procedure is troublesome--so I'll keep my vote at 'Keep'. 75.18.4.148 01:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— 75.18.4.148 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.18.4.148_35b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.18.4.148">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></s> <b>Userfy</b> It's clear no useful work can be done on this article until the vultures leave. 69.155.229.46 01:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am re-reading the references, and they do in fact discuss mysticism within Mormonism. They do no describe a group of people who practice such mysticism. In other words, this article is about a club that believes in mysticism. If you want to start an article Mysticism in Mormonism then that is one thing, but to create a wiki page for every yahoo group seems a bit extensive. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 03:32, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oak, can you please define "movement" for me? Also, a movement of what: young people, individuals, or Mormons? If they are Mormons, could you please point me to the evidence that convinced you of this position?</dd>
<dd>I have always interpreted a movement as something that is something that is measureable, observable within society, and definitive. Tsuzuki claims on his referenced blog to support this article that he is LDS and is the president of the Mormon club in his educational institution (high school?) and president of the Pagan club. I assure you, from an LDS doctrinal standpoint, this is not acceptable or recommended; it is a significant conflict. However, he/she is free to choose whatever he chooses, but it is not a choice of a Mormon, but as an individual. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:22, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The word "movement" can be subjective, but in this case, from what I can deduce from the sources cited in the article, it seems to be at least a segment of LDS practitioners embrace some aspects of what is defined as mysticism and that can arguably be considered a "movement." I value your perspective on LDS as I'm not a member, but what I do know is that the LDS, like many religions, is varied and has many different perspectives (I'm Catholic and believe me, most Catholics aren't even aware of the literally hundreds of difference branches and philosophies that fall under just the "Roman Catholic" umbrella). It appears from the specific reliable sources (I'm choosing to ignore the sources like blogs and focusing on more standard ones like the Salt Lake Tribune articles), the existence of interest, both scholarly and lay, in Mormon mysticism appears real. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 20:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - original research, non-notable, and possible POV fork. Just because because an undefined number of people with a Mormon background find an attraction to mysticism &amp;/or the occult does not mean that the subject warrants an article. Where's the article about <b>Lutheran mysticism</b>? It won't be written because it's just not a noteworthy topic, even though I'm sure that there are probably some number of people that come from that background that are interested in mysticism &amp;/or the occult, just as there probably are some people from every religious (or irreligious) background that are attracted to it. The only reason I can see to keep this article would be to provide yet another place for the tired "Mormonism is a cult" POV pushing, but this time it would presumably be a "safe" place to present that argument, since the article topic is already about cultish topics. I for one hope that Wikipedia will do better than to continue finding additional places to fight over that topic. -- <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishUtah_190e.html" title="User:FishUtah">FishUtah</a> 06:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If mysticism has a distinct flavor within a Lutheran setting, then by all means create the article. --<a href="../../../t/s/u/User%7ETsuzuki26_002c.html" title="User:Tsuzuki26">Tsuzuki26</a> 08:00, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My vote for keep is in no way a "Mormonism is a cult" POV as I, and I'm assuming most non-Mormans, don't view Mormanism in that way. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mysticism.html" title="Christian mysticism">Christian mysticism</a> has a very long history and there seems to be some recognition of this branch of it. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 08:08, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course you are correct that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mysticism.html" title="Christian mysticism">Christian mysticism</a> exists as a significant topic -- however the "me-too" tact taken on this article <i>does not</i> support it's notability, just as any other article about |Fill in the blank with a denomination| mysticism would not without good, solid references demonstrating it is significant as a distinct topic. I'm also not saying that the article as currently written is inherently anti-Mormon, though I feel that it <i>is</i> an article with an agenda; I'm just warning that it is likely to be hijacked for "Mormonism is a cult" POV purposes. First and foremost this article is Original Research about an obscure topic that doesn't have the support of references that are generally acceptable on Wikipedia, but there is also additional reasons for removing it based on unwarranted POV forking, both within the Mormonism topics, as well as with Christian mysticism, syncretism, comparative religion topics. -- <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishUtah_190e.html" title="User:FishUtah">FishUtah</a> 17:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
