<li>Self-evidently not. When Googled together with their band name, they go down in flames. To Google without the bandname is meaningless (lots of people could have any name you like). <s>Merely quoting from an article extension to the article (which didn't provide any reference, proof, justification etc) doesn't prove the slightest thing: you can't say "this article is notable because this same article says here that it's notable".</s> And <i>I</i> have a history going back to the 1970's!-<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 7 July 2005 01:53 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, that was a bad way to say what I meant. I meant that VfD is for <i>establishing</i> notability not merely asserting it (which is all you've done). By quoting back the very content that needs to be established, your argument is circular and internal. External verification of the notability of all 3 artists does not consist of a mere claim that they are notable — surely you agree that other evidence is needed. I personally didn't find any, and I looked. You've <i>not</i> looked (or haven't showed us where) but <i>still</i> seem to have found some! -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 7 July 2005 02:17 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an apparent vanity page announcing the graduation of Ms. Rivas from Carnegie Mellon University. There is pretense of notability by way of a claim that, at 20 years old, she is the youngest woman to graduate since 1945. Since typical age of a college graduate is 21, I find it doubtful that Carnegie Mellon has gone 65 years without graduating a single female younger than that. It's outrageously unlikely. In any event, the information is not verifiable at the university website, the local press did not cover this supposedly historical event, and it is in fact thoroughly non-notable. Congratulations to Ms. Rivas on her graduation, but some genuine accomplishments would be nice before we start an article on her. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 7 July 2005 00:35 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. The vehicle is indeed canon, and the Lucasarts website indicates that the Scarab fighter will have more information on it in some upcoming books, along with other vehicles featured in the game. We can either keep the article until then, or someone will come along and write it when more information is available. I don't think it matters really; whoever writes the new one will most likely remove the information in this one anyway. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 7 July 2005 13:35 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Looks like it only exists in a game. This makes is non-canon by definition, does it not? I thought Lucas always claimed only the films were canon. Anyway, there's no article about the game, so why is one particular type of ship used in the game more notable than the game itself? <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 7 July 2005 16:37 (UTC)

<li>Lucas divides SW into canon levels. Movies are the top level, followed by EU books. Games are in the lowest level, but vehicles mentioned in games are almost always considered canon. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 7 July 2005 16:47 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not quite. For instance <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyle_Katarn_a4c5.html" title="Kyle Katarn">Kyle Katarn</a> played a major role in SW despite being a video game character; his story has been moved to books and is considered quite canonical.

<li>It looks like a fork of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_breaking.html" title="Horse breaking">horse breaking</a>. It seems like some editors didn't like the violence of that article and decided to make a new article about non-violent horse training, or something.

<li><b>Keep</b> My name is Amanda and I am the creator of this Kevin Loxley section. Certainly I am happy to see that at least one other person has expressed a positive comment as for keeping the page up. As stated in the section, little is known about Loxley, but his name is a major buzz in Canadian literary publications. It is believed by this scholar that Loxley has been publishing for at least six years under the radar. This interesting man and gifted scholar is very much worthy of a page here. But, if not now, don't be surprised when his page pops up again as his popularity grows.

<li><b>Keep</b> A mass email has been send out by Amanda Newman to the Listserv of two Canadian universities, as well as Canadian Lit. publications. So, expect more debate. Loxley is the real deal.

Bald assertions, however, are not very useful. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> July 7, 2005 16:10 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If his work has come to the attention of the literary world then name some of "his work". So far there is absolutely nothing verifiable. These <b>keep</b> voters are all making logically contradictory claims. First, what he's written is a nebulous, tantalizing mystery then he's a Canadian literary sensation within the span of a few hours. At the worst this is a hoax, at best a case of non notable vanity. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 7 July 2005 16:56 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think the point that most 'Keep' voters here are trying to make is that Loxley doesn't have a following on the Internet for the simple reason, he does not publish under his own name.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> Changed to <b>Keep</b> <s>non-notable/not-verifiable. I noticed that the article now states the source as his wife and student. If external and verifiable sources can be provided, then I'd consider changing my vote. As it currently stands, though, I think removing the article is the right thing to do.</s> I've reviewed the sources now listed on the talk page and am satisfied that this is a real person with real accomplishments. I note that this person holds patents in Canada, the United States, and Europe. I also note that the author has provided satisfactory sources to justify a keep, in my opinion. Though many of the sources are not online, I think we have to be careful about deleting content that lacks online reference. There's lots of information out there that has not yet landed on the Internet so we must be mindful not to toss stuff simply because we cannot quickly validate it with google. Since the publications and patents are now verified, I think we should keep and let this article grow and mature.

<li>Further examination reveals 30 more like this one. (Category:C-Train stations) I have respect for the job done and the time taken, but none of these are likely to ever be expanded into notable articles. If someone gets killed at a tram stop (either someone famous or in an unusual way) then perhaps.

<li>Hmm... I think subway stations and railway stations are notable enough to justify individual articles, while bus stops definitely are not.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, there should be an article about the region -- in fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find that we <i>do</i> have such an article -- but this reads like someone's high-school essay. It would probably be best to delete this and start over. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 7 July 2005 06:38 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - A google search for "Mediterranean Region" (470,000 hits) shows that it is a phrase used by others (although often it is about Meditteranean Turkey and not the whole region, etc). However, this does not mean that this article should not be changed a lot and a lot more after that to make it encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 7 July 2005 06:44 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Edit</b> The principle behind this is correct and it is definitely not the same as <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, which is a geography article primarily about the sea itself. There is a distinct socio-economic context here that is as valid as Northern Europe or Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately the article needs a rather heavy rewrite to get it off its soap-box and make it NPOV. But then, lots of Wiki articles started that way. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 7 July 2005 14:30 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is a real region, and is not about geography like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, or about distant history, like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Mediterranean_region_bb67.html" title="History of the Mediterranean region">History of the Mediterranean region</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The problem with the article is not just POV-related, but also shaky English, and total failure to outline: It's not at all clear from this article what the Mediterranean region countries are, <i>why</i> they might have certain things in common or issues with each other, and why the article is concentrating on certain issues rather than seemingly much larger ones. Of course, these are editing things rather than VfD things. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 8, 2005 17:30 (UTC)

<li>Exactly.

<li>you could rename it 'everything I can think of which is wrong with the mediterranean and probably everywhere else'. It contains just about nothing you might expect to be in an article under its present name. You might extract sentences from it and stick them into other geographical articles for different countries, but people interested in those articles might object.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Looking up <i>urethral penetration</i>, the only non-pornographic site that mentioned it (names it vaguely and that is all) is here: <a href="http://www.fairfield.edu/x1965.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fairfield.edu/x1965.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairfield.edu/x1965.html</a>. In this statement here (my bold):
<blockquote>
<p>Sexual assault occurs when a person performs or compels another person to perform any sexual act or to have any form of sexual contact without consent. Rape is a specific kind of sexual assault that involves any vaginal, oral, anal, or <b>urethral penetration</b> with any body part or object without consent.</p>

<dd>Actually, the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexology_topics.html#U" title="List of sexology topics">List_of_sexology_topics#U</a>, lists 'urethral self-instrumentation' as a topic, which if put into google, surprisingly gives results from <i>actual</i> information sources (although not necessarily sexual). Accordingly I now would say <b>move and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../u/r/e/Urethral_self-instrumentation.html" title="Urethral self-instrumentation">urethral self-instrumentation</a> . <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 14:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And of course, <b>rewrite</b> , because I'm not so sure about the notability of the references made, and certainly statements such as this: "stretching of a male's penis hole, allowing another male's penis [...] to be inserted for sexual stimulation." are questionable. In its current state it is more an article regarding a neologism than a practice. <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 15:10, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Ben Bullock here.</p>
<p>This page wasn't written by me, I believe it was written by a sysadmin at GOL Japan called Brett Arthur Robson. The article is inaccurate, and frankly libellous, and since I don't wish to feature in Wikipedia, please feel free to delete it.</p>

<p>Tagged for a speedy as "nonnotable" but that is not a criterion for speedy deletion. Even under the new proposed criteria this would not qualify since author of a website does <i>assert</i> notability. Nonetheless, I cannot see that the website is notable, and the article fails "Geogres rule" (For those who don't know what that is, it says something about "barros" having a little "B").

<li><s><b>Abstain</b></s> <b>Delete</b> I really don't know about this one. I find many references to "Banana Man" or "Bananaman" with respect to "Singapore Idol", and some controversy surrounding that, but no reference to this name. Problem is that I'm searching in ASCII, and most references to this show and this person are almost certainly <i>not</i> in ASCII text.

<ul>
<li>I came to Wiki about a week ago as a newbie and started writing Security breaches, then was told that I had failed to achieve NPOV, so I started to try to rewrite to fix that, and it soon became obvious to me that my efforts to fix POV were becoming too weasle-wordy, so I stepped back and thought about how best to define some of the ingredients of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> that are essential to avoiding Security breaches in the first place, this being one of them. An enterprise that does regular <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Security_Audits_f880.html" title="Computer Security Audits">Computer Security Audits</a> is much less likely to sustain Security breaches or have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_insecurity.html" title="Computer insecurity">Computer insecurity</a>.
<ul>
<li>My intention here is to define how computer security audits fit into a larger picture, giving examples of how tools for that purpose are available for a diversity of platforms and software applications, then make this one of several main articles within Security breaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Computer security audit is a noun. It is an iterative process. There is little point in doing one audit. It is like <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_5b51.html" title="ISO">ISO</a>. You set a standard, you test that you have met the standard. Either there is something to fix, or it is time to raise the bar on the standard.

<dd>The problem is not you personally. The problem is that this article (and Security breaches for that matter) is not an encyclopedia article, and doesn't seem to even be trying to be. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>. Every Wikipedia article is to be an encyclopedia article -- not an outline, a collection of comments, a discussion forum, or something else.</dd>
<dd>By analogy: If you enter a painting contest and submit a sculpture instead of a painting, expect to be disqualified. It may be a very good sculpture, but it's not what the contest is about. That's a goal of VfD -- removing things which are not encyclopedia articles from the Wikipedia article space.</dd>

<dd>I notice that there is more than one kind of Wiki out there. Are you able to direct me to one which welcomes what I think I am trying to do:
<dl>
<dd>Security in the Computer world seems to be lacking all over the place, but solutions do exist, that many people seem not to be aware of. I want to try to describe the reality, the problems, and show a diversity of potential solutions. I guess that is your sculpture parallel, in which I think I am doing a painting, and you think I am doing a sculture, so perhaps one solution is for you to redirect me to where sculpture is welcome. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 7 July 2005 18:48 (UTC)</dd>

My interest in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security.html" title="Computer security">Computer security</a> is bigger than any one platform, so I looked for a Wiki that was platform neutral, but perhaps made a mistake in selecting this one.<a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 7 July 2005 18:54 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There are other areas where I am ignorant. Perhaps someone could add to my talk page collection of places to study, what is meant by ideiosyncratic and article ownership.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a valid important topic, I am surprised it is not covered yet. It was listed for deletion by a newbie user whose first edit was on June 30th 2005, two hours after the author, also a newbie user, had started it and while he was obviously still working on it.

<dd>Wow, I haven't been called a "newbie user" recently. I've been working on Wikipedia since March 2002. Maybe you haven't been here long enough to know that a user's contributions list can span several pages?&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>A vote for deletion, by the way, doesn't mean that a particular <i>topic</i> is not worthy of being covered in Wikipedia. It means that a particular <i>article</i> is not appropriate to Wikipedia. I agree with you that computer security audits should be covered in Wikipedia. However, I cannot agree that this particular article is anything resembling an encyclopedia article. Wikipedia is not (as <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">User:AlMac</a> seems to believe, above) simply a free-for-all wiki -- it is an encyclopedia project. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 7 July 2005 21:21 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, FOo. I don't know why your earlier edits weren't shown (I can see them now). But then you should know not to bite newcomers and your listing within a few hours was bad style. Also I wonder about your misconception of article ownership? According to the edit-history of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_security_audit.html" title="Computer security audit">Computer security audit</a> you haven't tried to fix the problem (or if the system is swallowing edits again, I can't be sure you didn't).

<dd>Having been on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Newpages</a> patrol before, I don't think tossing something non-encyclopedic onto VfD counts as "biting newcomers" -- it counts as cleaning things out which don't belong on Wikipedia.

<dd>Not a bad idea. Material which isn't an encyclopedia article simply doesn't belong on Wikipedia, but it could perhaps be expanded into a work of some other sort. Since a good section of this article is "how-to", and much of the rest is a bare outline made of bullet points, perhaps that would be a good place to put it. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 8 July 2005 00:58 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The cleanup template should remain. To resolve the cleanup issue, most of the details of the article would probably be better put into a Wikibook.

<li>Several people here told me about Wiki books. I been looking around there. It seems to me that Wikibooks not as rich as Wikipedia in volume of topics, while Wikibooks goes to greater depth of subject matter, like chapters of a text book.

<li>I used what y"all taught me to try my hand at a Wiki book. My first effort there is <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400" rel="nofollow">SQL/400</a>. I will see if this gets a reaction there that is positive or negative. It seems to me that many people there are using the kind of listing writing style that I got my hands slapped for here. I do not know if this means that different styles are welcomed at different Wikis, or if what I have seen so far are all works under development that won't be that style when all the content gets there. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlMac_ad62.html" title="User:AlMac">AlMac</a> 22:44, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Americans have their own article, Latin Americans don't. Also (from what I know) most Afro Americans identify themselves as such. There is no article for Afro-British inspite of the fact that my experience is that there is much more race consciousness in the UK, and much higher levels of insidious rascism, than in Latin America, and I suspect the same can be said for the US. By singling out black Latin Americans without writing an article about Latin Americans as a whole I would argue we are being rascist, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> July 9, 2005 00:05 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yeah, I would say that's useful information, although again I don't like the title and would prefer something without a racial distinction. After all, that culture is more the culture of slaves exported from Africa and their descendants, and not that of Africans who immigrated of free choice afterward. It's also a culture adopted by a number of European-descending Americans. Also, notice that <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_the_United_States_a6a3.html" title="Culture of the United States">Culture of the United States</a> ignores that culture entirely and talks exclusively of American culture as being white American culture. Note also there is no article on "white American culture", since that seems entirely synonymous with "American culture", and therefore the whole article on US culture is devoted to people descending from Europe, and other immigrants are administered under third-class subcategories. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 04:30, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I've been slowly coming in and adding information and editing on this page. I've run websites and forums on Afro Latino cultures for several years and have studied it quite a bit. Afro Latin American studies are "developing" right now. It is developing in the academic fields of Latin American studies and African/African American studies. There is quite a bit of research available on the topic, although I believe it is under-represented and understudied. It seems like the "accuracy" problems are more about semantics here. As far as label goes - the real issue is whether or not this should be under African American or not. In Academic fields, African American is starting to become more accurate and inclusive by addressing "Africans in the Americas." But, that is not a complete transition and may never finish. The entries for US African Americans (afroestadounidenses) is dense as it is and would require vast reworking to include the history of the African Diaspora in more than a twenty other nations. Considering this is an English language portal, a focus on the curent English language meaning of African American (US Blacks) seems appropriate - as is a separate reference to Afro Latin Americans (Afro Latinos or Afrodescendientes). As far as "racial or cultural labels" - the history of these cultures as identifiable communities and groups started with racial distinctions that pushes their original diverse culture together and continues to affect those communities on that level. It's appropriate. 14 July 2004 -- Cacimar</li>

<dd>I wouldn't exactly call it "failed". Perhaps it wasn't as popularised elsewhere in the world, but certainly in the UK the concept of toothing got significant press coverage; even a bbc news article: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3673093.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3673093.stm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. I think people should be able to look the term up in Wikipedia, even if it's only to find it was just a hoax. The term has been widely enough used! <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 7 July 2005 21:34 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to add to my last comment, this is a made up term, not used to describe anything other than this phenomenen, yet it gets 115,000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=toothing&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=toothing&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">google results</a>. Surely that goes to show how widely it may have been believed and used. It also inspired a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62687,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,62687,00.html" rel="nofollow">Wired</a>, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1091429.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1091429.htm" rel="nofollow">ABC</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3673093.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3673093.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a> news article, as well as stories in a significant amount of the UK's newspapers and magazines. It was also <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/2054256&amp;tid=133&amp;tid=100&amp;tid=193" class="external text" title="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/2054256&amp;tid=133&amp;tid=100&amp;tid=193" rel="nofollow">discussed</a> on <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>. It may well have been popularized significantly more in the UK than elsewhere in the world, but the term did gain usage. It may be a hoax, but it was certainly one which was believed upon. As long as the article retains a NPOV, explains it was a hoax etc etc, I see it as a useful definition and explanation of the term. I might add also that it was a term I had heard of long before reading this article, and one which I was interested to find is now an acknowledged hoax. Surely the article should remain so that other people may do the same. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 7 July 2005 21:45 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I new to this great website and still just learning. I didnt want to do anything until I figure things out, but this is much to grave. I born in Esfehan (been in US for 2 years) and I know that there is such a person as Ameen Dorri that was born in 1990. No joke, no lies. There is such a thing as Islam's Students, but they were not made in 2004 or whatever this article is claiming. This is an old organization made during the time if Imam Khomeini. I dont know what this article is, but I suspect it is a twist. The question I have is how anybody knew this person? Ameen Dorri is around 15 years old for heaven's sake! Sure, he was a brilliant prodigy for his age, but most definitely not how the article describes him. I say delete, however keeping in mind that this person exists though he is not really that important to have an encyclopedia article written about him. That is crazy! <small>(unsigned vote by Az Iran)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> On a second thought, I think it would be good to keep this article however revising it to make it factual.

<li><b>Delete</b> the lot. And there's more. Striver has been trying to evade controversy on the main Islamic history articles by creating dozens of his own. Striver does not admit that the Muslim traditions he wants to include, the <i>hadith</i>, are extremely problematic as historical source material. As many secular, Western, scholars have observed, instead of the sources closest in time being the ones that are the fullest and the most detailed, the Islamic historians seem to have more and more material as time passes. Western scholars believe that most of it has been invented for polemic purposes. If he wants to include the standard Sunni, Shi'a, and Ibadi hadith collections in Wikibooks, that would be fine. A service to the world community. Importing a mass of dubious material into Wikipedia, as if it were fact, is not a service to anyone. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Zora, you miss the point. The point is not to bring the hadith COLLECTIONS to wikipedia. The point is to REPRESENT THE MUSLIM VIEW ON THE SUPOSED EVENTS. Now, it is true that Muslim have hadith as the main source for our BELIFE, but that does not matter one bit. For all you care, it could be the figment of our imagination, why we belive the event happened is TOTALY IRRELEVANT. As for hadithes, i have explained it extensivly, hadithes give a glimps her, a glimps there. It does not give the whole event in one shot. So i go to non-primary source of hadithes and report how they managed to puzzle together the event. Just take a look at the "external source", its full of prominent Muslim sites giving THEIR VIEW of what happened. They could be wrong, it could be non-factual,they might use FULL BIAS when doing their reconstruction, but IT DOES NOT MATTER WHY OR HOW THEY CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION, im just REPORTING THE MUSLIM VIEW OF THE SUPOSED EVENTS. in fact, im going to make that clear in the articles, i sugest that everybody takes a look att the uppdate ill make to the articles.</li>

<li>its a representation of MUSLIM BELIF OF THE EVENT, wich is all that matters, since it is what Muslims belive that matter to them'</li>
<li>It says why the event matter (as if that would be necesary considering wikipedia contains <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_poop_girl.html" title="Dog poop girl">Dog poop girl</a>)</li>
<li>It shows it is NOT USING HADITHES, rather, it use MUSLIM RECONSTRUCTION from the hadithes.</li>

<li><b><s>not delet</s></b> yes of course it rehashed source material, what did you think encyclodpedias contain? <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>It can not be included in a biograpy, it would clog the biograpy and make it unrideable. And what about everybody else that are involved, are whe supposed to clog upp their biograpy as well?</p>
<p>Just take a look att the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Battle of Bassorah">Battle of Bassorah</a>, its obvious that it can be included in a biography, not to say in the biography of every single one included in it.</p>
<p>Its the same with this series, all the event Muhammad (as) did can not fitt in his biography, that is long enough as it is. And yes, they do have a relevance. If ti was me doing stuff nobody would care, but we are talking about the person that over one billion people are trying to imitate. What more could be relevant than report on actions that over a billion are imitating?</p>
<p>Marjas dedicate THEIR ENTIRE LIFE to read stuff like that so they can tell people if is allowed to listen to music or if its allowed to have an abortion: THIS IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF EVERYDAY ISLAM, the day-to-day practices of Muhammad!</p>
<p>Of course this would not fitt in a bok, but this is not a book, its a electronic encyclopedia and of course it does use other ways than books. I does not have everything on pages, it has one event per article so and all relevant persons can link to that event. This event tells a lot about how the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> acted in their private life as well. It is the farthes thing from uninportant and it is set upp in best way possible: NOT everything in one long meaningless article that nobody care to read, rather, on event at a time so it can be linked to it whenever it becomes relevant..</p>
<p>Remeber this is not a book, information is not costly to keep and it has a value. Its not trash, its the preserved day-to-day life of the peoble that over one billion are imitating.</p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. I still fail to see the purpose to those pages and it is hopelessly misnamed. If anything, you should expland the page on Muhammad to include some of this information... I fail to see how this would clog the biography... if it did, someone would split it. and there is not too much uncylcopedic information here anyways. And i do not see the point of having every small event in his life mentioned... If people wanted to find out about that, they would read the Qur'an...

<li><b>Comment</b> My friend, trust me, if i would put even one fourth of that in the Muhammad biograpy, it would be deleted within the houre. It simply does not fitt in the biograpy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your analogi with Jesus (peace be upon him) does not work for several resons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the only source to what Jesus did is in Bible, more or less. And it follows a very short period of time, less than three years. Muhammad on the other hand has over 20 years of his life writen down, every single thing he did, done to including relieving himself!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jesus life is not the source for such an extensive work as Muhammads life is. People dedicate decates, over forty years, onlu to learn what he did and why he did that. That information is then prosest and the detailed Muslim Jurisprudence is derived from it. Have you ever wondered why Muslims men cant have gold rings? Since Muhammad forbade that during his life. Now, trust me, its imposible to include all that details to the main article, or any artice, but it dosent mean its irrelvant! It affect Muslims day-to-day life, in contrary to Jesus teaching that are mosltly allegorical. When did u turn you chek the last time?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Muhammads life is NOT in the Quran! Let me repet that, its NOT in the quran! Ther has been sugestiosn to make a vers-to-vers comentry of the Quran. If that is important, then Muhammads <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> is equaly merited to be included to Wikipedia. Furthermore, the hadithes are not to be read anywhere in a single narratative flow, people dedicate their entire life to sift troght the material and get coherent view of all the details. Now thanks to computers that can be done instantly, you just need everyones biography and link the correct event to the correct biograoy!</li>
</ul>
<p>I repeat, this material can not be found in the Quran, in can not be found in a ordered manner in any book, its spread over volumes of books in a non-cronological order, and not even in one pice, its it often takes 4 hadithes in diffrent volumes to make sense one event! People dedicate their live to this, its not a small matter, its not easly available and it is definitly worth to represent in a encyclopedia that aimes to collect "all human knowledge"! Think about it, it may sound as every-day event to you, but remeber that it shapes the life of over on billion people that strive to mimic Muhammad's smalest action, including how to greet eachother! Its not godnight-tales!</p>
<p>I mean, if <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Bagger_acde.html" title="Rich Bagger">Rich Bagger</a> can have a articel, i dont get why events that shape 1/6 of the world cant have an article! Take a look at <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">sunnah</a> and you will see that what im saying is correct!</p>
<p>It is WAY do much matterial to fitt in a biography, not even 1/10 000 would fitt in a biograpy, and even if it did, is it supposed to be repeted in every biograpy that of those whom partake in the event? This is the best solution, to have an article series, and link all involved to that article!</p>
<p>I mean, c'mon, this is not something i make money on, and its nothing WP looses money on, i just want to have <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammads</a> <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> represented on Wikipedia!</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Well, the problem is that this things do not come from a single source.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, i see what you mean, but tell me, is the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> article coming from one single book?</p>
<p>Its like this:</p>
<p>Ther are several hadith that explain one given event. Scholar that have more knowledge than me have gone throughe the chain of narrations of them and authenticated them. The authentic hadithes can be found in diffrent collections, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/001.sbt.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/001.sbt.html" rel="nofollow">here for example</a>. In one of those collections one can say x whent to home and ate a burger. the next hadith in the other part of the collection says that after x ate his burger, he whent to work.</p>
<p>Now, is it original research if i make a article that claims x whent home, ate a burger and then when to work?</p>
<p>In manny cases even puting the hadithes together is done in diffrent biograhis of the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">sahaba</a>. Manny of this event simply would not fitt in a article biography of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">muhammad</a>, since everything he did is recorded.</p>
<p>However, they are relvant, specialy while doing the biography of the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahab.html" title="Sahab">sahab</a>, in those cases it can be benefitial to link to those events instead of repeting them in every single biography.</p>
<p>Take for example Events with Muhammad: 1. in whose biography should it be included?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_the_Persian_dfff.html" title="Salman the Persian">Salman the Persian</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilal.html" title="Bilal">Bilal</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../k/h/a/Khabbab_ibn_al-Aratt_7e3a.html" title="Khabbab ibn al-Aratt">Khabbab ibn al-Aratt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This cant be included in <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, that article is to long as it is, however, it can not be included in any of the other biographies eather, since it is Muhammad that is the main character!</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, i found that event in a web site, but al of them dont come from the same website, that what makes it "not a book".</p>

hmm.. on second tough, i disagree... i ... i mean, i source says.... a event took place at 1, 5 and 7 am, a second source says what happened at 2, 6 an 9 am, and a third source gives the names, and i combine that in a article that says the events of "1,2,5,6,7 and 9 am + names" is that a book? no. is it original research? no. Its a legitimate article. Thats my view. Im sure they did not find everything in <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_poop_girl.html" title="Dog poop girl">Dog poop girl</a> in one and only source, and that is not transwikied to Wikibooks... conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>not delet</b>, its a legitimate article, no book, no original reasearch, it a extension of several biographies, if any biography is legit, then the extensions are legit as well.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> 10,000 pages of every detail of a man's life, no matter how important, does not belong in an encyclopedia. Neither do a simple series of collected quotes from multiple works. If you were to write an article on, say Muslim views on the Nature of Heaven, and then include the references you have now in Events_with_Muhammad:_2 to demostrate that there would be no elderly people present, then that would be entirely acceptable. There needs be no direct back linking from every Sahaba to every event in which they are involved with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Coment</b> I understand what you are saying, but remeber that that hadith carries more issues than that. It need also to be duplicated to Muhammads sense of Humar and also in the biography of the people engaged in the event. In that view, its better to have it in one article and link to it from every other place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, whe are not talking about "10,000 pages of every detail of <i><b>a man's</b></i> life", rather "THE man" 1'200'000'000 people try to imitate.</p>

<dd>I am quite aware of just how import a man he is. However, Wikipedia is not a set of instructions for how to live as a good Muslim. Furthermore, by requiring all of these interlinks, you would be trying to create tens of thousands of pages, each of which would have to link to thousands of other pages detailing every mention of that person, or that event, in any context. And you would be creating at least half of these pages under what are essentially non-sensical, non-searchable, and non-encycoledic titles. This last point is the most relavant here. This VfD refers only to the three pages in question, not to whatever grand designs you may have. And "Events with Muhammad 1, 2, 3 etc... ad infinitum are simply not suitable titles for articles. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 23:54, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well written article, but it is still non-notable blogger wankery devoid of real content. Just because some self-proclaimed, vain "online journalists" repeat a meme on their web-site in every post doesn't mean it is fit for inclusion in an encyclopedia. 193.77.153.149 7 July 2005 15:24 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> advertisement for a MMORPG, i don't know where you got that from, but anyway, that isn't the case. the Snow Ravens are a little-known faction in the science fiction boardgame that had its heyday back in the late 80s, know as Battletech (for those who want proof it exists, go to www.classicbattletech.com ). there are online games for Battletech, but not like WoW or Everquest or such; one, MegaMek is essentially an electronic representation of the boardgame and another (which name eludes me) is like the Battletech version of Space Empires. oh and there's the Mechwarrior games. well long story short Battletech, which many long thought to be at death's door has come back to life (the gaming community that is) and more source material was produced, wherein, a little-known faction known as the Snow Ravens, have gone from being nobodys to well, a a fairly well known faction lets say. i have a great affinity for this faction, and i wrote an article that was so well-written that much to my own amusement, it was mistaken as copied from a book. Snow Ravens are notorious for talking, and so i chose to write not only the article for them first (as opposed to the other Clans) btu also make it the biggest, because their reputation for garrulousness has gotten to be pretty bad these days. i apologize. still, it would be nice if someone would tell me what i did wrong in the first place, geez, everyone is so mysterious around here. - the offending party</li>
<li><b>keep</b> There's no precedent I can find for deleting a wikipage concerning a fairly popular subgroup of a fictional property--that being the Battletech and Mechwarrior universe. This being a very informative page and there being little to no substance whatsoever in accusations of delete-worthy offenses, I see no reason to Delete. --Sennou Yukari. 12:01, 15 July 2005</li>

<p>This article was speedy-deleted back in May. The speedy-delete was opposed and the article recreated. The person recreating the article tried to follow the right practice and immediately created the VfD discussion page. Unfortunately, the page never got posted to a VfD day-page. On 7 July, someone asked on VfD Talk that this discussion be closed because "It's been up for vfd for 2 months now." Not realizing that the discussion was never posted for community discussion, it was incorrectly closed. As a procedural matter, I am re-opening the discussion and posting it to the current day page. The 5 day discussion clock starts now. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 7 July 2005 21:12 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> -of course I'd vote this way being the originator, but let me try to justify. This is fun, it's not meant to be 'just fun'. An extensive list compiled by a variety of people both scientists and non-scientists has the potential to give a true insight into the life of a scientist, beyond the usual "dry" descriptions of laboratory work. It is my intention to take the input I receive in this article and to use it to write a wikipedia article on a "life in science" that includes not only the dry and rational aspects, but also the fun and offbeat aspects. So while this may not be an encyclopedia article <i>per se</i>, it is still a useful list. Furthermore, I can't see how it qualifies for any of the deletion categories under Wikipedia's current deletion policies. Whether it would under the <i>proposed</i> policies is arguable. It's not like I'm some vandal or something. Check my other contributions. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynaptidude_a311.html" title="User:Synaptidude">Synaptidude</a> 7 July 2005 22:52 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, the person who posted the article orginally also posted 8 or 9 other articles on other photographers, so I doubt that at least originally the article was self promotion. As to the subsequent edits, who knows. Regardless, I followed several of the links and it does seem that he is a relatively notable photographer. I don't know what number of Google hits should be expected from a fashion photographer, but it seems that the quality of the links was pretty good (not Wikipedia mirrors or link farms but real sites and blogs). <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> July 7, 2005 23:05 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is largely a discussion for elsewhere... but I don't think Alexa is just U.S. thing. Maybe an english-speaking thing, but I think it's a pretty valid barometer of the popularity of english-language sites. At any rate the site being in Canada doesn't account for it having a rank 50 times lower than the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline. But traffic is just one part of the decision here... I was just a bit bothered that it's unreliability was the <i>only</i> reason you cited for keeping.

<li>The bottom line is that it's a valid ballpark estimate of traffic... not accurate enough for most statistical purposes, but enough to estimate popularity. Even Slashdot, the poster site for the anti-IE/Anti-spyware mentality, gets a high rank and has double digits of IE/Windows-using readers.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a no-brainer in the Canadian media; this site is used as part of any good barometer of Canadian public opinion. Deleting this article would be a mistake, and I think significantly demonstrates an offhand US systemic bias on Wikipedia. It *is* tantamount to saying that Canadian political debate (which naturally contains a lot of debate about US policy, for reasons any Canadian would see as obvious) is irrelevant. As a Canadian, I'm inclined to object to that. References to PB or 'Canadian Blogosphere' as 'non-notable' here seem to be offhand and poorly informed. I don't hesitate to say that an American isn't going to be naturally inclined to make an informed choice about this. There are, after all, only 30 million Canadians. . . for US perspective, that's NYC and surrounding areas, and we're a pretty politically splintered group. That said, the Alexa rankings make perfect sense, and actually don't justify deletion based on overall popularity. Overall popularity among whom? Americans interested in Canadian political scandals? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.48.129.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.48.129.117_fb2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.48.129.117">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Any metric which ranks all websites on a single scale is <i>inherently</i> going to favour American website traffic to the expense of other countries, and can quite easily misrepresent the actual importance of a non-American site to its <i>own</i> national context. Alexa is simply <b>not</b> a reliable gauge of a Canadian website's importance within Canada -- it's a reliable gauge of how many <i>Americans</i> visit a Canadian website. If a site as undeniably important as <i>Rabble</i> can't even meet the stated guidelines, then there's something seriously wrong with the guidelines. Every Canadian voter in this debate has clearly stated that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> are notable enough. If our <b>actual experience</b> doesn't overrule the obviously flawed metric of a website whose statistical method isn't even regarded as valid by professional statisticians, then why don't we just let Alexa ranking stand as a speedy criterion and save everybody the trouble of thinking their opinion actually mattered or something? <b>Notable enough within Canada to keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 07:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just because something is supposedly notable in Canada and not in the rest of the world doesn't mean it deserves it's own article. Should a country of similar importance, say.. Christmas Csland had a blog group be notable because everyone on christmas island reads it.. of course not. Also, because blogs are webcentric, Alexa is a good metric for their notability.

<li>I've read the article, and the "evidence" does not impress me. And as for Mr. Mercer's blog doing so poorly...guess what? As a blogger, Rick Mercer is not notable. As an actor, he is. Just because a famous person's blog isn't notable doesn't mean that all traffic rankings are crap. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 18:16, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Not impressing you" is not generally my bottom-line metric of notability. Its role in the Grewal affair spells notability whether that personally interests you or not. Citations by Antonia Zerbisias spell notability whether that personally interests you or not. And I'm most certainly not conflating Mercer's significance as an actor with his significance as a blogger; his <b>blog</b>, specifically, is one of <b>the most-talked-about Canadian blogs on the web</b>. Unless you're proposing that it's somehow possible for people to talk about Rick Mercer's blog as much as they do without anybody ever actually reading it, the dichotomy just doesn't do Alexa any favours. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd be more impressed if you were actually attempting to address and/or refute the stated facts — how does PB's role in the Grewal affair not equal notability? how do regular citations by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonia_Zerbisias_3567.html" title="Antonia Zerbisias">Antonia Zerbisias</a> not equal notability? how does citation in the Parliamentary debate record by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Cools_bff6.html" title="Anne Cools">Anne Cools</a> not equal notability? etc. — instead of relying on the "because I said so" school of assertion.

<li>(So much for me agreeing to disagree!) Anyway, regarding citations: <i>in my opinion</i> notable people citing you does not automatically confer notability onto you. Said citations are not mentioned on the Wikipedia article on Progressive Bloggers, incidentally. And their role in the Grewal thing seems, to me, almost trivial. As in, the only mention of Grewal in their article is in the 'trivia' section. Actually investigating what role they seem to have played bears this out...ooh, look out, one of them made what amounted to a diff. Notability is a subjective issue, we all know that.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Both Blogging Torries and Progressive Bloggers enable Canadian web users to access blogging communities of like minded individual. These communities enable anyone to engage in a common forum across Canada where ideas and politics can be shared and critiqued. Without these blogs, Canadians from the grassroots to the top would not have a central online source to measure what other like minded individuals think on topics important to them. This in my opinion makes them notable. --Jtorgers 19:04, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The nastiness is being perpetrated by this "Lord Bob" guy, a self-admitted supporter of the Canadian Conservative Party, who has crawled out of the woodwork in the midst of election fever in Canada, and is doing his party-hack thing right here. Nothing from "Lord Bob" about the notability of the Blogging Tories entry. This kind of thing is another reason to fear the election of Stephen Harper: rabid intolerance, intellectual dishonesty and a love of censorship.

<li>John and Simon, would you both please tone down the rhetoric and keep this discussion on topic? This isn't about bombing or war, and it's not a nefarious Tory plot to sideline progressive discussion. It's just a debate about whether or not the article is notable enough on its own merits; the argument is easily made without resorting to ad hominem attacks. And while it <i>is</i> true that a single contextless Alexa-rank cutoff can distort the notability of a non-American site, it's <i>not</i> a conscious and intentional plot to institute American bias; it's just an accidental side effect of a policy that wasn't designed carefully enough. <b>So would you guys cut out the conspiracy theories and stay on topic, please?</b> <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 21:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Next time I'll use &lt;/sarcasm&gt; to make sure that you understand. It's usually the sign of a weak argument to attack the person rather than simply presenting a compelling reason that they are wrong. Anyone who wants to keep this based upon a "campaign" instead of the evidence should have their recomendation completely discounted, as they are not adressing the issue of <i>this article</i>. I don't care if the GNAA are sodomizing nuns in the name of Cthullu, they have their facts correct - this is a non notable blog zealously defended. The fact that we aren't having a calm and measured discussion about <i>facts</i> speaks volumes, but that instead the arguments seem to be "because canadians say so". Both this and the previous AfD are examples of special interest groups shouting down common sense. Be proud, be very proud.<br />

<li>I think you should go back and read the comments in chronology. It was the GNAA who introduced the irrationality into these discussions by calling arguments "bullshit" and wikipedia entries "retarded."--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 01:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, the first really irrational entry I see is - <i>Yeah, I really don't care what you Americans think. Trying to impress upon you what is notable in the other countries of the world is up there with taking out the garbage in my book. You can bomb the shit out of other countries, and destroy what they've made -- but that doesn't mean you have to bring that attitude on Wikipedia.--Simon.Pole 20:40, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</i><br />

<ul>
<li>Actually, there's nothing irrational about that statement. American bombing is a fact, producing many dead facts. Furthermore, when I am accused of seeing "conspiracies against Canada" (the statement this quote responds to) when Wikipedia has clearly identified a systemic bias against non-American entries, I am not the one being irrational. I did not mince words about how unsavoury it is to have to respond to foreigners saying Canadian entries are not notable. Only from an American point of view would this be seen as "irrational." Just as the view that Iraqis might not want Americans occupying their country is "irrational."--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 02:08, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
