<li><b>He's more than just a personal avatar of a random user</b>. He is an icon for an entire gaming generation...his name&#160;:"Renegade" sort of explains part of it. Alot of people I know know of him. Not just people I know personally, people from akll over the world. A girl in Norway, a man in Finland, tons of people in America, a chinese kid, a woman in Bangladesh...the list goes on. I have been doing some research and I actually got to talk and meet with him. He was a very interesting person who lead a troubled life. Renegade1116 is an underground icon. he isn't something that you'd find in a magazine or in print. Like an urban legend. He isn't as famous as a movie star, but people know of him. A surprisingly large amount of people. I figured it might do him a little justice to put something up about him on wikipedia. I think you guys are making a way bigger deal of this than really exists. You have multiple articles way worse than this that you let survive. I want this Renegade1116 to be recognized somewhere else than hearsay. Isn't this WIkipedia's spirit anyways? It's freedom of information. <b>The whole point of this article is to bring something to light. It IS to MAKE it more widely known and notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> he is NOT notable online. That's the entire point of this. Think of movie stars for a second, ignoring the comparison. They had their start somewhere else. They got inducted into wikipedia after they had done notable things OUTSIDE of it. They didn't appear on wikipedia all noteable online already. Someone must have seen their acting/movies and decided they belonged online in wikipedia. This is exactly what this is. Usernames have nothing to do with it. Results of "searches" don't matter. That's the whole point I am trying to create this...so there will be more informaation available. And anyways, why do you guys seem so harsh? Is one article wasting wikipedia's space so significatnly? Renegade1116 is noteable outside of online places. THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE ARTICLE!
<ul>
<li>You're mistaken. We don't create articles here until people are already notable elsewhere online. As for why we're so harsh, how many thousands of gamers would start adding themselves here if we let this one stay? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 16:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Fine, if he truly is notable offline, give <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that can back this up. As for movie stars online, they become notable because of independent, verifiable sources that can show a claim to notability. And YES they appeared as notable already before getting an article on Wikipedia, otherwise the article would be removed using this SAME CRITERIA. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 16:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Your telling me if I find any other site where this character is "noteable", then that's good enough for you? Why do you think I am creating this?

<li><b>Comment</b> "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious).

<li><i>Comment'</i> Those "thousands of people" that have their articles created end up being deleted using the same criteria as well. If he is so notable in the world as you state, show WHERE this is make. Just because you say he is notable, doesn't mean he is. If he is known in multiple countries and in the real world, there HAS to be a way of proving this rather that saying "he is because I said so". <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 17:00, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Another Wikipedia quote from the "ironclad" rules: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."

<li><b>Comment</b> Antyone want to help me with "userfication"? Or are you all just going to sit there and quote stuff?</li>
<li><s>'<i>Comment</i> You were hellbent on keeping the article, you never mentioned userifciation until now. I'm adding the userfy tag to the page as we speak. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 17:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</s> <b>Comment</b> Strike that, I'm not sure what happened to the page, an admin can adjust this for you though. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 17:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I hope I haven't just screwed things up too badly...thank you for your help -.- and also, no matter really how "important" the article is or was...it was nice that we actually got a chance to discuss it. I am hoping I will learn from this to avoid future mistakes. I realized the article was wrong as defined by Wikipedia a long time ago. I just wanted to see if I could possibly get around it in some way. I guess userfication is the only way to do that. I hope you'll all forget me that way I can start posting decent, wiki-rule following wikis in the future. Thank you all for putting up with me, and thanks for at least discussing it instead of automatically deleting it. I love wikipedia and I apologize for any inconvenience(s) I might have caused. Thanks again guys =)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You're welcome, and good luck to you! <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 17:49, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Mission accomplished. Hopefully an admin will be able to sort out that fairly convoluted set of redirects you've got on your userspace right now: the page-meddling capacity of the Move function is not to be taken lightly. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 17:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> APologies for the redirects...I kind of misread the userfication page 4 times in a row. Not pretty.</li>
