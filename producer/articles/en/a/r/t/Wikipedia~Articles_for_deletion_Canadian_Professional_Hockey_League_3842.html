<li>Wikipedia is also not a collection of random data, a crystal ball, or a place for unverifable or non-existent things.

<li>Delete: There is no there there. When it exists, come along and devote some Not Paper to it.

<li><b>Merge</b> with the article on the lockout. The fact it has a website and was in the planning stages is notable. There are plenty of Wikiarticles on things that were planned but never realized.

<li><b>keep</b> May I remind my American friends that the wikipedia is an International project, not a solely USian project? Just because you never heard of a topic doesn't mean that topic isn't noteworthy in some other part of the world. Look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ice_hockey_leagues.html" title="List of ice hockey leagues">List of ice hockey leagues</a>. It is comprehensive. Are you going to challenge the existence of every league on that list you have never heard of? The lockout was big news up here. Rumors that the lockout was soon going to end made the national news several times a month. And news of the progress, or lack thereof, on the CPHL also frequently made the national news. Yes, this article needs some improvement. I will make a few changes later today. I am going to repeat my invitation to our American friends to remember that the wikipedia is an International project, and not a purely USian project. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:04, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As a Canadian who has actively followed this league, I would like to assure my USian friends that you need not worry: seriously, this league is as notable as my Eastside Hockey Manager leagues.

<dd>What does being an American have to do with wanting to vote delete for a hoax league?

<li>Did you go to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ice_hockey_leagues.html" title="List of ice hockey leagues">List of ice hockey leagues</a>? It lists many dozens of leagues. To be comprehensive shouldn't it list this one too, even if there hadn't been an earlier league of the same name?</li>
