<p>The Battle of Murkhana was a fictional battle in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>Universe, that took place at the end of the Clone Wars. It is detailed at the beginning of the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labyrinth_of_Evil_3ac1.html" title="Labyrinth of Evil">Labyrinth of Evil</a> novel.</p>
<p>Murkhana was the capital of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_Alliance_fff0.html" title="Corporate Alliance">Corporate Alliance</a>, and a key objective for the Republic. Republic forces also hoped to capture <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passel_Argente_2b13.html" title="Passel Argente">Passel Argente</a>, the leader of the Corporate Alliance.</p>
<p>Republic forces were commanded by <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Master_7d02.html" title="Jedi Master">Jedi Master</a> <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roan_Shryne_f297.html" title="Roan Shryne">Roan Shryne</a>. The attack began with Republic <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_troopers.html" title="Clone troopers">clone troopers</a> landing in LAAT gunships. Murkhana's atmosphere had been sprayed with laser-disrupting aerosols, forcing both sides to rely upon <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missiles.html" title="Missiles">missiles</a> for the early stages of battle. Some of the gunships were shot down by missiles from Hailfire droids.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_troopers.html" title="Clone troopers">clone troopers</a> landed and were able to clear beachheads with supporting fire from gunships and space forces. Murkhana's capital city was protected by energy shields, as well as armies of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droids.html" title="Battle droids">battle droids</a>, tank droids, and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenaries.html" title="Mercenaries">mercenaries</a>, including the elite Vibroblade Brigade.</p>
<p>Master Shryne led a small strike team of ARC troopers and disabled the shield generator. Republic forces then fought their way through several heavily defended causeways into the city. Chaos and confusion reigned supreme, as native Koorivar attempted to flee the city in the midst of heavy fighting between the Republic and Confederate armies. The tide soon turned in the favor of the Republic, since much of the Confederate army was made up of unreliable mercenaries who surrenderd to the clone forces.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of the battle, <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_66.html" title="Order 66">Order 66</a> was given, and the clones turned on their Jedi commanders. Roan Shryne, along with <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bol_Chatak_8cb9.html" title="Bol Chatak">Bol Chatak</a> and her apprentice, <a href="../../../o/l/e/Olee_Starstone_c6be.html" title="Olee Starstone">Olee Starstone</a>.

<p>Ditch lights are part of a locomotive's exterior light set. They are positioned on the forward end of the locomotive, often on the hood, forward platform ("porch") or pilot beam and angled to shine to each side of the roadbed. They usually shine a steady white but may flash at crossings to provide an additional alert to cross-traffic or pedestrians.</p>

<p><b>Russell Arthur Gower Bragg</b> (born 23 April 1945, in North Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada) is a nationally-recognized educator turned Canadian-American novelist.</p>
<p>R A Bragg has scribbled freelance (magazine, news service), been formally recognized provincially as a scriptwriter (1992 Government of Newfoundland Arts and Letters Award for Dramatic Script), and nationally as a master educator (1990 Marshall McLuhan Distinguished Teacher Award). Bragg has travelled widely in western, central and eastern (communist) Europe and the UK, and began notes toward his novel in Moscow in 1988.</p>
<p>R A Bragg's 2003 novel, By the White Book; A Far Angelus Novel, is an investigation of several questions involving such seemingly diverse areas as religion, genetic manipulation and alien technology woven into a storyline involving human, near-human and non-human characters alike.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important question posed in his novel as the background to the action centers on how Christianity may develop from the second or third century onward in near-total isolation from the rest of the early Christian community on the high, arid plateau of Angelus, a far planet hanging over the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
<p>By the White Book; A Far Angelus Novel includes appendices describing in detail the extra-galactic setting, flora and fauna, and a short course in the Latin-based language of the inhabitants of Angelus and representative word list. Two web sites supplement the appendices.</p>

<p>Nació el 29 de Febrero de 1987, y recién tiene 6 años, debido a que losa cumple cada 4 años. Se crió en el hogar de ancianos "La Cordura" en Quinta Normal, rodeada del centro de madres "CEPEKA" (Centro de4 pelambres y kawines Lo Barnechea). Desde niña gustaba de la televisión, y su primera incursión en este ámbito fue con el programa infantil "Cachureos", donde conoció a su primer amor platónico: "Epídemia".</p>
<p>En 1994 entró al colegio por equivocación. Sus papás le dijeron que la inscirbirían en Rojo, pero finalmente la llevaron a un lugar que parecía más bién un hospital con una iglesia, finalmente sería un colegio. Siempre se destacó por ser una mujer apasionada de la lectura y la vida social, en su primer libro "Pichuliñas de ayer y hoy" habla justamente de su niñez bajo las influencias del alcohol y los ring-raja junto a sus amigas.</p>
<p>En el colegio, descubrió a amigos como Pamela, Josh y Roberto, éste último quién sería su gran amigo de toda la vida.</p>
<p>Soledad optó por ser cantante. Su primer disco (al estilo de bandas como S Club 7 y RBD) llamado "Ábreme A La Vida Y no de piernas" , decidió lanzarlo en Enero de 2006, con sólo 2 ventas se convirtió en todo un exitazo. Acá presentaremos el disco y sus temas:</p>
<p>Soledad Vilches - Ábreme A La Vida &amp; No De Piernas</p>
<p>1.El Secreto 2.El Fuego de tu sala 3.Embócame el choro 4.Vivir Así 5.Incendio en el cebo 6.Amor prohibido (Cover de Selena) 7.Pelos Sexies 8.Dos Palabras Para Amarnos (La Gonorrea) 9.Juntos Podemos 10.Si te falta más, avísame 11.Soy Rebelde 12.¿Qué sonido es ése? (Cover de El Castillo Ra Tim Bum) 13.Papi, dale más duro</p>
<p>El primer sencillo fue "Vivir Así", un éxito en las radios como: Corazón, Wfm y Nina. Luego procedieron sencillos como "Embócame el choro" y "Papi, dale más duro" con el que ganó el Latin Grammy Award a canción más potente.</p>
<p>Luego se dedicó a emprender una empresa de Papel Higiénico de oficinas pero lamentablemente fracasó. Posterior a esto, hizo el intento con un hogar de ancianos (en honor a su mejor amiga, Ascilos) llamado "Lunesd 17 de Septiembre", pero lamentablemente se inscribió solo 1 persona: Ella misma.</p>
<p>Con el fracaso de sus proyectos, volvió a la música con su segundo álbum "Ahora Sí que sí", pero fue un total desastre en ventas y el sencillo "Te Cashé" sólo alcanzó el puesto 3597 en el Billboard Latino.</p>
<p>Actualmente, se dedica a vender sopaipillas en La Vega. Dice estar feliz con su novio "Brayatan Huaiquipán", y espera lanzar su segundo libro "Cómo ganar dinero en forma sencilla".... un libro de cocina con las mejores recetas para sopaipillas fritas con el mismo aceite del mes.</p>

He also tried to establish links with the Muntenian revolution. He was one of the most intransigent Romanian leaders in 1848 and particularly militant on questions involving the national language. At the same time, he attempted in 1849 to reach an accord with the Magyars As a consequence of his radical activities, he was once more imprisoned, from 1849 to 1853. He returned to politics in 1861, but his popularity had peaked.</p>

<p>Willy and the wet sneakers was a psychedellic group in the early to late 70's known for their hits such as "Cardboard Jelly" and "Oh Baby". The band originated in massachusetts,usa. Frontman Bob Turini is often regarded as the greatest rhythm guitar/lead singer ever to live. Starting in 1970 the band took little time in finding their audience and record label for that matter. They were soon inked to one of the largest record deals of their era. A fallout almost occured in 72' that would eventually happen in 1980 when Bobs Girlfriend (Julie) claimed that the guitarist hit on her. Bob disregarded it and then The band performed before crowds as large as 200,000. Lead guitar was Willy Sneaks. After a show in San Francisco, Bob destroyed a hotel room and broke the servants jaw. Bob Ended up in prison for the night and while in prison he wrote the famous album "Sneakers of all sizes and colors". This then went on to be one of the best guitar driven albums ever.</p>

<p>An international parodian country song, written by Gordon Parsons in 1957. The title refers to a real pub in Australia. But it seems that there's debate about where the actual pub is.</p>
<p>"Pub with no beer" became the first golden hit single by the renowned Australian country singer <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slim_Dusty_53e0.html" title="Slim Dusty">Slim Dusty</a>. In 1957 "A Pub With No Beer" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time.</p>

<p>Funny When Drunk ESPECIALLY funny when drunk and angry and attempt to chase you then give up, fall over and roll at you with great speed and agression, knowing that as long as their bodies are round, they will continue to roll over civillians potentially killing them and leaving a trail of corpses down the road to be left for the minimum wage workers who eventually get tired of their job, blame all their problems on fat people and so "Fat Hate" begins. "Fate Hate" originated in India when a fat person named Ahmid Khabett (after a rather large curry with grease instead of curry sauce)fell over and rolled down a hill, causing absolute chaos. The Earthquakes began about he same time as the fat guy hit the floor and some people believe that this was the most damage caused to a public place since the blue whale was dropped on the london eye and godzilla decided to throw a wild party.</p>
<p>Remember readers, fat hate is WRONG. it is only funny in small doses. DO NOT ABUSE THIS INFORMATION, AS MUCH MY TIME WENT INTO THIS AND I DONT WANT TO HAVE TO WRITE IT ALL AGAIN!!</p>

<p>Sam the James was a notorius director known for his ignorance and fictional movies created during the early 20trh century.</p>
<p>Born Bjorg Ferryburn James, he was nicknamed Sam the James after migrating to America and including James de Fonso Barotoriti in most of his pictures.</p>
<p>What some would consider Sam thest film work was still to come, beginning in the 1980s. In 1981, Sam's up for the first time with his long-time friend George Lucas to make Raiders of the Lost Ark, his homage to the cliffhanger serials of the Golden Age of Hollywood, with Harrison Ford (whom Lucas had previously cast in his Star Wars films) as the dashing hero Indiana Jones. The biggest film at the box office in 1981, and recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director second nomination) and Best Picture (the second film to be nominated for Best Picture), Raiders is still hailed as a landmark in action cinema.</p>
<p>One year later, returned to his alien visitors motif with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, this is the story of a boy and the alien whom he befriends (and is trying to get back "home" to outer space). E.T. went on to become the top-grossing film of all time for many years. It was also nominated for many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. It is considered by to be his own personal favorite film from his works. E.T. originated as a sci-fi suspense thriller called Night Skies. Night Skies also gave birth to Poltergeist, a film that co-wrote , co-produced (and some people who worked on the film claim directed) and was released only a week before E.T.. also negotiated an unusually lucrative video game licensing deal with Atari for an E.T. video game. This was a famously expensive failure which contributed to the video game crash of 1983. Following the screening of E.T. at the White House, President Ronald Reagan leaned over, clapped on the shoulder, and quietly commented, "You know, there aren’t six people in this room who know how true this really is." [3]</p>
<p>His friend George Lucas immediately pulled back in as part of their friendly agreement to make more Indiana Jones movies with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Plagued with uncertainty for the material, the saving grace for during the making of this film would be the meeting of his future wife Kate Capshaw, who was cast as Indiana's new love interest. The film was a hit though the reviews were less positive than they were for its predecessor. It was criticized for lacking the energy of the original, as well as for its grossly inaccurate and ignorant depiction of Indian culture. The extreme violence and gore would also inspire the Motion Picture Association of America to create the PG-13 rating the following year, in fact it was Spielburg that suggested this rating.</p>

1987 was a time when the Chinese economy was beginning to boom, and as the Chinese gates began to open to the world, took advantage by shooting the first American movie in Shanghai since the 1930s. The result was an adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, Empire of the Sun, which told the story of a young boy named Jim (Christian Bale) who is separated from his parents during the sacking of Shanghai in 1941, and is forced to survive through the rest of the war. wanted to convey a heartfelt message of innocence being shattered as a result of war, as audiences saw the transformation of Jim from sheltered Shanghai to a struggling and resourceful war refugee. The film garnered numerous praise from critics, was nominated for several Oscars, but did not attract the kind of box office power that films usually get.</p>

<p>Hjelmslev's theorem is the statement that if points P, Q, R... of one and the same line are isometrically mapped to points P´, Q´, R´... of another line in the same plane, then the midpoints of the segments PP`, QQ´, RR´... also lie on one and the same line. The proof is easy, if one assumes the classification of plane isometries. If the given isometry is odd, in which case it is necessarily either a reflexion in a line or a glide-reflexion (the product of three reflexions in a line and two perpendiculars to it), then the staement is true of any points in the plane whatsoever: the midpoint of PP´ lies upon the axis of the (glide-)reflexion for any P. If the isometry is even, compose it with reflexion in line PQR to obtain an odd isometry with the same effect on P, Q, R... and apply the previous remark. The importance of the theorem lies in the fact that the proof does NOT presuppose the parallel postulate and is therefore valid in non-Euclidean geometry as well. By its help, the mapping that maps every point P of the plane to the midpoint of the segment P´P´´, where P´and P´´ are the images of P under a rotation (in either sense) by a given acute angle about a given center, is seen to be a collineation mapping the whole hyperbolic plane in a 1-1 way onto the inside of a disk, thus providing a good intuitive notion of the linear structure of the hyperbolic plane.</p>

<p>Find Love is an unscripted, experimental film shot entirely on digital video in Wilmington, North Carolina. Directed and conceptualized by Erica Dunton, Find Love stars Alexie Gilmore, Christian Camargo, and Craig Sheffer and is an attempt to truthfully capture how one feels in the very first moments of falling in love. It is the story of two strangers who are instantly captivated by each other and exported from their own realities into a disjointed realm of new emotions. Looking for love is the absolute last thing on their minds but it is clear that love has no sense of situation. Love simply arrives and expects to be dealt with. It premiered at Slamdance 2006, won awards at RiverRun International Film Festival, Sarasota Film Festival and DiBa (Digital Barcelona Film Festival).</p>

<p>Robert A. Hatch, a public-relations executive who helped shepherd "Sesame Street" onto the air in 1969, died on June 16 at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 75.</p>
<p>The cause was heart failure, his brother, Stanley, said.</p>
<p>A newspaperman by training, Mr. Hatch joined Carl Byoir &amp; Associates, a major public relations firm, in 1957, eventually becoming a vice president there. In 1965, on leave from the firm, he became deputy director of public information for the Peace Corps, which was then just four years old. Mr. Hatch was named the Peace Corps's director of public information in 1967.</p>
<p>Returning to Byoir, Mr. Hatch became the account executive for the Children's Television Workshop in 1969. (Founded in 1968, the organization, which produces "Sesame Street" and other educational programs for children, is now known as the Sesame Workshop.) Mr. Hatch joined Children's Television Workshop as its vice president for public affairs in 1972.</p>
<p>Before a single episode of "Sesame Street" was broadcast, Mr. Hatch helped solicit support for the idea of television as an educational tool among parents, in Congress and though it seems surprising today, among educators themselves.</p>
<p>"Sesame Street" was first broadcast on Nov. 10, 1969, on PBS. Today it appears on 350 PBS stations and in 120 foreign countries.</p>
<p>Robert Adrian Hatch was born on Jan. 7, 1931, in Salt Lake City. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Utah State University in 1952 and later studied at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. After service in the Air Force, he worked as an editor for Copley News Service.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatch's first marriage ended in divorce. Besides his brother, of Santa Barbara, he is survived by his wife, the former Linda Pollard; two children from his first marriage, Jennifer, of Upper Nyack, N.Y.; and Graham, of Lisbon; and a sister, Elaine Thomas of Sacramento.</p>

<p>His frequant columns are viewed by thousands of people every week, and always start with the line 'This Week I Am Mostly Pissed Of With' or 'This Week I Am Mostly Pissed Of By' and have been based on a wide variety of subjects including British Summertime, Horoscopes and Gossip.</p>
<p>Rikki's site contains a guestbook, contact page, and pictures of the man himself.</p>
<p>The site originated on the website of his Webmaster 'Cowboy' Dave Lee, a website dedicated to his 5-a-side football team. Debuting in February 2006, it moved to its own dedicated website in April 2006, due to popular demand.</p>
<p>Regular personalities that feature in Rikki's Rants include his Spanish/Scottish associate 'Al The Psychotic Spick', his Webmaster, the afore mentioned 'Cowboy' David Lee, 'The Blackest White Man' Martin Small, and Chris Bray, winner of the 'Chant Idol' competition, a contest organised by Rikki to discover the world's best football chant.</p>
<p>Recent developments in Rikki's Rant have included a contest between 5 candidates to write the Rant for one week while Rikki is away. The initial round ended in a dead heat between Dave Lee and Chris Bray, who both polled over 67,000 votes, after over 200,000 votes were cast.</p>
<p>Another incident being opened up to 'the Ranting public' is the future of Dave Lee, who has been considering his future as head of the Website staff.</p>

<p>The noun <b>back burner</b> is used as a metaphor (most often as "put on the back burner"). It is an idiom which is English in origin, and is used to emphasize reduced priority. It's origin is culinary in nature, and is simple to understand if you are familiar with the placement of cooking items on a stove. Many stoves have <i>front</i> and <i>back</i> burners; those items requiring consistent attention to should be kept on the <i>front</i> burner (stirred, watched for browning/melting, and the like) whereas things that can be left to simmer, boil, or otherwise do not require immediate or constant attention can be placed on the <i>back</i> burner. It is applicable to several situations where something has less priority than others.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>"Because of the gravity of the murder case, other cases had to be <i>put on the back burner</i>." - "That project was <i>moved to the back burner</i> until we finish with higher priorities." - "My taxes still aren't done; with April a few weeks away, I'm afraid my tennis lessons are <i>on the back burner</i>."</p>
<p>Alternatively, <b>front burner</b> can be used to emphasize increased priority.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>"With so many people in the community afraid, the murder case was <i>put on the front burner</i>." - "This project was <i>moved to the front burner</i> in order to meet the deadline." - "Forget tennis lessons - my taxes are <i>on the front burner</i> until they're done."</p>

<p>The song "coming clean" was co-written buy the power-punk band Green Day (with lyrics by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong), and recorded on their third album,"Dookie". The album was released in 1994, and led to the bands widespread fame. The song is about Billie Joe wondering if he is bisexual. Although he never fully admitted this until during an interview a year later, the song's lyrics clearly give some evidence of struggle. These are the lyrics:</p>
<p>Seventeen and strung out on confusion... Trapped inside a world of disalusion... I found out what it takes to be a man... Mom and Dad'll never understand...</p>
<p>Secrets collecting dust but never forget... Skeletons come to life in my closet... I found out what it takes to be a man... No, Mom And Dad'll never understand... What's happening to me...</p>

<p>Habbo Hotel is an online chatroom where you can meet new friends, and decorate rooms with a virtual currency called "coins". To use habbo hotel, you must have the firewall on your computer turned off, and suspicion has arisen that this is because of the accusation that habbo hotel gives out viruses. That is a myth, and the only way you could get a virus from habbo hotel, is by giving out your ip address to a habbo hotel user, who can then either access your computer directly, or install a keylogger on your computer. Habbo hotel does have potential hackers on it, but you can feel safe, because a user named Asian.Babii will offer you a job if you have been scammed (this info is based upon a former habbo Xpert (a trusted habbo hotel user) who switched accounts to prevent harassment, and whose name does not wish to be revealed).</p>

<p>The slang term 'safe' is derived from North London, as a means of describing ones appreciation or gratification. The use of the word was popularised by notorious rapper Dizzee Rascal and peaked in it's popularity in 2003. In recent times however, the term has depreciated in value, due to an increasing trend of it's use in the context of irony or mimicry.</p>
<p>Pink Floyd at Live8.</p>
<p>On July 2, 2005, at roughly around midnight, Pink Floyd, with Roger Waters, took to the stage at Hyde Park, playing together for the first time, in 24 years. They played a 23 minute long set, consisting of Breathe, Money, Wish You Were Here, and Comfortably Numb.</p>
<p>It was regarded by man, as the highlight of the show, and the image of the band's group hug has become one of the most famous pictures of the concert.</p>
<p>It had sparked many rumours that a new tour was being planned, but this was disregarded by David Gilmour, when they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, in 2006, when he said that plans for a reunion were practically nil.</p>
