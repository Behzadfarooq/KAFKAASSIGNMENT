<dd>No, when there's overwhelmingly a lot of red links, its not that "no one has thought of including it", it means its such overwhelmingly a neologism, <b>the very theory of Aetherometry</b> is not basing itself on "previous concepts", like it claims (from Tesla et al) - its fabricating its own. Most fundamental particles have already been included, if you want to theorise that some of these fundamental particles have a new property, link their name, and call it "massfree" and whatnot, go get a cyclotron, or tracers and show evidence of it - after all, neutrinos themselves were discovered to have mass by their oscillations.

<li>Quantum teleportation is a bad analogy as that is a term used to describe a widely accepted and experimentally demonstrated process in quantum mechanics whereby the quantum state of one atom can be transferred to another over small but macroscopically significant distances. In that context, it is not at all radical. Oh, and for the record, I suspect they are zealots (true believers of what they are saying) rather than hoaxers or commericial scam artists. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 01:08, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am going to hate myself for saying this, but <b>rewrite</b>. This is psuedoscience, quackery, and great number of other unflattering things, but unfortunately, I believe it is notable quackery. The Correas and followers have, through determined effort, managed to insinuated their ideas into thousands of websites <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=Aetherometry" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=Aetherometry" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=massfree" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=massfree" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and written multiple books, "research papers", and essays. They really do have PhDs supporting their work (though a list of the fields of study of those PhDs might be entertaining). Perhaps most importantly, this is not the first time I have encountered aetherometry. If it is something I have heard of before by chance, then odds are it is sufficiently widespread to be notable (lord help us all). That said, the version of the article that is ultimately kept needs serious NPOVing, in addition to stating the opinions of these believers, it needs to state the mainstream objections, and comments from critics such as <a href="http://www.orgonelab.org/correas.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orgonelab.org/correas.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Honestly, I rather hope this is deleted, but I can't really support that.

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>by asserting claims or theories without first verifying them in experiments</li>

<li>by failing to provide an experimental possibility of reproducible results;</li>
<li>by failing to submit results to peer review prior to publicizing them (called "science by press conference")</li>
<li>by claiming a theory predicts something that it does not;</li>
<li>by claiming a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict;</li>
<li>by violating Occam's Razor, the heuristic principle of choosing the explanation that requires the fewest additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (and the more egregious the violation, the more likely); or</li>

<dd>Now, I've read everything that the Coreeas have published, and I have to confess that I cannot figure out which of these characteristics Aetherometry is claimed to possess. What exactly is the basis for you calling it pseudoscience? I mean, you can call it anything you want, I am sure, but if you are trying to be truthful to boot, then what are your criteria? 66.217.179.112 17:54, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC) That was me too.

<dd>And we're supposed to take you on your word? Just because they asserted a theory in a book doesn't make it correct. I don't see experimental evidence anywhere, other than claiming they have it (ie. I don't see reports where it was reproduced in say, a scientific journal, verifications et al), a scientific paper cited, (rather than just an advocacy website, ie. in pdf form, complete with verifiable addreses which one can contact), with page and line number cited...oh yes, it does violate <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>. It has failed to submit results to rigorous peer review, as well.

<dd>Look, if Wikipedia simply does not want articles about scientific efforts that have not been published in mainstream journals, why not say so to begin with? As far as I can see, nobody ever defended Aetherometry by claiming it was accepted by the mainstream. Why all this broohaha? I suspect that if the original author had just been told to begin with, "Look, this has not been accepted by the mainstream, so Wikipedia is not a place for it", he or she would have withdrawn and nobody's time would have been wasted. And no, you have no idea whether or not Aetherometry violates Occam's razor, because you have no idea what experimental data it is trying to explain. And the results have been available for peer review for at least 4 years now, so the statement "it has failed to submit results to rigorous peer review" is not accurate either.

<dd>That isn't the point. We're not even sure of these "scientific efforts" are notable. Wikipedia does not have to include articles about every single attempt to try to find some "free energy" source in the world. For example, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> has his entry on <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a> existing because 1) it was notable 2) it is sent through peer review, even though its very controversial, and only 70% accepted by the mainstream (as a figure of speech). It may submit results for "peer review", but unless it suddenly accumulated enough review to verify it as evidence (like results reproduced over and over again, documented, and resubmitted), then its not "rigorous". "I have no idea what experimental data it is trying to explain"? If you mean the original information here, yes I do, unless you want to be Helicoid and allege that "I haven't read the material". - but if you mean because the results haven't been published, then duly right, it shouldn't be here if its not going to be verified anyway.

<li><s>I don't know where you deletion-mavens are coming from, but it sure ain't from actually studying the stuff. I have been reading the Correas' research papers ever since they first started publishing them in 2001. As is clear to anybody who actually takes the trouble of reading them, it is most certainly solid scientific work, is absolutely fascinating, and most likely a lot of it is correct (and, like with any new science, a lot of it may also be in error). I think the number of Google hits is a pretty poor criterion for judging the merit of a science, no? One would imagine that a "community encyclopedia" would be precisely the place where new scientific ideas coming from outside institutional science would find a hospitable home, and where people could come to learn about them. What's the point of having a "community encyclopedia" if all it does is self-censor itself to look "respectable" in the eyes of the mainstream?

<li>Same old Patrick here (with his second edit). I am not sure what you mean by "has no home outside wiki". Aetherometry has a huge webpage, with something like 50 monographs publicly available on it. It certainly is not a homeless stray in need of a home, you know. What I meant was that one (or at least old Patrick here) would expect a "community encyclopedia" to be hospitable to non-institutional science. As far as I can see, though, even the Assume good faith policy was bypassed in this case. I'll do the three twiddles this time. Patrick. 66.217.178.106</li>

<dd>You misunderstand. "Community encyclopedia" does not mean "lower standards". In this case, Aetherometry doesn't even fit the bar. It has to be a notable theory, first, and even more if its pseudoscientific and Wikipedians have already pointed out great gaping holes in its logic. It is hospitable to <b>knowledge that benefits the community and the international reader</b>. Generally, something informative. Something counter-productive like Aetherometry doesn't fit the goal, because its sheer lack of notability doesn't even seem to justify its existence. And if it were notable, the encyclopedia's job is to give an NPOV look at it. Even if survived, the page has to go under tremendous cleanup, and to represent the theory as probably very unlikely. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 22:59, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive old Patrick here, but I am beginning to suspect that you are confusing Aetherometry with something else. Either this, or I seriously missed something. What are the great gaping holes that the Wikipedians have pointed out in the logic of Aetherometry? Could you list them for me? Also, I have to confess that I thought the original article was a lot more informative than the one that's there now. And I would think that a theory that results in a number of actual, working, new energy technologies would be a good candidate for something that benefits the community, rather than for something that should be called counter-productive. And I am curious about this statement that "its sheer lack of notability doesn't even seem to justify its existence". You mean only notable things have a right to exist? Poor old Patrick, I better go get myself some notability, otherwise I can't justify my existence. OldPatrick 18:58, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you're missing the entire point. Better to say nothing, than to say something which might lead people down the wrong path. As for the "great gaping holes", it conflicts with quantum mechanics because it doesn't attribute some of the phenomena described in aetherometry to a "massfree/massbound" model, but something entirely different. I also note there isn't any clear correlation and compatability with the <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncertainty_principle.html" title="Uncertainty principle">uncertainty principle</a> either, and also a failure to cite, <b>proper, verified evidence</b> (ie. not a web page on an advocacy website, but an actual scientific paper, page by page, line by line)....emphasis - SPECIFIC paper, SPECIFIC page, SPECIFIC line. As for the "original article being more informative", its disputed: that information is horrendously wrong, or at least allegedly wrong, so I don't see how it benefits the community. It has to be NPOV'ed first, making wild claims just because it fills up the page doesn't make it "more informative". If I made a page about some snake oil product and proceeded to insert 200 kilobytes of information how it could benefit mankind, does it really benfit mankind? Oh, you're totally wrong on one count - "existence" - existence of having article. You're right, you better go get yourself some notability, or you can't justify your existence of having an OldPatrick article.

"Aetherometry" may be an obscure name, but the effort behind it is massive, (if only 2 people) and I suspect it will keep popping up in various places (in the wider culture of the net), so better to have something about it that is balanced (ie, after the rewrite). It's not your flash in mind delusion, but rather a long standing one.

<li>Have you guys considered actually informing yourselves on this stuff before you start voting one way or another? So far, you don't seem to be able to tell the Aether from theories about the Aether, science ficttion from science, a "kind of Adams motor" from any other "kind of" Adams motor, one Aether theory from another, an Aether theory from cold fusion, and your ass from a hole in the ground.

Tried to understand it? There is nothing to understand - this work contradicts itself so much I highly doubt it, especially with its definition of "energy without inertia". I cite logical arguments discounting YOUR evidence, and as such that counts as evidence as in such. Perhaps you should also think about the fact that many Wikipedians work in similar fields, and have as much authority to discount the theory as the Correas do to support it? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 17:51, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry to say that what you wrote above seems totally confused. If you want evidence for the claims of Aetherometry, then you <b>have</b> to start by reading through, and understanding, the experimental and methodological work that lays down this evidence - in exactly the same way as people wanting to understand Faraday's claims had to start by reading, or seeing demonstrations of, Faradays experiments. How else would you know, about any scientific endeavour, what it is that is being claimed and why? And no, people who know nothing about Aetherometry do not have any authority to discount it. Aetherometry represents the result of over 20 years of painstaking experimental and theoretical work. One does not gain "authority" to make any judgement about it simply by virtue of "working in a similar field". The only authority comes from studying the work, reproducing the experiments, thinking through the theoretical claims, etc. It is no different with Aetherometry than with any science.

<dd>All that you have a factual basis for is saying that Aetherometry is not recognized by the scientific community at large. This is absolutely <b>not</b> a basis for concluding that it is a hoax, a scam, or a cheat. First of all, aetherometry could be largely correct, but has not yet been recognized as such. Secondly, aetherometry could be largely or totally wrong without being a hoax - there are a lot of erroneous scientific claims being worked on inside and outside of scientific institutions all over the world, every day of every week. Science progresses through error, you know. You have absolutely no basis for the claims you make, and you are defaming the reputation of people you know nothing about, simply because somebody put up an entry about their work in the Wikipedia. this just doesn't compute.</dd>

<dd>More interestingly, you seem to have an ignorant and naive view of the "scientific community" and of "peer review". Do you really think that the process whereby official science pemits something to "pass" is not permeated by politics and entrenched interests? You should read some case histories of how the so-called "peers" in scientific institutions treat those who try to think "outside the box". Do you know that Halton Arp has been banned from being able to do work - or even enter an observatory - in the US? Do you know that Eric Laithwaite was ostracised by his "scientific peers" when he made experimental discoveries that did not jive with the official theories of rotary motion? Examples abound, but of course they don't get much talked about. Even the Wikipedia entry for Halton Arp has been cleansed of all "controversial" material. I would recommend, however, that you educate yourself about the realities of the "scientific review" process before you put it on such a pedestal. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankZappo_ec43.html" title="User:FrankZappo">FrankZappo</a> 20:11, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I find far more striking to the last 24 hours, is that several people, well spoken and initially extending the polite "assume good faith" tact, by going to great length to address howling accusation of "hoax and charlatanry", as would seem humanly possible. Not one, or two but several people have attempted to work upon the main body article. (Again the edit history shows) A steady, and tirelessly unproductive effort of comment-less deletion and belittlement. Little more than a few capitals and commas, compared to the real effort performed by the initially polite individuals. Now? It's an all out brawl, resisted at length by the initial posters and straggling but real support, for an article simply entitled, Aetherometry. TTLightningRod</dd>

Where is the rule of law of this democracy that protects that user, the sameness in treatment, the no abuse of power?? Let's hear it! loud and clear, mr. connolley. Fascism, people, is how this kind of behavior was called in my young days. It is not Wikipedia that will change its meaning. Nor laws which will correct it. Only courage will. I propose that connolley do the right thing: muzzle himself and step down. Assume responsibility. i guess that he will not do that until someone will report him to the higher authorities. could one ask the anarchist to do this too, report connolley to the higher authorities?

<p>Then you vote delete. Ironically, although you termed it fascism, you realise it seems the other way round. It has become a belief system, <b>unless you back it up with unverifiable sources</b>. You take things for granted, you realise that even Encylopedia Britannica would not accept your article, so who are you to condemn us? Idiocy? Is that a personal attack? Just because the original author wanted the article to be that way, doesn't mean the article is going to stay that way. The original article was so full of POV and unsupported statements, the text had to go - we may put it back when you help us NPOV it. Furthermore, <b>no one "owns" an article"</b>, and how an article is shaped is decided by the community, not one person. Ironically, "accurate and cogent" information is not what your article is, considering how it conflicts with a whole host of accepted scientific theories, which I am sure most Wikipedians and scientists (such as WMC) will agree with me on this point. I'd advise you not to credit Wikipedia for that article you have on your own server - that's Helicoid's "<s>brilliant</s> prose", which has been rejected by the community unless its NPOV'ed. Not what any "Tom Dick and Harry" thinks it is? Well, we're a <b>wiki</b>, and by standard deviation we thus shape it into a good article, and not the word by ONE user, but by a community. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 22:05, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Suppression of the original contribution by Helicoid so that the vote had no bearing on anything even mildly intelligent and informative. Suppression of the original text without foundation, knowledge of cause, legitimate reasons, because of an overt refusal to consult the many links that were given. Suppression of any effort to be constructive. Suppression of knowledge on the basis of inadmissible bias - intellectual bias, scientifism (false interpretations of institutional science passed off as real ones), scientificity (false and grave misrepresentations of a theory, a model, etc, with total disregard for facts and the contents of the material), discrimination of minoritarian thought, outright put down of minorities, admitted and verified ignorance.

<dl>
<dd>Suppression of what? I recognise the danger of Orwellianism, et al, but you're pretty ironic as this is a free encylopedia mandated by the community. Furthermore, Aetherometry has very little notability, and you're lucky we even tolerate this article in the first place. If this article is to exist, it needs to be NPOV'ed as that is the spirit agreed on by the community. Its not "Helicoid's text", its an encylopedia. <b>Wikipedia is not a soapbox</b>. Its a place to publish facts. <b>No one owns an article</b>. Have you read the disclaimer? <b>"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it."</b> Its a community encylopedia, to be improved by anyone, according to the NPOV policy. Helicoid? Muzzled? He was blocked for 24 hours, not until the vote was over, and only because he violated the 3 revert rule, stampeding over other people's editing rights. The vote? Its to decide the consensus. It can be appealed, or brought up later, and it isn't absolute. Oh, I'd advise you not to make a personal attack, either. What "bias of power"? Each Wikipedian is supposed to act like an administrator - just that the power is granted to those who have proven themselves not to be sockpuppets, vandals, etc. Do you get the idea of what a wiki is? Its supposed to be IMPROVED, so it could be kept. Do see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">Wikipedia:Replies to common objections</a>. It is not "suppression", in the meanwhile, because it is DISPUTED whether it deserves to have its own article or not. If you don't want it to be suppressed, work within the framework. We can't acknowledge it as truth - that is not "suppression", that is going over the top with some theory that even Encylopedia Britannica wouldn't accept. If you really want to base all your conclusions on one vfd, well, who am I to force you not to? Perhaps you should actually take a look around, and realise how Wikipedia works - the idea is to judge by consensus of the community, and I hardly call that "suppression". -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:22, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps you're unhappy your view isn't represented, but in order to do so, since your view is a minority view, it has to be represented as such, whic seems fair. We have to remove the prose concerning extensive theories of aetherometry because they haven't been verified and they assert themselves as truth. What you can do, is help represent claims as claims, and fact as fact, and then perhaps it seems less like suppression. Can we agree that most of what the Correas are advocating are claims that have not been fully replicated to warrant a recognition of it as fact? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:52, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was not aware that the Britannica was the Wikipedia standard. But is the standard of Britannica to declare something into a belief system "<b>unless you back it up with unverifiable sources</b>", as you wrote above? Kinda doubt it. Fishy, no? How much of a community encyclopedia is Wikipedia when 5 admins and a Chihuahua become judges of what is or not (1) factual (is the original submission factual? which is different from:is its content factual?), (2) peer-reviewed or peer-tested or not, (3) worthy of mention, (4) worthy of study, (5) a science, a quasi-science, or a falsification, intentional or not? A little humility on the part of admins in dealing with the situation would have been the smart move. Suppression, falsification of records (as in Talk), addition of scurrilous pages, muzzling ("each Wikipedian is supposed to act like an Administrator..." - a good joke when power is stacked by a very visible policy of suppression), destruction of texts, rush to judgement: not very smart. Not to mention the Wikipedia policy of removing gratuitous slander of third parties.209.29.93.57 23:51, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not the proper place for a serious article about anything. The overall quality of "information" in the Wikipedia is appalling - as is inevitable with a publication whose editorial process encourages incompetent people to "boldly edit" and muck with the work of people who are more knowledgeable. Who in the world would buy a print encyclopedia whose editors did not recognize that every subject has its experts, and that those experts are more qualified to convey knowledge about their subject than others are? But if its "Wiki", then suddenly a free-for-all can have the pretensions to being a "professional" and "reliable" source of knowledge. <b>Delete</b>, <b>delete</b>.

<li>And there you have it. Mr. Natalinasmpf once again, displaying his irrepressible, obnoxious POV. Why don't you try to be honest, just once in these pages. You've been on a campaign to slander the correas from the get go, and here you come again with your snake oil stupidities. Just vote for deletion. It's obvious that you'll never be able to treat the material in an impartial manner - your POV screams from one end of this discussion to the other.

<p><b>Of course its POV. Its a talk page comment</b>. As to be on a "campaign to slander the Correas from the get go", I never heard of them until five days ago, and I simply question their credentials because of my OPINION that this theory is bunk. Oh, I'm afraid that by addressing me, you severely jumped to conclusions. Its not that I "don't have the slightest idea of what aetherometry is", because aetherometry is <b>nonsense</b>, as much nonsense as <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a> is. That is my opinion. I'm not producing it in the article, but I deserve the right to make such an opinion known on this talk page. Fanatic to be on a noble mission, I consider that a good thing.

To this date none of you (Helicoid, Patrick, you and all the people who registered and "arrived" days ago not to contribute to Wikipedia, but to push POV) - has provided a verifiable source.

<li>Very well then: opinionated POV, zealotry, unwillingness to inform oneself , fanatics of any sort on so-called noble missions should have no place in any forum purporting to be concerned with knowledge, information and learning.

</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, just because I have a POV on the issue doesn't mean I can't contribute. Nearly all Wikipedians have POV's with similar zealotry, probably even you, on any case, concerning any subject. I am not making a personal attack against any other Wikipedian: I reserve the right to criticise the theory if I wish, its perfectly legitimate. Its a point of view. That's the whole point. Everyone has a POV - but that's on the talk page. I did not bring this into the article space. As for "unwilligness to inform oneself" - I have duly informed myself, and I have viewed the advocacy websites. You can't assume "I haven't read the material" just because I disagree with you. It appears this is out of spite. Funny, "I have no place", but you want me to vote delete?

<li>Delete. My favorite quote from the one who appears to be the major wikibureaucrat (Natalinasmpf) is: "It has become a belief system, unless you back it up with unverifiable sources." I'm perplexed: was that a Freudian slip, or did he really mean that? If you want verifiable, go read Experimental Aetherometry Volume 1 - lots of detailed experimental data there (and you can easily verify it by relpicating the experiments). However, if you'd rather continue to believe that laboratory electroscopes can produce energy from nothing, you won't be interested in the results. 199.232.231.114 03:28, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)"</li>

<p>Freudian slip? Do tell me - <b>a book written by the Correas is not a third party source</b>. Its a reference no doubt, but its part of the aetherometry advocates in itself, not checked by third party scientists. As for "producing energy from nothing" that's ironic, although it doesn't explicitly say so, by claiming your "philosophy from Tesla", you are indeed looking for some alternative new free energy source, that is dubious at best. A book isn't a scientific paper, either. Unless other scientists took it upon themselves to peer review it. And for the umpteenth time, you address me wrongly, but I guess lack of common sense and a sense of what science is leaves you perplexed. Experimental Aetherometry Volume 1, unless you can cite me <b>page number</b>, <b>line number</b>, and <b>reviews by other scientific journals, page number and line number included</b> - <b>its not verifiable</b>. You can't say, "oh, I have a source at so and so, so I don't need to cite" - ISDN number, page number, line number - and oh, a bookw written by the Correas does not count, because they do not cite third party sources. Do provide me with an experiment of something reproducible. In fact, instead of filling the article with nonsense on how you think the universe works, give us the outline of detailed, reproducible experiments, and then tell us how that is evidence. It would be most appreciated. The best thing about you aetherometry proponents is that you claim, "I have sources, do you really want me to cite them to you"? And then we request, yes, <b>we want those sources cited, page number/line number</b> - and you don't provide. You evade the question, and rather continue attacking us. <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">Logical fallacy</a> - maybe you don't have anything to provide. Of course, I want to say its nonsense. I'm not saying its nonsense on the article, so I am not violating anything.

I don't see how this is relevant to aetherometry though. As for being an aetherometrist, at the moment, I just have a piqued curiosity for something I very much doubt the credibility of. Until of course, you can provide me with actual sources. As for "all the work", we take pride in work.

<dd>It was a typographical error. As for being "dense", Mallove is libertarian indeed, but not libertarian socialist. And the "philosophy of aetherometry" has nothing to do with it.

As for apologies and retraction, I will not budge. I will remain steadfast in my opinion. The decision to vote keep or delete is based on whether the article can be salvaged or not.

<li>The "Improvement" by Natalinas, Mel Etitis, Knott, etc (the admin gang) is rather apparent. Natalinas, you make me cry of laughter. But the improvement will not stand for long as the vote is to delete (every abortion should be deleted). What good reasons can you make to keep? Only fools would bother with your kind. But let's say that I'm a fool 'coz I needed a taste of your kind of democracy, power, intelligence, goodwill, sharp wit, independence from authorities, knowledge, accuity, just to remind me of how lousy mao-maos (that's stalinist-maoist fanatics) are. Ah, and how <b>fascism is indeed, even today, the dearest secretion of leftism</b>. Wikipedia: the fascism of leftist majorities of administrators desperately trying to control the content of culture and knowledge, and monopolize meaning. NPOV certificates available! Apply to Karada, Jacobi, Connolley, etc! Factotums wanted! Preferably self-styled anarchists and underage! Apply to Wikipedia (Google too?). Helicoid</li>
</ul>
<p>Good reasons to keep? Well, since you all voted keep at the start, and have proven me how notably dangerous and how false, this kind of "science" is, I vote to keep to inform readers of the truth about aetherometry, and include scientific critique of it when I have time. Unless of course, you want to cooperate, make aetherometry look better, and generally treat other editors with respect, I could change all of that. I bet the millions of others that hit this site each day are "fools" as well, I guess. Fascism is the secretion of leftism? Pardon me, but it's rather the opposite, Bolsheivks and Mao - and all of them - they were "right-wingers" who purposely hijacked the communist ideology for their state capitalist gain. Mao Maos? That's your kind, not mine. Its the kind aetherometrists seem to be made out of, to denounce constructive edits as "suppression", while masking their own suppression of their opposition as "vandalism and ignorance". Truly platonic, I can see. Majories of administrators? Are you insinuating that the hundreds of thousands of contributors, millions if you count legitimate anonymous contributors are all part of a grand conspiracy? Unfortunately, it seems that's what aetherometry is in fact, how ironic. A plot and a scam to try to suck the unwitting reader into its plutocratic grasp. "Underage"? Unfortunately, age does not define validity of contribution. As for asserting your authority over the article, how fascist as well, you want it to be deleted, simply because YOU, as an individual, can't stand it, and you want to assert your pro-fascist ideology over everyone else, and condemn constructive editing, and project that would undermine <b>your power based on ignorance</b>. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 23:58, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Natalinas, you as qualified to "inform readers of the truth about aetherometry" as I am to write a treatise about sea cucumbers. And are you threatening Helicoid that unless she cooperates, you are going to "make aetherometry look bad"? That's what it sounds like: "Unless of course, you want to cooperate, make aetherometry look better, and generally treat other editors with respect, I could change all of that.". In other words, you're threatening that if Helicoid doesn't "cooperate", you will spread lies about Aetherometry. Nice goings on - all brought to us by the Spotless Wikipedia Team. And isn't it rather ignoble to vote to keep an article out of hatred for its subject matter? Man, you are one demented, pathetic mush-brain. 165.154.24.56 00:58, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nothing is stopping you from writing a treatise about sea cucumbers. You can go ahead, and you won't be stopped. Other editors will correspond with you to check your facts, if you are civil. I'm not threatening Helicoid: because since I do not advocate aetherometry, without his correspondence, the article will be more critical of aetherometry then it should be. If he wants to avoid that, then he should contribute constructively. In order words, I'm not going to spread "lies" about aetherometry, because aetherometry isn't verified in the first place. If I say it isn't "rigorously peer reviewed", and Helicoid isn't there to try to provide sources to prove otherwise, then Helicoid's possible correction will of course, not be present. Ignoble to keep an article out of hatred for its subject matter? Hardly. It's my view, and there's nothing wrong with my vote. It's an opinion. Its hardly being a mush-brain for doing so, perhaps out of spite, but then again, that's eye for an eye, isn't it?</dd>

<p>I'd also advise you to know what "fascism" is. Fascism is when the corporations control the state, and wealth rules everything - a plutocracy - and seeing how your scamming of a corporation of aetherometry runs, and your attempts to silence valid opposition on a free encylopedia to your claims, you aetherometrists are hypocrites. State-capitalism like Bolshevism and Maoism which appears aetherometrists love so much, and tute as their "philosophy", and tries to poison the meaning of what anarchism and libertarian socialism is, is a form of fascism. Libertarian socialism is the antithesis of fascism. But then again, you people base your success on fanatical devotion and ignorance, don't you? -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 00:05, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yes, oh yes, I can explain. Listen carefully. We are deleting or keeping a Web page. Its title is "Aetherometry"; that's fixed. Its contents, on the other hand, can at any moment be arbitrarily generated, degenerated or modified by anybody who knows how to use a web browser, irrespective of whether or not they can tell the actual science of Aetherometry from a bottle of gin, can form a grammatical sentence, or have any interest in any even vaguely related subject. And if past experience is any guide, they do this at the rate of an edit every five minutes or so. There are a lot of people with browsers out there.... 165.154.24.56 01:25, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It isn't "arbitrarily generated" - just as nonsense can easily be put in, it is even easier to remove, considering that given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Ironically, YOU - who can edit anything, and could edit that article to be improved right now, are talking right here, and wouldn't be given a voice otherwise. You wouldn't be able to say that this was an "actual science". Britannica and CNN and everywhere else would not listen to your comments. Oh, Wikipedia receives about 40,000 edits each day, so it isn' tabou tan "edit every five minutes or so". Whether or not they can form a grammatical sentence is irrelevant - it can be corrected. Unfortunately, ironically, Helicoid can't even do this properly. So how are you to criticise? If anything, they are at most typos from replies being typed out in haste. I love how Helicoid includes parantheses everywhere, that acutally muck up the paragraph flow. You obviously don't get the concept of what a wiki is. Its peer-reviewed in itself, and far more credible than your crackpot of an "Infinite Energy" "scientific journal".</dd>

<dd>No. What is shameful and disgraceful is the way it was done. You-all could have courteously approached the original author. You could have thanked her for her contribution and explained to her that scientific projects not described in mainstream literature were subject to a special procedure for establishing credibility. You could have informed her, upfront, exactly what kinds of proofs of credibility were required and in what form. If the original author could not, or did not care to, furnish the requisite proofs, the matter would end right there, the article would be deleted, and everybody would have parted on good terms. If the original author could furnish enough acceptable proof, the next step should have been to give her general guidelines about how to make the article itself accepatble - and then let her, and/or anybody else knowledgeable about the subject and cooperating with the original author, make the changes. And after that you-all, and everybody who cared about knowledge and information, should have participated in protecting the intergity of the information in the article from subsequent distortion and falsification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>That</b> is the way anybody worthy of the name "encyclopedia editor" should have acted. But none of that was done. Instead, the article was immediately, and without any basis, treated as if it had been submitted in bad faith; the author was treated with derision, contempt and condescension; both the author and the scientists whose work was described in the article were subjected to slander and defamation of character; and a kangaroo-court proceeded to ride haywire on the subject without knowing anything about it, and to replace the article with ignorant derisive crap. <b>That's</b> what is shameful and disgraceful. And even more shameful and disgraceful is that none of you people - you PJacobis, you William Conneleys, you Natalinas', you Mel Etitis' (sounds like a disease), you Karadas', you Guettardas - don't feel any sense of shame about it - no, to the contrary, you feel a sense of holy righteousness. It's exactly like a Stalinist party rally - I know those rallies, I grew up under Stalinism. But let me tell you, there are already enough Stalinist encyclopedias in the world - Stalin himself was a great Encyclopedist, you know.

<dd><b>Ceasefire</b>. I had some negative and wrong misassumptions about aetherometry, more of concerning the people behind it, than the science itself, which I still doubt. Now, I'm also worried that you have misassumptions of Wikipedia as well. Now I want to ask, why did Helicoid submit this article in the first place? What did you hope to achieve? I am in the process of typing up a lengthy, semi-apolegetic discourse, which of course my stance of it as a fringe science will not change, nor my stance that it needs more peer review and is probably wrong in many areas, although probably insightful - that will not change. But I really hope we can be civil, and to cooperate and rule out the kinks. Now for one thing, I am going to retract some of my previous statements about aetherometry. But that is only if you can agree that some of the behaviour (from several IP's) concerning civility need to change.

<dd>No see, that is the thing that made me think you people were authoritarian and tended to be fascist (although you argue I am and you are not) - you "demand" a full written public apology, and call it "slanderous and libelous". The concept of slander and libel is something invented by authoritarian leaders who can't stand a tarnished reputation and can't stand criticism, and business leaders who are afraid to lose their precious, precious monetary gains. That's fascist. The political opposition in my country are all silenced because the government prosecutes them for slander and libel, and silences the students too, if they try to make any public critique of the government. That's the thing I can't stand. The moment you say its "slanderous and libelous" - I immediately think you are as politically decadent as my government. A good scientist merely shrugs off these claims, or rebuts them with cool. Now, I have agreed to apologise for some things, but I will not do it because you demanded it so, or you asked me to. I do it because this is a comment of my own accord. I'm not doing it because "its the least I should do" - but rather, because I want to reconcile this ugly battle that never should have happened in the first place. I admit I was wrong on some counts, but no its not a "full retraction".
