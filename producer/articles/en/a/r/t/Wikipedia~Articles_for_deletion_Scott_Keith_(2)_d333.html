<li><b>-***½ Delete</b> - as an ex-wrestling fan, I find Keith's breakdown of wrestling shows are fun to read, but the nom is correct in there's no reliable sources about Keith himself. Only one of his books appear to have been reviewed in a reliable source (<a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosK/keith_01feb05-sun.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosK/keith_01feb05-sun.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), and the man himself has received nothing in terms of coverage in independent reliable sources. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 19:09, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> as the author of four published books through what appears to be a reputable publisher, the Citadel imprint of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington_Books_ccbc.html" title="Kensington Books">Kensington Books</a> and a writer for a professional magazine, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighting_Spirit_magazine_68bc.html" title="Fighting Spirit magazine">Fighting Spirit magazine</a>. One of his books is reviewed on <a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/23/727852.html" class="external text" title="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/23/727852.html" rel="nofollow">Slam Sports</a> and a number of internet-based stories, and is used as a reference by <a href="http://www.thesportjournal.org/2006Journal/Vol9-No4/shuart.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.thesportjournal.org/2006Journal/Vol9-No4/shuart.asp" rel="nofollow">The Sport Journal</a>; there are mentions of his books in an <a href="http://www.dtweekend.com/issues/20060412/so.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dtweekend.com/issues/20060412/so.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Texan_ab98.html" title="The Daily Texan">The Daily Texan</a>... there's some play for his published works. The article does need work, though, as it stands, and some sources would be useful. I think the problem is that as a writer about a specific topic like pro wrestling, it's difficult to get reviews outside of the wrestling community, and I'm not sure if we consider places like <a href="../../../4/1/1/411mania.html" title="411mania">411mania</a> as reliable enough sources to work with. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 07:26, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>None of these are about the person; some of them are not even about the book, just evidence that someone referenced it. All of these only trivially mention Scott Keith. You would need to make an entire encyclopedia article about Scott Keith out of these sources, as any unsourced or poorly sourced information would need to be removed, which is not possible from the ones you have listed. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:41, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mostly I was pointing out that he does squeak up against the "published author" bit in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, noting that there are multiple references to his books - and I do point out that he gets far more play within the wrestling community than on a larger scale.

<dd>That doesn't meet even the minor standard in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There are not "multiple independent reviews or awards"; there is only one review, in a rather unreliable source. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 21:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would disagree that Slam Sports, on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Online_Explorer_696b.html" title="Canadian Online Explorer">Canoe.ca</a>, is an unreliable source; it's run by one of Canada's largest media conglomerates. I point to the reviews on 411mania and other wrestling-related sites as other reviews. But, frankly, my main concern is with sites that should be considered reliable being discounted at this point, so hey, whatever. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 21:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is not sufficient to warrant an article on Wikipedia, especially an article on a living person. The article must be substantiated by reliable sources. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> On principle alone. Seriously. How backwards is Wikipedia? Why is it that there is 11 seperate articles just of LISTS of fictional characters from Dragon Ball Z for example, and literally hundreds of articles on all of these individual characters, and then someone like Scott Keith, a notable real-life published author, gets put up for deletion. People seem to lose sight of the big picture here. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamestrepanier_b1b1.html" title="User:Jamestrepanier">Jamestrepanier</a> 18:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The reason is there are an abundance of sources that list these fictional characters. Also, that "Scott Keith" is a real-life person is part of the problem; unsourced inaccuracies in an article about fictional characters have no effect on the life of a living person. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 01:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
