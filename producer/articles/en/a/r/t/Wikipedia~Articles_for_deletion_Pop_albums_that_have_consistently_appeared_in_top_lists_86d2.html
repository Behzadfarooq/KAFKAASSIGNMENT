<li><b>Delete</b> Inherently POV; no discrimination as to what constitutes a 'top-list,' solely focuses on an arbitrary boundary of albums centered in western world, has no encyclopedic value, talk pages illustrates that it is simply a vehicle for individual editors to get the name of their favorite albums out there...

<dd><b>Comment</b> How is 'consistently' defined in this context? How are these 'top lists' chosen? Does a 'top list' from a Japanese magazine get equal weight with an American one? (Certainly not as the article is severely biased towards the West, America in particular). All these questions point out valid problems with the article, this combined with everyone elses arguments points to deletion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 17:20, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> I don't see a reason, really. The article is severely biased towards the West, because the West because every album on the list is a rock album, and rock was created, developed, and pioneered in the west. I do agree that the article uses quite a few weasel words yeah, and maybe the genre-creating albums section should be cut, but I think once a good number of accolades are provided, and artists who site the albums as influences and all that, it should be kept. Instead of searching all over to find where to start with a decent music collection, readers can just quickly access this list, look at different genres and start to build their collection from there. It's very helpful. ClashingZeppelin 20:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Wikipedia isn't <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">allmusic.com</a>. I think <i>helping the kids find good music</i> is a poor reason for keep. It's POV, it's unsourced, it's biased, it is a fanboy MAGNET and it is unmanageable. I've been reverting changes on it for days from people who want their favoritest-bestest band to be up there without a cite in sight. excuse the pun. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup><small>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_sandbox_peerreview_b694.html" title="User:JoeSmack/sandbox/peerreview">p-review!</a>)</small> 05:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not only is it severely biased towaords the west, the number of citations to Rolling Stone indicate that it is biased towards a particular conservative - one might say reactionary - view of western popular music. The suggestion that somebody would use a list in an encyclopaedia to start a music collection is somewhat risible, too. It implies that he or she would know nothing about music and had no opportunity of hearing any - in which case why would they want to start collecting it? <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a> 09:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
