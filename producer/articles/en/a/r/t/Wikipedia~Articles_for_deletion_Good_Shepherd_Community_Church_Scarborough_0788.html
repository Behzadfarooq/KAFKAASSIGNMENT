<li><b>Delete</b> I have real doubt about the significance/importance of this church. It doesn't seem as though it is important enough to be listed in an encyclopedia. It also reads like an advertisement for the church, listing everything from the address to hours of different programs. I would also make mentions about the lack of NPOV in the section Good Shepherd Community Church Scarborough#Care House, but I feel that the significance and reading like an advertisement are the major reasons why I listed this for deletion. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 19:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also have a problem with this statement: <i>Care House is an expression of God's people at Good Shepherd Community Church showing God's love in practical ways to poor and oppressed in our community.

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> I was looking to delete "Good Shepherd Community Church, Toronto" and replace with this one (Scarborough), since the legal name is "GSCC Scarborough".

<li><b>Keep</b> well, if we are to follow the guidelines to the letter, then 90% of all church pages listed, should be deleted, as most of the information on them, are from internal documentations, and therefore, make each and every church listed here as 'advertisement'. Also, Althought written in third party, <b>all</b> articles have some form of advertisement to them. If I look up "Coke Zero" it's because I'm interested in learning about a COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. If someone looks up Microsoft Office, they they are looking up information, and, that is a form of advertisement. Perhaps, people need to stop being so petty, and let a church have an informational page listed. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanVS_c740.html" title="User:AllanVS">AllanVS</a> 22:48, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are right. Every product does have some sort of advertising in it. It isn't that this article is blatant advertising; if that were the case, I would have nominated it for speedy deletion. The problem with this article is that the church is non-notable. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28local_churches_and_other_religious_congregations%29_07e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)">Wikipedia:Notability (local churches and other religious congregations)</a>, in order for a church to be considered notable, there is three criteria to be met. 1) <i>Local churches are usually notable if the scope of activities is national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source.</i> While this church may attract members from immigrant communities (which is most likely true since half of the GTA is foreign born), it is not considered national or international scale. I doubt that more than a handful of people in Vancouver or Iqaluit are familiar with this church. 2) <i>Individual local churches in notable denominations are not inherently notable, and do not warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability for the local church itself is established through reliable and verifiable sources.</i> There is a link to the church website, which I will discuss in a moment. 3) <i>Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found.</i> There is nothing listed that it did anything non local in scope. For example, I'm not noticing that it has any national press coverage, or even that there were any abroad missionary trips (although that wouldn't count for notability, either). You could say that the website is considered to be reliable and verifiable sources. However, under assertions to be rejected, <i>Internal documents cannot be used as an assertion of notability. However, they can be used as source material for an article...[i]nternal documents can include, reports, newsletters, press releases, magazines and websites published by the church itself, or any denomination or other organisation it is part of.</i> Therefore, the church website doesn't count. Even if you listed the website for Congregational Christian Churches of Canada, that wouldn't count either. This church does not deserve to have a Wikipedia article. I understand that you are concerned about other articles being able to exist. I suggest and invite you to take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, where you can take a look at the criteria, and process of AdD, and invite you to even contribute by listing articles that do not meet qualifications, either. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Riley_1176.html" title="User:Adam Riley">Adam Riley</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Riley_dcbd.html" title="User talk:Adam Riley">Talk</a></sup> 21:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
