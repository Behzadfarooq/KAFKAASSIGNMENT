<p>You redirected this to Raccoon. Maybe it should just be deleted.</p>
<p><b>Reasoning:</b> The Giant Raccoon's Flatulence theory is a whimsical example used in the book <a href="../../../t/h/e/Godless%7E_The_Church_of_Liberalism_6dfb.html" title="Godless: The Church of Liberalism">Godless: The Church of Liberalism</a>. Some fool (me) put it into a short article, thinking that that was a good place to describe the "theory"/whimsical example. Out of 6.5 billion people on earth, only two or three of them agreed with me, so the GRFT article is no more. The admin who deleted it redirected <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Raccoon%27s_Flatulence_theory_e367.html" title="Giant Raccoon's Flatulence theory">Giant Raccoon's Flatulence theory</a> to 'Godless,' the book in which it appears.</p>

It now redirects to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Raccoon.html" title="Raccoon">Raccoon</a>, which is fine, but I don't think there <i>is</i> such a thing as a giant raccoon, except in the aforementioned whimsical example.

Article can easily be recreated once any real information comes to light, for now it's rather pointless.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>May I suggest you have been misled by a nomination that contained serious misconceptions?
<ul>
<li>In particular the nominator asserted that these two articles were essentially identical, and referenced "<b>the same two links</b>". This is incorrect.</li>
<li>I have given a fuller explanation in the {afd} page -- the short version is that although I created a large number of articles that appear essentially identical if you only take a cursory look at them, they are in fact unique. The links that the nominator describes as "the same two links" are, in fact, unique references that allow the reader to go quickly to the transcripts of the detainee's <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a>, the detainee's Adminstrative Review Board hearing and/or the detainee's factors memo, that summarized the factors for and against their continued detention. You see when the DoD was finally forced to comply with a court order to release information about the detainees they chose to do so in the least useful manner possible. They released 6,000 pages of documents in .pdf format. And those 6,000 pages of documents don't give the detainee's names, just their ID numbers. Prior to my creation of these stub articles that Crzrussian has such an objection to, it was possible to find a particular detainee's transcript -- if you were prepared to spend several hours visually scanning through all 6,000 pages.</li>
<li>The facility to go directly to detainee's transcripts that the wikipedia has made available to the world, through considerable effort on my part, is unique in the public part of the internet. There is no other place someone can go that will spare them that tedious several hours of visual grep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crzrussian didn't see fit to reveal that his nomination to delete Guantanamo articles is the twelth attempt so far. See <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_working_Guantanamo_related_articles_which_have_been_nominated_for_deletion_2c45.html" title="User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion">User:Geo Swan/working/Guantanamo related articles which have been nominated for deletion</a> for the details. All the previous attempt, but one, failed. And, when I had more information about that detainee, I recreated his article.</li>
<li>Crzrussian didn't see fit to let those considering his nomination know that I have quietly been working away at expanding all the stubs I created. Well I have been, and, FWIW, I am about half way through.
<ul>
<li>Why not delete the articles that haven't been expanded, and add them back in, when someone is ready to expand them? Well that means that anyone who needed to access those transcripts would be out of luck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know if you have taken a look at either <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim_Daif_Allah_Neman_Al_Sehli_a74c.html" title="Ibrahim Daif Allah Neman Al Sehli">Ibrahim Daif Allah Neman Al Sehli</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/k/Kako_Kandahari_041f.html" title="Kako Kandahari">Kako Kandahari</a>. I expanded both of them since Crzrussian filed his nomination. Frankly, I am mystified as to why he hasn't addressed those changes.</p>
<p>Maybe, even after this expansion, you will consider the article's pointless. If so I would sure appreciate hearing why.</p>

<p>Hi Just wondering what your problem with AJAX pointing to the programming article. None of the other articles on the disambiguation page are acronymns. My expectation is that typing AJAX should take you to the programming article. Cheers. <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 03:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wha? the opening line of the article defines Ajax as short for "Asynchronous JavaScript And XML" that sounds like an Acronym in my book (<i>a la</i> Radar, Laser, Scuba, etc.) (cf. "<a href="../../../a/j/a/Talk%7EAjax_%28programming%29_Archive_2_cffc.html#Not_an_Acronym.3F" title="Talk:Ajax (programming)/Archive 2">Not an Acronym</a>" and "<a href="../../../a/j/a/Talk%7EAjax_%28programming%29_Archive_PageMove_1e27.html" title="Talk:Ajax (programming)/Archive PageMove">PageMove</a>"). RADAR redirects to Radar, so why shouldn't AJAX redirect to Ajax (programming)? <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 02:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I noticed you redirected the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoebox_effect.html" title="Shoebox effect">shoebox effect</a> stub to the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebate_%28marketing%29.html" title="Rebate (marketing)">rebate (marketing)</a> article. I disagree with that since the "shoebox effect" occurs in other areas besides marketing rebate submissions. It also occurs whenever a reimbursement is neglected, such as a prescription receipt to a prescription insurance plan or a parking receipt for a job is lost or forgotten about. (Note that neither of those is involved in marketing or considered a rebate.) Also, if you are going to redirect what you believe to be a sub-topic, please take the time to <b>boldface</b> the sub-topic (shoebox effect, in this case) in its first appearance in the article, per the <a href="../../../r/_/_/WP%7ER_3abc.html" title="WP:R">redirect guidelines</a>. That should make it easier to understand why shoebox effect is redirected to that article. (Although, in this case it makes it seem as if the shoebox effect is only applicable to marketing rebates).

Although not an expert on the subject of this article, I did some research and have wikified, clarified, and referenced this article.

<p>Hello ARTW. Please indicate why you think the xfanz site is spam. The site is a news source that is owned by the current leader in adult news (xbiz.com) we do have a full community aspect. This site should not be considered spam as it makes NO money what so ever from the end users. Xfanz.com is exactly what is stated in the article, a news site with a community aspect (and will soon have its own YouTube type video service.) if you feel that the format of the article needs to be changed then please indicate what and we will see to it. But to say it is spam is unfair and untrue. Did you take the time to look at the site at all? Please take the time to check your facts before you take a credible site and shame it by saying it is spam. I look forward to your response and hope that this will be fixed. Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article (by XFANZ TEAM) is IMHO clearly spam. I have no idea what the actual site is like and do not care. TBH you're probably better off raising this on the article page than bothering me directly. You could, for instance, remove the prod, which would mean your article would no longer be up for deletion. That would probably mean it going to afd and getting discussed there.

<p>Both on my talk page and on ANI and the village pump. Though it may have looked like I ignored your post on my talk page, I did actually act on it, just not on the page you were talking about. It took me on an interesting journey that lead to me working in concert with several admins, filing official complaints, exchanging emails with Jimbo, and ultimately deciding to stop editing wikipedia. Jimbo is willing to overlook Cyberanth's extreme edits (even he characterized some of them as wrong) and refusal to work with others because he agrees with the core of what he did, but the extreme edits and the refusal to work with others were the point of why most of us were screaming. If he confined himself to only removing controversial uncited information no one would have cared. Instead he was trying to force a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. This particular episode is just a symptom of what is wrong here...not the problem itself. Even if I had won that battle, the underlying problem would have remained, including the manner I would have used to win it. Winning it, would have been at best, only a temporary political victory, good until the next idiot came along who decided to misapply policy and start ripping apart the work of others. I didnt sign up on Wikipedia to be a security guard. Best of luck. just wanted you to know I didn't ignore your post. It was what actually lead me to realize the scope of what he was doing and the extreme nature of the deletions and it lead to me deciding to reallocate my time into far more productive purposes. So thanks. It worked out good, for me anyway. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaper13_315c.html" title="User:Caper13">Caper13</a> 21:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
