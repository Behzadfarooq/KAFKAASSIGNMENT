<p>I was going to list this on VfD, but to avoid the accusation that I am somehow "trolling" I'll bring it up here first. This page is completely useless. It tries to make broad reaching precedents based on single examples with a small number of voters. This fallacious reasoning (proof by a single example) takes a decision such as to keep <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affectional_orientation.html" title="Affectional orientation">Affectional orientation</a>, which had 1430 google hits, and attempts to say that this creates a precedent that "article[s] with 1430 Google hits merit inclusion". I modified this to at least at the word "could", indicating that not all articles with 1430 Google hits merit inclusion, but that makes this example rather useless as a precedent. Further, as the number of VfD entries increases, the breadth of opinion on a single VfD article becomes very thin. The proper way to set such precedents, if anything, is to take the broader issue (does a certain number of google hits merit inclusion) and discuss it directly.</p>
<p>I think this page should be deleted. If not it needs to be seriously reworked. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 14:30, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Certainly not in current Wikipedia deletion policy, in which the actual reasons for the decision are rarely articulated. Even if this part of the policy were fixed, I'm not sure we should have precedent set in a situation where a quorum of 50% of eligible voters is not reached. There are just far too few votes in a typical VfD vote to be binding on future decisions of Wikipedia in any way. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 14:51, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've been thinking for some time that we need to provide some more help for people making their first listing on VfD. This is one thing it should point out. Another possibility is a gentle suggestion that it's good to list only one article per week for your first few attempts. Some newcomers list several articles only to see them all fail to get consensus and there is ill feeling generated all around. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:59, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That page should have a note in the lead paragraph indicating that none of the precedents are generally considered binding just because they are precedents, especially as arguments given in discussion for retention or deletion do not necessarily reflect all or even any of the reasoning used by other individuals in casting their votes. Something like that should neutralize it. However, since no-one ever seems to cite this particular page on VfD, it seems actually quite neutralized and harmless as it is. It is not unhelpful to have a compendium of old discussions. The Google example cited by Anthony is indeed rather strange since I know there have been a number of retentions with less hits. Another one, besides the one <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> mentioned, had only 11 Google hits and is discussed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Peryton" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Peryton" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Google tests are usually reasonably evaluated by commentators. Most people can see when apples are being compared to oranges and when relative Google hits are very relevant and when they don't matter very much. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 18:14, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I created this page and I do think it is important to recognize that VfD largely operates on precedent, whether you like it or not. For instance this time last year about every second VfD nomination was a list of obscure trivia, the first such being List of songs whose title does not appear in the lyrics. After several close votes it was determined that such lists are encyclopedic. Today these lists are an accepted part of Wikipedia, pages like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_by_gory_death_scene.html" title="List of films by gory death scene">list of films by gory death scene</a> rarely appear on VfD. When they do the votes are overwhelmingly to keep, with even RickK supporting their inclusion (e.g. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_song_titles_phrased_as_questions_44cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of song titles phrased as questions">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of song titles phrased as questions</a>). This policy on list of trivia is nowhere written down, but is based on the long debates of a year ago. Similar consensuses have developed for 9/11 victims, misspelled redirects, surnames, towns with under ten people and many other areas. In the future I am certain that similar unwritten rules concerning high schools, micronations and conlangs will evolve. The vast majority of these precedents are only recorded in the memory of longtime users. This helps make VfD accessible to only a minority of experienced Wikipedians. VfD Precedents is an attempt to preserve early and trend setting debates that clearly affect a whole class of articles so that these precedent setting cases can be easily found and read by those without a long history of reading VfD. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 20:13, Sep 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it has potential. So far, the selection of cases is too much the work of one person, but I think that it would be useful to build up a body of "case law" to complement our equivalent of "statute law". -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 22:56, Sep 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The concept of "case law" doesn't extend well to situations where 4 or 5 of the 100,000 interested persons express their opinion on a matter. At the most a VfD vote should set a precedent for a single article. To require someone interested in voting on a broad issue to vote on hundreds of individual articles is ludicrous. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 15:04, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Small numbers of people voting is exactly how case law works. In the real world one, or at most a handful, of judges makes a decision that affects every subsequent decision. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 17:24, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem isn't the small numbers of voters. The problem is the miniscule number of voters compared to the number of eligible voters. To bring the analogy to the "real world" you would have to have panels of unpaid self-appointed judges deciding whatever cases they feel like. When John's five friends decide that John was only doing 75 in a 55 and doesn't deserve a ticket that would then be a precedent when Mary does 72 and five friends of the cops show up to judge the case. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 01:42, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bogus. The <i>real world</i> of VfD is a <i>free</i> vote outside of any <i>case law</i>. There is no <i>case law</i> here. A legislative body or corporate board of directors is similarly not <i>bound</i> by past decisions except insofar as individuals knowingly allow themselves to bound and to the extent that previous practice may weigh with individual voters. But the body may choose to totally reverse themselves or to be inconsistant with past practice, may vote for something <i>unprecedented</i>. No vote by itself establishes a precedent that <i>must</i> later be followed unless that is what the vote is about. And even then such a rule can be reversed. I see what Anthony is getting at. It looks like a single sysop is setting up rules which gives him an excuse to ignore consensus if consensus doesn't agree with the particular rules he (but not necessarily anyone else) thinks are binding, to attempt to claim that some results of consenus would be <i>illegal</i> and therefore should be ignored. But I am aware of no policy that voters on VfD or elsewhere in Wikipedia cannot vote against past precedent and no policy that if consensus is against any supposed past precedent, a resulting consensus can be overruled on those grounds alone. If suddenly <i>all</i> articles on minor individual fictional characters in any book or television show or comic book and so forth were accepted on VfD when submitted, regardless of how trivial that character was, that does not mean that a year from now, having seen the results of that, one might not find almost all articles of that kind being rejected regardless of what was being done in the previous year, and that many of the same articles that had been accepted placed again on VfD and rejected. People change their minds. Organizations change their group minds. Precedents on VfD may be cited as argument one way or the other, but they aren't law. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 22:02, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Absolutely. Case law evolves over time, and we have no equivalent of a Supreme Court. But it is very useful to track things like this over time and see if we can identify a consensus over time on certain issues. Like the records of trial courts, it will show many conflicting decisions, but over time it will presumably help us evolve toward consensus policies. If, for example, we can see that certain types of things <i>always</i> get deleted, we may have a new criterion to add to what may be speedy-deleted. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 01:56, Sep 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess the page is worth keeping, as a number of people find it useful. It still needs to be cleaned up, though. Right now it seems like a dump of random VfD entries. Is there any reason the votes need to be listed on the page? This page should have more original text and less copy/paste. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 00:42, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps this be changed to "Students are <i>generally</i> non-notable". It's entirely possible that someone may have notability solely for the fact that he is a student at a particular school (as opposed to having notability for other reasons but also happening to be a student at or an alumnus of a particular school). <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 20:57, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree, but it's a disclaimer that seems relatively unnecessary. Obviously "Students are not notable" doesn't mean that no students are notable, it just means that someone being a student isn't notable enough. This article is really about what is <i>generally</i> notable or non-notable anyway, obviously, since it isn't about policy. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 22:57, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As the very low success rate of school deletion listings (less than 15% over eight months, more like 5% over the past four months) is an excellent counter-example against this piece of advice, I've decided to remove that rather than the correct statement on the unlikelihood of school articles being deleted. See the detailed figures below. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:49, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose there may be said to be a difference between whether there is no consensus of the first type: that schools are not notable (which is true) and whether there is a consensus of the second type: that schools are notable (which is not true) but in practice all that is needed for a school articles to be kept regularly is a failure of consensus of the first type. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:55, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently edited the wording of the text on schools. Before the edit, it said:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>High schools remain the subject of much debate, but are highly unlikely to be deleted on VFD. See <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a></i></li>
<li><i>High school teachers, clubs, classrooms or lessons are not notable.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In the past eight months there have been some 270 school article deletion listings, but fewer than 40 school articles were deleted as a result of these deletion listings. This is a success rate of less than 15%. Moreover most elementary and middle school deletion listings also fail, though there is a slightly higher success rate with elementary schools. Even infant schools are sometimes kept where they are a regulated part of a state educational system. The only class of "school" that is regularly deleted if listed is the pre-school.</p>
<p>In August, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millburn_School%2C_Wadsworth%2C_Illinois_e44a.html" title="Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois">Millburn School, Wadsworth, Illinois</a> (K8), <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andover_Elementary_School_be62.html" title="Andover Elementary School">Andover Elementary School</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Middle_School%2C_Portland%2C_Maine_cd93.html" title="King Middle School, Portland, Maine">King Middle School, Portland, Maine</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/v/Duveneck_Elementary_School_065a.html" title="Duveneck Elementary School">Duveneck Elementary School</a> were kept and Townsville_Primary_School/Temp (a rewrite of a copyright violation) looks likely to be kept. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_York_Hill_Elementary_School_b4be.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/York Hill Elementary School">York Hill Elementary School</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Netivot_Hatorah_Day_School_1291.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Netivot Hatorah Day School">Netivot Hatorah Day School</a> and two preschools were deleted. High schools are almost invariably kept--indeed although we may soon see an article about a high school built only an eight-years ago deleted, the last time this happened was <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_St._Stephens_High_School_cddd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/St. Stephens High School">St. Stephens High School</a>, listed April 15.</p>
<p>I changed the text to remove the word "high" from both of the above lines.</p>
<p>Aaron has removed the first line. We then had nothing in this document describing the massive difficulty of successfully listing a school article for deletion. I have reverted to my version which I believe most accurately represented the current state of affairs:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Schools remain the subject of much debate, but are highly unlikely to be deleted on VFD. See <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a></i></li>
<li><i>School teachers, clubs, classrooms or lessons are not notable</i></li>
</ul>
<p>So...I'm relatively new and not sure what the policy should be regarding University dorms of no apparent distinction. In this case, the article is <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Dickson_Hall_f548.html" title="Clara Dickson Hall">Clara Dickson Hall</a>. Its page, recently marked by me as disputed, claims that its capacity of 450 makes it the largest dorm on the eastern half of the US. However, I have shown this to be untrue, meaning that there is evidently nothing special about this dorm building: there are hundreds or thousands like it across the country. Should I mark it for deletion, or go somewhere else first and ask (maybe I should've been bolder and just marked it)? <a href="../../../f/s/i/User%7EFsiler_3c60.html" title="User:Fsiler">Fsiler</a> 09:46, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd just redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>. If it's the largest dorm on campus, maybe it deserves a mention in the article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:00, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, but you don't provide an explanation on why you reverted. You only describe your perception of the sequence of events. In fact I created an extensive and detailed explanation of why I reverted your removal of material. You simply hadn't noticed it, or I hadn't finished writing it, when you reverted. Never mind, the restoration of the text you insist on excising can wait a few weeks if necessary. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 05:58, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could you explain your rationale, by the way?

<p>Tony,<br />
I notice how <i>"I don't see what good the editing history will do us."</i> neatly avoids you actually examining it. Time is clearly divided into the <b>before</b> where there was something you didn't like about the main page and you cheerfully reverted several times without discussion and the <b>after</b> where the main page was as you liked and you're happy to use the talk page.

<p>Most of the AfD arguments related to notability surround "vanity" pages for schools, musicians and the like. I don't have a strong general view about such pages. A different and much more serious nn issue arises when an article about a nn business or person slams the subject of the article. Two examples I have in mind are <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathryn_Blair_6e6a.html" title="Kathryn Blair">Kathryn Blair</a> and American Agencies. In the former article, about the minor child of English PM Tony Blair, there are frequent attempts to insert private alleged facts about the subject. The latter article appears to have been created by someone involved in a (dismissed) lawsuit against the collections agency which is the topic of the article. One argument against deletion was that (the article says) the company has some well-known clients. Well, really, I opine that there are very few businesses or professionals that don't have (or could be alleged to have) some connection to some notable figure. Because the subject of the article is not well known (even if arguably not sufficiently nn to be voted off in an AfD vote) few editors will have the interest or knowledge to correct a negative PoV slant. And the subject of the article may unknowingly suffer a lot of damage b/c Google searches return links from WP associating the subject with some alleged wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In short, where an apparently or marginally non-notable subject is being put in a negative light, especially by anonymous editors, we should be quicker to delete.<a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 22:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have had an issue with regards to Planes of existence (chat site) in that it is a <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>, a type of <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_chat.html" title="Online chat">Online chat</a> and there is no confirmed precedent that is set.</p>
<p>The article in question is notable within its core community, if for no other reason than because incidents that happened led to a mass of people leaving talkers and moving towards online messengers such as <a href="../../../i/c/q/ICQ_3c2b.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>, sometimes referred to as "the death of talkers". Now, in my mind, that makes it notable.</p>
<p>However, it has not been open for 2 1/2 years (possibly more), was not the most popular of all time, and it is debatable even whether it was the most popular of its type. Its web page has not existed for 2 1/2 years, and its main web page hasn't existed for 7 years. But Alexa's Way Back When machine kept records of it, which Alexa only did for the most popular web sites, which seems to assert notoriety - except that we don't know how popular you have to be to have a web site stored on Alexa.</p>
<p>The thing is that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is only for Web pages. This is not a web page. The web page is not the notable part of the site, and not the reason for the article's existence. If it did not have a web site at all (few talkers did), then it would still be notable.</p>
<p>In establishing a precedent, I tried to look for other examples. There is the comparable example of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_MUSH_684c.html" title="Star Wars MUSH">Star Wars MUSH</a> which had similar kinds of claims to notoriety within the <a href="../../../m/u/s/MUSH_a560.html" title="MUSH">MUSH</a> community - it was not the most popular MUSH ever, yet it had significance from a historical perspective. It was probably not as popular as the talker that I mentioned above, and indeed as far as I know the talker community was bigger than the MUSH community (certainly, there were a lot more talkers than there were MUSHes), but it passed due to historical significance.</p>
<p>A second precedent, however, was set with <a href="../../../l/a/m/LambdaMOO_a39e.html" title="LambdaMOO">LambdaMOO</a>, which is the most popular <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html" title="MOO">MOO</a> in history. That article was eventually merged in to <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html" title="MOO">MOO</a>, and hence some people said therefore that articles such as PoE should be merged in to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>.</p>
<p>Now, one thing is that the talker community was about 4 times bigger than the MUSH community, and maybe 10 times bigger than the MOO community, so perhaps a direct comparison is not applicable. However, none of these communities is big in comparison to something like <a href="../../../i/c/q/ICQ_3c2b.html" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>. The most popular talker ever, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a>, had 2,000 users online at a time, which is nothing in comparison to the millions on ICQ, or <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> or <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a>.</p>
<p>I would like for us to establish some kind of precedent for what to do with things like this. I think that it should be added to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> so that when we have articles like this in the future, the thinking is a lot simpler.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that it is either historically significant, first of something or most popular of something. In my opinion either of those 3 is sufficient. But I think that we need to establish some kind of precedent about it.</p>
<p>For people who used talkers, understanding their history is important. And for people who use instant messengers, they may be interested in learning about some of the things that came before (or then again, they may not care).</p>
<p>I would appreciate a set precedent being made. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> 06:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently, this says:</p>

<p>I think that's false. Single city TV and radio broadcasters clearly are being kept regularly, unless they are a low-power station (limited to the local neighborhood) or inherently limited market, such as a local cable access channel, or a channel that only broadcasts a fireplace 24hours a day. Local programs of the broadcasters might get "merged up" but the broadcaster themselves are usually not seriously considered for deletion. If I'm wrong, please point me to some reasonably recent AFDs. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have to agree with Rob on this; I've previously raised the concern that these criteria are unclear and don't constitute an effective inclusion guideline. How, for instance, does one draw a viable distinction between "regional" and "single city" broadcasters? Does the station have to have multiple transmitters? Or is it enough that the main signal reaches beyond the city limits? And how far beyond the city limits does it have to reach to qualify as "regional"? And how, really, does one quantify this anyway, given that a broadcast signal's geographic reach can vary depending on the day's <i>weather</i>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would suggest the following as a basic framework to expand upon as necessary: <i>Radio/TV stations are notable if they broadcast over the air and originate at least a portion of their programming schedule in their own studios.</i> (As an example, take <a href="../../../w/c/m/WCMU-TV_1d58.html" title="WCMU-TV">WCMU-TV</a>, a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_System_d34e.html" title="Public Broadcasting System">PBS</a> member station in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Pleasant%2C_Michigan_97b8.html" title="Mount Pleasant, Michigan">Mount Pleasant, Michigan</a>. That station has its own article. However, WCML in <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpena%2C_Michigan_07db.html" title="Alpena, Michigan">Alpena, Michigan</a>, which despite having its own callsign is in fact a repeater of WCMU, doesn't get its own article, but instead exists only as a redirect to WCMU. And for a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> example, the <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_Radio_One_5e06.html" title="CBC Radio One">CBC Radio One</a> station in <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelowna%2C_British_Columbia_8e76.html" title="Kelowna, British Columbia">Kelowna</a> has 65 transmitters in the BC Interior, each with their own distinct callsigns, but that doesn't mean 65 distinct articles since only <a href="../../../c/b/t/CBTK-FM_500f.html" title="CBTK-FM">CBTK-FM</a> actually originates programming.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This doesn't have to be the only criterion applied, but I'm putting it out as a start for discussion. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:21, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I updated the project page, to reflect current precedent on radio/tv (keeping the typical tv/radio) basically worded as Bearcat suggested, but I mentioned licensing (to exclude unofficial stations), and said it might not apply to some low powered stations (I suppose in theory, anybody with a radio transmitter could call themselves a broadcaster, and we only want those with a sufficiently high signal). A more detailed guideline might be warranted (I don't know), but if so, it probably belongs on an appropriate guideline page. This change is just for the sake of reflecting existing AFD precedent, which I think it does now. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"small companies are not notable". How big is small? Some sort of dollar (sales, market cap, etc) threshold might be useful... Also what about former companies? I did up <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bridge_Company_f245.html" title="American Bridge Company">American Bridge Company</a> which at 200M sales/yr is, I think, big enough sizewise (and which also has notability in having been the general contractor or fabricator for many notable bridges, and for having founded a town)... but for much of its life it was a subsidiary of US Steel. I think it should stand alone because it's separate now. If it got merged in again some might argue the article should merge back too. But I'm not sure I agree, and it can be confusing! Consider the story of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informix.html" title="Informix">Informix</a>, Mercator, Ascential, and <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> (et. al.) The heritance around Informix and so forth are very tangled. Informix was a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">DB</a> company, which bought transformation technology as a sideline, and then sold off the DB itself to IBM, took the 1B in cash and changed names to Ascential, then bought more companies (including Mercator, which can be traced back to a spinoff of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dun_and_Bradstreet_c324.html" title="Dun and Bradstreet">D&amp;B</a>), growing to be a leader in its niche of integration and ETL with a very broad portfolio and market leadership, (with <a href="../../../d/a/t/Datastage.html" title="Datastage">Datastage</a> as the lead product) and finally got bought back by IBM last year (with interesting implications for the industry as a whole). How does one identify the proper set of articles that should (and should not) be created? The current <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informix.html" title="Informix">Informix</a> article doesn't seem quite the right home for all that (it has a section "2001: Other acquisitions" which barely hints at it). Some redirects certainly would help,but this seems a more tangled mess than that. I give this as an example of where general principles about mergers and acquisitions may help, not to get the specific answer (although I admit bias, I worked for Novera (at 75 persons, probably not notable...) which was bought by Mercator to get <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_server.html" title="Application server">application server</a> technology, and thus I now work for IBM!)? Maybe this belongs on the talk for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> (the current policy there doesn't address change over time I don't think, though).

<dd>If sales per year are the <i>only</i> basis for notability, then I think the guideline should be large like $100M per year. We don't need articles on every local car dealership with a good turnover in one year. Most companies should be notable for other reasons, like being mentioned in the press etc. In terms of merging articles of subsidiaries, I think that if they are part of the same company today, and the amount that it makes sense to write is not too long, then putting on the same article is helpful. If there is a long history (e.g perhaps Sohio with a separate history to BP and Amoco) and the article is not a stub, then a separate article makes sense. Also if the subsidiary is a separate <i>brand</i> then it is fine to give it its own article, as we do for brands from e.g. Kraft or Unilever. Novera article?

<p>...but "bands and musicians are notable if they have released two albums on a notable label." Is the remark about albums intended to refer to albums by musicians who are themselves considered notable? Otherwise you end up with an odd situation in which an album is considered <i>prima facie</i> notable but the band who made it might not be. Certain compilations might be considered notable in themselves, but in general it seems to me that albums ought, with some exceptions, to be considered notable only when the band is -- in which case, perhaps the privoso "by notable band or musicians," ought to be added, viz. "Albums by notable bands or musicians are notable, but please provide..." etc. --<a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a> 15:27, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Should the criterion be small related to the global economy or small related to a focused industry. Consider whether the company is significant in monetary sales, but also consider whether it is significant in effects on an industry."</i> That may be helpful advice, and your input is greatly appreciated, but it is prospective in nature, and as such is inappropriate for <i>this</i> page. The purpose of this page is to summarize the results of the numerous <i>previous</i> <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> discussions.

<p>Note: REMOVED MY REFERENCE TO BEARCAT ... Satori has changed this without discussion until today. I tried to rework this section into a reflection of my concerns and a line reflecting Satori's concern about Sole Proprieterships. Additionally at Satori's suggestion (above) I took some of the content here back to the Notability page for consistency. It has been suggested that I did this to protect a particular article -- this is not the truth. I have recently recognized that fairly new editors are running rampant empowerd by inconsistences and truncated precedents, not thinking through the reasons for articles. I think that this is dangerous and we need some thoughtful guidance here.</p>

<dd>Hello Mr. Murray, and thank you for taking the time to discuss this issue. Unfortunately, I still have several strong objections to your edits to this page:
<ol>
<li>I have difficulty believing that any administrator would pre-approve the edits you have made to <i>this article</i>. If you can provide a diff or other link illustrating said approval, please do so. It seems likely the language was instead intended for a guidelines page.</li>
<li>While your goal of providing guidance to new editors is laudable, this is a wholly inappropriate venue for such advice. Once again, the sole purpose of this page is to summarize the results of the numerous <i>previous</i> <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> discussions. If you wish to give advice as to how editors should prospectively apply the notability guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, you should continue to do so at <i>that</i> page and not duplicate your efforts here. There is also an ongoing debate at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_924c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> where I'm sure your perspective and strong opinions would be welcome.</li>
<li>Previously you have reverted <i>all</i> of my edits to this page, even those that have nothing to do with your contributions. And you have done so with no comment or discussion whatsoever, all the while chastising <i>me</i> for failing to use this discussion page "until today", although you can clearly see my earlier comments from almost two weeks ago above. I would greatly appreciate if you could effect your reversions with greater care. Finally, <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> did not "fine tune" any of your "minor" contributions whatsoever. That is very misleading to say.</li>
<li>You claim to have attempted compromise, yet your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPrecedents&amp;diff=85596726&amp;oldid=85580872" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FPrecedents&amp;diff=85596726&amp;oldid=85580872" rel="nofollow">latest reversion</a> is substantially the same as your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83246055" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Precedents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83246055" rel="nofollow">earlier edits</a> to this article. You are still trying to influence policy and give advice, an activity that is not appropriate here.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I am asking you politely but resolutely to please remove your well-intentioned advice from this page and, instead, conduct this debate at the proper forum. Please solicitously consider my request, and also where your counsel and insight might be most effective.

<p>Satori,</p>
<p>I thought that someone fine-tuned what I wrote at one point and I thought it was Bearcat. I even wrote a thank you note, but must have been tired and confused and not recognized my own revisions to my work – no wonder I was so impressed. I’ve amended my comments.</p>
<p>I certainly am not looking for a battle, but I think my concerns are warranted. I apologize if I reverted work other than your reversion of removal of my work -- that was not the intent. Can we start fresh here in a spirit of cooperation?</p>
<p>Do you object to my method or my message? Maybe you could help me to achieve my goal. What are you trying to accomplish and why? Are we on different paths?</p>
<p>On October 23 it read ‘’” Small companies are not generally notable”’’, and I objected to that as very ambiguous Now my changes have been removed along with the words “Small Companies, but it has been modified to read: <i>" Sole proprietorships and closely held corporations are not generally notable (unless, of course, they have received significant press coverage)"</i>.</p>
<p>I removed the bulk of my contribution which read ” Please consider what the definition of a small company should be -- it can be subjective. Should the criterion be small related to the global economy or small related to a focused industry. Consider whether the company is significant in monetary sales, but also consider whether it is significant in effects on an industry.” I agree that this tries to say too much for the purpose of this article.</p>
<p>I think that we are making progress. I’d like to see some more definition of what small means. I think that it is being misinterpreted. Just as mentioning “press coverage” can be pertinent, effects on an industry can be important. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:18, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On reviewing the situation, I'm going to have to agree with Satori here. The purpose of this page is not to instruct editors on how to handle company articles that are up for deletion, it is intended to instruct editors what the precedents have been. Since they are precedents, the contents of this page are not up for negotiation <i>except</i> in order to make them more accurately reflect historical facts about Articles for Discussion results. As your changes have no connection to these precedents, they aren't appropriate for this page. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 17:15, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Satoria &amp; Saxifrage -- the more I understand the purpose of this page the more I agree with what you say. However, I came to this page a couple weeks ago because it was quoted as a reason for removing a valid article. I believe that the editor was inappropriately interpreting the purpose of this page. To me this begs the questions, what is the value added of this page, and could it cause more harm than good? Is this page adding clarity or confusion? If it is going to be a list of precedents, then it should cite the examples where this precedent was developed; and there should be more clear and frequent instructions for editors to read the underlying rules before trying to apply these precedents. I also think that there are editors other than myself who are tweaking this toward a list of rules rather than examples. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:19, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's entirely possible, but that's a project that you should put on the back burner for the time being. As you are currently involved in disputes about whether articles should be deleted, and due to your inexperience with the deletion process, you're not very well equipped to tackle a review of this page and its purpose right now. With more experience with the workings of Wikipedia and deletion in particular, and especially with some distance from the current disputes, a review of this page will be more effective. Changing pages in the Wikipedia: namespace isn't something to be done lightly or without a deep and broad understanding of Wikipedia's workings and how the page fits into that. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 18:09, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point well taken regaring my objectivity and experience. But lack of experience in Wikipedia nuances should not discount years of expereicne in life and organizations. There is something wrong here and it shouldbe adressed. Sometimes thoughts and processes become inbred. I got involved in this discussion some time back; the dispute over one article is only an clearer illustration of the problem(s) which I seek to redress. I think that the culture of Wikipeia is becoming one of discouragement rather than encouragement -- this may become dangerous for inspiration. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:19, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are things that Wikipedia properly discourages, and things it properly encourages. Not all articles are welcome, as not all articles belong in an encyclopedia. Whether the line is being drawn in the right place is certainly an issue well-worth debating, but it is a very finely nuanced issue as well that requires familiarity with the overarching goals of the project, as well as how the multitude of policies and guidelines interact with those goals. Not all companies and organisations belong in Wikipedia. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 20:55, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>YES! I think that you have hit the nail on the head in two ways" (1) the <i>"overarching goals"</i> need to be communicated to the individual editors, and (2) the <i>"the multitude of policies and guidelines"</i> need to be reconciled to each other and the goals. My problem is that rookie editors are not looking behind simplistic cookie-cutter rules, and are seeing the goal as cut-cut-cut, not think-think-think. Are the goals secret? Or can we all be empowered with the understanding? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 03:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I appreciate your willingness to be reasonable and compromise. However, I am still unclear as to whether you still have specific objections to this page. Do you believe that it does not accurately summarize how the notability standards of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are currently being applied in AfD discussions? If so, please be specific and provide links if you can. I am certainly more than willing to discuss any changes, especially those that could make this article a more accurate summary of precedent.</p>
<p>As far as the <i>"overarching goals"</i> of the project, I believe they actually have been openly stated and explained, starting with <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a> and the numerous guidelines and policies linked from there. And, at the moment, I do not see anything on this page in conflict with those goals and policies. Again, if you disagree, please be specific. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 04:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As has been pointed out in prior discussions, this is a page for <b>precedents</b>; however, you are asking whether this "<i>does not accurately</i> <b>summarize</b> <i>how the notability standards of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are ... applied</i>". I don't beleive that it does summarize; it brings out different standards. However,<b>Precedents</b> and <b>summaries</b> are two very different things. (1) The section on Companies does not summarize the information at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, a summary is a shorter more direct version of the same information. The information here is not necessarily the same -- it expresses other opinions. (2) <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">Precedents</a> are: <i>"a legal case establishing a principle or rule that a court may need to adopt when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts"</i> If this is a page of precedents it should be citing past actions approved by a recognized authority -- personally I don't think that precedents are practically applicable in this forum. In short, the page does not acheive your purported goal and the goal you state is inconsistent with the definition of a "precedents page."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not beleive that "overarching goals" in the context of Saxifrage's statement are as you defined them. I'd like to see Saxifrage's response before commenting on your well put statement. In my mind the Five Pillars should be overarching, but I think something different is being implied in the statement "<i>very finely nuanced issue</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your response is quite telling. I now realize your frustrations with this page stem from a misunderstanding as to what constitutes precedent. You have referred to the Wikipedia <i>encyclopedia</i> entry for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a>, but in doing so have overlooked the critically important first two words, <i>"In law..."</i>. As an attorney in the real world, I can assure you that the concept of precedent is not restricted to our profession. Wikipedia is not a judicial system, and previous AfD discussions are not cases. The "recognized authority" you refer to is actually community consensus, not a court of law.</p>
<p>The <i>dictionary</i> definition of precedent is: <i>"1. an act in the past which may be used as an example to help decide the outcome of similar instances in the future; 2. an example in the past which may be used as a justification for similar occurrences at a later time."</i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precedent" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precedent" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In fact, it does not appear that you have even read the notice at the top of this article, which clearly states, <i>"There have been many AfD debates over the years. This page summarizes how various types of articles have often been dealt with on AfD."</i> Please note the word "summarizes". Once again, your objections to this page are not well founded. And I am sorry that your edits to the guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> have not been well received, but, I will state again as clearly as I can, this page is not the proper forum for notability guideline debates. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 16:14, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I refer to the overarching goals of the project, I do mean the Five Pillars and everything connected to them—the whole tangled complex of policy and guidelines that come together to communicate our goals. (It is often summarised as "writing an encyclopedia", but this obviously needs clarification and specification.)</dd>
<dd>When I said where to draw the line between inclusion and exclusion is a very finely nuanced issue, I was pointing out that even the most experienced editors disagree about the exact position of the line, so disputing this without a very broad experience at Wikipedia is futile. To engage on such a nuanced part of how to achieve the project's goals requires familiarity with the principles that must underpin any arguments about inclusion and exclusion.</dd>
<dd>I'm going to have to agree with Satori about this page. There's no room to change this page except to more accurately reflect what happened in the past. Adding <i>new</i> instructions and distinctions to this page would be in contradiction with what this page is for. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 23:17, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am surprised that there has been no precedents listed for notability of television programs and television guides on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Articles for deletion/Precedents</a> page. Perhaps this is not the right place to ask, but where would I go to suggest a proposal? The thing is, there seems to be a growing number of episode guide articles, and several of them — as far as I've seen, recaps of game shows and/or reality programs (e.g., <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Deal_or_No_Deal%2C_Season_1_%28US%29_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Deal or No Deal, Season 1 (US)">Articles for deletion/Deal or No Deal (Season 1)</a> — have been successfully nominated for deletion. Although not a perfect solution by any means, having a precedent would be helpful to wikipedians who are considering creating television articles, and perhaps refer them to more appropriate places to create their proposed articles (e.g., <a href="http://tviv.org" class="external text" title="http://tviv.org" rel="nofollow">TVIV.org</a>). So how about it — what articles merit inclusion, which topics have been afd subjects and which ones get deleted most often? Thanks in advance for your help.

<p>There were several editors that contributed to this article's AfD discussion (see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_dab2.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">the discussion</a>) that suggested a rename of this article to something like Articles for deletion/Trends, to place further emphasis on the fact that the items on this page are not binding, are not prescribing actions for the future, and that consensus can change. What do you all think? Rename?</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with this. I don't especially like "trends" either, though. Maybe "examples?" --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, the simple fact is that these <i>are</i> precedents. I don't think they're trends really, and to simply call them examples is misleading. Precedents are very useful, in that we've based many guidelines and CSD criteria on them. Is it actually a problem that people consider this page binding, especially since its header clearly indicates it's not? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The name precedent may mean to some people something more than guidance. It has the connotation for some of something prescriptive. Maybe not trends either... we should come up with a name clearly better than "precedents" before we decide to change the name, if we decide to change the name. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho McCann</a> 17:11, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Sancho. Calling AfD outcomes "precedent" implies they're authoritative, which (1) is bad for reasons I gave in the MfD, and (2) contradicts the top 3 lines of the page. Renaming the page probably won't do much to discourage AfD participants from continuing to "cite precedent" but it's a start. I don't see why Examples would be misleading. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 19:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with "examples" is that any random AFD could be called an example, even the ones that have an uncommon or controversial outcome. The point of this list is to show <i>common</i> outcomes. If we know that e.g. articles on Lord of the Rings characters don't generally get deleted, that should advise people not to nominate them (but rather, edit or merge them or something). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
