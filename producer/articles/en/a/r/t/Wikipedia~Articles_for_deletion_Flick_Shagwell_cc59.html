<p><strike>There is no way this person is real (and even if she were it should still go I think)</strike>. OK admittedly she is real, but should it be on Wikipedia? Much as there are 190,000 Google hits they certainly don't seem to refer to the same person (some say Asian some British for example). I refer back to my previous opinion that she is not a real person but rather a popular pseudonym.

<li>That is true, but all the same, most of the hits do seem to be automated lists of keywords which link to the same sites - as has been stated google isn't a very good measure when it comes to porn.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Google is inherently biased, and there's no shortage of porn actresses (I won't use the word artist- sorry, but artistic merit is something people rarely look for in this particular subject), so I find it hard to believe thet they're inherently notable if they have google hits. Of course they have google hits! Anybody, what's the number one use of the internet? 4-letter word, sounds like corn. Don't mistake this as a vote for censorship, which I'm not in favor of; but you <b>cannot</b> use google hits to determine notability of porn stars. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 14:18, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Notability not established. The fact that porn actresses pop up a lot on internet searches is a function of the internet and how it has become a perfect distribution method for the pornography industry. Just because Wikipedia is internet-based does not mean we should base our standards of notability on Google counts when it comes to porn stars. The most minor porn actress probably has more hits than most Nobel prize winners. Based on my brief review of the various porn categories and lists on Wikipedia such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_porn_stars.html" title="List of porn stars">List of porn stars</a>, we already have hundreds of porn actors and actresses with articles (and I assume that not every porn actor or actress has been categorized or linked on the lists). While there are some that are truly notable, such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Carey_0db0.html" title="Mary Carey">Mary Carey</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Lovelace_f18d.html" title="Linda Lovelace">Linda Lovelace</a>, I would venture to say most are not. In most cases we know nothing about them other than their stage names. Almost all of the "girls" claim to be 18 or 19, but like Dorian Gray, they seem to stay the same age. Any supposed "facts" that are published are likely nothing more than marketing, and certainly not verifiable. Although Ms. "Shagwell" does exhibit the ability to accept large objects into an orifice generally used for discharges, I fail to see how that distinguishes her from many other nameless "stars" in her profession. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 15:56, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm concerned that this debate is becoming a debate on the merits of porn stars (on wikipedia) in general. That's a worthy debate, but not for here. Let's not assume that nothing fictional is worthy of an article or we'll be dealing with a lot of cross <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> fans!

<li>If the last two comments were directed at my comments (since I am one of the relatively few to have voted to delete), I thought I made it clear that I am not opposed to having porn stars <i>if</i> they are notable. What I do think is that the concept of what is notable is being grossly distorted by the fact that the porn industry uses the internet for delivery and that the focus on Google hits is a very myopic way to determine the notability of these people. In my opinion, this person does not meet the notability standards of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It seems to me by applying the Google test, anyone who is willing to make a couple of hardcore films under an assumed name is automatically notable under the definitions others are applying. Independent judgment seems completely lacking here, since I see no arguments in favor other than citations to a test which I believe is not an accurate gauge of notability in this case. I have no personal problems with the porn industry existing or even being represented fairly within Wikipedia. I fail to see where that shows any personal bias. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 20:30, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Unverifiable</a> things are <i>not</i> worth articles. That's our policy. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a 'phone book</a>. That is also our policy. So far, all that we have about this person is her pseudonym(s), her date of birth, and that she has a job that tens of thousands of other people have. (The place of birth and nationality are unverifiable, for reasons already stated.) That doesn't meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<li>Her <i>claims</i> of being born in such-and-such a place are verifiable. If she is notable, this is all we need be concerned about. Many notable -- but odd -- people give false details in their biographies. The untruth of these is interesting, and might be discussed in any article, but should not prevent otherwise notable articles from passing. No one is certain about the age of <a href="../../../m/a/e/Mae_West_e0e3.html" title="Mae West">Mae West</a> (because she lied about it quite often), the birthplace of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> (because little attention was paid to the birth at the time), or any biographical details of mytho-legendary historical figures galore. What is important is that enough people knew of these notable figures, and accepted details regarding them. We don't strike <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> for lack of a verifiable birthday. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:26, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see no verifiability. Please point to the place where she herself (rather than some pornography copywriter just making blurb up to go with the pictures) has actually claimed a nationality and place of birth. In any case, that has no bearing upon the points that I made. Even having pseudonym(s), date of birth, job (that tens of thousands of other people have), claimed nationality, and claimed place of birth doesn't meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria, by an enormous margin. Articles about everyone who ever received a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_card.html" title="Green card">green card</a> would be justified on those grounds. The discussion of <a href="../../../m/a/e/Mae_West_e0e3.html" title="Mae West">Mae West</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is irrelevant and completely misses the point. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:18, 2005 Jun 25 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whether or not we can verify the claims of where she was born, her age and any other facts is not really the issue. We can verify the age, height and place of birth of any number of people ranging from singers and shop assistants to teachers and students. However this is not sufficient to earn them a place on Wikipedia. What must be established is whether this woman is a <i>notable</i> porn actress. After all, while I have nothing at all against porn actresses appearing on Wikipedia, it is certainly not the case that every single one deserves an article. This is when the google results come into it. Whilst a non-notable teacher would have very few search engine results (perhaps one or two from the school website or that of a local newspaper), a non-notable porn actress may have a very large number of results. This is because they conduct their entire business via the internet whereas for most jobs the internet is fairly irrelevent to their working life. As such we can expect that <i>any</i> porn actress will get a great many search engine results as this is their form of advertising (although note that most of these results are actually automated lists of keywords to inflate page ranks). What <b>we</b> have to establish is whether Ms Shagwell is an especially notable porn actress or whether she is just one of thousands of actresses who have not yet earnt a place on Wikipedia. Google results will not tell us this because any porn actress, notable or not, will get huge numbers of these - their entire source of income depends on it. <a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimt_5387.html" title="User:Wimt">Will</a> =&gt; <a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimt_36f5.html" title="User talk:Wimt">talk</a> 21:06, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
