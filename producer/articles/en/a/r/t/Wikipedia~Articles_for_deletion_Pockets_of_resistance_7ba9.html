<p>The stub has no place on Wiki, as "pockets of resistance" is not a term. Santabarba 01:42, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>NOTE</b> - I have destubified the article, describing several battles from <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> that involved pockets of resistance. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 23:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b>::comment: actually it is a term. Its a military term. After an enemy is defeated and they are fighting from small areas within its called 'pockets of resistance' Though the article makes it sound as if its a new term for Iraq from the media. Its been around for years. Commonly used to describe holdouts in island hopping in WWII. A complete article re-write for context is needed to be accurate.--<a href="../../../x/i/a/User%7EXiahou_4cc2.html" title="User:Xiahou">Xiahou</a> 02:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - this is the second article started by me that User:Santabarba (a new user) has put up for deletion in the past half an hour. It is a term that has been widely used by the media, and as pointed out above, a military term. <span style="font-family:century gothic"><font color="DarkRed">S</font>facets</span> 02:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comments</b>. I don't see any sources for the article, nor do I see how it could grow beyond a stub, or a dictionary definition.

<li><b>Rename, source, and expand.</b> An article could possibly be written about this, including but not limited to definition, historical examples, tactics relating to the pockets and the cleaning thereof, more widespread use.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Far too generic to be worthy of an article, since it's not a technical military term, just a figure of speech which happens to have a military application. Certainly not a term restricted to Iraq either, as people have said above. The OED records its first use in 1940 (and the first use of "pocket" to refer to a group of resisting troops in 1899)! I find it amazing how people always assume that terms started to be used when they first heard them. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> [see below] per <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a>. Due to usage of this term in the Iraq War and elsewhere, it's timely.

<li><b>Delete</b> as a dicdef - the term doesn't seem really expandable into a more general article.

<li>Not so sure about that. "Pockets of resistance" means small encircled groups of regular army soldiers, bypassed after an enemy offensive (short time frame ... days or perhaps a couple of months), probably relying on conventional tactics. "Resistance movement" means an army of irregulars primarily based among and recruiting from the civilian population, perhaps lasting for many years and relying on guerrilla tactics. These are separate concepts and perhaps worthy of disambiguation. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeanHinnen_6a4b.html" title="User:DeanHinnen">Dino</a> 23:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe the proper solution is to rename that article "Salients and re-entrants" and keep this one, transferring information about pockets from that article to this one.

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b> this proposal. Seems sensible. One significant difference between the two is that 'pockets of resistance' is often used to refer to guerrila and insurgent activity, where there is short, or long periods where the enemy's location isn't really known, except that they're somewhere in the area. Very different to salients and re-entrants. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 23:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>While I have no objection to a separate article on pockets as distinct from the salients one, it should really be at <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_%28military%29.html" title="Pocket (military)">Pocket (military)</a> rather than <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pockets_of_resistance.html" title="Pockets of resistance">Pockets of resistance</a>; the latter is more a media term than a military one, and can't be properly applied to things like the <i>kesselshlacht</i> doctrine in any case. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 18:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who can say? There's a 4 day backlog, but it's not a huge number of articles if someone decided to do it. Given the DYK listing, I'm sure a request at AFI would get a speedy response. Or we can leave it where is till DYK is done. I guess it doesn't really matter where it is, so long as there's certainty that it will stay put for a while? Therefore, I've struck the entry at RPM, and you can decide if you want to get it moved real quick, or just leave it alone for the moment.
