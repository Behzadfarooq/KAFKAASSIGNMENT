<li><b>Delete</b>. Hmmmmm.... Regardless of Uncle G's suggestion (and I would ADD to it that the redlinked movies be removed as well; if a movie is not notable enough for Wikipedia <i>as a whole</i>, then it is not notable enough <i>in part</i> either), the question remains whether such a list is encyclopedic. I sometimes get the impression that editors that love pop culture have run out of articles to write and have now moved on to creating IMHO arbitrary lists to categorise information in a myriad of ways. So, while the <i>subject</i> of "unsimulated sex in film" is possibly notable, a <i>list</i> of all verifiable and notable movies that have such scenes goes to a level of detail beyond which an encyclopedia (even a non-paper one) should not cover. There are some things that just don't belong in an encyclopedia, which is why we direct readers to the sources and external links for further reading. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 14:16, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just because a film is redlinked doesn't mean it isn't notable enought for an article. It just means no one has gotten around to writing an article about it yet. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm with Zunaid; even if everything was cited and redlinks were removed, etc., etc., this would still be unencyclopedic listcruft. As Zunaid said, it is probable that the concept of (unsimulated) sex in film is notable, but a mere mention of films that contain sex is not. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> per Uncle G. Since there have been only a small handful of non-porn films in this category, I don't think it's even close to listcruft. It seems to me more like documentation of a shift in cultural and industry norms. Maybe in twenty years it will have grown to a nonmanagable size, but we can worry about that then. Certainly needs to be sourced and dramatically cropped, however -- I would argue that it should stick to its title ("mainstream" and "films") and lose all the cable tv / internet stuff. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep....but</b> 1) immediately remove everything that isn't sourced as potentially libellous. 2) Since that will not leave much, why oh why is this a LIST.

<li><b>Delete.</b> There are a few verifiable examples of "mainstream" films with unsimulated sex acts, sure.

<dd>I'm not trying to be dense (it comes natural!), but I don't see how this is a reason for deletion. In fact, just the opposite: because unsimulated sex in a mainstream movies is a rare thing, it is worth having a list of those rarities. Surely a List of mainstream movies with simulated sex would be listcruft, but this is a list of exceptions to a rule that has very few exceptions. In this way, it's like having a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_left-handed_people.html#Baseball" title="List of famous left-handed people">list of left-handed baseball players</a> -- that is, they are all important exceptions.

<dd>No, that's a very fair point. I think an article <i>about</i> this topic could be made if done right and the sources where there for the reason you stated. This article is not about the subject, it's just a <i>listing</i> of movies in which it occurs, not encyclopedic to begin with and then it's losses the rest of it's reason for existence (in my mind) when only one or two of those movies scenes can be verified by reliable sources. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 21:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All criticisms seem to originate from personal biases. The article just needs a brief paragraph explaining how/why unsimulated sex and/or explicit sex found its way into mainstream cinema.</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I can see where the "keepers" are coming from in the responses above, and would not object to this list being partly merged back into an "unsimulated sex in film" article <i>as examples of the concept</i>. However I still feel that having a long list of every single film that fits the criteria goes beyond an encyclopedic level of detail. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange">®</font></a></b> 06:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unencyclopedic. The list is entertaining, I'll grant you, but not a topic for an encyclopedia article. Maybe there should be a separate "Listopedia" or something to capture this list-making impulse. But really, if you grant this for Wikipedia, what's next? "List of films in which simulated fellatio occurs"? "List of non-mainstream films with scenes of dogs drinking water"? (Not to mention the problem of adjudicating what counts as "mainstream.") <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 08:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. ...and clean up. Not particularly a good article, but that is an of itself isn't enough to delete.

<li><b>Mild keep and remove or tag unreferenced items</b> There is some possible use here for someone researching either censorship or sex in movies and related topics by providing specific films the reader can reference as citable examples.

<li><b>Delete</b> If this were a proper <i>article</i> I might feel otherwise, but we have more than enough of these silly pop culture lists already. We certainly don't need a big list of supposedly mainstream films that supposedly show people really doin' it. If the vote does go to "Keep", I suggest a LOT of paring down using more citations and a much stricter definition of "mainstream film". <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECKarnstein_6dd0.html" title="User:CKarnstein">CKarnstein</a> 04:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see any compelling reason to remove the article. Clean up any libelous content, sure, though I saw nothing that was libelous -- i.e., that demonstrated a malicious intent. Seems like a fairly honest and straightforward list. Could someone point out content that they though was libelous? Otherwise, the only basis for objection is the sexual content, and really, if you're going to let the prudes run the show, might as well give up and do a dead trees edition with all objectionable content removed, because it won't be the Wikipedia and it will not be a democratically-created product.</li>
