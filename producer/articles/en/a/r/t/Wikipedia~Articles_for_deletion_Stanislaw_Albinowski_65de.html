<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems to be a reasonably prominent Polish journalist and writer. Some expansion of the biography would be fine, though. Author's username is irrelevant and likely just a sign of momentary lack of imagination, as s/he registered to write the article. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 17:25, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since we do not need to have two sources of information for this person.

<li>It's interesting that the article and all modifications were made by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d442.html" title="User:Stanislaw Albinowski">User:Stanislaw Albinowski</a>, and that he keeps a "safe copy" on his user page.

<li><b>Delete</b>, since it appears that the subject of the article is quite probably the same editor <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d442.html" title="User:Stanislaw Albinowski">User:Stanislaw Albinowski</a>, delete on the grounds of possible vanity (or an attempt to subvert the vfd process). <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:55, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>That may be taken as a personal attack against the author of the article. I think that is against some rule around here. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:23, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And there are rules on user names: <i>Avoid usernames that are offensive, inflammatory or confusing.</i> and <i>Avoid choosing a username that is the name of a celebrity, or a political, military, or religious figure or event or known Wikipedia vandal.</i>. If that user is not Stanislaw Albinowski, he is an imposter and has no grounds for complaint. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:38, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article could need some expansion by someone familiar with the person, but there is really nothing seriously wrong with it. In fact, it is probably better than 99% of the articles on baseball or cricket players. The nomination is based on a faulty search and reinforced by unfounded suspicions of vanity. Polish economists mainly active during the 1960s through 1980s aren't necessarily very googlable. Moreover, <b>the <i>subject</i> of the article is <i>dead</i></b>, perished, a Polish ex-journalist, has gone to his maker etc. At least according to the article he <i>died 25 January 2005</i>. Even supposing he wouldn't be dead, he is born in 1923. How many 82 year old Polish economists do you think we have on Wikipedia? — The existence, name and books of Albinowski can very easily be checked using the catalogue of the National Library of Poland <a href="http://alpha.bn.org.pl/" class="external text" title="http://alpha.bn.org.pl/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which also confirms the birth-year (death-year is not given, but these kinds of things often lag behind a few years). I also find reference to nine articles in economic journals in the <a href="http://oh1.csa.com/" class="external text" title="http://oh1.csa.com/" rel="nofollow">IBSS: International Bibliography of the Social Sciences</a> database, all written in Polish. (These academic publication databases usually have a bias towards Western European languages, especially English, so there are likely more articles.) The <a href="http://infotrac.london.galegroup.com/default" class="external text" title="http://infotrac.london.galegroup.com/default" rel="nofollow">K G Saur World Biographical Information System Online (WBIS Online)</a> also confirms his existence and refers to <i>Who's Who in the Socialist Countries of Europe</i> (München [et al.]: Saur, 1989). I also found a reference to him in an article in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> Oct. 27, 1960, according to which Albinowski was the economic commentator for the Warsaw paper <i>Zycie Warszawy</i> and an outspoken critic of the way the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comecon.html" title="Comecon">Comecon</a> worked at the time. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:23, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If he is dead, why is there a <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d442.html" title="User:Stanislaw Albinowski">User:Stanislaw Albinowski</a> still editing as of today? Either 1) his death is incorrect reported or 2) there is a wikipedia editor pretending to be the Stanislaw Albinowski (with the Stanislaw Albinowski article on his userpage), in which case the admins should look into it. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:45, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The author is a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbie.html" title="Newbie">newbie</a> who registered both here and on the Polish Wikipedia yesterday. As I pointed out above, when registering he most likely just took the first name that popped up in his head. Somebody seems to have complained about it <a href="../../../../pl/s/t/a/Dyskusja_Wikipedysty%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d0da.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Dyskusja_Wikipedysty:Stanislaw_Albinowski">on the Polish Wikipedia too</a>, but there is probably nothing sinister about, and it is certainly no reason to delete the article. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 11:54, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Albinowski_8329.html" title="Stanislaw Albinowski">Stanislaw Albinowski</a> is dead, but <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanislaw_Albinowski_d442.html" title="User:Stanislaw Albinowski">User:Stanislaw Albinowski</a> is an user - newbie, as <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> reported. Even if he is son of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Albinowski_8329.html" title="Stanislaw Albinowski">Stanislaw Albinowski</a> - it is no reason to delete.<br />
Mr. Albinowski was rather "old-fashion" East-block socialist-economist and the present times show, that his opinions were quite wrong, but it is not the reason to delete the article. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulo_dc4c.html" title="User:Julo">Julo</a> 14:23, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The significance of the user name is that I probably would not have looked twice at this article if I hadn't noticed that the names were the same. Then, when I saw that the subject was deceased, I rather suspected that the author was the subject's son. Nothing at all wrong with that, it's quite nice, in fact, but it lead me to question whether the article would have been written were circumstances otherwise. I suspect that the subject does not pass the "more notable than the average professor" test, which is why I nominated the article for deletion. But this is why we have a voting process, in the hope that collective wisdom is greater than individual wisdom. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> 21:40, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - appears to have been influential during Polish economic debates during the 1980's making him notable enough for mine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:19, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - might not be notable to you, but he was quite notable in Poland. Should English Wikipedia only include what is notable to an average American? <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAusir_735a.html" title="User:Ausir">Ausir</a> 10:31, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately there are people who think we should have higher notability standards for articles about non-English-language topics. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:43, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this person was indeed Polish econmist and a notable one. As to the author of the article, he claims (on his talk page at the Polish wiki) to bear the exact same name as the late Mr. Albinowski, which may or may not be true. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilu_32c9.html" title="User:Filu">filu</a> 18:10, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Both Stanislaw and Albinowski are rather common Polish names. Roughly it translates into Stanley White or Whiteman</li>
