<li>An article of the kind many Wikipedians call "How-to"s. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 22:20, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So what gives you the right to delete it? I call it a how-to article, or if not right now then one day it will be! Wikipedia needs time in order to grow. It can't just be complete all in one try. <b>oppose</b> <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> 22:25, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh well, I guess this means that my page is gone. I exercise my restraint in order to avoid calling people bad names! lol <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> 22:58, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> well-written and well intentioned. Could probably use some cleanup so that it reads less like a magazine article, and maybe a rename (perhaps into "Car-washing techniques"), but the topic deserves an article. If it absolutely cannot be kept, then at least transwiki it somewhere. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:07, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Someone wanted to move it to wikisource! They thought it was copied from somewhere, but it is originial. <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> 23:14, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>transwiki</b> to someplace that takes howtos like this would be good, if they want it. Though you'll have to extend the text and explain all the tiny little details of how to wash wheels and so, and compare makes of soap etc etc. (not to mention waxes&#160;:-P ). Doesn't need to be done right away, but it does need doing then. Nicely written articles like this that don't quite fit encyclopedic criteria might be <b>userfied</b> too, and we could do so if Jaberwocky6669 requests it. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 23:26, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was in the process of fleshing out all of the smaller details until I saw that the article was opposed in its present state.

<li><b>Comment.</b> This article already exists at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_Wash_69df.html" title="Car Wash">Car Wash</a>. "Car washing" is inappropriate because articles on nouns are preferred over verbs in an encyclopedia.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalidecyphon_5f3e.html" title="User:Halidecyphon">Halidecyphon</a> 07:59, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> If converted to an enecyclopedic article about car washing, and car washes. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 00:35, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> If it was re-written and more substance added, it could be a useful addition. As it stands, it's far too light-weight, quite parocial (clearly written with a N American audience in mind, references to warm weather but not cold) with dubious assertions like: " It is known that in a busy parking lot a dirty grungy car will accumulate more knicks and scrapes than a clean car." Well known? says who? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Is it possible for an article of this sort to be NPOV? Certainly an article about car-washing techniques, or even about a particular car-washing technique, could be written neutrally, but it seems to me that an article that instructs the reader to do something necessarily advocates that that thing be done. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimmin_7c2f.html" title="User:Shimmin">Shimmin</a> 00:23, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>COmment</b> I have begun to work on the article, in my <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_Laboratory_c863.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669/Laboratory">Laboratory</a>, according to the ideas that I have seen here. <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> 03:34, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jaberwocky, this article already exists as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_Wash_69df.html" title="Car Wash">Car Wash</a>, but could definatly use your improvements. Add the stuff from your "lab," but DO NOT turn it into a "How-to" <i>please</i>. If you want to write a how-to, write it for wikibooks.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalidecyphon_5f3e.html" title="User:Halidecyphon">Halidecyphon</a> 07:59, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons stated. I was the one who originally posted the Wikisource notice which seems to have started a misunderstanding, now straightened out. If Jabberwocky is ready and willing to wax this with the "Carnauba of NPOV," I'm for letting it stay. Remember the one about dishwashing a few months ago? That turned out pretty good after the how-to was excised and some history added. - Lucky 6.9 04:04, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> any non-"how to" information to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_Wash_69df.html" title="Car Wash">Car Wash</a>, and <b>transwiki</b> if desired. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalidecyphon_5f3e.html" title="User:Halidecyphon">Halidecyphon</a> 07:51, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> the how-to, any factual info that isn't in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_wash.html" title="Car wash">Car wash</a> should be merged. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 09:54, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Or redirect and merge with <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_wash.html" title="Car wash">Car wash</a>. Style is too breezy and informal. Content weak and could use work. As nearly as I can determine, the frequently cited statement that how-to's do not belong in Wikipedia is a legend. Note that the page <a href="../../../h/o/w/How-to.html" title="How-to">How-to</a> practically encourages their creation and notes that they <i>supposed</i> to be "informal." On the evidence of <a href="../../../h/o/w/How-to.html" title="How-to">How-to</a>, how-to's are valid topics for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:53, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, according to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Talk%7EHow-to_6583.html" title="Talk:How-to">Talk:How-to</a>, a lot of the content there and the how-tos in Wikipedia predated the creation of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a>, and many of the authors who <i>had been</i> writing how-tos in Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">theresa knott</a>) decided around December 2003 to start moving instruction manuals over to Wikibooks, which has been happening since. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:28, 2005 Apr 20 (UTC)</li>
