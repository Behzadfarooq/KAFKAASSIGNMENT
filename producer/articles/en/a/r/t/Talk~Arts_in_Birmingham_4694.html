<p>Of Steve Winwood and Dave Mason, the article said "the last two being close friends of Jimi Hendrix. Winwood played on 5 Hendrix LP's and Hendrix first heard "All Along The Watchtower" by Bob Dylan at a party he was invited to by Mason, he decided to record his own version the same night with Mason playing acoustic guitar." I can find no evidence that Hendrix ever came to Birmingham so I have deleted this passage. The information about Hendrix is not relevant here. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 23:07, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not assume that it took place in Birmingham. Indeed, I imagined that it did not take place there. Since the event did not take place in Birmingham, it seemed irrelevant to the article. So I deleted it. I recognised, however, that I might be mistaken even though I did check that no event of this nature had occurred in Birminghamâ€”because such an occurrence would merit inclusion here. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 22:25, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The line of descent isn't so straightforward. Parkes and his successor Spill saw no further than tacky trinkets, and went bankrupt.

<p>Let's go to source. Go to the site of <a href="http://www.luminar.co.uk/cgi/home.cgi" class="external text" title="http://www.luminar.co.uk/cgi/home.cgi" rel="nofollow">Luminar plc</a>, and search for "Jools". A quick skim finds that "in April 2000 we acquired the Jam House, a branded going concern concept, in conjunction with Jools Holland based in Birmingham", and that he's "on board as the venueâ€™s musical and creative advisor" (which isn't a managerial post - the guy has a career). So he's probably a co-owner, but certainly doesn't "run" it in the general admin sense. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 21:47, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Luminar's annual reports for the past few years have stated that Jools Holland was granted an option on 50,000 shares at Â£8.77 "to strengthen the company's relationship with [him]". The option is contingent upon him remaining involved with the Jam House until 2006. He may be a co-owner but we cannot conclude that from this. I think it most likely that he is being offered contingent remuneration for consultancy. I would guess that he was an owner of the Jam House before its acquisition by Luminar. I cannot confirm this without recourse to Companies House records. Perhaps someone with a subscription could check. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 22:52, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Reasonable conclusion. The FT November 2, 2000 describes the acquisition (no earlier details) saying the Jam House "is fronted" by Jools Holland. Birmingham Post, October 11, 2000: "Jam House, which has the considerable cachet of Jools Holland as one of its backing names". Basically we're talking a token role for them to have a prestigious name to wave. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 23:42, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before we get into an argument over the inclusion of comparisons to other cities, can we please discuss the phrasing here? The fundamental question seems to be: is it necessary to compare the musical contribution of Birmingham to that of other cities?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the comparison is not essential but it does enhance the reader's understanding of the city's place in England's musical landscape. I propose: <i>:Birmingham has had a vibrant and varied musical history over the last half-century.

<dd>My intention in including the references to Liverpool and Manchester was to show that despite the fact that Birmingham's music scene isn't <i>celebrated</i>, it in fact matches up to (even surpasses) either of those cities. It's not the first place that would spring to mind if you were asked about a provincial city with a music scene, and that's partly because a lot of the music is (or was) not trendy - it doesn't get the critical kudos. Heavy Metal is hugely popular, friends who work in music retail tell me it's the only genre where sales are consistently increasing, but it's generally seen as a bit naff, music for spotty teenagers. ELO were one of the biggest bands of the seventies, but completely out of favour these days. The same could be said for Duran Duran in the eighties - huge success then, and still a lot of fans now, but you won't find many modern bands claiming them as an influence, they are seen as a slightly embarrassing relic. But when you look at Liverpool and Manchester closely, they don't have anything like the long-term success of Birmingham. I'd be happy with Theo's rewording. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 09:04, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"My intention in including the references to Liverpool and Manchester was to show that despite the fact that Birmingham's music scene isn't celebrated"</i> ~ who doesn't celebrate it?, the people of the city have supported local bands fervently and the Brum Beat scene although not as obvious to the media as other cities was quite extensive and some great musicians hailed from there, this is why I tried to include such trivia as <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hendrix_2ed1.html" title="Jimmy Hendrix">Jimmy Hendrix</a> recording All along the watchtower because of (and with a) Birmingham musician, one of the most influential rock recordings ever?</dd>
<dd>Birmingham bands have been very "trendy" whatever that means, Durran Durran whether you like it or not have been a big influence in recent club culture from the chronic hairstyles to the extravagant clothes style, I have heard many new bands such as the editors (another Brum band in current favour with radio 6) who play a similar style recently, to suggest that Duran Duran are a <i>"slightly embarrassing relic"</i> is a bit unfair and your opinion not mine, I think that seeing as you were happy to point out that you are a professional journo Ray It is fair now that I should point out that I am a professional musician. Dexys, The Beat, Traffic even early UB40 were all underground (better than trendy) individual acts and are still played on "trendy" stations today such as Radio 6. Manchester had a brilliant spell in the late eighties mainly down to the success of the <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacienda.html" title="Hacienda">Hacienda</a> and its wide music policy, similar to the <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rum_Runner_50a4.html" title="Rum Runner">Rum Runner</a> but on a much bigger but less stuck up scale.</dd>
<dd>Liverpool and Manchester are definately bigger in the medias eyes especially papers such as the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Musical_Express_a10e.html" title="New Musical Express">New Musical Express</a> who have had a dislike of anything Birmingham for some time, why should we pander to their misconceptions, Wikipedia is honest and as I keep getting told... unbiased, so we need to know the facts and not someone elses view which is always going to be challenged. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 18:37, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant "celebrated" exactly in the sense of what you're saying in that last paragraph - being "bigger in the media", having a reputation. It's nothing to do with particular bands, it's to do with the city as a whole having a reputation as a centre for music. All the Liverpool post-punk groups of the early eighties traded on that city's reputation, as did Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the Zutons do today. A lot of those groups were mediocre, but they got a bit of a boost from the association with the Beatles. Birmingham (as the article makes clear) has a great musical history but it doesn't have the same cachet. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 19:08, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ray, according to Google hits (Andy Mabbetts prefered method of establishing how important something is) Black Sabbath figure quite highly in musical reputation and seem to be quite iconic, so do Duran Duran etc. If we are talking about musical reputation of a region as a whole then we could add <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Drake_2052.html" title="Nick Drake">Nick Drake</a> to brum (west mids) list who grew up a few miles south of Brum or the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specials.html" title="Specials">Specials</a> from <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, we do not need to mention the word iconic or Liverpool or Manchester or any other missleading comment other than Brum has produced some really talented musicians, their scene is an ongoing one that relies on a proud heritage, the view that Manchester or Liverpool's music scene is more famous than that of Brum is a contentious issue and one that could be argued till the cows don't pup on the fields.

<p><small>[resetting indents]</small> The site that Nick cites says <i>Norrie Paramore apparently came up with "Brum Beat" as part of an advertising campaign to promote national interest in the bands he had signed up from Birmingham, but the term Brum Beat would later become known more for the geographical location that certain groups and performers came from, rather than for a single unifying "sound".</i> As Ray says, it is worth mentioning but I do not see how to do so without diminishing the "birthplace of heavy metal". How about:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Birmingham has had a vibrant and varied musical history over the last half-century. There has never been an iconic "Birmingham sound" comparable to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merseybeat.html" title="Merseybeat">Merseybeat</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madchester.html" title="Madchester">Madchester</a> but the city is described as the birthplace of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy Metal</a>{{Inote|Konow|Konow}}. Norrie Paramore of <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a> promoted his West Midlands bands under a "Brum Beat" slogan in the 1960s but this did not represent a single sound{{Inote|Woodhouse, &lt;http://www.brumbeat.net/oview.htm&gt;|WoodhouseOview}} and was one of many attempts to exploit the Merseybeat phenomenon.</i></dd>

<dd>Sorry to be pedantic here but what about the amount of Reggae artists and bands that have evolved out of a Brum reggae scene, amount to more than Manchester and Liverpool combined but have arguably been overlooked by the press because Birmingham isn't "trendy", shall we mention this also ie: <i>Birmingham has a great history of reggae musicians, more so than Liverpool and Manchester combined</i> do you get my point? Why use a comparison when it is not needed, I would argue that Brum has contributed to the Madchester scene with the Charlatans who are always refered to as a Manchester band, I think that if we were to keep the reference to Liverpool and Manchester it needs to be explained further <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 22:51, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That is also interesting. Can we say that more reggae artists come from Brum than any other English city except London? I would need a source but I think that this would be sufficiently significant to merit a mention. The origin of the Charlatans is something for the body of the section. The thrust of this opening paragraph is to communicate the things for which Brum is <i>famous</i>. Overlooked or neglected achievements could form a second paragraphâ€”perhaps that is where we should mention reggae and the Charlatans. If we all accept the form of paragraph one, we can put that in the article and move on to paragraph two.â€”<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 07:32, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Theo, the thing is that this initial title has been changed about so much since I first bulked up the popular music section some months ago, please read my last response to Brum Burger above, this intro stayed for ages and it doesn't suggest anything other than the absolute truth, it is neither OTT Brum biased nor is it highlighting any "poor old overlooked brum" type of wording, the initial sentence to the article IMO should be short and to the point, we can asume that the reader may have never thought of comparing Birminghams music to that of Liverpool, London or Manchester, this is an encyclopedia and bare facts should remain otherwise I would like the Jimmy Hendrix stuff back again, this is why I added them in the first place so as to try and shout about the music scene and it's influence, you rightly pointed this out to be trivia and irelivant to the article, I now agree but I disagree that we should have reference to other cities on the page, the reader can see for themselves just how much or little the city has contributed to Brit music from the bands and musicians, they only need to click to Manchester or Liverpool to see what those cities offer, am I to go to Liverpool and Manchester and add a comment at the start of their music section... "Although the Afro-Caribbean music scene is not as diverse or successful as Birmingham... etc.." how long do you reckon it would remain and believe me there are plenty of examples of bias on those pages. I suggest not comparing to anywhere, just something like what was there before, "Over the years Birmingham has been a centre of inovation for many different types of music." Black Sabbath are more successful/famous heavy metal band than anything in Liverpool or Manchester, UB40 are a more successful/famous reggae band than anything in Liverpool or Manchester, The beat are a more successful/famous ska/2-tone band than anything in Liverpool and Manchester, Traffic were a more successful/famous psychadelic band than anything in Manchester, Duran Duran are a more successful/famous new romantic band than anything in Liverpool or Manchester, I realise that this is what the sentence was trying to suggest, IMO it reads as though it is trying to cement the media misconception that Brum music has not been as famous as the cities mentioned when in fact it has, I really think this should be dropped, If I object you can guarantee others will and personally I would like there to be some kind of sustenance to what we decide here.

<p>Ok, I have taken into account the fact that Brum has never had a particular music scene as famous as the Merseysound or Madchester scene although the city has contributed to both scenes (charlatans - Manc &amp; Fortunes - Mersey), I am in the process of elaborating on the music article so as to highlight the intro, to reach a compromise I will be addressing the facts that Birmingham has appreciated many "supergroups" who have received much acclaim and notoriety and whilst the city has experienced <i>micro</i> music scenes there has never been a city-wide scene that could be labeled as such, I have come up with this as the initial intro:</p>
<p><i>"Whilst cities such as Liverpool and Manchester have enjoyed famous music scenes that have been easily labeled by the British media Birmingham's music styles have often proved difficult to "box" with many smaller scenes evolving (possibly due to its sprawling size) or individual supergroups taking the limelight rather than the city itself. Birmingham has had a vibrant and varied musical history over the last half-century with many famous Birmingham musicians contributing to a wider British music scene in general."</i></p>
<p>I was going to mention heavy metal in there but it is not 100% a Birmingham sound, like most scenes the city has contributed rather than created the sound although heavy metal obviously has more longevity than either the merseybeat or madchester scene, which incidentally incorporated the indie and baggy scene as well with bands from all over the country, anyway... is this a fair compromise?

Between them Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham released something that might be described as Rock Of Attrition- the loudest, heaviest ever heard. Led Zeppelin was a musical juggernaught, an armageddon machine powered by the crashingest rythm drive ever unleashed on an innocent public. Seeing Led Zeppelin for the first time may be compared to going into battle against Hannibal and coming face-to-face with armoured elephants- you don't know whether to flee for your life or stand and watch this incredible sight and thus risk being ground under foot.

<dd><i>did you ever watch Led Zeppelin perform live in the late 60's early 70's?</i>. No. Did you ever come face-to-face with armoured elephants? I don't doubt Pascall's credentials. It's just that he writes in rock journalism style: it's difficult to assess who's genuinely important, because it cranks up the importance of everyone.</dd>

<dd>Erm... how wrong can you be.. Mr Invisible???, the point is that we have an opinion of a writer who, during the 60's and 70's, wrote prolificaly for the major music publications of the UK, the term "supergroup" has to come from someone/somewhere... Birmingham has provided the UK with many supergroups... <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:25, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must admit that the book is a little hyped but then isn't that journalsim? Anyway, I think that looks good Theo. UB40 and Duran Duran have always championed Birmingham, both bands often being interviewed about their roots, Duran Duran recently played the NEC where they were hyping the audience and saying how proud they were to be back infront of their Birmingham home crowd, UB40 fronted the live capital of culture bid for Brum. Ocean Colour scene named their most successful album after a suburb of Birmingham, the Streets sang about the Bulring in Brum and Matt Skinner is not shy in stating where he grew up, West Heath. I think that the emphasis could be put on the idea that the media choose not to associate certain bands with the city because often the bands are individual in their style and do not pertain to a particular scene in the city, whereas Manchester scene consisted of many bands all sounding similar and Bristol trip hop scene the same. I concede to your removal of "supergroup", I guess it's a bit dated anyway, what about:</dd>

<p>Andy: Please explain why the two pieces of information and the two typos that you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arts_in_Birmingham&amp;curid=1640949&amp;diff=21565467&amp;oldid=21563117" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arts_in_Birmingham&amp;curid=1640949&amp;diff=21565467&amp;oldid=21563117" rel="nofollow">reintroduced to the aricle</a> are enhancements. Your assertion that "their music bore no resemblance to Led Zepeplin" is not even supported by the written and musical sources. Members of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Band_Of_Joy_8621.html" title="Band Of Joy">Band Of Joy</a> have commented that Plant used some of the band's pieces for early Zeppelin numbers; have you ever heard anything by Band Of Joy or do you have a source stating the dissimilarity? And why is the legality of graffiti pertinent to this article? In my opinion the place for comments on the legality of graffiti is in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">Graffiti</a> article. â€”<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 11:57, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) Of course typos are no t enhancements, Please feel free to correct any you find. 2) It's ages since I heard any Band of Joy, but since Wikipedia is not for "original research", I don't see how that is pertinent, anyway 3) "using the pieces" (which could simply mean lyrics, or songs whcih were "covered" by Led Zep) does not sit with the Led Zep articles' claims as to their originality. Please cite your claim. 4) The legality of graffiti is of relevance, because of the context. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 13:02, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) I apologise for the typos gibe. It was a snide response to your having reverted corrected typos back into the article.<br />
2) I think you may be misunderstanding <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>. It is about not introducing new ideas. It is not about not checking assertions. The reason I wondered whether you had heard any Band of Joy is that you may have recognised some of the songs that they covered as the bases for some Zeppelin songs. You might then have read the Led Zep material here on Wikipedia with a different eye and noticed the references to plagiarism and rearrangement.<br />
3) [Led Zeppelin]], Led Zepellin (album), and <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_II_3fae.html" title="Led Zeppelin II">Led Zeppelin II</a> all mention areas in which the band were not original. This is not to detract from Led Zep. As far as I can tell (and I know from experience that using such a modifier opens the way for you to say that I must therefore be wrong; please resist that) Led Zep played covers and rearrangements of the blues numbers (that they had covered as Band of Joy and in other bands) in a heavy metal style. Using the technique that you have demonstrated earlier: please do not make assertions that you cannot support with explicit references. I have been unable to find a reference that states that Led Zeppelin's "music bore no resemblance" to that of the bands in which its members previously played. Band of Joy played the numbers from which Led Zepelin numbers were derived. Led Zep covered songs that were covered by Band of Joy. I agree that Heavy Metal is a very different sound to the Blues, but it is not entirely without resemblance to the blues and to maintain that two covers of the same song bear no resemblance is inappropriate exaggeration in an encyclopedia article.<br />
4) Please explain why it is necessary in this context to explain that graffiti "is illegal, and regarded by some as vandalism", particularly when graffiti is only illegal when applied without consent (is all Birmingham graffiti illegal?).<br />

<dd>Hi Theo and all, graffiti art is carried out illegally in Brum but many legal pieces are still carried out like for example in Selly Oak ball park, the <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custard_Factory_6a86.html" title="Custard Factory">Custard Factory</a> and in <a href="http://www.schudio.co.uk/master.htm?http://www.schudio.co.uk/pages/portfolio/aerosol/commission/selfridges.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.schudio.co.uk/master.htm?http://www.schudio.co.uk/pages/portfolio/aerosol/commission/selfridges.htm" rel="nofollow">Selfridges</a>, thanks for picking up on Andy's adjustments, I look forward to his clarification on his Led Zep edits. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 00:09, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally, I think everything from <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Birmingham_6724.html" title="Music of Birmingham">Music of Birmingham</a> which isn't already here (if there is anything, which I doubt) should be put in this article and MoB turned into a redirect.

<dd>Having done a side-by-side comparison, most of MoB is a subset of AiB (probably just an earlier version of this article), the exception being the section on dance music which doesn't appear here at all. So maybe the answer is to move all the musical stuff from here to there. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 12:06, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd rather see the music stuff on a separate page, although looking at the pattern which the Music of Birmingham page was formed on (as per comments on its talk page) - i.e. <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Manchester_d038.html" title="Music of Manchester">Music of Manchester</a> (and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_United_Kingdom_0b09.html" title="Music of the United Kingdom">Music of the United Kingdom</a> from which that page effectively devolves) - it might be appropriate to put only popular music onto that page and keep the classical music here. Arts in Birmingham could then have a "see <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Birmingham_6724.html" title="Music of Birmingham">Music of Birmingham</a>" line under the sub-heading <b>Popular music</b>. Also, if the Music of Birmingham page is kept then it should probably add the {{Britishmusic}} tag as per the aforementioned pages. (N.B. Classical music is not covered in any of these pages - presumably as it is seen as non-indigenous...).</dd>

<dd>Moving popular music to a separate page gives more room to develop the other arts on this page.

<dd>Sounds good to me - I can see the point about classical music not belonging with other forms. Looking at the other "Music from X" articles, they either seem to be about regional styles (i.e. folk, mainly), or an area's <i>popular</i> music scene. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 15:03, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the merge. A separate "music of" seems reasonable, even if the two articles aren't very well differentiated at this point. I note that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Birmingham_6724.html" title="Music of Birmingham">music of Birmingham</a> is listed as an encyclopedia topic at <a href="../../../m/u/s/Wikipedia%7EMusic_encyclopedia_topics_5ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Music encyclopedia topics">Wikipedia:Music encyclopedia topics</a>.

<dd>I would suggest classical music might not be covered in <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_the_United_Kingdom_0b09.html" title="Music of the United Kingdom">Music of the United Kingdom</a> because it is by definition (see <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">European classical music</a>) not possible to break such music down along national boundaries. I appreciate this is an opinion, not a fact. Also, the category is called music <b>of</b> Birmingham, not music <b>in</b> Birmingham. I think this distinction is significant. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 12:08, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I opposed this merge to begin with, it was not really done very well. Even if you wanted to make classical and popular music separate, why put the music festivals and venues in between? And its not really neutral to put obscure, underground house and hip hop music under "popular" since many would dispute that classification. And why are some festivals covered under "classical music" and some under a separate heading? This article now looks very unbalanced. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:43, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
