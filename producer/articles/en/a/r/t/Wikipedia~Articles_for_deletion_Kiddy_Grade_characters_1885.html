<li><b>Comment</b> I am this Author. Does 977,000 GHits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Kiddy+Grade%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Kiddy+Grade%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) sound minor? I feel really insulted by this, I really enjoy this series and wish to make a valid contribution to the pages related to it. I don't care, how big or small it is, I am interested in doing this. I just happened to put great effort into these pages and really wish to improve them. I have contacted several users for their help, and placed the article in several 'wikihelp' instances, note the <a href="../../../k/i/d/Talk%7EKiddy_Grade_140b.html" title="Talk:Kiddy Grade">Talk</a> page. I as one dont understand the obsession with not needing detailed articles on 'minor things'. I happen to note that you have no active interest in anime series. Unfortunately who are you to decide wether or not this article is relevant, irrespective of your admin title? All I want to do is write a damn good article and everything is getting in the way. Most of my argument is personal, I realise that. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 22:36, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Firstly, I should be clear that the fact I am an admin is not relevant to this discussion - anyone can nominate articles for deletion and I am acting as a regular user and not an administrator in that regard.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Articles should be much more than they are now and give character relevance if they are to stay, but the pages <i>were</i> just created. As for <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a>, don't take things so personally, as while this isn't a vote rants are more likely to lose like-minded individuals than gain them. I do disagree with KG being considered very minor (while it is an average series), but if this is as far in detail as the articles are to go I'm more in favor of a <b>Merge</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 23:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was moving around information, i think that classes as moving, not creation. The information on all these characters was on, the now deleted, List of Kiddy Grade Characters, i was moving info to characters own pages. I wish to take things personally in this instance. When someone puts efforts into something, they dont want to see it deleted, that goes for every single person. Deletion is spiteful, I wish to only see this occur in vandalism and such cases. Also i wish to point out that it is a distinctly good series, it is the first 5 episodes that really let it down. Also a merge seems stupid as this information was shall i say, un-merged, as described earlier. Again I shall point out the <a href="../../../k/i/d/Talk%7EKiddy_Grade_140b.html" title="Talk:Kiddy Grade">Talk</a> page If people are going to refer to the quality of the article. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 23:07, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Venting is doing nothing to help your case here. My point of view of the series' quality has nothing to do with my nod to stay/go, and how long the text was around before doesn't change the fact the articles are very young (which was an argument to your benefit, not against). I will say though, after sitting through the show only once, I don't think that many characters could supply sufficent content to sustain an independent article. It <i>shows</i> they were taken from a list as of now, an expansion of detail and relevance on your part would do more to prove doubters wrong. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 23:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Merge</b>: It would be easier to just move the short paragraphs if the pages have to be deleted rather than to delete the character summaries.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Point taken on the merging. But Aesthisticly and in terms of wanting numerous images, this way is the best. I have done similar things with other animes, most notable <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenchi_Muyo_059b.html" title="Tenchi Muyo">Tenchi Muyo</a> where you take an article, where the character info is confusingly placed all on one page and move them to separate ones supplying a char box. It encouraged writing ten-fold. The images help the articles immensely too.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 23:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't want to be rude and please don't take this is gnawing the newbies or assuming ill intentions of an editor. I don't, it's not the editor, it's the culture. But there has been a pervasive explosion of these character articles in Anime articles. They contain little chunks of information, but only seem to exist to hold an image and an infobox on the character and to fill out a character navagation template... <i>[Note: this comment added by <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>]</i></li>

<li>I have half a mind to say delete the lot of them and start from scratch .. but I'd only push for that if we could throw in the similarly formatted character articles from OMG, IY, and Tenchi as well. They were all created in the same manner, and it's not well suited to the wikipedia. First off, they contain way too many pictures and (some of them) seem to only exist because an infobox was able to be created for the article. But, I will not be mean to the information and I will push for a <b>SUPER speedy merge</b> These articles fall under the auspices of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> which give a wonderful steps on how to create such pages. Also, a aticle like <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclair_and_Lumiere_%28Kiddy_Grade%29_19de.html" title="Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)">Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)</a> contains WAY too many photos and is a definite violation of the fair use policy. It needs a lot of trimming regardless of the outcome of this debate. I would vote to <b>Delete the Kiddy Grade Infobox and navigation templates</b>, if I could. <i>[Note: this comment added by <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>]</i></li>
<li>I also mistakenly removed a prod template from the minor non-human chars article.. It, however, would be best to list it with these articles. <i>[Note: this comment added by <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a>]</i></li>
<li>There are a lot of Anime and manga character articles that need to be cleaned up and merged. (Though there will be some fights on certain series.) Perhaps, I should nominate as a ACOTW. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 00:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wish to point out that I am not trying to do what fits in with policy best, but with what is easiest to read. This is an anime, and a anime is a cartoon and as a visual product, pictures are available and used. For this point i will use <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclair_and_Lumiere_%28Kiddy_Grade%29_19de.html" title="Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)">Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)</a> and will tell you that all the pictures are relevent. There is the main one of each character there, you can't argue with that. Then there is also one of their guard robot and ship, that La Muse and Donnershlag, each of these articles are important in the series, technically, I see that they should be placed on the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-human_Kiddy_Grade_Characters_ea3e.html" title="Non-human Kiddy Grade Characters">Non-human Kiddy Grade Characters</a> Page. But they are relevant to the people. Now the other 4 pictures of eclair and lumiere are ones of forms that we learn about later in the series, while these forms are relevant they are also spoilers. But again this is an anime, it is visual each picture is useful and each has a purpose. Wether or not this suits the wikipedia style. As I am trying to get an article that is easy to read and that gives lots of relevenet info. Now in terms of the info <b>the pages are very young, and haven't had time to accumulate information.</b> That said a merge should probably wait a bit at least. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 09:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've never heard that a fair use image may only appear once in wikipedia. I do, however, know that only a limited ammount of fair use images should appear on a page. The fair use image (screenshot) has one goal: "For critical commentary and discussion of the cinema and television." Furthermore, according to the <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">official policy</a>, "3) The amount of copyrighted work used should be <b>as little as possible</b>. Low-resolution images should be used instead of high-resolution images (especially images that are so high-resolution that they could be used for piracy). <b>Do not use multiple images</b> or media clips if one will serve the purpose adequately" and "8) The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate <b>relevant points or sections within the text</b>) and must <b>not serve a purely decorative purpose</b>." For the page in its current for, the images of the the two charaters on that page could be done with two images. As to the newness of the articles, I'm currently out of time and will write more on that later. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: There can be a lot that can be said about <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keiichi_Morisato_ceb6.html" title="Keiichi Morisato">Keiichi Morisato</a>. The character appeared on 5 ova episodes, one anime movie, over 37 anime episodes (ongoing serries), furthermore it appeared on a manga that had been around since 1988 (23 volumes). By all means Keiichi is among the most notable fictional characters. With the logic behind this nom that article should also be merged just like all stub articles throughout wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>YES.. It should be merged into a list of characters. If, after the article is merged into that list, there is a decent ammount of information, a <b>summary</b> should be left on the character's page and the article should be moved to its own page. The Keiichi article doesn't have much substance right now.. It's a lot better than some of the other one paragraph, two sentence, fluff that exists for some of the other OMG articles. Secondly, you're over stating the character's importance he's appeared in a lot of episodes, but only one franchise. The case could be made per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> that he deserves his own article because he appears in an OVA, the TV series, and the manga of the same exact series, but that's stretching it a bit.</dd>
<dd>I have told you this before, and I will tell it to you again: there are more benefits from merging these articles than keeping them seperate. The first and foremost is that they reduce the number of pages that need to be monitered to ensure that changes are made correctly and that no vandalism is occouring. They also make the articles easier to navigate and provide more succinct articles without the need to repeat the same information over and over and over. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Very tough call. The series and characters are notable, but the articles are, quite frankly, horrid, and do not even attempt to use an outside perspective on the series. Also, way too many images, ugly templates and nowhere near enough prose. In accordance with my view that articles up for deletion as "fancruft" should be judged by quality of writing, I say <b>merge</b>, with no prejudice towards recreation iff the author can come up with better versions. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 18:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your points are null, you cannot make a call on wether or not to keep an article based on "looks," clearly stated in policy. There is no policy on fancruft so that isn't a valid reason. Giving that the articles are <i>horrid</i> could be considered a personal attack, against policy.

<li>I apologize for the excessively intense langauge then, it was not meant to be interpeted as an attack. By "horrid", I meant that they don't follow the writing guidelines (including <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>), manual of style, proper voice for writing about fiction, etc. I'm simply suggesting they be merged for now, and that you rewrite them one at a time. We did something similar with a number of character articles from the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)</a> category who were either non-notable or had not yet proven their notability, and as some of them have turned out to be important, we have reinstated their articles. I'm not saying we should salt the earth here, just that character lists are preferable to character articles until the list has reached a sufficient length. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 19:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank for reiterating that, I was just poking the fire with the horrid comment. ummmm, The notability is not disputed. An earlier comment comparing the GHits of this to Ah My Goddess, a clearly more favored program. Proves that it is beyond a doubt notable. And I am also going through the articles, if you still think that <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclair_and_Lumiere_%28Kiddy_Grade%29_19de.html" title="Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)">Eclair and Lumiere (Kiddy Grade)</a> is written badly please say, as the new article is designed to be far better and non fancruft. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 19:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, now I'm confused, but at least it had some actual information. Still needs significant clean-up. (Tip:Use sub-headings) Why are Eclair and Lumiere listed as one article anyway? The only times I've ever seen 2 character articles are for characters who are split personalities of each other. It also needs far less pictures. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 19:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can't you cite the series itself as a resource? I realize it's a primary source, but it's a published source and highly verifiable. We cite primary sources in the form of research studies in numerous articles. The biggest problem with citing external sources is that outside of Wikipedia, your review sites are basically a bunch of blogs and barely say anything other than "I liked it". I suppose there are probably some magazines that cover anime series as well, but that's only helpful for establishing notability. When it comes to actual information about a series, wikipedia is often the best source outside of the series itself, because while our articles are often written by cruft loving fanboys, everyone else's articles are written by cruft loving fanboys who don't have rules against speculation. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 12:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> There is a large amount of printed information available for the series in the form of the Continuity File books that were included with the LE DVDs and the kiddy Grade Conclusion book. Unfortunately it is all in Japanese but parts have been translated for the FUNimation site (which is all in Flash, but I have all the textual information extracted on disc). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiroi_Hane_f5af.html" title="User:Shiroi Hane">Shiroi Hane</a> 22:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong merge</b>. There's not going to be much you can say about these characters outside of plot summary or analysis of Kiddy Grade, and we really don't need 79 million articles all recapping the plot of one anime series. It's kind of a cheap shot to call Kiddy Grade minor, but it isn't exactly Mobile Suit Gundam or Walt Disney for lasting cultural impact. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. OH MY GOD! It isn't about wether or not we need them, you can't say that we don't need something just because you think we don't. Please if you are going to make such a comment, give a reason. You don't know these characters, there is plenty to say. It isn't about cultural impact either. I consider the <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">a</a> article to be pointless, it has little use, i think. But there are fans of series, people who are interested in anime. In just the same way that there are people interested in language and typography. No anime has cultural impact in the way you suggest it, but that doesn't stop us from writing articles. I can't believe that you are prepared to make such a statement. -end of rant- Apart from that, I have already said that a merge is not ideal. Articles sit for long periods of time, wallowing around doing nothing. You take the list of character and split them into their own areas and people can easily focus on adding pictures and writing informative long articles about characters. having it in one least, means that they are encouraged to just put basic information down, not to give detail. Wikipedia is a resource an infinite one, while you may not think it's necessary, each little article isn't exactly a waste of space, they are like 2 kb each for crying out loud. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrampy20_deb5.html" title="User:Crampy20">Crampy20</a> 12:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> He did give a reason: Lists allow for the exact same amount of useful information to be given as articles do, you do not need minor character articles. Seriously Crampy, you need to calm down, realize we aren't trying to remove any content, just place it in a list rather than individual articles. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 12:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Yeah I do agree with Tjstrf's statement and besides one thing I learned when I helped with the making of character profiles is that those with one or few paragraphs should deserve to be on the same page and only those with a large amount of paragraphs into a page which is not only why I supported having <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seiryo_Tennan_9d9c.html" title="Seiryo Tennan">Seiryo Tennan</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misao_Kuramitsu_8130.html" title="Misao Kuramitsu">Misao Kuramitsu</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seina_Yamada_c04c.html" title="Seina Yamada">Seina Yamada</a> to be made into their own pages. The point I am trying to make is that <b>since most of these profiles have minor summaries then it would be a better idea to merge them together</b>. I also agree that you should calm down, I mean even though I occasionally get stressed with things that occur on Wikipedia but I prefer to control my emotions and do the best I can to help even when something I worked for such as a type of category gets deleted. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 02:21, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

On the other hand I don't see why we should not merge the other pairs and characters into articles on 'GOTT ES Members', 'Villains', 'GOTT Command' and 'Others', most of those are stubs anyway and until they grow too big (if ever) I see little reason for a split.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus"><font style="color:#006400;background:#7CFC00;">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 16:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

My reasoning being that, these are mecha, not characters (only the few mecha with advanced AI, e.g. Donner and Wirbelwind, could be considered characters), and the information would better serve being merged with the relevant character articles (e.g. merge the CC and Dodo information with the Tweedle Twins page) - provided of course that the character articles aren't actually deleted. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiroi_Hane_f5af.html" title="User:Shiroi Hane">Shiroi Hane</a> 01:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
