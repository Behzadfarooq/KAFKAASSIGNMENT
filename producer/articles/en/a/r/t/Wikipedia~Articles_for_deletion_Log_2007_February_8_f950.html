<li><del><b>Delete</b> per nom. The blog mention does not actually make an explicit claim that the game exists, and the insinuation it does make is just not strong enough to serve as the basis of an entire Wikipedia article. That the subject does not meet any <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">WP:SOFTWARE</a> criteria means that there very likely is not enough reliable information right now to develop a fair, verifiable, encyclopedic article. The article can be recreated when better information is available. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 02:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</del>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is indeed a mention of an announced "Health Pack" in the Iwata Asks interview series,<a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/iwata_asks_vol4_p1.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://wii.nintendo.com/iwata_asks_vol4_p1.jsp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and a search for "Health Pack" does pull up articles confirming an announcement.<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11211" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11211" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4003&amp;Itemid=34" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4003&amp;Itemid=34" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1160582051" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1160582051" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Game database entries and SPOnG articles are notoriously unreliable. Not much is reported other than an announcement and a bare description. As a note, it seems the game has been covered on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Wii_games_c5b9.html" title="List of Wii games">list of Wii games</a> for quite some time, but no new reliable information has been shown since then. At this point, I withdraw my delete vote, which should not be construed as a vote to keep. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 18:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's still not a clear fulfillment of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28software%29_dfdb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (software)">notability criteria</a>, especially where depth of content is concerned, per the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="Wikipedia:Notability">primary criterion</a>.

<ul>
<li>Gamasutra, Next-gen, IGN, t3, cubed3, gameworld, and Nintendo have all mentioned it. That should satisfy the criterion. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 05:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I said before (in another way), it's the "non-triviality" qualification that is of concern.

<dd>You made two comments, one about IGN being not notable, and the others about being trivial. I think this is where there's some disagreement.
<ol>
<li><b>Blog posts being non-notable</b> There is nothing in Wikipedia policy (that I'm aware of) that specifically excludes blog entries. It does say things about comments to a blog post being non-reliable, but doesn't specifically exclude the blog posts themselves. Take a look at <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Spolsky_8e78.html" title="Joel Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a> He writes a blog <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com" class="external text" title="http://www.joelonsoftware.com" rel="nofollow">Joel on Software</a>. In his WP article it mentions how he is openly gay, yet there is a single posting in his blog in which he states that he has a boyfriend. Is his blog reliable enough that we can make assumptions based on it? Yeah, that's about himself, so we can probably assume that his information is reliable, but do you understand where I'm coming from? I've made the point before, that I think that this IGN blog posting, <b>is</b> notable. This isn't some random livejournal post. This is IGN, a reputable news source. This blog is a blog that he gets paid to write by the aforementioned news source. It is, in all actuality, IGN publishing it. Clearly, this should be considered notable. The fact that other people reference it in their blogs is actually part of the RS criteria! Should I go through the RS criteria for non-scholarly articles? Google("wii health") has 43,000 hits. I haven't been through all of them. I haven't even been to the second page. Sure, a bunch are probably referencing the IGN blog post (Heck, that single blog post probably satisfies notability, though probably not encyclopedic)</li>
<li><b>Gamasutra (et al) mentionings "trivial"</b> 1) The trivial section doesn't say anything about 1 page news briefs having a 1 sentence mention being trivial. It does say that one sentenece in an entire biography is trivial. The Health pack mentioning in gamasutra is approximately 1/6 of the article. It is not a directory entry, and it addresses this topic directly. Next-gen also addresses the topic directly, and is not a directory entry. Several sentences on the subject matter are included.</li>
<li><b>Nintendo's article</b> (okay, so maybe no one has refuted it (except you did use the word "rumor"), but I feel it necessary to bring it up again.) I mentioned Harry Potter 7 and how it was notable even before it's name was certain, and the response was something to the effect of "well, JKR has always said that there'd be 7." Maybe that isn't good enough reason. If so, I haven't heard a good enough reason. If not, then "announced by Shigeru Miyamoto at a conference held in mid-September" should be reason enough to satisfy <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> right?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Really, I think that there's reason enough to include it according to wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 06:39, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>’’’Weak keep’’’. The three entries under “Sites about specific albums and works” are probably reliable sources which just establish notability, although the third entry, a newspaper article from the Mississauga News, appears on a Tripod.com page rather than the newspaper’s own site.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Point taken. That said, I should add that Stepien's albums are in no way issued by an "important indie label" (just one of the criteria found in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>). In fact, nearly all the CDs offered for sale on the Ego Trip Records website are single copies of new or used discs by established artists like B.B. King and Aerosmith. The fact that one Stepien CD (out of a discography of ten titles) was reviewed in <i>Chart</i> is not, particularly notable - the magazine is very devoted to the independent scene. <i>Exclaim</i>, too, is devoted to the independent scene, and reviews literally thousands of CDs every year (many only on the web). <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 05:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please review the three references which I consider independent: a newspaper article from the Mississauga News (the text is posted on a Tripod page, presumably because the newspaper doesn't have extensive online archives), the review in Exclaim and the review in ChartAttack.com He is not a world-class musician. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a>'s comments about Exclaim and ChartAttack are correct, but I think that all three qualify <i>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</i> if one accepts that a record review makes the musician the "primary subject" of the review. He passes, even if some primary-source material in the article should be moved from "references" to "external links". --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 02:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I understand the point being made about the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> statement ("The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person"). That said, I note the guideline fails to define "multiple". In Stepien's case, he has been the subject of one article and one of his ten albums has occasioned two reviews from publications dedicated to covering independent releases. This amounts to a total of three pieces about Stepien and/or his music. Of these, the most recent, the <i>Chart</i> review of <i>Brodie</i>, dates from October 2000. The longest of these published works, that found in <i>The Mississauga News</i>, amounts to less than 500 words (I should add here that in the article he identifies himself as the founder of Ego Trip Records). Again, each of these pieces concerns Stepien as a musician - as already noted, he clearly fails the "criteria for musicians and ensembles" in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. One more observation concerning Stepien's literary profile: the claim in this Wikipedia article that his book "The Palimpsest mind of Christian Stepien" was "critically acclaimed" is backed up by a press release in which the book is not mentioned. What is included, however, is a claim that the book/CD <i>I Fall into Oblivion</i> garnered "rave reviews from those in the literary community". The press release provides no further information. I can find no evidence that the book was ever reviewed. A google search combining <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22i+fall+into+oblivion%22+stepien&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22i+fall+into+oblivion%22+stepien&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">"i fall into oblivion" and Stepien</a> results in only three hits: this article, a post made by the author on youtube and a similar post by the author on dabble. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 05:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: While I'm not at all convinced of notability here, I do want to sound a note of caution. Certainly nothing in the article <i>as written</i> passes our notability guidelines, but at least on the music side a couple of things point to the remote possibility that he <i>could</i> meet them under certain circumstances. As far as the magazines go, <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chart_%28magazine%29.html" title="Chart (magazine)">Chart</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclaim%21.html" title="Exclaim!">Exclaim!</a></i> <i>do</i> pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria themselves, as they're the <i>only</i> two Canadian music magazines currently in publication which focus on a general readership (as opposed to a music biz insider perspective). That said, however, the <i>type</i> of attention the magazines give can be an issue: if either magazine has done an actual <i>article</i> on him, then he's certainly keepable, and if he's actually <i>charted</i> in either magazine, then he's certainly keepable. But if <i>all</i> he's got is one capsule review in each mag, then that doesn't really pass the "non-trivial" part of the core WP:MUSIC criterion. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Music_Canada_4d7c.html" title="New Music Canada">New Music Canada</a> being what it is, the fact that he has a profile on there points to the <i>possibility</i> that he's gotten airplay on <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_Radio_3_c8cf.html" title="CBC Radio 3">CBC Radio 3</a>, which would give him WP:MUSIC criterion number 10, but as I can't vouch for ever having heard him on there, I simply don't know if that's happened or not. So, to be honest, I'm a bit ambivalent at this point — if he has actually received more substantial coverage than what's currently noted in the article, then I'm willing to change my position to keep <i>if that information is added</i>. But if <i>all</i> he's got is two reviews and an NMC profile that's flown below <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Lawrence_91c1.html" title="Grant Lawrence">Grant Lawrence</a>'s radar, then he's a <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:08, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi everyone. I've been away from this site for a bit, and just noticed the comments for deletion. As far as how the article is written, I'm not used to writing encyclopedic entries (as one of you have noticed this is the only page I've worked on in Wikipedia. I wanted to make sure I got the hang of it before creating more sites) so I understand when users complain about my...embellishment, if you will (I'm speaking in particular about the "critical acclaim" reference. I understood the comments made in Christian's bio as meaning "critically acclaimed", but I guess if it doesn't explicitly say "critically acclaimed" I shouldn't have used that term). With regards to articles on Christian, I personally have 5 newspaper and magazine articles on Christian, however I don’t have a website and am not sure how to get that information onto Wikipedia (can I source an article or information source that’s not online?). One of them I believe makes reference to his touring with Chantal Kreviatzuk a few years ago, if that makes a difference at all. Before setting up this page I tried to find out what the Wikipedia criteria was for Musician’s and Writer’s, and it appeared to me at the time that Christian had met those criteria. I could really use some help in fixing the page, because I’m sure Christian fits the criteria (it’s more my lack of research and writing skills that are being called into question). If someone could make a short list of what Wikipedia is looking for (or give me the link to where it’s listed), I’ll try to find references that prove he fits the criteria. Thanks for the help, Stephen. Stephenmcd 17:30, 9 February 2007</li>

Eusine appears to be <i>extremely</i> minor, appearing in what appears to be a couple of episodes and as one trainer in the video games. I don't think merging this would be appropriate as he is <i>that</i> minor of a character, not even appearing more than 1-2 times.

<p>For those not up on their latin, Lusophobia refers to hostility of Portuguese people. The problem is that the term is not in widespread usage - as evidenced by a google search which reveals only about 300 non-wikipedia results.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Lusophobia+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Lusophobia+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Upon searching scholarly databases such as JSTOR I discovered that the term "lusophobia" has been used by some legitimate historians, but only to describe a period of intense animosity towards the Portuguese in 19th century Brazil. This subject is addressed in only a single sentence in the article. The rest of the article reads like an essay countering the mean things people have said about Portugal. These things are either <i>not</i> racist (for example one can note that a country is poor without showing hostility to that country's people) or uncited. Since there is so little legitimate content here, and the article remains almost entirely unchanged since its creation in 2005, I believe that deletion is appropriate. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 01:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has improved <i>a tad</i> since the last AfD and is actually in better shape then some of the stuff listed on <a href="../../../r/a/c/Category%7ERacism_ca08.html" title="Category:Racism">Category:Racism</a>. It is an antiquated and scholarly word so G-hits is not the best parameter. It an encyclopedic subject relavent to Wikipedia's coverage of ethnic racism. This article could certainly be better but AfD is not a substitute for clean up. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 01:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem is that if we take out the stuff that's irrelevant and/or uncited we're left with what? Three sentences? Barely more than a dictionary definition. Even among scholars the term is barely used. I counted about 10 unique articles that used the word. Also, since nobody has seen fit to fix up the article in nearly two years and the Portuguese wikipedia article is only a sentence, I don't see much chance of future improvement. As to your point about other racism articles, I agree, a lot of them are crap. That's why I nominated <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hibernophobe.html" title="Hibernophobe">Hibernophobe</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> for deletion.

<p>Non-notable fiction writer.

<li><b>Delete</b> - If as is, the article is more about the author's book than about him; the inclusion of material blatantly promoting the book ("back cover blurb"?) as well as prominent, gratuitous linkage to the author's website and online forum fall under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (soapbox: self-promotion and advertising). Significantly revamping the man's bio and shifting focus away from the book would perhaps save things, but not as it stands now. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 02:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - As I wrote the the thing, I suppose I should put in my two cents. I suppose it is true that the writer is 'non-notable' but then it is noted both in the article and in the publisher's information that his book has only been out since December of 2006. I am unaware of much info about him for the bio but I did have the book so that info is is properly sourced. When I learn more about him I will be glad to update the bio more. Also, I had intended to make an article for the book itself in due time. At anyrate, the core of my argument is that it isn't fair to single him out as 'non-notable' when he is so new and that wiki sourcing rules require me to focus on the material I have in hand. That would be the book. He already has reviews on Amazon.com that are favorable, so perhaps he won't be 'non-notable' for long. What's the harm? Delete it in 6 months if he turns out to be a nobody.</li>

<dd>The consensus seems to be that in such a case, it's preferable to recreate the article in 6 months after he wins the Pulitzer Prize rather than keep it here <i>in case</i> he becomes notable in the future. This is also a hedge against self-promotion and vanity, which this does not seem to be.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well that does seem to be a bit outlandish, don't you think? There are plenty of authors on wiki who are not Pulitzer Prize winners, and it seems to me that if you agree that this is not 'self-promotion and vanity' then you are actually employing the opposite argument: 'just in case it is self-promotion and vanity, we're going to delete the sucker.' Do I understand it correctly that if I were to email the man up and get some more biographical information to put in here this article could fly uncontested? The initial editor said the article was fine (thanks!) but it was notability that was his concern. It doesn't seem like both arguments should be able to fly at the same time.

<dd>The Pulitzer comment was a joke. But to your point, notability is the concern - however, I'm not sure what the "other" argument you refer to is. If the article is in really bad shape, that is not a call to delete it; also, calling up the author to get biographical info is a no-no, as wikipedia requires third-party sources. The rule of thumb is, if you can't find a reference to someone in a reliable third party source, then he therefore does not meet the notability requirements.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 06:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yea I thought about the no independent research rule after I posted. The other argument was the 'self-promotion' charge that the other gent was making. I will investigate whether or not there are third-party sources available. I still wonder about that provision in this context as he is a new author. I'm not sure its worth belaboring the issue. And I got the joke. &#160;;) There are all sorts of obscure authors on wiki, which is why I didn't respond with humor. Well, off for now. Straboandlivy 07:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Straboandlivy! as others have pointed out, the issue here is that Mr. Horvath is still not such a well-known author and it appears as if the article about him is attempting to use wikipedia to boost his internet profile. I believe that first the author has to gain notoriety and reputation, and only then perhaps should the wikipedia article be added, as notoriety is a requirement for biographical articles on living people (and dead people too, at that). A very clear example I found is <a href="../../../e/o/i/Eoin_Colfer_9466.html" title="Eoin Colfer">Eoin Colfer</a>, author of the Artemis Fowl books; altough the first one was published in 2001, nobody bothered to add an article about him until mid-2003 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eoin_Colfer&amp;oldid=1625730" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eoin_Colfer&amp;oldid=1625730" rel="nofollow">here</a> and it's not even the earliest version). Notice, too, that he is listed as having written the Artemis Fowl series, which by then was presumably successful enough to prevent information about the author being questioned since he was already notorious, like what's happened here with Mr. Horvath. As for the "amazon-o-meter", it's also not enough to have the book sold on Amazon; for example, John W. Creswell and Harry Wolcott, both authors of major books in the field of qualitative research which are sold on Amazon and presumably have a respectable level of sales, are not mentioned anywhere on wikipedia. In a nutshell, the correct order of events is first for Mr. Horvath to become a successful author in his own right, and then for someone to add an article about him in here. If there's interest about the person the article will thrive, be added to and will eventually turn into a fine biography. Otherwise it will end up in AfD again, which would be quite unfortunate. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 15:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unsourced article on subject who was an unsuccessful contestant on Canadian Idol and Pinoy Pop Star. The article, written somewhat in non-NPOV tones by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Big2entertainment_c807.html" title="Special:Contributions/Big2entertainment">Big2entertainment</a>, describes him as "musician, composer, actor, independent film director and producer".

<p>Contested PROD. This article is on a phrase and simply explains the phrase's etymology and use. That seems more like a job for a dictionary, but <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. There's really not much to be said about the concept of being "number one with a bullet" as it's just a phrase with meaning as described on the page, for, as is also mentioned, the music charts (from which this phrase was derived) do not allow the possibility for actually being number one with a bullet. I don't see much hope for expansion of this beyond various examples of usage, which makes it no less a dictionary definition. Prod was removed on the grounds that the phrase was once very commonly used. I would argue that it's still not all that uncommon a phrase, but that there's nothing particularly encyclopaedic to be written about it. GassyGuy 02:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep if published references available for verification of etymology; delete transwiki otherwise</b> The article appears to be more than a simple dictionary definition, as it goes into pretty good detail as to the specific origins of the phrase. (By contrast, a dictionary would merely explain what the phrase means, how it is pronounced, and at most a couple of words about the word origin). So my vote would be Keep... except the references for the story about the origin of the phrase appear to be a little dodgy at first glance. Therefore I will recommend Keep, but only if the references check out and/or are expanded to include a published source. I would also recommend that the article be expanded to include some notable examples of use of the phrase in pop culture, etc. Deletion only seems necessary if the information in the article can't be verified. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:55, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>For what it's worth, there actually is an etymology at the wiktionary entry, as well as a mention in Wikipedia at <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bullet (disambiguation)">bullet (disambiguation)</a> about what a bullet means on music charts.

<dd>Just to clarify, I was saying that the dictionary contains a <i>very</i> short description of etymology ("from the practice of Billboard magazine of putting a bullet sign in front of some chart entries."). This article expands on that, going into greater detail. That increased level of detailed background information is one of the differences between a dictionary entry for a word and an encyclopedic article about the word. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is not the flash in the pan fame for being a Canadian Idol that makes her notable -- it's the multiple, independent, reliable, published sources having her as a primary subject that make her notable. Notability is permanent and does not diminish if the frequency of publications decreases with time. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho McCann</a> 04:17, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I realise what you are saying, but considering the amount of publicity generated by the program itself, all those non-trivial sources must be taken with a pinch of salt. Ie, because the program and therefore contestants were being marketed as commodities for the duration of the show by corporations with a huge market reach, then to be dropped once they are off it I don't think they are still notable - will someone really care about her in 100 years time? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, I agree, but the notability guidelines don't consider our (your, ohconfucious's and my) reservations about this type of subject being included. We should propose some changes to the guideline. Since the topic of this conversation is changing, perhaps we should move this conversation out of the AfD as well, I've started a discussion on <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a>'s talk page.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho McCann</a> 04:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Failed game show contestants are not notable. The sources included in her bio do not establish her notability independant of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Idol_b300.html" title="Canadian Idol">Canadian Idol</a> show. As such, her mention should be on that article only. If her band meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> at some point, then the article should be recreated, but not before. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> The editors have at least added some references, but on examingthem the references do not make a strong case for notability. Her fame is as a failed Canadian Idol contestant, and several of the references are press releases from the Canadian Idol site, which is arguably not independent. References 2,3, and 4 are press coverage from July 28-30 2005, that she was booted off the show for low vote totals, and certainly count as one good reference. Ref 5 is a press release from the Canadian defense department listing 15 acts on a morale boosting tour, and she gets passing mention as part of one of the 15 groups. Ref 7 is only trivial coverage in a story about a skater, Elvis Stoiko, mentioning that he recorded a track with her for the album. She and 2 other contestants were put in an album, "Braided.". Did it make it big in Canadian pop charts? There is no evidence that it was a hit. There was talk they might go on a tour. Did they? No sign of it. So in summary she has the potential to be notable, but is not there yet. Most of the sources are not really solid ones, being press releases or trivial passing reference. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 17:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Completely agree that, of the 7 references, the two from CTV fail independence, two are "trivial mentions", 2 others are strictly of <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">local</a> interest, whereas national sources are <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">required</a>, so there is thus only one good reference.

<li><b>Keep</b> While most of the other related afds have no published articles included in their references, <i>this</i> article does. In fact, it seems to have multiple articles specifically about this person from different verifiable published sources. That alone would meet WP:BIO 's notability recommendation of "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." (Most of these are not "trivial" articles about her.) And beyond that, it looks like she has minor references indicating possibly notable appearances outside of Idol too. So while most of the other similar articles about these contestents don't have sufficient verification of notability, this does and should be kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, it is. It is a show where people compete for prizes. Textbook definition of a game show, no matter what misnomer is applied to the sub-genre.

<li>The social and cultural impact of these individuals is virtually nil. You might argue that The Idol series of shows has had an impact, but that does not automatically transfer to every failed contestant. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 15:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Very, however that doesn't address the point. Even you refer to the show when talking about the phenomenon, not the contestants. There is no evidence that Ashley Leitao has any notability separate from the show. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 15:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There doesn't have to be. Her "notability" exists because of the show. She's "notable" on her own because of her achievements there. We wouldn't remove <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Faison_3d09.html" title="Donald Faison">Donald Faison</a>'s article because his "notability" is tied directly to <i><a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrubs_%28TV_series%29_0267.html" title="Scrubs (TV series)">Scrubs</a></i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Faison is best known for Scrubs, yes, but he has also starred in several major movies and television shows. His notability is not tied to any one show. Leitao has zero notability outside of being a contestant on Canadian Idol. What little information can be said about her belongs in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Idol_%28Season_3%29_ea33.html" title="Canadian Idol (Season 3)">Canadian Idol (Season 3)</a>, unless she establishes any kind of independant notability. She may do that with her band, but that would be crystal balling at this time. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 16:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Independent notaiblity is established, <i>not</i> that it has to be. That's the point.--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Resolute, so, the difference is the Faison became notable individually when he attained multiple sources of notability? (Not sources like "media references", but sources like "tv show a", "news event b", "tabloid controversy c", etc). The current guidelines don't require this, they require only that multiple published references exist, (I am assuming this means even if they are because of one source of notability). However, this could make sense as a change to the notability guidelines for people... that they must have multiple sources of notability, not just multiple references to one source of notability. For example, mayors would pass this test not automatically, if the only articles about them are because they won the election; they would pass this test after they made their next decision that causes multiple articles to be published containing them as a subject. Again, this isn't part of the guideline yet, so my vote is staying as keep, but it makes much sense to require multiple sources of notability (almost amounting to prolonged notability) for inclusion in Wikipedia. I will introduce this in the discussion on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho McCann</a> 17:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even if you assume the only reason she has received independent published articles is due to her being on Idol, and even if you assume Idol is "just a game show", that still is enough to meet notability guidelines. Articles about people who are solely notable for being on a game show are allowed, provided they receive multiple published sources. Otherwise we wouldn't have <a href="../../../g/a/m/Category%7EGame_show_contestants_2bdc.html" title="Category:Game show contestants">Category:Game show contestants</a>, which is mainly to handle articles about people who are only notable for having been on a game show. Additional coverage outside of multiple published articles about her being on Idol is therefore icing on the cake and not actually mandatory. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I would suggest that outside of the local paper article on her, all of the coverage she has recieved is trivial, and incidental. The articles are about Canadian Idol, she just happens to get mentioned for being that weeks loser. While it is poorly defined at present, I would suggest that the "notability is not newsworthiness" caveat of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> would apply: just because she was in the news does not make her notable. I could find multiple, independent articles on every violent criminal in North America, but that hardly makes them all notable. The problem here is that the hype and popularity of the Idol series of programs is creating unwarranted focus on individuals who otherwise wouldnt merit any kind of mention. There is no reason why these minute little bio's of singers that contain very little other than the songs they sang on the show can't be left in the season articles for foo Idol. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 19:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Per the article, it is just opening, so the article could be recreated in the future if there is adequate independent reliable coverage. It claims to be the largest shopping center in the former Soviet Republics, but the size is not given in square meters. The article sounds almost like a Babelfish machine translation. Maybe a shopping center fan will help out and look up sources and rewrite it.

<p>It's an email based service. Here is an example of one of his releases Press Release</p>
<p>First, concerning the temperatures: The frigid Arctic air that has gripped our region over the past few days is, whether you like it or not, on its way out, and replacing it will be more seasonable temperatures--highs in the mid 30s and lows near the 20-degree mark.</p>
<p>In terms of precipitation--well, there's little reason to celebrate. The jet stream trough remains positioned just a bit too far east to permit any significant winter storms; instead, all we'll get is the occasional Alberta clipper that delivers a dusting of the white stuff.</p>
<p>This weather pattern, however, may change in the not-too-distant future . . .</p>
<p>As of now, we're tracking two potential winter storms, one on the 13th and one on the 16th. Now these systems are still forming over the Pacific ocean, so whether or not they'll even impact our area is exceptionally questionable, thus any attempts to estimate their exact paths or calibers would be hugely inappropriate, to say the least.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, more details will emerge over the remainder of the week. We'll keep you updated . . .</p>
<p>Next press release on Sunday; please stay tuned.</p>
<p>skibumj12 Weather Service</p>
<p>As you can see from the above reference, the <i>Service</i> does indeed exist. Since it is not acclaimed much by those not subscribed to it, one should not expect Google results.</p>

The fact remains, you have no viable support to disprove Jake Felton and his legacy's existence. Because of this lack of evidence, deleting this article would only result in the deprivation of many Wiki readers to learn about a great, young thinker. It only seems just to allow the article to remain so the knowledge of his excellency can spread, and once such excellency does spread, concrete sources can be provided for you naysayers. magicdan25 04:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Magicdan, this is the wrong way around. Wikipedia does not exist to advance people's careers or bring "dark horses" to the public's attention, but rather to document the already known.

<dd>Just a judgement call. I deleted stuff that was <i>obviously</i> a hoax. Bare biographical detail is not, and there has already been an assertion that the skibum thing exists.

<li><i>no substantial proof that this is a hoax</i>? Really? So a 15-year-old founding a weather forecast system with "a near 99% accuracy" (a statistic which would be unlikely even if he were a professional weather forecaster) doesn't seem a little bit odd to you? Not the fact that his mentor is one Hildegard von Bingen, who died in 1179 and very probably never met a golf course architect of either gender in her life? Not the fact that he's editing an essay by an author who (according to another contributor to this discussion) doesn't seem to exist? Not the fact that his novel bears an uncanny similarity in title to a very well-known book which already exists? Not the fact that his forthcoming dissertation is on a topic which comes very close to being nonsensical? Not the fact that his "grammar" is praised to the highest heavens and nothing else? Simply put, there's no substantial (or insubstantial) proof that this is anything but an increasingly obvious and increasingly tiresome hoax. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He plays a major character on <i>Neighbours</i>, and IMDB is an <i>very</i> unreliable source to use as regards how many episodes he has appeared in.

<li><b>Keep</b> He is very well known in Australia - he has featured in almost every Neighbours episode since he started in 2005 - he has appeared on other television shows including 'Thank god you're here', 'Australia's Brainiest' (quiz show), 'Ready Steady Cook' - he was nominated for a Logie for Best New Talent - Male (top television awards show in Australia). He has featured on numerous magazine covers. He is very well-recognised in Australia. (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I wish both Idol and Neighbours would go away, but there are a lot of dull people who enjoy Neighbours - enough to make regular actors notable. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 04:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<p>A good article, but certainly not one suitable for Wikipedia. It's a great example of something better for a video game Wiki and/or fansite. What's next to show up: list of single player features? A merge into Xbox 360 was suggested, but people don't seem to want it. For good reason: it would bloat the Xbox 360 article alot. But this article certainly isn't something that needs to exist here. It's a good resource that should be on a video game wiki. Many systems have multiplayer features and games, it doesn't justify making list pages of all the information here. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 06:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Contested prod. Lacks a main article for the church itself, so a separate history page seems excessive. The church itself may not be notable enough for its own page. It's not apparent what is notable about the church in the page itself, and the references in the given sources may not be non-trivial or independent. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaligron_d32d.html" title="User:Saligron">Saligron</a> 06:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>And before anyone asks "What about Bolak?", I point out that there are (that a few minutes' research turns up) at least three different translations of the Lord's Prayer into Bolak. <a href="http://langmaker.com/bolakoverview.htm" class="external text" title="http://langmaker.com/bolakoverview.htm" rel="nofollow">Apparently</a>, this translation is <i>not</i> the one that can be found in <i>La Langue Bleue Bolak</i>, but is <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-bolak.html" class="external text" title="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-bolak.html" rel="nofollow">someone else's copyrighted translation</a>.

<dd><b>Keep</b> - note correction that it's the largest in its circuit, and third largest LCMS church in Los Angeles (out of 27); also, Lutheran churches in the U.S. tend to be under 400 members (this one is larger than average for its LCMS district). In addition, Lutheran churches use congregational governance (each congregation is independent of the synod), which means that synod sources/materials count as an independent source. There are other ways in which the church qualifies as being notable, though they aren't in the article currently; there's a strong music program which has received coverage in local press, and a notable external mural has also been covered locally. (There are also a few notable members who have their own WP articles, some of whom are significantly involved in church programs - though I'm not sure how much external sourcing would be available to mention this.) I've added some other notes in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Holy_Cross_Lutheran_Church_%28Atwater%2C_California%29_9053.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Holy Cross Lutheran Church (Atwater, California)">deletion proposal</a> for another congregation; I don't think it's advisable to delete articles in an area that Wikipedia doesn't yet cover very well, even when they are still stubby. The article for <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_180a.html" title="Venice, Los Angeles, California">Venice</a> itself is already 31K, so I don't think merging is ideal; adding material to that article regarding every local church and religious group would soon result in moves to split off new articles again. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 20:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> - The first link is the official site, so I don't think it matters much whose server supports it. I agree that the article needs better referencing, but I would note that there are less than three dozen articles for Lutheran churches right now (see <a href="../../../l/u/t/Category%7ELutheran_churches_f9ef.html" title="Category:Lutheran churches">Category:Lutheran churches</a>) – only 24 in the U.S., and 11 for LCMS congregations (out of 6000 churches); I think some leeway might be allowed before we start deleting articles too quickly. I believe it's inadvisable to delete an article when it's one of the better ones in its subject area; patience is useful. Conceding the need for better referencing (I think it's virtually certain that there's been reasonable coverage of this church in its local press over 50 years), this is clearly one of the most substantial articles for a U.S. Lutheran church, and one of the few with more than one photo. WP:CHURCH is still in the draft stages (and is only a proposed guideline anyway), so I don't think its standards can yet be used as the primary basis for deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 19:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> as author of the article, I can vouch for there being newspaper articles for the church, about its history, involvement with city programs, and other characteristics. When I return to Atwater where the church is located this summer, I can add the references for much of the information from these newspaper articles. The rest of the information comes from historical records from within the church. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 20:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The nominator may not realise that WP:CHURCH has changed significantly - the guideline has expanded to include more categories for inclusion. I'm only a very narrow vote for merge at present (basically the lack of references) and I think it would be a waste to delete the article — are you saying the size of the church is significant for the local area or that the church would satisfy one of the WP:CHURCH categories? If it does and references is the only problem, I'll willingly change my vote to keep pending you finding the references. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 23:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>comment It only fails WP:WEB if you think the WCCA is a non-notable award. As a 2006 winner and a 2007 finalist, those two items by themselves establish notability. Add in some third-party coverage (Editor and Publisher may or may not be reliable? That would be news to the entire newspaper industry) and you have an article that should be kept. For reference, the sad AfD debate on the WCCA is here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> with the result being seven votes to keep, three to delete and the final result being a delete.

<p>Keep this entry in Wikipedia: Paul Southworth has been creating web entertainment for nearly a decade under the previous comic, "Krazy Larry". The comic is not fake, nor is the artist (I have signed artwork and I fed him once). This is art, this is good work and it should have an entry as any major web comic would. There is no formal peer review process here nor is there any special reason why web comics should be purged, so I can't even see the motivation. Save everybody! pseydtonne 15:41, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>keep</b> I think that considering that Ugly Hill meets the requirements of "notability" (in quotes because those requirements are incredibly open to intepretation and opinion) then the burdeon is on the nominating party to show why the comic was even nominated in the first place.

<p><b>Keep</b> Odd that this happens on the heels of Brad Giugar's deletion controversy as well. Mr. Southworth is, in fact, a published author and has been a web cartoonist for quite a while now.

<li>This is a <b>summary reply</b> to some of the less ridiculous of the above comments. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires substantial coverage by multiple reliable independent sources.

<li>Ah, the smell of deleting stubs in the morning. Joy. Y'know, before the web notability guidelines were turned into subjective mush, this article would have passed with flying colors. The comic is published and syndicated, and it is a siginificant search term on Google with over 81,000 hits. Certainly, you are correct in that if someone decided to make an article about one of the collections that have been published, it might not meet the notability requirements for published literature; however, a webcomic is most certainly a different medium.</li>
<li>It also is of interest to note the rather interesting bias of the administrator who deleted the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards. Among other things, he says that the Times is not a notable source?!? Well, now, I would hardly call that particular paper non-notable. Hmm. Of course, I would say that your conduct in this matter has not been perfect. I can excuse abuse of AfD; after all, older accounts than yours have been guilty of much worse. I am more than slightly annoyed that {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7EComicscene_6d36.html" title="Template:Comicscene">Comicscene</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../w/e/b/Template%7EWebcomicepisode_631e.html" title="Template:Webcomicepisode">Webcomicepisode</a>}} do not contain a satisfactory fair use for you; they are sufficient for all of the other comics on Wikipedia. (Of course, as it goes, this last point no longer matters; I have obtained a more permissive license for an updated image.)</li>
<li>Two wordy paragraphs full of ridiculous, half-baked, inscrutable text written by a slightly deranged man with a penchant for strange words should always merit a third such paragraph, which is the idea behind this particularly self-referential topic sentence. At any rate, although it would be my opinion that this article, and many like it, are worthy of encyclopedic inclusion, it obviously falls to the wielders of the almighty mop to make that decision, and my rantings are largely irrelevant because, as I stated before, I post under a declaration of <i>No vote</i>. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostAwesomeDude_d9b9.html" title="User:MostAwesomeDude">MostAwesomeDude</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MostAwesomeDude_a591.html" title="Special:Contributions/MostAwesomeDude">Be excellent</a> / <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMostAwesomeDude_4218.html" title="User talk:MostAwesomeDude">Party on, dudes!</a> 23:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I was beaten to making this reply because I was distracted by shiny objects, but feel that I should still write it. The WCCA deletion is in no way uncontested. It was done on a single admin's not-all-that-convincing opinion after a 7-4 vote for keep, with all delete votes cast before the article was sourced further. I'm taking it to DRV as soon as I can get a full night of rest to ensure that I'm up for the task, and currently intend to do so tomorrow.<br />
Furthermore, even without an article the WCCA's significance is not null and void. They're still a prominent part of the field - a field that, as has often been noted in AfDs, by its very nature receives press in the older media, the traditional standard of notability. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 01:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ah, I appear to have misread the log. I thought I saw your name next to some rather collusive deletions. Since that isn't the case, I will indeed believe that this nomination is good faith, even if I do not agree with the philosophy that spawned it. Also, Image:Uglyhill.jpg is obsolete, although not in a manner that permits me to tag it for speedy deletion, so further discussion on it is superfluous. It has been listed on IfD. Also, notability is inclusive, not exclusive. A webcomic should be held up against (the increasingly useless) <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and also against <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a> if it is in print; however, since the article's subject is the comic itself and not the website on which it is hosted, it logically follows that any comic that is distributed over the web but is notable only because of its appearance in print should still have an article. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostAwesomeDude_d9b9.html" title="User:MostAwesomeDude">MostAwesomeDude</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MostAwesomeDude_a591.html" title="Special:Contributions/MostAwesomeDude">Be excellent</a> / <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMostAwesomeDude_4218.html" title="User talk:MostAwesomeDude">Party on, dudes!</a> 01:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I couldn't care less, either way, whether or not you block or ban them. But, do not simply discount someone's words, especially when they are acting in good faith. While it may indeed be inappropriate to endorse "stuffing the ballot box," as it were, it is even worse, especially for an established, seasoned editor, to forget to assume good faith on the part of newcomers.

<li><b>ohhhh boy</b> I like (read: hate) that any and all proof that Ugly Hill does meet notability requirements is then put up for deletion or just ignored. Hey Sandstein, if you have such a strong case then why not present it? Show us some non-subjective proof that Ugly Hill deserves to be deleted. As for the "meatpuppet" crap, how else would we know that the page is in trouble? Believe it or not not everyone feels the need to keep tabs on Wikipedia 24/7. Of course most of us got here from Ugly Hill's website. We read the COMIC for UH news, not it's wiki page. Lessthankate</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Why should it be deleted? I thought the idea of an encyclopedia was to contain MORE knowledge, not to censor it based on the odd opinions of a few people with nothing more constructive to do with their time than quibble over the internet. I could point you to several articles about insignificant little towns with no information which is not available from the 2000 census-- a mere demographic sketch of a few score people, with no mention of any history, not local traditions, nor attractions, nor any other colorful information.

<p><b>Query</b> Was the Ugly Hill Wikientry first given an opportunity to verify itself by placing the appropriate tags in the article itself? By this I mean, were the less drastic options of first demanding sourcing for the article, which by reference would then help prove if the comic constitutes Wikipedia's requirements for notability? I am not an established Wikieditor, and so am only posting this as an anonymous query out of curiosity. It seems to me that if there is this much backlash over webcomics, as has been the case for both Evil Inc. and Ugly Hill, then a more appropriate course of action would be to first allow editors an opportunity to prove notability by requesting additional verification for sources of the article. 72.178.166.5 Anonymous Me</p>

<p><b>Weak delete</b> self-publication is not a criterion of notability, anyone can pay their 500 bucks and get published via self-publishing, if I had the money I could publish 10 volumes consisting of nothing but the letter 'a', that doesn't make me a notable author.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Apart from the fact that the comic did indeed win an independent award of notice, it is definitely not a random, short-lived project. So on top of fulfilling at least one criteria for notability, there is also a strong interest in the user base. While I agree that sending hordes of people to mindlessly vote and create SPAs for it on top would not be acceptable, I can not see an interested party informing others about the AfD to be bad in any way. As Shuttleworth is pointing out, people do not check the Wikipedia article every day so how else should they know about the AfD in the first place? -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichiH_720c.html" title="User:RichiH">RichiH</a> 10:32, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> I am insulted on some of the comments about meatpuppetry - if you need to inform people about impending deletions - it is a valid to put the word out. I have been an wikipedia editor for quite a while, and were it not for the notice on the comic's home page I would have missed this discussion. Ugly hill is notable for a) longevity, b) publication by a serious label, c) nomination for awards. What is this pogrom that some wikipedia editors have against webcomics?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I had three things to contribute to the discussion on why this article should be kept, all under notability. First has to do with two guest apperances. Paul Southworth has been a speaker at two conventions. One this year at Vericon <a href="http://www.vericon.org/speakers.html" class="external free" title="http://www.vericon.org/speakers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vericon.org/speakers.html</a> and last year at the New York Comic Con. The 2006 information for New York has been taken down, though if you search google new york comic con paul southworth, the result will come back, but the page is empty. The reason that Paul Southworth was asked to be on a panel at NY and at Vericon is his webcomic work, which includes Ugly Hill. To me, that argues that both con organizations thought the work Paul Southworth was doing is notable. To me that means Ugly Hill is notable. The third piece of information is from a press release from Keenspot, the former web publisher of Ugly Hill. Keenspot had it's comics, including Ugly Hill, published in newspapers. Here is the press release <a href="http://www.keenspot.com/comicspage/" class="external free" title="http://www.keenspot.com/comicspage/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keenspot.com/comicspage/</a>. This was considered of significant note that newsarama, a well know comic site, did note this press release as well. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediAutobot_53a9.html" title="User:JediAutobot">JediAutobot</a> 15:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>- I'm not a huge fan of this webcomic, but as per the argument of the author being invited by major comic conventions to discuss webcomics, plus the WCCA award, plus the length of time that this comic has been around and PLUS the vast support from the webcomic community, I think this article should be kept. There is an obvious animosity and bias with some of the Wikipedia editors against webcomics. This concerns me. And as I read through the deletion article discussions, I find that it's the almost <b>exact same few people</b> vouching for these deletions. I won't name any names, but I feel that this wave of new deletions is the result of a small group of people with strong-headed views to a subjective guideline. There <b>needs</b> to be more serious discussion regarding the inclusion of webcomics into Wikipedia. Something has to change, I think. Having this bias toward webcomics isn't going to make Wikipedia more legitimate and it's only going to make people angrier.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Very clearly meets the standards for notability on account of publications, awards, and third party recognition. I will also second the above "SS Slacker"'s concern that there appear to be a small number of editors engaged in a personal vendetta against webcomics, e.g., NetOracle. In accordance with NetOracle's arguments <i>for</i> the deletion of various smaller webcomics, I will also point out that UglyHill's Alexa rank indicates a reasonable amount of traffic. I am particularly concerned in seeing that NetOracle has been invoking argument by Alexa only in such cases as it would seem to aid the cause of deleting webcomic articles, as this is one of several indications that leave me unable to credibly assume that NetOracle is acting in good faith. This is far from my first edit, and my contributions to Wikipedia have not included anything related to webcomics before this week. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment/Observation</b> This AFD is getting a lot of attention. Any webcomic news site worth its salt is reporting this. Of course, that doesn't give much argument against the whole "meat-puppetry" chants, but it's not like they're saying "cast your vote!" because everybody <i>knows</i> it's not a democracy. At least it's not a democracy when there are more keep votes than delete votes. When there ARE more delete votes, it seems to be totally super democratic. The delete-prone editors need to be at least consistent with their arguments because the general outside observation is that those who have this vendetta against webcomics flip-flop their methods of determination.</p>
<p>This debate is such a big deal and this comic is so freaking notable that I think anybody notable in webcomics is watching this. This is not "fancruft", another term I see thrown around. I don't think even half the people here are real "fans". I mean, I like this comic, as probably a lot of people here do. But I think this AFD debate represents the last chance Wikipedia has for good faith regarding Webcomics, not just to save this article.</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>, and nominate Wikipedia's FUBARed definition of "notability" for deletion. It's textbook non-notable! It's not verifiable, nobody's heard of it outside the small community of diehard Wiki-editors who invoke it at every opportunity to the consternation and mystification of everybody else. It's like jargon had sex with fancruft, and this is their baby: wikipedia "notability."</p>
<p>This sick, sad cycle of things being nominated for deletion based on lack of notability... and somebody sees it and then attempts to establish notability (which, in the real world, "having been noted by a large number of people" does establish), and then the mere fact that the rest of the world has a different (and more relevant) definition of notability than etymological abortion that wikipedia has adopted is used as an excuse to ignore actual attempts to provide verifiable "notability." The sickest part is, in the above debate, it looks (at a glance, anyway), as if the passage which mentions that "meatpuppetry" can't help but negate neutrality is being cited to excuse the fact that people are reacting vindictively to the "meatpuppetry". For the record: "meatpuppetry" is also mystifying jargon to people who aren't part of the die-hard wiki community, and it only makes the cycle worse when people who attempt to establish ACTUAL notability (not wikipedia's non-notable definition of notability), they're greeted with a word that can really only be taken as some sort of vague insult and words to the effect that their opinions don't matter.</p>
<p>What <b>PURPOSE</b> does it serve to say, about any topic, that "This doesn't look notable. Please show us that it is, or it'll be deleted."... and then acting surprised when you get flooded by people saying, "Uh, this is notable. I and many other people have noted it."... and then saying in response, "Sorry, you're just a meatpuppet. Doesn't count."? It's like this process is <b>DESIGNED</b> to create this kind of situation in order to create endorphins in the brains of the elitists who get off on the fact that they've spent so much time learning the jargon and policies and procedures of Wikipedia while the crude unwashed masses of "meatpuppets" haven't.</p>
<p>Jesus Dead Jew on a Stick Christ... Wikipedia at large should either come up with a word besides "notable" that means what is actually being asked for (or just drop the "notability" requirement and focus on verifiability, as after all, the requirement that things be "notable" just leads into the fact that such "notability" results in verifiable sources), or stop acting surprised when the public replies to questions of notability by showing that the subject actually is notable.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's quickly turning into every hilariously bad satire of an impenetrible bureaucracy whose rules have evolved completely out of touch with the public interest they're supposed to serve... <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandra_Erin_1ed2.html" title="User:Alexandra Erin">Alexandra Erin</a> 12:27, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, thank you for illustrating my point, Hbws. Neither Ugly Hill nor webcomics are my particular ax to grind... not even that familiar with Ugly Hill (but then, anecdotal evidence about popularity's got nothing to do with notability, right?)... it's just an illustrative example of something I find to be badly wrong. I'm assuming I'm one of the "external people" you're referring to. Hey, you disagree with any one thing I said, feel free to speak up and dispute it... the rumor is, this is a place for discussion.&#160;:P I've read Wikipedia's policies. I've followed numerous AfD's. The problems I see aren't the procedures so much as how they are carried out, and how the use of jargon (or non-standard definitions of non-jargo words) by wikipedia at large guarantees the creation of situations like this. There's a school of thought which says the working definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. The more "notability" wikipedia achieves in and of itself, the more often its peculiar jargon is going to create conflicts with "external people" (though the very idea that somebody can be "external" to public discourse on a resource that anybody can edit is strange to me.) Is it sensible to expect the entire world to bend to Wikipedia's linguistic quirks? Maybe this isn't the best ground on which to raise this particular issue, in your mind, but I find the deeper one gets into the policy discussion pages, the more one runs into the impenetrible bureaucratic entrenchment of "This is the way things are done, so this is the way things are done." and the "what Wikipedia is/is not" listings being invoked to shut down or shoot down any new ideas on handling these things regardless of their actual merit. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandra_Erin_1ed2.html" title="User:Alexandra Erin">Alexandra Erin</a> 19:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I should also add wild accusations about some kind of a "conspiracy against webcomics" to the pile of things that aren't really helpful here. Articles get deleted from Wikipedia for not meeting policies/guidelines on notability/verifiability every day. Today, one guy decided to go through the category for webcomics, and tag the stuff that stuck out. Tomorrow, it'll be the category on egyptologists, or voice regognition software, or cross-bred dogs. You just don't know that because a) you aren't interested in egyptologists/voice recognition programs/dog breeding, and thus won't notice when someone decides to take a look at that category and b) you haven't done much of anything on the site before, and thus don't have enough experience with the deletion process as a whole to recognize the difference between the usual order of business and an honest-to-God conspiracy. This is one of the reasons why&#160;!votes from anonymous users and single-purpose accounts aren't usually given much weight in deletion debates: You aren't an impartial participant, and you don't understand the rules of the game. If you want to have the article kept, the best thing you can do is improve it. Are the sources good? Great. Make them EVEN BETTER. Make it so good that the mere suggestion that it should be deleted will produce gales of laughter from here to Timbuktu, and that Pete Abrams cries himself to sleep at night because Sluggy's page can't hold a candle to this one. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Even the most structured bureaucracy will give rise to narrow-mindedness and slant as long as there is a strict division in power which is insurmountable. On Wikipedia, the cabal is a group of administrators who share a set of traits: Failure to assume good faith, emphasis on power, belief in irredeemable vandals, overly broad categorization of non-vandal edits into the umbrella of vandalism, overwhelmingly deletionist feelings, and failure to recognize bad faith in other administrators. These administrators, although they do not always act in concert, compose the cabal. Denial of this cabal does not negate its existence. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostAwesomeDude_d9b9.html" title="User:MostAwesomeDude">MostAwesomeDude</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MostAwesomeDude_a591.html" title="Special:Contributions/MostAwesomeDude">Be excellent</a> / <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMostAwesomeDude_4218.html" title="User talk:MostAwesomeDude">Party on, dudes!</a> 06:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been noticing and been hearing of various webcomic's entries in Wikipedia being deleted over the past several weeks, not simply on one day. In addition, believe it or not but this is NOT the only wiki website with a deletion process. I may not have contributed much on Wikipedia but that is because my primary focus concerning the internet is the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI, and there is a separate wiki (FFXIclopedia) created explicitly for it. Thus I do not generally have anything of worthy input to contribute to Wikipedia, unless for some reason Wikipedia feels a need to request the level of detail and thoroughness concerning Final Fantasy XI as is provided by FFXIclopedia. In addition I am not adding to the page because I do not read the webomic in question, nor do I have any meaningful input on the article itself. As I have stated I DO belive that it meets criterion for notability, as has been stated by others on this AfD page. Finally, I have made no claims or accusations -or wild accusations for that matter- about conspiracy. There does seem to be something of a vendetta, though. And as a personal note, this is not a single-purpose account and I feel a bit put off by insinuations that it is. They seem rather like active editors saying to occaisional editors "go away, this is our club." I make no claim of knowing your mind, Hit bull, but that is how it comes across. --Volkai 20:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a relative newcomer to editing WP but have been using it as a source for a couple of years. This is the first place I look for information about any subject. As a user, I expect to be able to find information about the things that interest me as well as a wonderful springboard for discovering things I didn't realise would interest me (the front page article on a professional wrestler last week introduced me to a whole world I knew nothing about). Web comics are a remarkable "new" (say, 10 years old or so) cultural phenomenon and it seems from the discussion above that the definition of Notability needs to be reviewed as regards online phenomena. I understand the comic has many thousands of readers and a quick Google search shows tens of thousands of references to Ugly Hill. Many of these are obviously incidental but there are numerous reviews by people who are part of the webcomics community and the comic received an award from that community (and has been nominated again). I think there needs to be some serious re-thinking of the notability criteria if Ugly Hill does not fit. From a user's point of view, I want the encyclopedia to help me explore this emerging cultural phenomenon in the same way that it helps me discover information about other things I know nothing about.

<li><b>Keep</b> - One of the main reasons I've seen mentioned not to keep the article is because it lacks "notability." Notability can be roughly defined as significant.

<p>NOTICE:Rowan Tink From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Rowan Tink is a former Australian Special Air Service officer whose identity was widely publicised after he was awarded the United States Bronze Star Medal for his role commanding 150 SAS troopers in Afghanistan, notably during Operation Anaconda. The medal was presented to Lieutenant-Colonel Tink by Major General Frank Hagenbeck at a farewell ceremony at Bagram on 24 July 2002.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>According to the above article on Mr. Tink, having a Bronze Star is sufficient to qualify for Wikipedia.org. Therefore, Mr. Wimberly more than qualifies, right?</p>

Shoessss, what about the Bronze Star? Look over the Bronze Star lists on Wikipedia, such as that of Rowan Tink. See if Mr. Wimberly is not in the same category. Most of these war heroes are unknown to the general public outside their hometowns. If you have other POWs who should be written up, then write them up. Don't go after a WWII POW because he lacks "notability."</p>
<p>Also, consider some of the "popular culture" people on Wikipedia. If there is room for some of those, there is room for Mr. Wimberly.</p>

<li>From the XPeRT Keyboard inventor: The XPeRT Keyboard layout was invented as one option to free us from Qwerty. The Dvorak keyboard is another good option, but it is harder to learn, while maintaining Qwerty speeds too. Yes, not all frequent letters are on the home row on XPeRT, but that is not the dominant typing speed factor, proven to be key striking by alternate hands (opposing digraphs), as also incorporated by Dvorak. A study of keyboard patents and design confirms all of this. Note that the XPeRT Keyboard definition at the Wikipedia site is technical material - it includes no product claims or marketing data. (Just as an aside, the reviews and awards are not false. Go ahead &amp; try it.)

Addition to Feb 2007 discussion</p>
<p>The XPeRT Keyboard website has now been repaired, all images are now public ones and a single private image was removed on amicable terms with the owner. It was always present in reduced format. Never abandoned. See www.xpertkeyboard.com.</p>
<p>The main independent source of data for the XPeRT Keyboard is the Dvorak keyboard patent of 1936, at the USPTO database. The Dvorak patent contains all of the digraph (key sequence) data referenced by the XPeRT website, and the XPeRT US Patent #7,137,749 of Nov 2006, title: "A Faster Practical Keyboard".</p>
<p>One of the dependent sources of data flagged in the article was a list of frequency of use of letters in English writing. There are dozens of those out there, ... and a few digraph statistics other than Dvorak too. I haven't had time to find the links yet (swamped in paid work) and WOULD LIKE UNTIL MID-MARCH 2007 to locate and include those independent References.</p>
<p>As before, I did not start this web-page and there were several KEEP votes, no DELETE votes, before this "restart" page, which cites need for references, which can be provided, given a little breathing room (And what is an AfD anyway?)</p>
<p>THANKS, inventor of XPeRT keyboard, M.E.-E.E., xpertkeyboard@telus.net.</p>

<p>Contested PROD. Band fails <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">the notability critera for bands and musicians</a> as far as I can tell. They have released one album on Disconcert Music, which itself does not seem notable, although I don't know enough about death metal to judge the label. Only claim to notability in the article appears to be that the band has played with notable artists, which in itself is insufficient. GassyGuy 08:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>the label itself as only been active for a few months, but it is run in part by singer of the established band Quo Vadis www.quovadis.qc.ca</p>

<li>The appropriate guidelines have been outlined, and this is falling afoul of them. As far as I know, we don't use webzines as sources (I could be wrong), and selling "over 300 albums" is really not at all notable, as most notable releases sell far more than that. I would also recommend reading <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">this guideline</a>, which recommends against creating articles about subjects with which you are closely affiliated.

<dd>The article doesn't mention sexual attraction. I was distracted by the paraphilia article. But my vote doesn't change. Maybe phytophila does have more potential - I found academic references for phytophilia, still using a different meaning then the article's though. As a quality reflected in the positive influence of green environments on human behaviour. Here's one academic mentioning (though it's just an abstract of a paper): <a href="http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/conferences/past%20conferences/salamanca-abs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/ishe/conferences/past%20conferences/salamanca-abs.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> ---<a href="../../../s/l/u/User%7ESluzzelin_c586.html" title="User:Sluzzelin">Sluzzelin</a> 11:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Week Keep</b> The WWC tag team championship sugests marginal notability. If we go by analogy with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s sportpeople guidelines (though I know they don't apply by their terms), he would easily make it as a competitor and champion in the top wrestling promotions in Puerto Rico. Notability as an actor is less clear since there are no sources for a fan-base. Or indeed for any of this.

<p>Largely autobiographical article. I started on this by cleaning up puff/CV type stuff, multiple links to subject's website, and the like. While the number of "sources" may appear impressive, they are either primary or mention the subject's name (that at best, I removed several sources which did not mention the subject whatsoever). Also nominating Michael B. Neff, a redirect to this page. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 14:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A cursory examination of the comments left by "Seraphimblade" in the article history will demonstrate the extent of bias the reviewer brings to the process. He makes outright false statements, e.g., pretends not to see that an article about the subject in question even mentions his name (Poets and Writers article or New York Times) then fails to admit what the subject is known best for, WebdelSol.Com, is even relevant. Links to other sources would show the subject as editor (on masthead, e.g.) but reviewer fails to see this. Solneffmike 23:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No paranoia, Mr. Copy Editor, just facts. You're intentionally failing to recognize the New York Times and Poets and Writers," etc. as "actual reliable sources", therefore, playing the ignorance card works for you. But in fact, you are not ignorant, you know better. What we have here, ostensibly, is an act of hostility. You and yours have been insulting and unprofessional right from the beginning. Like good cops, you'll never admit you are wrong, only dig in and continue to accuse regardless of contrary evidence. Just take the page off and be done with these immature mocking games.

That doesn't sound like the act of "good cops", but never mind, Mr. Kettle, I have a call for you on line 4 from Mr Pot: <a href="../../../k/e/t/WP%7EKETTLE_583e.html" title="WP:KETTLE">he says you're black</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 22:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't understand how the author of this article about himself, who is arguing about the deletion of this article he wrote himself about himself, can reasonably talk about anyone else being biased. If you look at <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESolneffmike_18b1.html" title="User talk:Solneffmike">User talk:Solneffmike</a> as well as <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">User talk:Calton</a>, you'll see that despite multiple clearly understandable attempts to explain basic wikipedia concepts like <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>, the author seems unable or unwilling to learn about editing. Instead, he defends himself with bizarre and unfounded mentions of other people he knows who advertise here, but whom he refuses to name in some attempt at attaining moral high ground (despite the fact that he is the only one who keeps bringing it up). More seriously, he asked Calton what his name is in real life (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Solneffmike&amp;diff=104622325&amp;oldid=104522291|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Solneffmike&amp;diff=104622325&amp;oldid=104522291|here" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>) in what I interpret to be a potentially threatening tone, which, while possibly harmless, I don't feel is ever acceptable. He also blanked the page in an attempt to "delete" it, which he has no power to do. All of this indicates a trend toward behavior that is disruptive and an unwillingness to just sit back and listen to people who have thousands more edits than him. I like to assume good faith and not be mean to newcomers, but you can't walk into a new situation and start telling everybody right and wrong. So, delete as vanity. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="black">Tractor</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETractorkingsfan_0b20.html" title="User talk:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="green">kings</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tractorkingsfan_5bb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tractorkingsfan"><font color="red">fan</font></a> 07:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Week Keep</b> despite obvious conflict of interest in creation. It needs better independant sources (the only real one is the NY Times thing which is clearly not <i>about</i> the subject of the article) but there is a clear and convincing assertion of notability and sources could probably be found. -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 14:48, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - For an article about Michael Neff, it has too little about him and too much about his website, which raises concerns of attempts at self-promotion (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Most of the references talk about the website and not the person so what are they doing here?. What's the article about? if the website itself is notable, the article should focus on that, and be moved/renamed. If enough sourceable information can be found about Michael and the article is significantly revamped and refocused, it might make the cut. Right now it doesn't. Also, Solneffmike certainly sounds like Michael Neff himself; his history indicates he has contributed mostly (all but 2 of his contribs) to Michael Neff and stuff re: edits to the article and this AfD. This should be taken into account as, if the user in question is indeed Michael Neff, it would be a case of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.<a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 19:00, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> You need an assertion of notability to not be speedy deleted, but actual notability to survive AfD. As Neff hasn't been the <i>subject</i> of multiple, reliable independent sources, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 00:23, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It appears to me that we are mixing two subject matters here with this article. Mike Neff himself does not appear to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as there are no reliable independent articles about him as primary subject. More numerous and more prominent hits are about Mike Neff, the <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=00019759" class="external text" title="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=00019759" rel="nofollow">hockey player</a> or <a href="http://www.fastmachines.com/archives/nhra/002383.php" class="external text" title="http://www.fastmachines.com/archives/nhra/002383.php" rel="nofollow">motor-racing crew chief</a>, or <a href="http://www.bullseyenews.com/results2505_moose-int.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bullseyenews.com/results2505_moose-int.html" rel="nofollow">Darts player</a>. There are a number which point to his own website(s), the main one of which which appear to be linked to other authors' websites in a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quid_pro_quo.html" title="Quid pro quo">quid pro quo</a>. However, we are not here to determine the notability of his website. Therefore, references thereto do not count. In any event, for Mr Neff and webdelsol.com, total independence renders it but a <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">self-reference</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> NX Files is an independently produced show out of Orleans, ON Canada. Since the release of it's first episode in November of 2005, it has been viewed in over 54 countries AND has released a Season 1 DVD which has been distributed in many countries including Canada, USA, Norway and Denmark. That being said, this show definitely deserves a wikipedia entry. --Sensei Krush 15:08, 4 February 2007 (UTC) .</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article for NX Files is based on its official website, which should certainly be considered a reliable source. It was largely written by one of the four creaters of NX Files itself, who can obviously be considered an expert on the subject in question, so it is again safe to assert that the content is reliable. The show itself has received attention from the media as well as many different nationalities and the creators' attitude is always very professionnal. NX Files certainly deserves its own Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESun_03_47d2.html" title="User:Sun 03">User:sun_03</a> 15:51, 4 February 2007 (UTC) .

<li><b>keep</b> The NxFiles are internationally viewed in over 50 countries, has it's own websitewww.nxfiles.com and more importantly is an interactive/participatory medium related to martial arts that kids and adults in Ottawa/Orleans, Ontario can be part of. NX Martial Arts is a jiu-jitsu and kick boxing dojo where most the actors from the community train on a weekly basis. They actually released a DVD of their entire first season this past December 2006. I think this kind of project popularizes martial arts as a whole and a web-based show like this one demonstrates an alternative to martial art training when comparing to Ultimate Fighting Championship /UFC. I believe this is beneficial from a parents’ perspective to promote martial arts and the positive influence of the discipline on children. Taking this entry away would only impinge on the greater good of not only the martial art sub-culture, but the community as a whole. Feb 4th, 2007 6:03pm

<li>Prejudiced? I think it's an unreliable source because it's not in English, not because it's a French newspaper. Let's stop the name-calling here and stay on topic.

<ul>
<li>Why does it make it unreliable? Language has nothing to do with this debate. A very respectable French Canadian newspaper interviewed the creators of the show and wrote a very nice article about them. If this is not notable, then what is? Furthermore, the posts here are not sockpupetting, they are fans and students of the show and the dojo who are showing their support. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.101.11.104 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.101.11.104_a8cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.101.11.104">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>My local newspaper wrote an article about a benefit concert in my area, that doesn't make it worthy of <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a>.

<li>I think that fans of the show coming on here and showing their support proves it is notable. I have been working on the page and adding sources from other sites besides the creators site. Again, the normal proceedure for this kind of thing is to add a reference asking for more sources before nominating for deleation. And for the record, I am not a character on this show, just a fan. I also speak french and added the scan of the LeDroit article - for those that dont know LeDroit has national distribution to french speakers, so it is not a local paper. We are discussing a first of its kind here, a Martial Arts Web Series, that also adds to the 'notability' of the article. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClausewitz01_2491.html" title="User:Clausewitz01">Clausewitz01</a> 22:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If wikipedia holds articles for specific genres of entertainment shows such as 'sitcom comedy' and 'reality television' as well as articles on specific shows such as 'Gilmore girls' with articles for each individual characters of the show, I really dont see why NX files can't have it's own space on Wikipedia when it is, as previously mentionned, a Martial Arts Web Series. This is a specific genre that should have its own article and the subsequent articles of the characters should be treated like the characters of any other show like those from the example listed above. User Sun_03 19:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC) .</li>
<li>Here is the article on the LeDroit Webpage (no more scan) and I have changed the sourcing link inside the article. Though I guess you can still go to the scan for the pic. This is the first ever full Martial Arts Webisode series on the net. Others have tried singular episodes, but I have yet to find anyone doing multiple seasons. This is a new genre that will grow with the obvious success of the NX Files. LeDroit is distributed nationally: <a href="http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20061214/CPARTS/612140393&amp;SearchID=73271273466437" class="external text" title="http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20061214/CPARTS/612140393&amp;SearchID=73271273466437" rel="nofollow">LeDroit Article Une série de combat extrême connaît du succès sur Internet</a> And if you are unable to read French, use BabelFish, Canada is a Bilingual country, so everything up here is in both languages. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClausewitz01_2491.html" title="User:Clausewitz01">Clausewitz01</a> 01:30, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here are a couple more 'Notable' links for NX Files.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/t/v/CTV_2c92.html" title="CTV">CTV</a>, a Canadian National news network interviewed the creators for their Tech Now feature, I invite you to watch: (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=U_AIjejn4Wo" class="external autonumber" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=U_AIjejn4Wo" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>So, to sumarize, there are now linked examples to national print and telivison media as well as web-pages that rate internet media, links from other martial arts sites, commenting on the uniqueness and popularity of this online Show. The show has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works, in print, on Telivision and online, whose source is independent of the creators of the show. I will edit the main page to reflect that this is the first of its kind, and 'notable' because of that, an entire Martial Arts series that is webbased. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClausewitz01_2491.html" title="User:Clausewitz01">Clausewitz01</a> 02:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - You can't really use the argument that other pages on similar subjects exist as a reason for keeping; if I started a garage band, made an article, and claimed 'But you have one on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a>!', would that be valid?

<li>Veinor, this is not a garage band, I'd suggest that if you watch the show and you wouldnt make that comparison. There is nothing else like this that is free on the web.

The fact that the NX Files show is an example of a NEW and FIRST application of serial martial-arts action-adventure video entertainment using the Internet has apparently threatened those who are for deletion.<br />
<b>This also brings the entire concept of Wikipedia as a valid and useful phenomena into question.</b> You have a wonderful new idea, cutting edge entertainment, a fact and reality for the producers and their viewers and fans, but you think it's not legitimate? Laughable!

<p>I have clearly done an injustice to the subject, by writing under a name that implies I am she. This is not autobiography, but that clearly is not the only issue here, as MER-C points out that he is dissatisfied as to Verifiability. However following a quick search of Wikipedia, I have found several other entries that are currently unchallenged and they do not appear to have any substanially different or additional verifiable sources then this entry in quesion. I am curious as to why they should be unchallenged and this entry be challenged.</p>

<dd>I will agree with you, Neier, that this election probably <i>will</i> (future tense) receive notable published coverage from independent sources. However, <i>this</i> article fails to provide any of those sources, and in fact looks to be mainly speculation as to the possible future results of the race. My suggestion is delete unless seriously cleaned up, and then if and when better information is actually available consider recreating it down the line with proper sourcing. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:03, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And, that's where we disagree. A bad article should not be deleted. A bad article should be improved, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problem_articles_where_deletion_may_not_be_needed" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">WP:DEL</a>. It seems to me lately, that AFD is being misused for many articles of this type. We aren't here to find articles in need of cleanup; but, to find articles which don't meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requirements of Wikipedia. Even if the article is reduced to "The city of Philadelphia will hold mayoral elections on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">11-06</a>." with a reference link to <a href="http://www.thenextmayor.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.thenextmayor.com/" rel="nofollow">the Philadelphia Daily News page</a>, it would pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 02:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, if the article was reduced to "The city of Philadelphia will hold mayoral elections on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">11-06</a>", that would <i>not</i> meet WP:N, because the information being relayed through the article is quite trivial in nature. To count as a source for WP:N, it must be a <i>non-trivial</i> treatment of the subject. So just listing the date of the election would not count.</dd>
<dd>As far as AFD only being allowed to delete articles that aren't "notable", that is likewise incorrect. Articles that fail to meet policies such as verifiability and original research can certainly be deleted as well. As a <i>courtesy</i>, we normally give articles with insufficient references a chance to improve before deleting them. But articles with no references at all and which aren't likely to receive proper referencing can definitely be deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I beg to differ on meeting verifiability requirements as there is virtually no verification provided in the article. In fact, the article attempts to analyze an election that won't occur for a number of months using information of questionable value and sourcing.

<li><b>Keep</b>. If this was "<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomah%2C_Wisconsin_b63a.html" title="Tomah, Wisconsin">Tomah</a> Mayoral Election, 2007" I'd agree with the nom, but as the US's 5th largest city Philadelphia's race is notable enough.

<li><s><b>Delete unless references provided for verification and to remove bias/OR</b></s> This article has a couple of serious problems. First, it has almost no references within the article aside from "www.thenextmayor.com". The article <i>must</i> provide independent, reliable published sources. Secondly, the article appears to be partly Original Research and possibly slightly biased. For example, the very first sentence says that "the real race (and the next mayor of Philly) will be with the Democratic Party primary which will be held on 2007-05-15," which sounds very suspiciously like a biased political analysis of an election that is still many months away. Finally, it talks about "polls" of questionable value that attempt to predict the result of a future event with no attempt at verification, which breaks <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>. So while I agree in principle that in general articles about mayoral elections <i>might</i> be ok if properly done, this article isn't even close to being properly done and should be deleted unless these issues are addressed. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>P.S. I want to make clear one detail most of the keep comments seem to be overlooking. Even if you assume the election will probably <i>eventually</i> be notable and receive good independent news coverage, those facts must be demonstrated <i>within the article</i>. It is ultimately up to the authors of the article to provide verification of information, demonstrate lack of bias and verification of notability. The article as currently written fails quite badly on all three items, and should therefore be deleted unless seriously improved. Then, if a better article can be written in a couple of months around primary time, when newspapers are dealing with it on a more detailed basis, recreate the article using correcting referencing, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 00:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>delete</b> Every city in the US has mayoral elections every four years or so. To include them all on wikipedia strikes me as extraordinarily silly unless the race has some sort of unique feature or reason for having great encyclopedic merit. Yes Philidelphia is a big city, but there are also lots of big cities in the US, and to include minor political races (face it mayors are the LOWEST elected executive position in the US) If we include this, we also set the precident for including every single congress race (state and federal), county executive, and state offical in the US, a few thousand articles a year for articles of limited merit about which reletively little beyond the obvious can be said without resorting to OR. 129.89.68.218 01:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Andrew, that's definitely a step in the right direction. Based on the cleanup and the fact that the article is starting to include some good references about the upcoming election, I struck out my previous recommendation and am willing to change it to <b>Keep but requires more clean up</b>. Specific things that ought to be cleaned up are linking actual remaining facts in the article to specific references using ref tags (ie footnotes) and the article could probably stand to incorporate some of the published analysis of what are expected to be key political factors in the election. However, those are stylistic concerns, not afd ones, so that sort of thing would be better handled in the article itself and its talk page, not this afd thread. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

He is the most influential underground rapper since when Tupac was underground. He is respected throughout mainstream artists, and he is on his way to becoming a big time artist. He was recently on MTV promoting himself and his music. He also owns his own music label called Strange Music which has several artists signed to it who have or are going to be releasing an album. He has released 8 albums. Just because he isn't popular doesn't mean that he doesn't deserve an entry in Wikipedia, because he does deserve it. Keeping his entry will allow people who do not know about him to get comprehensive information on who he is. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin82485_c109.html" title="User:Kevin82485">kevin82485</a> 21:35, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>Texas High School Football and the individual players who help make the mythos ARE notable, whether or not they make it to the big leagues. Again, in addition to the book "1984 Scots: Team with a Heart: Highland Park Football" I, direct you to look at the book/movie "Friday Night Lights", which is an iconic book/movie about Texas High School Football. None of its individual players made it to the big leagues. in fact, the notabilty comes precisely from the fact that these individual players DON'T make it to the big leagues! This is their and their communities' time to shine. Their significance and notability lies in the stories they provide the small communities, the clutch plays, and the clutch players. At least look at the books/movie before weighing in on the lack of notability of Texas High School Football and the players such as Clark Kennington who helped create the mythos. Incidentally, this person was mentioned in feature articles in both the Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald, the two major daily papers for Dallas, Texas.User:Clarkenn 10:40 8 February 2007 (CST)

<li>True, but somebody has to advocate the point. I direct you to carefully read the Wikipedia entry "Friday Night Lights", before rushing to judgment. The point I'm making is the notability comes in the obscurity associated with the mythos. No-names rise above themselves and provide moments of meaning for their communities through remarkable plays in important games. Finally, as an aside the person did receive numerous accolades in high school, was heavily recruited by major colleges, and did receive a college football scholarship to play at Duke University, playing one season before quiting, but this is not the point of the notability.([User:Clarkenn]) 9:21, 9 February 2007 (CST)

<li>Clark is right that there is a lot of mythos surrounding high school football in Texas.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Texas high school football has been covered daily by the Dallas Morning News since 1981 and they dedicated two pages of the Sports section to it during the season. Websites like Rivals.com and Scout.com are dedicated to following high school football recruits. For those not in Texas, Florida or California, you might not recognize the signifigance. Clark in particular epitomized the high school football star as a definitive playmaker for the 1984 Scots. He is noted signifigantly in the book and is a certainly a local legend. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.226.246.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.226.246.130_f199.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.226.246.130">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As one of the people the nominator asked for input from re: this article, I did some research yesterday on the subject (sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, IZAK) and came up with a goodly amount of marginally interesting information, none of which supports the claims of the article in question.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: BTW, to clarify, it's incredibly difficult to connect any of what I've read about groups referred to as "Nazuraiun" or "Nazareun" or "Nazaraioun" with the subject matter of this article precisely because, without wanting to do <i>too</i> much to denigrate the <u>writing style</u> of the author, the article reads like a laughable drunken (?) joke. To those unfamiliar with Jewish Christians, or Christian Judaizers, or even [to be polite] "deranged" Christians who lay bizarre claim to "connections" with the Davidic dynasty, this article might seem to hold the possibility of authenticity. Trust me...it's pure unmitigated fantasy. <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myst.html" title="Myst">Myst</a> is reality long before this stuff is...

<li><b>Comment</b>. Actually, I think lack of references isn't a valid reason at all -- not even a poor one. If it turns out that I'm wrong and it <i>is</i> a good reason for deletion, then we have lots of other articles to delete.

<p>This article was tagged for notability concerns and a prod, which was removed without improvement to the article, so it's here for AfD. There is no indication in the article of meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> requirements. Not everyone who was shot in the "troubles" in Ireland will have their own biographical entry — only those who in some way have achieved wider prominence, which can be established by mainstream coverage, of which there is none cited here. It might merit inclusion in a wider article about the alleged "shoot to kill" policy or whatever, but not, from what is written, as a stand-alone article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Lets not get this out of persective, over 3,000 people died in "the Troubles", how many of them have articles? McCaughey was actually the youngest ever elected representative in All of Ireland and at the same time held membership of PIRA and held up by Unionists as the prime example of inextricable link between Sinn Fein and the PIRA. When I removed the tag I did state that I would fill in the full details tonight and would have thought that that would have been taken in good faith and given a chance to extend the article. Obviously not. I will extend it tonight so i would appriciate if you would revisit your "delete" votes after that. regards--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 15:37, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The reference for #4 does not show that there was any note taken of McCaughey's youth as a councillor at the time he was elected a councillor, therefore does not demonstrate that he was notable for that. #11 does seem to make him notable, but there's not really enough context for the claim - how big was the "Most Wanted" list in those days? How often did people come off or get put on it? But there is a reference that he was "most wanted in Britain", which does seem to make one pretty notable, unless the term was so overused as to be meaningless. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 01:52, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, thats quite strong language there. I wasn't attempting to "discredit" the BBC documentary, my point merely was that the claim that McCaughey was one of 'Britain's most wanted men' (and therefore is notable enough for a Wikipedia article) is based on a single line from a single documentary. This alone is not enough evidence to my mind to grant someone a page without wider corroboration or notability, which I do not feel this article as it currently stands provides.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>- IRA Volunteer Martin McCaughey is of course a notable figure - particularly in the area he was born and lived in. McCaughey and Grew at the time of their deaths were senior members of the Tyrone IRA and had been involved in numerous attacks on members of the British Army and RUC including one suspected attack on undercover soldiers who were apparently tailing his car (Kevin Toolis' book Rebel Hearts includes reference to this). I've yet to see a single well thought out explanation as to why this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrish_Republican_1600.html" title="User:Irish Republican">Irish Republican</a> 07:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article has changed hugely since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_McCaughey&amp;oldid=106562223" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_McCaughey&amp;oldid=106562223" rel="nofollow">version that was nominated for AfD</a>, which had no evidence of notability. It now, to my mind, validates its inclusion. However, none of the facts which now do that were present at the time of the nom. The initial responses on this page were of course made to the earlier version. As there is considerable challenge to IRA-related articles, it is highly advisable for those writing them to ensure that they are up to the present standard of this one, <i>before</i> posting in article space. I suggest preparation on a user sub page, or a Wikiproject IRA sub page. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think your&#160;!vote is a good illustration of what the problem is with this list and other similar lists.

Clearly everyone who entered an item on this list thinks that the item is important enough to be noted, so how can removing part of the list be justified without resorting to improper POV judgment calls? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, the article <i>is</i> referenced, but not with in-line citations. Therefore claiming this is all OR is not strong argument.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree that the fact that the current article "sucks" is not grounds for deletion. Nor is the fact that it seems to be a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam magnet</a> necessarily grounds for deletion, though I deleted several spammy or broken external links given as the "references". But I am also not confident that this can ever be expanded in a <i>worthwhile and neutral</i> way beyond a dictionary definition; or for that matter, beyond the definitions of the two words of the title. It seems incredibly vague and too open-ended to support much of an article. Trying to move beyond this, you will either get promoters of the various dubious get-rich-quick enterprises that are pitched as "business opportunities", or you will get their critics. At best, this should be a disambiguation page for such things as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchising.html" title="Franchising">franchising</a> and <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_schemes.html" title="Pyramid schemes">pyramid schemes</a>. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 16:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This may be a BrE/AmE difference, but I thought that a "business opportunity", in its true sense, was just that - an opportunity to start or expand a genuine business via a "gap in the market", as described <a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.8451" class="external text" title="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.8451" rel="nofollow">here</a> for example. The Wikipedia article seems to be describing what I would call <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get-rich-quick_scheme.html" title="Get-rich-quick scheme">get-rich-quick schemes</a> - their <i>creators</i> might call them "business opportunities", but they are not really.

<li><b>Comment</b> - this is why I think that if anything at all should go here, it should be some kind of disambiguation page. There is an economic concept of "opportunity", usually discussed in the context of <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opportunity_cost.html" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a>, the cost that arises out of the roads not taken, the loss of alternative uses that come from dedicating a resource to a purpose. There is also your sense, which is an aspect of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a>. Finally, "business opportunity" is used as a euphemism in the sense this article is about, for the promotion of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-level_marketing.html" title="Multi-level marketing">multi-level marketing</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advance_fee_fraud.html" title="Advance fee fraud">advance fee frauds</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forex_scam.html" title="Forex scam">forex scams</a>, secret plans to make millions speculating in land or on Ebay, and similar morally and legally dubious and economically implausible schemes. The phrase is inherently vague, and in itself not really a good subject for an article in chief. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 01:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>They may be published by fans, but that does not necessarily mean that they do not contain verifiable content, as per the interview I mentioned above. Since we are dealing with a fictional art, the converse of "exceptional claims require exceptional sources" from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> provides some leeway (i.e., you aren't going to find a scholarly paper or journal article on this topic). This does not mean the topic cannot be provided with useful and verifiable data (which I believe it has). To quote: <i>Not all sources on a topic are equally reliable, and some sources will have differing degrees of reliability in different contexts.

<dd>I would say that this context (fiction) does not require the kinds of sources you appear to be requiring. Not to belabor this too long, but I do believe that if the sources were actively referenced in the text of the article, it would resolve most objections. To clarify/ammend something I said previously with more precise terms, I think the topic is <i>sourced</i> properly - you can't get more accurate or valid than the individuals (director and choreographer) who developed it - but not <i>referenced</i> properly, which is a different matter.

<dd>WP:V makes no exceptions for fiction, and I don't know why you think it would.

<dd>I said nothing about <i>exceptions</i>... a careful reading of what I said will demonstrate this. I actually quoted from RS to underscore what I both said and meant. As far as the article goes, there are sources cited, there are interviews provided. I would not be against a merge and redirect, as others have mentioned, but I don't think we should delete an article simply because someone is not satisfied with some pretty direct sourcing for the topic. I had not intended to comment on this subject again, I think one person weighing in too often is counter-productive, but I do not wish to be misquoted - I understand how WP:V works. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">◄</font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel">Zahakiel</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777">►</font></a> 15:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> The related term <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_fu.html" title="Gun fu">Gun fu</a> has more history of use although that article too is in serious need of work.

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's notable in the same manner as other modern cinematic techniques (e.g. <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_time.html" title="Bullet time">bullet time</a>); I think the tone of the article should reflect this however, rather than treating it as a martial art (albeit a fictional one). So I also support a <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_fu.html" title="Gun fu">Gun fu</a> and giving the article a broader scope - as well as a cleanup. - 85.210.185.207 12:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference is that people have actually written about bullet time and that doesn't appear to be the case here. Also notability is not what is in question, just that the topic can ever be adequately sourced. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 14:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realise this, but I don't necessarily believe it to be the case. Seeing as we can agree on its notability, the correct course of action would be to search out articles, websites, commentaries, etc. that discuss the Gun Kata technique and base the article around them, rather than editors resorting to original research (which is obviously how the current article has been constructed). If there's still issues with original research after this approach has been taken then there'd be a more substantial case for deletion of the article. - 85.210.185.207 11:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did look and couldn't find anything reliable, which is why I put it up for deletion. There certainly could be something out there, but the burden is on you guys to find it, not me to prove it doesn't exist.

<ul>
<li>"the burden is on you guys to find it, not me to prove it doesn't exist" True, but you still can't delete it unless that's the overriding consensus - currently consensus seems to dictate the opposite, and that the article should remain. I didn't write this article and have no real investment in it, so I doubt I'll be going to great lengths to search out sources myself (it's worth noting that sources aren't limited simply to the Internet). Seeing as it seems as though the article isn't going to be deleted, your best bet for improving it would be to highlight the specific issues on the talk page and add requests for citations where necessary. - 85.210.185.207 16:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it can still get deleted even without consensus.

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b>- This is ridiculous. Whoever 'checked and didn't find anything' didn't check the movie. As someone else pointed out from the source guidlines: "Common sense is required to determine what sources to use; this guideline cannot be applied robotically." So here's some common sense. It is a logical fallacy for a 3rd party to be considered reliable on a fictional concept. Flat out impossible. They're either reiterating information gained from the author/authors, fabricating information, or they're making speculation, all of which are irrelevant. This means that only the creator/creators of the concept can be considered reliable sources, making the movies of their creation reliable sources as well. There is a quote on the Techniques page taken directly from the movie. This alone satisfies <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> enough to keep the article up, even if it needs revision. Looking for a more reliable source on a fictional technique than a fictional master of said fictional technique is rather redundant. 90% of the Techniques section is a direct description of Gun Kata scenes in the movie. There is no reason to remove this article. --X Kolchak X 07:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<ul>
<li>Please read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> again, as well as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Gun Kata is a fictional martial art from the movies Equilibrium and Ultraviolet. Under the cited policies, these movies are <i>primary</i> sources -- "artistic and <i>fictional works</i> such as poems, scripts, screenplays, novels, <i>motion pictures</i>, videos, and television programs" (emphasis added). Secondary sources are generally preferred, but primary sources can be used, especially if secondary sources are unavailable. You don't need to find a secondary source to say that Luke Skywalker lived on Tatooine at the beginning of Star Wars Episode IV, because it's right in the movie. The real issue here is not verifiability or original research, it's notability. At one point I was going to suggest merging the content into the article on Equilibrium, per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, but Gun Kata spans multiple movies. Maybe the entry in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_martial_arts.html" title="List of fictional martial arts">List of fictional martial arts</a> is sufficient. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 17:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue as far as deletion/keeping is concerned is verifiability. "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." It doesn't. Merging is another issue. The article on Equilibrium already has a section on gun kata and like you say the list of fictional martial arts has an entry on it, so I don't think merging anything anywhere is really necessary. The author has alerady made sure there is as much discussion of the topic in as many different articles as he or she could. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 18:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>The idea behind Gun Kata [which is the style of martial arts developed for the movie] was taken from true martial art concepts in that if one could learn the Gun Kata to it's fullest potential defending yourself in any situation could and would be realised. As opposed to traditional weaponry, such as we used in the sword sequences, guns were used in a similar martial arts manner. They were used as extensions of ourselves, which is the concept within the martial arts of all weapons. When learning the use of any weapon within the martial arts, it is taught in the same manner as hand to hand fighting skills. Whether it be a sword, bo staff, escrima sticks, tonfa's or any other weapon they, or it, become extensions of your body and therefore manipulated in the same fluid natural way we would use our hands, elbows, feet, knees, etc. The choreography of all the action was based completely on true concepts of traditional martial arts. The Gun Kata and afterwards the use of that training within the film brought weapons training to a new level which has never been seen before Equilibrium.</i> <a href="http://www.sci-fi-online.50megs.com/Interview/03-08-29_JimVickers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sci-fi-online.50megs.com/Interview/03-08-29_JimVickers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sci-fi-online.50megs.com/Interview/03-08-29_JimVickers.htm</a></dd>
<dd><i>The film also presents an entirely original fighting art: the Gun-Kata, a fast and furious combination of Western fire-power with Eastern discipline of the body. Says Wimmer: "Hong Kong action movies brought out the idea that if a man has two hands, he can shoot two guns but that's as far as they took it. I wondered: Have we really hit the envelope for gun-play or is there somewhere new it could go? To me, combining the gun with martial arts was a natural. No one has ever used a gun before in a Kata form but it becomes the perfect extension of the body and can be used in ways not usually seen.</i> <a href="http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/535/notes.pdf" class="external free" title="http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/535/notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/535/notes.pdf</a></dd>

After I would make sure that my family was out of the house and my neighbors weren't looking over the fence and I would, I developed it in the grass behind my house.

<dd>"Terinu" is a significant, long-running Australian print comic that has been on sale regularly for many years, before it was a webcomic and before it was made available through Lulu. It was also included in the book "Operation Funnybone." Failure to win Awards in Australia should not be regarded as having any weight, as the Ledgers are fledgling (2 years so far) and controversial. It should definitely be retained in the Wikipedia! Ian T (in Australia) 12 February 2007</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, based on references added to article which I believe serve to satisfy the critricism that it doesn't meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> It would be rather hard for this to <i>only</i> be published through Lulu if it's been around in print since 1986. Fram, please investigate the subject better before putting up an AFD. Ian, can you provide any links or details about this? This may meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> after all, but it's hard for me to be sure. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Addendum: <b>Keep</b> based on the added sources now that I've re-reviewed the article. I count multiple independent and presumably reliable sources, which means that it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. I would question classing this as a webcomic seeing as the print form seems to be much better known than the online form. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 09:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Pardon me, but which and where are the new sources removing all doubt? I saw the <i>Operation Funnybone</i> publication when I initially looked into this, but as it struck me as a bit-part inclusion in a charity publication, and I could hardly see it as <i>one of the mulitple reliable non-trivial independent etc..</i> (I have certainly seen similar publications containing contributions noone would use to establish notability). The other listed paper reviews, <i>Inkspot</i> and <i>OzComics</i> are.. well, whatever they are. Good faith ought to give time for these sources to become useful to the article, and I will neutralise my consensus flag, but what has yet, strictly speaking, changed? What in this article, apart from a Funnybone participation, is and will be <i>verifiable</i>? —<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurgh_9136.html" title="User:Murgh"><font size="-1">M</font><font size="-3">URGH</font></a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/User_talk%7EMurgh_f175.html" title="User talk:Murgh"><font size="-5"><sup>disc.</sup></font></a> 12:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Whatever they are" being magazines about comics. A review is a non-trivial mention for an arts topic, and the sources seem (from what little I can dig up about them) to be independent, reliable, and published, which is what <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> requires. (Being circulated outside Australia, or available online, are not conditions applicable to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.) That said, the article as written <i>does</i> need an awful lot of cleanup. It's an interesting contrast between this article and Greeneyes, which I've suggested does not meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in its AFD; the Greeneyes article is fairly well-written, while this one is utterly awful. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 12:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Inkspot, as far as I can tell, is the members magazine / bulletin of the ACA, and isn't for sale. I wasn't able to check the Terinu review, since it appeared in #40 (not 41 as the article says), and only issues #41 and later are available online. It is a borderline case for a reliable source indicating notability (assuming the review is substantial, which I believe it is). The review was written by Ian Thomas, a comics creator and enthousiast, and also a contributor to Funnybone, and also a reviewer for Ozcomics, which makes me wonder if he has also written the Terinu review in that magazine (just a hunch, no way to confirm this for me). This would mean that the multiple independent reviews are not so independent after all... Can anyone shed some light on this? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 14:04, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I move that we extend discussion to answer Fram's question. Fram is not alone in thinking this may be critical. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not critical for me. Verifiability, a policy, is satisfied. Notability, a guideline, may not be. On which should we place the greater emphasis? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> this is a bad faith nom, because Sarah has had a <a href="../../../h/i/s/HIStory_0363.html" title="HIStory"><i>HIS</i><b>tory</b></a> of disliking me. It was nominated mere hours after I made the article, which basically means one thing: <i>I have had no time to research and flesh out the article</i>. You reckon the article looks crap? Well maybe that's cause I have had approximately ZERO HOURS to fix it. I established it and then retired to bed (yes I do sleep) and only returned from work now. It is horrible to see vendettas behind my back like this, just to make the article not have enough time to be developed by me. I find it horribly deceitful, and while I'm sure you're all jumping the gun, trigger-happy and ready to aim and shoot, why not give me a little more time to research the song? Oh I forgot, you're all probably pals of Sarah's. And I bet 10 others are gonna come on and say "Delete Delete Delete!!!!!!!!" just because sarah is the respected editor and I am nothing. Well that would just be sad because I explained why I needed a little more time, but of course the administrator has 'ways' of getting his/her ways and I'm sure that the candle of this article will be mysteriously snuffed, while simultaneously on Sarah's computer screen the button 'delete' is depressed. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 07:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Please stop making personal attacks and assuming bad faith of everybody. Nothing was done behind your back. In fact, I went straight to your page to tell you I had nominated the article. Please try to deal with the article and respond to policy issues. <b>Sarah</b> 09:27, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Paaerduag</b> - No, I am not voting delete because I am a "pal of Sarah's"; in fact the only time I have encountered her before is when she voted oppose on my RfA. And I agree with you that admins have too much dictatorial power. The reason why I am voting delete is because the article, as it stands, does not meet WP policy. If you can provide adequate, concrete sources showing that the song in question is <i>definitely</i> going to be released, then I will be happy to change my vote. But as it stands, it fails <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>, which is not mine or Sarah's opinion; it is an agreed WP policy. The reason we have AfD, rather than simply deleting articles, is precisely to give users the time to improve articles so that they meet policy standards - as I said, if you improve the sourcing and verifiability of the article I will be happy to change my vote. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You say the only reference is a fan forum. If you take the time to read the article that is referenced, it comes from a Rollin Stone magazine article, and I can give you a link to a scan of the article if you like. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 06:37, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I did take the time to read the article. The reference in the article is a fan forum. Yes, I noticed that the fan forum was in turn reporting a story from a magazine. However, it doesn't change the fact that it is still an unverified rumour. The song doesn't exist yet and the article fails the policies mentioned above. There is also the qustion of the not minor issue of notability. <b>Sarah</b> 14:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To begin with, I want to remind everyone that there is not yet a policy of notability on schools. The requirement of stating some assertion of notability is mainly created on the fact that millions of articles that are <i>commercially based</i> or focused <i>individual</i> self-promotion would be littered all over wikipedia. I believe that if any article that is not advertising in this said manner is viable. In addition, as an additional requirement, I believe that articles should have some substance and according to policy, they should have some referenced material or at least, I believe, a list some legitimate sources. This article appears to have some information, and I am sure that in the future, individuals could work on and improve the article based on these sources and any additional sources that come light. As always, we should not be excluded articles on wikipedia on just notability alone; self-promotion and commercial characteristics of articles with illegitimate sources should be the targets of deletion. This article appears to have some possibility for growth, and I believe that if until some templates for clean up and additional sources are added, and <i>then</i> if no progress is made on the article within a few months, then the article can be properly assessed. --Thank You. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh17_09da.html" title="User:Sukh17">Sukh17</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><sup><a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh17_5dc2.html" title="User talk:Sukh17">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sukh17_a7a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sukh17">Contribs</a></sup></span> 22:15, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> as NuclearZer0's points per notability are hard to disagree with, but might also sensibly be a section of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>. (On the other hand, it's clearly not <i>only</i> his work, nor only notable because of its association with him.) Also, if kept, I think it should be moved to <a href="../../../f/r/o/FrontPageMagazine.com_22b3.html" title="FrontPageMagazine.com">FrontPageMagazine.com</a>. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Comparing with those two articles is akin to comparing apples and oranges; frontpagemag doesn't have a print version, so the standards for notability are higher. Also, the articles on those publications are well-developed and do a far better job of establishing notability.

<dl>
<dd>If Frontpage gets 1.5 million readers a month, as they claim (and it doesn't seem unreasonable given the alexa rank) than they reach a larger audience than some of the most influential publication's in the US. Given their large readership and the high caliber of their contributors, I think your claim that they are not notable doesn't holds water. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 14:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"ATTENTION!...this is not a majority vote, but rather a discussion to establish a consensus amongst Wikipedia editors..." Please contribute to the discussion, don't just "vote". As Brighterorange noted, FPM is "clearly not <i>only</i> [Horowitz's] work, nor only notable because of its association with him" (Glazov has an article on Wikipedia as well, for a start). Further, content such as the list of contributors would unreasonably clutter Horowitz's page, which is already long enough despite undeveloped sections. The content of the current stub could be accommodated in the DHFC article...but Hipocrit has put that up for deletion too. What, exactly, is the encyclopedic purpose of shoehorning multiple notable subjects into a single article? Wikipedia is not a Paper Encylopedia! <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 23:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is notable, but not so notable that it would not be better merged into the larger article. Merging would eliminate some redundancy, and give us one better page instead of three or four mediocre pages. It is a judgement call. Reasonable men may differ, but they should not call vandalism any good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia, and should not presume to lecture their fellows in all-caps. Overuse of capital letters, especially with exclamation marks, is one of the first signs of incipient jackassery. The next phase involves the use of italics, and then bold text. After the onset of tertiary symptoms, including the use of colored fonts and, in extreme cases, the blink tag, recovery is virtually unheard of. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 01:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mr. Harrison didn't notice the quote markes before the capitalized word. If he looks at the top of this page he will see that I left out the enlarged text, contrasting background, red borders, and other signs of full-out jackassery that the sysop responsible for the box is guilty of. None of which got his attention, apparently.</dd>
<dd><b>I</b> apparently got his attention, but he does seem to have a problem understanding what I said. At the risk of "lecturing", let me further clarify that "discussion" is an interactive process, not just two sides spouting their views. So, first I'll respond to him: merging would indeed reduce redundancy. If the content of FPM were already in DHFC I would not argue strongly for spinning it off until it was more developed. But by "the larger article" I assume he means <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>. First, see <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. Second, <b>please respond</b> to the two points I made in my first response to your "vote". Then I'll respond to your response, and you can respond, and we'll eventually clarify what points we actually disagree or *GASP* maybe even come to an agreement.</dd>
<dd>BTW, I'm <b>not</b> calling vandalism "any good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia". Disavian's proposal is wrong-headed, but he actually shows signs of being a reasonable person who can be persuaded to see the error of his ways, and I hope will prove equally persuadable should/when I fall into error. Hipocrite is a different case. I wrote that what he was doing was approaching vandalism, and I am more and more persuaded that the assumption of good faith has to at some point be recognized as either a delusion or beside the point. I'm not his psychiatrist. He may honestly think that what he is doing is reasonable. But it isn't. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Discover_the_networks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Discover_the_networks" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 12:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry for my sarcasm. I guess there is really no reason to think you are more likely than anyone else to use bold text and capital letters. I continue to think we would do better with one good page than three less good. I would not like to see a clutch of David Horowitz pages like that we had a few months ago of pages about the life and works of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">Alex Jones (radio)</a>. Whatever advantage there may be to organization in having more pages is outweighed by not having relevent material on one page but having redundant material on others; by having fewer editors following each page; by changes getting out of sync; and by some pages developing as pov forks of others. That is what I think and why. Beyond that, I am content to leave it to the closer's judgement. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there a reason for this list? For the vast part the entries for the droids do not even bother to assert notability within the fictional Star Wars universe - let alone provide reliable third-party sources that support notability - and there is no good reason why we should have lists of eminently non-notable droids, that are, by admission, <i>minor</i>. I have no doubt the information is all completely true, but that doesn't mean there should be a whopping great list of this unencyclopedic material: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - Ordinarily I'd say merge into an overall list of minor characters, per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> policy on non-notable characters. However, since this is Star Wars, and there's simply so much stuff about it on Wikipedia already, I think merging would lead to excessively long articles. No point in trying to transwiki anywhere either - all this stuff is already probably covered in exhaustive detail on Wookiepedia, which is the right place for this kind of material. So it looks like Delete is the only option. (Sorry about the long rambling rationale.) <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> <i>"A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other."</i> The nature of Star Wars and its fan base is such that even minor characters within the Star Wars universe have receieved a lot of independent, non-trivial coverage. The current sourcing is inadequate, I agree, but many sources do exist to substantiate the contents of this article and the notability of the subject as defined in Wikipedia policy above. Normally, I would say delete all stuff that isn't properly sourced, but the amount of work done on this article is so massive that I'm unwilling to flush that all away. Keep it and tag it for better sourcing. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 17:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I'll be somewhat surprised if many of these droids really have non-trivial reliable sources devoted to them: non-trivial in the sense of non-fanbase. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 17:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I love it so much that this list exists. But these just don't pass the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> requirement for Wikipedia, and their proper home is on the Star Wars fan wiki, where they will be appreciated as they deserve. -<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 18:29, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, and as to previous keep, note that the sources must be multiple, non-trivial, <b>reliable</b>, and independent-this is not a "pick any three", said sources must satisfy <b>all four</b>. Star Wars fandom coverage would not be reliable sourcing, and therefore fails. The two "external links" cited don't remotely begin to satisfy the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliability guidelines</a>. However, I'm entirely willing to change my opinion if such sources can be found. Anyone&#160;!voting "keep" should be prepared to cite sources, and be prepared to show or argue why those sources are independent (not affiliated with the Star Wars franchise), non-trivial (cover the subject in a sufficient depth for an encyclopedia article), and reliable (written by a source which is subject to editorial control or academic peer review.) I love Star Wars, but this just doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 18:32, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be an article about a slogan that nobody has ever used, except perhaps as a strawman argument, and even in that context is not particularly common. There's probably a place on Wikipedia for well-known phrases or saying, but this one simply is so esoteric as to be pointless. Most of the article is made up of examples of people saying things similar but not quite like it. At best it should be a small section in the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a> article - I'm not sure it even deserves to be that, though. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 17:26, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Well I'd never seen the article before, but I found it informative and well written.

<li>If this article is supposed to be "a catch-all for every goverment official or scientist who has asserted that there are no more reasons to doubt that the science of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> indicates a strong enough human component to justify the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_Protocol_1811.html" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>," then it should be renamed to something such as "opinions of goverment officials and scientists who support the Kyoto Protocol." Ed seems to have forgotten both the spirit and substance of the history of this article. He originally named it, [[Slogan 'The science is settled']. Ed put both the word "slogan" and the quote marks around the phrase into the original name of the article, and to this day it remains an article about that specific phrase. It has been improved somewhat by subsequent edits making it clear that no one actually used that slogan as a slogan, but if its sole purpose is to serve as a collection-point for statements by people who think the scientific evidence warrants the Kyoto Protocol, then its current title is both too specific and also inaccurate. I don't have a strong opinion on whether to delete this article, but I'm leaning toward <b>delete or rename</b>. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESheldon_Rampton_b54a.html" title="User:Sheldon Rampton">Sheldon Rampton</a> 20:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. From <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan.html" title="Slogan">slogan</a>: "A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase used in a political, commercial, religious, and other contexts as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose." This phrase isn't actually used repetitively to express an idea. In fact, a variety of phrases are used to express this idea, as evidenced by the quotes in the article. To put it under this name, or indeed any single name, would be foolish. "The science is settled" is not even a phrase used by those who believe that the science is settled -- instead, it's a common way (but by no means the only way) to set up a straw man argument. This isn't a slogan; it's a sentence, and the typical sentence doesn't deserve articles, even if it's frequently used (should we have articles titled "The climate is changing," "Average global temperatures are projected to increase over the next century," and "Emission of aerosols is estimated to contribute -0.7 Wm<sup>-1</sup> to radiative forcing from direct effects alone"?). The best thing to do would be to redirect to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> or something like that. --67.125.30.179 20:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or the World Will Come to a Quick End</b> I am sick to death of the idea in some Wikipedian minds that widely used concepts that affect us all by affecting our public debates do not deserve Wikipedia articles. Gwern's idea that the words need to be exact is exactly the wrong way of looking at it: It's the concept that's obviously what the subject is. This is a salient part of the debate over global warming and serves the purpose of helping people think about that debate, and it does so with a neutral point of view. We need more articles like this. It just needs to always be backed up with citations and remain strictly fair. These articles are also a great exercise for everybody in tolerating disagreement, something we could use more of.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I rarely comment on other people's views in AFD, and I certainly don't expect to change your mind. But... to my mind this isn't an article about a concept, and it's simply not the case that the concept is "obviously what the subject is". When I read it, it reads as an article about a slogan, and about who has or hasn't used it (or something like it). If someone were to rename it and rewrite it to be about the concept, it would be a very different article, and I wouldn't have nominated it. --<a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">Talk to the driver</a> 10:08, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I feel that one weakness this article has is the use of the word slogan, much better to use the word phrase, as there is no evidence (that I know of) that those using the phrase on the climate skeptic side were working together. As for having a wikipedia article about a phrase, <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_be_or_not_to_be.html" title="To be or not to be">to be or not to be</a> was the first one I thought of and that was in ( ok its by the bard, but so what). The <b>science is settled</b> is a phrase (or slogan) that has become symbolic of the (often heated) war of words between scientists who have come to accept global warming as an unpleasent reality we must deal with, and those who, <i>often</i> for reasons of political or economic gain have decided to fight against the theory, and have become known as the climate skeptics. The phrase is used by te skeptics as a (very successful) means of confusing the issue in the minds of the non-expert majority in society. By puporting that their opponents have claimed 'the science is settled' they can then attack their position by showing a single area in which the science is not settled, the classic <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> technique. This is a very common technique in the global warming debate and this is the key reason for me that this is an important article for the general wikipedia reader wanting to get closer to the truth in what is perhaps one of the most important, but also perhaps the most confusing, issues of the 21st century - kind regards <a href="../../../s/b/a/User%7ESbandrews_8633.html" title="User:Sbandrews">sbandrews</a> 18:41, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b> Sbandrews, if what you say can be footnoted, I'm all for making it part of the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This is not a phrase, or anyway it's not a phrase according to the normal or technical understanding of "phrase".

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The New York Sociologist is the offical journal of a respected statewide academic organization with a 53 year history of successfully running academic conferences. Their new journal builds on this history. The 2006 issue includes a lead article by a respected award winning ethnographer and journalist Michael I. Niman. The editorial board includes another well known ethnographer, Laura J. McClusky. This journal is a noteworthy new publication published by a venerable organization with a long successful track record. NBeat 19:41, 8 February 2007 (UTC)NBeat</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The old article appears to have been properly deleted. The nominator is right. It was better than this version, so this version should be deleted too. The only way to save it is to have some proper references to proper articles in peer reviewed physics journals that use the term "Boltzmom", and are talking about the same thing as this article. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 11:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the article could also be merged with more geneological relationships, like above someone mentioned grandfathers of PM's.

<li>I have a tendency to not like a whole article that fits into a spreadsheet. I think that an encyclopedia should explain things and not just list them. While I feel that some people may find this list useful, I'm not sure if it is useful for Wikipedia. I can only imagine that anyone who needs to find a list of all the PM's parents is an elementary school student doing some busy-work and we'd just be helping them cheat.

<li>I appreciate that I wasn’t singled out but since I’m the only one who said anything close to that, I do wonder “people” means me. =) Just to clarify, I think that lists are fine when they index encyclopedic content but that they shouldn’t masquerade as such. Having looked through all of the list guidelines to be sure that my comment was not novel, I see no references to lists which do not index articles.

<p><b>delete</b> Here are some comments I left a while ago on the Discussion page of the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrics.html" title="Sabermetrics">Sabermetrics</a> article, where a link to the Runs Against Average has been put in several times by the same person and deleted by various others: "I'm a member of SABR (Society for American Baseball Research) and for the last 4 or 5 years I've been receiving a daily email message from the SABR group in which various members send comments, queries, etc., to a central List (so they call it) about research matters. Then every day the moderator posts the 10-40 messages that have come in that day in a single email to the subscribers to the service. It's sorta like a chat room or newsgroup discussion area, except it's done by email and it's exclusively about research matters, NOT general baseball discussion, such as "who's gonna win the Series". I've just checked my SABR mailbox on Eudora -- there are 3443 separate emails! That means there are probably at least 35,000 to 50,000 individual emails within that group. I've just done a Search for "runs created" -- that returned 265 entries. I Searched for "total player rating" -- that returned 45 entries. I then Searched for "runs against average" -- and got zero entries. "RAA"? -- zero entries. A Google search for "runs against average" only brings in 65 hits -- many of them on blogs. Surely an extraordinarily low total for a generally accepted research tool. So it looks to me that, whatever the merits of the method, it's almost certainly Original Research under the Wiki definition and shouldn't be here." <i>End of my message on the Discussion page.</i> A Google for "total player rating", on the other hand, brings in <b>121,000</b> hits! So I'm afraid that this looks like a (possibly very valuable) research tool that, at least in its Wikipedian context, is purely Original Research and should therefore be deleted. I fought the Original Research debate on the other side a couple of years ago and was defeated and now, I think, I see clearly that what I used to argue was wrong. In sum, this RAA is Original Reseach and should be deleted. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 23:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> as original research. I agree with Hayford Pierce's main thrust, that it doesn't appear this methodology has been published anywhere else, and even if it has, it hasn't gained enough attention to be worthy of it's own entry. There are hundreds of new methods and formula for baseball analysis developed each year, and wikipedia should be used to document the few that gain traction, not as a launching pad for new ideas. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnson2995_78a9.html" title="User:Anson2995">Anson2995</a> 20:10, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I got more than twice as many hits outside of Wikipedia, and I think there are probably more out there. I have a hard time feeling that this should be deleted... it's an in-print series of comics with a real publisher. If there are issues with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (perhaps the statements on Case Closed could be sourced, but they aren't now), that is a content dispute rather than a case for deletion. I also have a hard time believing that <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E1523.html" title="User:1523">User:1523</a> (who isn't a native English speaker and wasn't informed of the deletion debate) is at any kind of fault here.

<li><b>Keep</b> "Non-notable" and "forgettable" are a matter of opinion. We are in the category of AFD <i>("A five-day public debate and discussion on the merits of the article and its best treatment. Applicable to all articles where deletion is unsure, seriously contested, or may need debate, and all borderline or controversial cases.")</i> The main linked article, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_ESPN_0b67.html" title="Mobile ESPN">Mobile ESPN</a>, is not yet up for deletion. There is no discussion on the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Talk%7EESPN%27s_Sports_Heaven_2567.html" title="Talk:ESPN's Sports Heaven">Talk:ESPN's_Sports_Heaven</a> calling for deletion. There is nothing controversial about the article. It is pretty difficult to consider dropping an article with a large amount linked content both ways. The article is the number 4 Google link using the separate words "sports" and "heaven". I do not understand what constitutes borderline other than a personal opinion of what constitutes a Wikipedia article. As a business enterprise, Mobile ESPN was a product in search of a market that ended up a monetary flop. This puts it in the category of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commercial_failures.html" title="Commercial failures">Commercial failures</a>. And if you look at that particular category, Mobile ESPN rises at least to the top half of the list. Sports Heaven was the biggest expense and biggest part of the failure. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroup29_822d.html" title="User:Group29">Group29</a> 15:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agree with that, if it's that important to have some of the info it should be incorporated into the Mobile ESPN article. I did not nominate that one as it <b>is</b> notable and <b>was</b> the commercial flop, not the other way around as others here seem to think, it's also why I didn't nominate This is SportsCenter as it is a notable ad series over a decade now.

<li>Gametz community is not insignificant. It has been integral in the trading community since it's inception over 10 years ago and has laid clear the groundwork for some higher profile trading community websites and community websites in general. The active user base is somewhere around 3,000 users. How is interest determined? If a website is perdominately featured in mutiple issues of a high readership magazine like gamepro, does that not illustrate a very real interest? AtaruMoroboshi 13:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By that logic, pretty much all of the pages in the Community Websites category should be deleted. All of these are sites of thousands of users. So, by your logic, a site with a few thousand users is advertising, but CNN and Netflix is worthy simply due to a larger user base? How are pages for those sites any less guilty of being advertising? More on point, I notice a page for Gamefly, a commercial game rental site. This page has been written to document the site's history and community, not primarily as advertising. Dstumme 15:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a web directory. Furthermore, there is not enough interest in this site to warrant this article. Sites such as CNN or eBay are legitimate considerations given their significance. GameTZ, on the other hand, is simply a small online trading community. For these same reasons, we have to delete articles regarding unknown actors, musicians and so forth who generally lack the sufficient interest to otherwise be relevant to an encyclopedia. Please take the time to review Wiki policy. G.hilmarsson 02:14, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as GameTZ has been featured in syndicated TV news spots (I think on CBS, but I could be wrong...it's been a few years since I saw the spot), has been covered in newspaper newspaper articles, and featured in magazine articles as well. It's the grand-daddy of all the various trading sites, and has outlasted almost all of them. Comparing GameTZ to Netflix, ebay, and similar sites is like comparing horses to tomatoes: they aren't even the same thing, so any comparison is invalid. When compared to other game/movie/music/book trading sites, GameTZ is one of the largest (if not the largest) out there. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 20:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - We are in the process of gathering other references. The GamePro magazine reference was recently added. I can also add a link to the video clip of the nationally syndicated news story that was done about game trading sites that heavily referenced GameTZ, but I wasn't sure how to cite that. The story ran on multiple stations across the country a couple of years back. There have been mentions in other gaming magazines occasionally over the years as well, but I'd need to do some more digging to find them.

<li><b>Comment:</b> The notability requirements do not require that <i>any</i> of the references be online references. With being mentioned twice in a popular gaming magazine, and having a TV spot (a recording of that spot is linked in the reference, BTW), the notability requirements are clearly fulfilled even without the other references you mention in your comment. Keep in mind that TV spot was aired on stations all across the United States. I actually saw it on my local news, though I didn't think to record it at the time. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 20:49, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am aware of the notability requirements... but limited coverage on the web is a big red flag.

<li>I'm not saying that every news story on TV deserves an article. The news story being used as a reference certainly doesn't deserve an article itself. However, the news story is perfectly acceptable as a reference used to meet the notability requirements for <i>this</i> article. The notability requirements say nothing about references needing to be notable enough to warrant an article themselves, only that such coverage is good enough to establish notability for the subject of that coverage. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">Nihon</a><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA"><font color="darkgreen">joe</font></a></small></sup> 03:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable college a cappella compilation (<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>). Not an award so much as a piramid scheme; i.e. you have to pre-purchase some of their CDs to get your tracks on the CD (<a href="http://www.varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" class="external text" title="http://www.varsityvocals.com/boca/faq.html" rel="nofollow">to the tune of $250</a>). Not a single <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">independent source</a> (i.e. a major national newspaper, etc.) writes about this compilation as being notable. In my due-dilligence lexis search I found two trivial mentions (one in a San Fransisco Chronicle human interest piece about Stanford music groups, and one mention in a New York Times article about music and the internet, which I believe to be a different compilation because it says it was founded by Adam Farb of Smoking Fish Records). Was kept earlier in a confused <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_House_Jacks_25aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The House Jacks">group nomination</a> that was marred by a high influx of anons and new accounts. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 19:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I used to work at a Barnes and Noble and would constantly see their books on the shelves.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I'm still trying to feel my way through this notability thing. It's a publisher, so not something that will be reviewed. I mean, take the company Dark Horse, I've read a lot of articles about Dark Horse's comics, but not many about Dark Horse itself. Most of what I read about Dark Horse came from them. So to me, if the comics a publsiher has are getting meantioned, with the publisher's name attached, then it's notable. For example, Viper Comics is mentioned in this article from Newsaramma, a well know comic site. <a href="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749" class="external free" title="http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749" rel="nofollow">http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98749</a> It got a mention in Best Surprise. Also, this publisher is particpating in the 2007 Free Comic Book Day <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecomicbookday.com/sponsors.asp</a>. To me that is notable. Just because it's a small independent publisher, doesn't mean it is not notable. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediAutobot_53a9.html" title="User:JediAutobot">JediAutobot</a> 18:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Adding to above, I did find this review of the publisher from 2003 <a href="http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicbookbin.com/viper01.html</a> <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJediAutobot_53a9.html" title="User:JediAutobot">JediAutobot</a> 18:22, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>strong keep</b> The only reason anyone nominated this article for deletion is to make it easier to delete the Ugly Hill page.Lessthankate</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This habit of deleting anything related to webcomics is getting out of hand. Come on people, Viper Comics? What next, Penny Arcade? -- <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 22:21, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It's Viper freakin' Comics! They publish many popular books! Just because they're independant doesn't make them "not notable." -- <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeakerWiggin_50e3.html" title="User:SpeakerWiggin">S</a></li>
<li>Comment: it took me a while, but I was able finally to find several somewhat small coverages in one reliable source <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizard_%28magazine%29.html" title="Wizard (magazine)">Wizard (magazine)</a> and several more sizable coverages in more borderline-reliable sources online. On the other hand, tcj.com The Comics Journal seems to never once have mentioned Viper. The article itself contains information sourced from the vipercomics home page, rather than the sources - the sources say Viper first published in 2003, whether or not the company was "founded" in 2001. It seems to me to be teetering on the edge of notability. The article, however, makes no actual claims of notability. And I wasn't able to find enough reliable information that I felt confident in adding such myself. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelisse_a0f3.html" title="User:Felisse">Felisse</a> 07:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Just because a publishing company has decided to publish a few webcomics does not make them non-notable. It has <a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685366p1.html" class="external text" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685366p1.html" rel="nofollow">well reviewed</a> works, and the only way that the publisher of those works would not be notable is if none of it's works are notable. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberSkull_302c.html" title="User:CyberSkull">Dread Lord CyberSkull</a> <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_40df.html" title="User talk:CyberSkull">✎☠</a> 23:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Viper Comics is notable, if only due to the fact that as an "independant" publisher, they compete successfully with mainstream comic publishers. I agree with Lessthankate - by being able to delete the publisher, it makes it easier to delete <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> too. Just like the ill advised deletion of the WCCA opened the floodgates to the current webcomic purge. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmccloud_d946.html" title="User:Timmccloud">Timmccloud</a> 12:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Re the "missing" news.htm page. An unfortunate circumstance that I would agree does give the wrong appearance. The website it belonged too changed completely in mid to late December and that page has not been part of the site since then--It is not missing--it has never been there stnce the change. The fact that it shows up in a cached Google search is no surprise.

<dd>Re the "Invented By The company" comment above. It bears some rebuttal. The methodology essentially started in the early 1980's at the National War College with the first published versions showing up in <i>The Air Campaign</i> (1986). The methodology (although not bearing it current moniker) was actually used for the planning of the first Gulf War. This is well documented and John Warden is referenced in numerous US and foreign texts related to this methodology. In the early 1990s, elements of methodology were taught and still are at the USAF Air Command and Staff College and have been taught at many of the other Military service schools and professional schools. This all occurred before I ever went to work for the company. Shortly after the first Gulf War, John Warden was working in the office of American Competitiveness in the White House under then Vice President Dan Qualye. The Methodology was evolving as John worked with businesses throughout the U.S. In the 1995, John, retired from the USAF, started his current company and began coalesing the methodology into what it is today. In that process, he collaborated with another author and management consultant, Leeland Russell to write Winning in FastTime and coin the term "Prometheus Process" to capture the essence of the strategic planning methodology. I became involved with company in 1996 as a software guy to build tools related to the evolving process. Other consultancies, some fairly major names use versions of this methodology to work with their clients. As I posted on the COI discussion, this link * [<a href="http://www.quality.nist.gov/PDF_files/Bama_Application_Summary.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quality.nist.gov/PDF_files/Bama_Application_Summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>] kinda of summarizes the process and gives it some sort of pedigree. However, I do think a strict adherance to the COI guidelines by me is necessary here and I will make those reverts and deletions as appropriate to clean up that angle.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Cline_ad65.html" title="User:Mike Cline">Mike Cline</a> 14:15, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The stuff I'm seeing in the WP at least doesn't seem to constitute non-trivial coverage. e.g. "Check out [Robert Strong]'s breathtaking act -- maybe even be part of it -- at one of nine "Hogwash" shows this month at the Smithsonian's Discovery Theater: July 23 at noon, and at 10 and 11:30 a.m. each day from July 26 through July 29" and that appears to be all.

<li>True, but it does confirm the Smithsonian performance. So in my mind, that's notability on the East Coast, combined with notability on the West Coast as well with the "Best of the Bay" award. I agree that it's not a super strong case for notability yet, but let's also keep in mind that the article was just created on February 6, and then got sent to AfD within 48 hours. I say let's keep for now, give the article some time to breathe, and then if it still looks weak after it's been given a chance to expand, we can take another look at it later. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 17:04, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - this is the second AfD for this article, the first is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lothl%C3%B3rien_Co-op_2a0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lothlórien Co-op">here</a> and was closed with a <b>keep</b>. Many of the voices in favor of keeping were so in favor on the basis of what the article could possibly become. However, in the intervening two months there has been no substantive effort to improve the article beyond cosmetic wikilinking. There are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for the article to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concerns. The sources consist of the co-op's own webpage along with its myspace page and assorted directory pages. The article has been tagged as reading like an advertisement for months and it still does. I also believe that one or more of the people arguing for keep the last time are heavily involved in the Madison co-op housing scene. I'm not sure how relevant that is to the discussion but since it is a potential bias I thought it reasonable to mention. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At any glance, this article is just a <b>major</b> fair use violation.

<li><b>keep</b>. I see no reason not to keep this article. It is part of a pop culture phenomenon, the character/persona is verifyable and there is considerable interest in the character. Additionally, there is a real person attached to the persona and that is also interesting in the same way as the Stephen Colbert persona is attached to the person Stephen Colbert. I don't disagree, however, that there is currently a commercial appearance to the article. The need to clean up the article has been identified and there are certainly editors available that appear to be willing to work on this requirement. Plus, Dr. Steel apparently has recruited an army of people who are likely to continue to resurrect it anyway. It makes sense to leave it and clean it up. <b><a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_K_ef39.html" title="User:Pete K">Pete K</a> 03:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</b></li>

There's a page of a couple Professional wrestlers on here I've seen, and no one's ever heard of them before, but have used wikipedia to get known. for example, the human tornado. nobody in the midwest knew who this guy was, and yes, the page that was made for him helped out his career a little. But this artist is know throughout the world by many people without this page. With all honesty, This guy doesn't even need this page, cause he's gonna get a bigger fan base without it or not. But he has been in several shows, and magazines, and is a popular artist with no mainstream radio play. to make this kind of a name for himself with out that help is a rare thing, and that's deserving to be a part of wikipedia.<small>— Yellowjacketrattlocke (<a href="../../../y/e/l/User_talk%7EYellowjacketrattlocke_5baa.html" title="User talk:Yellowjacketrattlocke">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yellowjacketrattlocke_34e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yellowjacketrattlocke">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Merge into Phineas Waldolf Steel</b> - or merge PWS into this one. Either way, the article(s) need(s) to be heavily edited to separate reality from promotion. For instance, Steel did get a brief appearance on Leno, but I'm not sure about Letterman (the pic might be photoshopped) and I think the Muppets thing is a pure bit of promotional fantasy. (Shame, cuz I think they'd be smashing together!) Anyway, I do think there should be an article about this guy, but we need more real info about the performer, which seems to be hard to get. --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistrion_ca94.html" title="User:Histrion">Jay (Histrion)</a> (<a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHistrion_9096.html" title="User talk:Histrion">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Histrion_7f5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Histrion">contribs</a>) 23:54, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this page is important as it gives information on the only known organization of its kind. Ska for Christ site members and visitors come from all around the world. The organization has sold merchandise to help promote up and coming bands from Brazil to Germany, from Croatia to Columbia. Many up and coming bands have been able to find eachother, locals, and other support through the organization. Members of the organization's online community have found comfort and counsel in the staff as well as eachother. The site staff have conducted interviews with members of popular bands in the genre who, themselves, have Wikipedia pages, Five Iron Frenzy and The Insyderz. (This is, and has been for quite some time, referenced, in the external links of the The Insyderz Wikipedia entry)</p>
<p>Again, it is the only known organization for this genre of music, and it has a very dedicated following, especially in the US, Brazil, Columbia, Germany, Croatia, as well as other countries.</p>

<p>If the genre of music of which this organization is the only known organized supporter, and bands that this organization have interviewed, are significant, then how is the organization <i><b>not</b></i> significant?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, also the article makes a pretty bold claim without substantiating references. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadmr_3c40.html" title="User:Roadmr">Roadmr</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/a/User_talk%7ERoadmr_d19a.html" title="User talk:Roadmr">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roadmr_eaa5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roadmr">c</a>) 23:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Two entries, one song. Useless. <a href="../../../l/a/j/User%7ELajbi_aa80.html" title="User:Lajbi"><b><font face="Lucida handwriting" color="#78866B">Lajbi</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/j/User_talk%7ELajbi_4318.html" title="User talk:Lajbi"><b><font color="#C3B091">Holla @ me</font></b></a></sup> 01:36, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> patently false on two fronts, 1. the song's still called Bring Me to Life, and 2. those words are indeed sung in the song. I like the concept of songs being changed for that reason, though; now, let's have an article on "<a href="../../../s/y/m/Sympathy_for_the_Devil_90ed.html" title="Sympathy for the Devil">Hope You Guessed My Name</a>". ^_^ <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per those above. If "Wake Me Up Inside" (without the band name and the dash) isn't already a redirect to the song, it might be worthwhile to make it one. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:19, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b>, is a substub a good reason for deletion in this case? I doubt so. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 06:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being a substub is hardly a crime, no. However that's not really the reason for deletion. The nominator has argued that, at best, this information should be part of another existing article (since it's an addition to what we already know about the song, that sounds fair enough, since we don't need two entries for one song). Additionally, other contributors have pointed out that the facts presented in this article are unsourced and (where the lyrics are concerned) inaccurate. Those are three good reasons for deletion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>No Consensus on any</b>. I have carefully reviewed the page history and determined that votes <i>were</i> removed in the course of <i>whatever the hell</i> happened here (I'm still trying to puzzle it out).

<p>Four <i>Amazing Race</i> winners who are not notable for anything other than winning the race. Am testing the water here as I can't find other examples of Amazing Race deletions but I note that the majority of race winners (apart from those notable for other things) do not have articles.</p>
<p><b>COMMENT: I WISH TO REGISTER MY EXTREME ANGER AT EVRIK MESSING UP MY NOMINATION</b>. I have just discovered that Evrik has created individual nominations for each of the three others I included in this single nomination and had also messed up the Articles for Deletion page by creating a subheading for "Amazing Race contestants". Let it be known that I am reverting all these edits and putting things back to their original state, as I feel that I, as nom, have a right to do. If other editors disagree with this decision of mine they are welcome to take it up with me on my talk page and I will be more than willing to discuss it. I believe this is part of a pattern of harassment of me by Evrik which is detailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#WikiStalking_by_PageantUpdater" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#WikiStalking_by_PageantUpdater" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Speedy procedural close</b> - the editing of this nomination by Evrik and PageantUpdater, resulting in the inappropriate removal of a great deal of the discussion, have in my view subverted this process past the point where this nomination should be allowed to continue.

<dd>Hey it wasn't me who messed with the nom in the first place, it was Evrik. It was also Evrik who brought in the drama in the first place, forcing me to get defensive.

<li>Honestly, I don't really care whose "fault" it was. His splitting up your nomination may not have been appropriate but your removing comments by a number of editors by reverting it definitely was. If you're so confident that this nomination will pass, then withdraw it and re-nominate to remove any question of impropriety <i>on anyone's part</i> in the nomination. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:55, 13</li>

<li>They were all listed under the Branaman and Conley entries. I thought this was confusing or misleading - I also thought they had been listed incorrectly and was trying to add clarity. No ill intent or maliciousness was involved. If I violated policy - I am sorry. I never edited your comments. I was under the impression that each article nominated for deletion deserevd its own entry and not be grouped. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 23:13, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
