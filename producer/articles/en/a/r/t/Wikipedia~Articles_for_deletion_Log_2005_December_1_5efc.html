<li><b>Delete</b> - possible vanity, most certainly nn; no evidence of the proposed numbering system has been peer reviewed (only source given is his own web page), so even that reduces his reputation. <a href="../../../1/4/7/User%7E147.70.242.21.html" title="User:147.70.242.21">147.70.242.21</a> 00:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Rowlett is verifiable as an actual professor at a real university and there are Google hits for "Rowlett numbering system." I dunno. There are a lot of cartoon and game characters being kept in the Wikipedia, I would tend to fall on the side that even a relatively minor math professor is more notable than, say, Homer Simpson (your mileage may vary). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li>He may be a real mathematics professor at a real college or university (but then again, so am I), but if his claim to fame is a numbering system that (based on evidence I've seen so far), has not been published in other than his personal web site, not only is his notoriety in question, but the validity of his invention <i>must</i> be called to question here as well. After all, I could devise a new set of names for larger numbers, but my proposal won't be noteworthy until and unless the mathematical community (or the academic community) accept it... or at least discuss it after reading it in a valid publication. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 04:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Redirect</b> to Rowlett and merge.</s> In fact, I've already done the merge since there was so little content to move.

<li><b>Delete</b> I was all set to vote keep until I checked this out on Google - the results were most interesting. As stated above, almost all the references to this numbering system are in Rowlett's own homepage, add-it-yourself biopgraphical sites, and Wiki mirrors. Actually, Wiki mirrors and references in other Wiki pages make up almost the entire body of hits. I can't actually find <i>any</i> verifiable external sources outside Rowlett's own pages for this information. Can anyone point me to a genuine authoritative source for this system having any currency at all beyond Rowlett and his immediate circle? If not I propose to AfD Rowlett numbering system as being at best unverifiable original research and at worst a hoax. I find it hard to believe that a genuinely significant mathematical conept would have <i>no</i> hits on <i>any</i> university math faculty sites, for example.

His own website doesn't count, for verification purposes, obviously.

<p><b>Delete</b> As sad as her story is, it isn't encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not a repository of unsolved murder cases. Article was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brooke_Wilberger_4fe9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooke Wilberger">deleted before</a>, so I nominated it for a speedy delete, but apparently this version is sufficiently different to not warrant a speedy delete.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There do seem to be a lot of MWWs on Wikipedia, though it begs the question whether this is a form of Wikipedia systemic bias (against missing American non-whites and men and non-American missing women), or whether we're just doing our duty by noting that the media found someone notable. That said, AfD isn't a legal system and I personally don't believe precedent is a particularly strong argument. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:47, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: Crime victims generally must pass the bar of having their case set precedent in real life or affect changes in the real world. (BTW, I think that MWW are particularly represented when college students. College co-ed victims are a special topic, white or non-white, as various serial killer cases will show. This may be a hangover from the anxiety of allowing women into college.) Because of the bar, the woman in Georgia who ran away and turned up in New Mexico might well make it, as she has blazed a trail by <i>getting arrested and sued</i> by her vindictive town for police resources (when she didn't report herself missing), but few others do. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:44, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Exactly right, Zat Guy: we usually put a redirect from victims to their (alas, more known) killers and merge, if there is material to merge. It's ghoulish, but it is precedent in wider media, and we are constrained to follow them (mainly because one killer will have multiple victims, and it's easier to talk about all the victims in one spot than to say the same thing about a criminal in multiple spots). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, so now I have to vote <b>keep</b> because this contains substantive and verifiable information which pertains to a case which on present evidence is notable but which, as yet, can't be merged to the alleged perp because guilt has not yet been established - and if guilt is established for this case alone the answer will be delete since single murders are almost certainly not notable.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>NO CONSENSUS</b>. It is patently absurd to call these things Laws of Energetics. The first two or three are laws of thermodynamics and have been around forever. Most of the rest are either moot or proposed. To retain this article borders on the incoherent. I hope those expounding cleanup and de-POV get their writing boots on right <i>now</i>. I came this &gt; &lt; close to deleting anyway. I would observe that unreasoned votes in a debate such as this should be rejected out of hand. The article faces serious charges of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and without justifying your vote one way or the other, you should expect short shrift from the admin trying to interpret the debate. It's pretty plain to me that this material belongs in an article about the academic, rather than an article pretending to be about principles of energetics, established or moot. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:17, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I object to the label of "pure original research". I do not admit to this. Odum proposed principles 4, 5 and 6 and their corollaries in the referenced text. There needs to be an entry which details Odum's contribution to this field. I can write a different introduction, but Odum's proposals should be kept. If one reads <b>Ecological and General Systems</b>, one will find that Odum used the principles of physics to examine, model and analyse ecological systems beginning with analog electronic circuits. This reveals more about the ignorance of the AFD nomination than of any statement of fact about Odum's work. If there is "a right way to go about this stuff" then the author is invited to comment on this in the discussion section of the article.<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 03:40, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not yet. Principles zero through four have got to go. Principle one is a quote from Sir Isaac Newton incorrectly attributed to someone from the 20th century.

I honour you all for your attention to this work. Odum was a great thinker, but we need not tribute. I get the feeling that there is some acceptance for the need of an article on energetics, and such an article might be the most appropriate place for some acknowledgement of Odum's proposals re 4th, 5th &amp; 6th principles. If the court approves of such, I seek help in merging and non-original researching the history of energetics together with a better statement of Odum's work.

<li><b>Comment</b>: it is true that H. T. Odum was one of the founders of ecology. It is equally true that many early workers in this field seized upon thermodynamics and later information theory without really having a proper understanding of these rather abstract subjects, and hence came to grief in various ways which are still not well appreciated by many ecologists. OTH, as Linas's comment shows, not many physicists or mathematicians are aware of how physics and math has been used (abused) in ecology to dress up in fancy language some very questionable ideas. My point is that I think it would be valuable to have articles addressing the uses/misuses of mathematical and physical concepts in ecology, but sadly, I don't think many are well qualified to do this. No-one should attempt who has not studied at the very least ecology, thermodynamics, and information theory textbooks at the graduate level <i>as well as</i> having studied the relevant literature in all of those subjects, which is absolutely vast. So, while I agree in principle with those who suggested that the article be kept but greatly improved, I fear that that (unless I take a hand myself) the chances of this happening anytime soon are slim indeed.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:21, 3 December 2005 (UTC) (For those who know me mainly for my gtr interests, in previous instars I studied information theory and ecology.)</li>

Odum is struggling with a legitimate question - the transformation and use of energy by life forms, particularly humans, and is genuinely attempting to use scientific concepts to deal with it, but as a hard science it falls short. He needs, as Karol said above, a better understanding of thermodynamics and information theory. I think a lot of people have picked up on the buzzwords, but have less understanding of the scientific aspects than even Odum had. It is an article about a legitimate object of study, but its going to take some serious work by some ground-based personnel to keep it from becoming a pseudo-scientific babblefest. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 18:31, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. I'm saying that a key component of Odum's ideas was the application of the electronic understanding of maximum power efficiency to ecological systems. Thus the graph and table are key components to the article and an effective rendition of his approach. I am not saying that Odum should get credit for ideas that existed in their current form before he was born. He proposed that this should be considered a principle of energetics with wider application than electronics, that it could be applied in ecology. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 06:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

People happy if we put them on the max pow theorem in the section on efficiency? <b>2.</b> This maximum power article could be deleted. <b>3.</b> People criticised the article and the principles of energetics article because it did not properly refer to the history and development of the theorem. I notice that the maximum power theorem article has no historical discussion. It would benefit from this, with examples of applications. The history of the application, might be the best place to discuss Odum's use of the theorem and suggestion that it should be considered the 4th principle of energetics?

<li><b>Comment</b>: to repeat in different words what I said in one of the other related AfDs: the immediate problem is that (as I guess) Sholto is not familiar with the physics literature, while Linas is not familiar with the ecology literature. The trouble is that almost no-one else is either! Linas: Sholto is right about Odum being notable as one of the fathers of ecology, and even about Odum's influential but questionable ideas which he is trying to describe in these articles being notable. Sholto: Linas is right that you have not written a good article even regarding a good summary of Odum's suggestions and later work in ecology, and he is even more right that to someone knowledgeable in physics, Odum's suggestions about energetics will appear rather cranky. The best solution would be for someone expert in ecology, information theory, and thermodynamics, to write much better versions of all these articles, but such a user will prove hard to find. Oh well, if nothing else at least this incident shows the value (and difficulty!) of breaking down barriers between disciplines. I suspect ecologists have more to benefit from a better understanding of thermodynamics and information theory than vice versa, but that it would be far easier to a smart physicist to read enough ecology to be able to speak the ecologists's language. Linas, if you want to spend some time, a very nice semipopular book is Paul Colinvaux, <i>Why Big Fierce Animals are Rare</i>, Princeton U Press, 1978 (also reprinted by a mass market publisher). After that, you would have to do a literature search in ecology and start sifting through literally hundreds of papers with the help of an abstracting service, then read the most relevant dozen or so. You also have to have studied a book like Cover &amp; Thomas, <i>Elements of Information Theory</i>, Wiley, 1991.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:38, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I guess I'm on the hook. Looks like <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principles_of_energetics.html" title="Principles of energetics">Principles of energetics</a> will survive the AfD, and so I shall take a shot at editing it so that it has what I might have expected to see there. I am also concerned about the technical content of <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergy.html" title="Emergy">emergy</a>: it sounds more like a concept used economics, where there are explicit equations that can value an object today based on the value that its parts may have had some time in the past. Although I know I've seen such equations in the economics lit, I certainly wouldn't be able to name these equations. Again, my complaint is that emergy sounded like something the economists have already been working on for quite a very long time and even awarded each other nobel prizes for (e.g. the <a href="../../../l/t/c/LTCM_2137.html" title="LTCM">LTCM</a> folks).<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 04:23, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to draw the courts attention to § 16.11 <b>Generalized Treatment of Linear Systems Used for Power Production</b> (in M.Tribus (1961) <i>Thermostatics and Thermodynamics</i>, Van Nostrand, University Series in Basic Engineering, p. 619). Tribus draws conclusions and variables about maximum power efficiency of thermodynamic steady state from an article by Odum, H.T. and Pinkerton, R.T., "Time's Speed Regulator," <i>American Scientist</i>, Vol. 43, No. 2, p. 331, Apr. 1955. Tribus seems to be referring to this as the founding article in the analysis of "peak power". Would anyone like to comment on the implications of this in terms of our discussion of the status of maximum power re: Odum and re: the laws of thermodynamics? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 11:19, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: This <i>is</i> a list of shops, and there is no indication that the list is presenting supermarkets of importance -- just a list of supermarkets.

<li>I was refering to a comprehensive list (that includes both ficion/non-fiction uses). A understanding of its role in popular culture arrived is best arrived at by knowing the nature, amount, and kind of its roles. By censoring a actual listing, it denies readers the abilities to come their own conclusions as easily. Also, as a side note, the prop FN90's are often actual P90s (firing blanks).

<p>This Article was an attempt to bring a bit of humour to an intellectual community, and has since been highly vandalized by two people who know the band and are purposly attempting to have the page deleted. If given the chance to fix this page, it will be made appropriate and was not intended to be selfindulgent or vulgar. If any changes should be made it should be to the deletion of the accounts of the two individuals who seem to take pleasure in vandalizying honest efforts and give little thought to the concerns of others. <i>(Note: Unsigned edit by User:209.226.83.2) -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 06:13, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's not entirely accurate. There were four different IPs trying to vandalize the article, which is how I noticed that it existed in the first place. After I got done reverting the vandalism, though, I realized that the article probably didn't meet our guidelines for band inclusion, and thus nominated it for AfD myself. We aren't thinking about deleting it because of immature edits by random people; we're thinking about deleting it because there doesn't seem to be much evidence that the band is notable enough (yet) to belong in an encyclopedia like this one. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 06:09, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Band's proper name seems to be Sutcliffe Jügend (with umlaut). Google seems to indicate that this band has a significant underground following and may have been pioneers in their genre. This <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sutcliffe+J%FCgend" class="external text" title="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sutcliffe+J%FCgend" rel="nofollow">discography</a> shows that they released on least six indy labels.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not a very high-quality article, but notability seems to be satisfied (see the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE4791DD347A97320D6913564CCBA74FB079056F7871D280450D8A02D51AC1C46B066E0DF81B0F86AB566ADFF2EA11606D9CBED5CF8D5764C40&amp;searchlink=SUTCLIFFE|JUGEND&amp;uid=CAW030512010913&amp;samples=1&amp;sql=11:5hrsa9rgu23s~T2" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE4791DD347A97320D6913564CCBA74FB079056F7871D280450D8A02D51AC1C46B066E0DF81B0F86AB566ADFF2EA11606D9CBED5CF8D5764C40&amp;searchlink=SUTCLIFFE|JUGEND&amp;uid=CAW030512010913&amp;samples=1&amp;sql=11:5hrsa9rgu23s~T2" rel="nofollow">Allmusic page</a> and Google). and I don't see any foundation for the claim of vanity. With some cleanup and wikification it could be a decent article. I've tried to fix some of the more egregious misspellings and awkward wordings, but there's a way to go. If it is keepable, arguments about quality should go on the talk page instead of here. Note: the official band site does not use the ü. However, to complicate things, the website says "Sutcliffe Jugend have decided to use the name SJ for all future recordings and Live Assaults", so maybe that's where the information should live. (Disclaimer: I've never heard of this band before, so this is not a fannish defense.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 14:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>""cleanup<i>" The first-past-the-post system has meant that the Green Party of Canada, whilst attracting 5% of the national vote has yet to gain a seat yet. The candidates for the party, however, have been some of the most influential in shaping the environmental policies of the other major parties. Mr Rankin is a rising star in the federal Greens, and is fighting a race against a strong separatist candidate. Though he may not win, he is an important player in the Green Party and thus I feel deserves an article. He is as relevant as, for example Gary Lunn, an ordinary MP. As a rising protege in the 5th largest party in Canada, and the 4th largest pro-Canada party in Canada, I feel Mr Rankin deserves mention.</i></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> OK, I <i>suppose</i> they have had or are having a "national tour". It's not the Rolling Thunder Revue, though, is it? Problem is -- and this is really getting to irritate me about D-list band articles -- is that there's almost nothing in the article that can be used to make a <i>real</i> article. "All merchandise designs, and even t-shirt screen printing is done by Hellogoodbye"... what a freaken joke. That means somebody is going to have to dig through the seamy underside of American culture and find this stuff out.

<p>Why is this article being considered for deletion? It is an interesting topic for those concerned with grassroots politics. I could easily see a high school kid, for instance, being assigned a project on grassroots politicians, and MacKenna would serve as an excellent source. I understand that Wikipedia is concerned with levels of "fame," but "Dean's Dozen" was a well-known concept, and this entry can actually benefit others.

<p>I understand that, but as I've explained to you, being a member of "Dean's Dozen" IS sufficient, in my mind. I'm not Rob MacKenna, and I can't speak for him, but I find his biography useful and interesting. I understand that the administrators are trying to maintain a positive web site, but I believe the actions of some have been heavy-handed and borderline abusive, particularly "Drini," who seems to take this far too seriously. There is no damage being done here, and people can benefit from this minor celebrity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.195.66.44 (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.195.66.44.html" title="User talk:192.195.66.44">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.195.66.44_d607.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.195.66.44">contribs</a>) 22:29, 1 December 2005.</small></p>

<dd>Well that is where we disagree. I personally don't see that being a member of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Dozen_c4c5.html" title="Dean Dozen">Dean Dozen</a> as a criteria of notability.

<p>192.195.66.44 23:24, 1 December 2005 (UTC)I think we can agree to disagree, then, without deleting the entry. This seems like a minor battle for you to be fighting. I know you Wiki people take this site EXTREMELY seriously, but you can't let your personal opinions keep the public from receiving information that could be valuable. I doubt more people in this country have heard of "Popo Bawa" than "Rob MacKenna," yet there seems to be no problem with the "Popo Bawa" entry. I ask you to reconsider this decision to delete, and back off just a bit. Thanks, and I appreciate it. 192.195.66.44 23:24, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Isn't the whole point of this endeavor to let people edit and write things? This tyrannical and arrogant attitude about deleting certain articles seems to go against what I like about this community. Everyone needs to take a step back, remember what this is all about, and just leave the site up.

<li><b>keep</b> - Dean was a major contender for the Democrat's Presidential candidate, right? And the thing he was most admired for was the way he marshalled supporters over the internet, right?

<li>If you would read my comment more carefully, you would see that I never said he was a intern, that's just another example of unremarkable people who are "members" of something that gets an article (in that example, Congressmen get articles, their interns shouldn't). All the reasons in the "keep" vote above are reasons to have a Dean article, not one for each of his unremarkable minions. How unremarkable he is is clear from the text of the article itself, which spends a significant amount of time talking about how he was a well-known internet troll. --<a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjdz_a544.html" title="User:Ajdz">Ajdz</a> 22:18, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> - This is far from a vanity page. All the delete-happy people keep saying that Dean's Dozen deserves a page. Well, what happens when someone wants more info on a particular Dean's Dozen member? What if you want to know what happened to that experiment? MacKenna's FAILURE, believe it or not, is newsworthy! It provides a lesson in American politics and depth/detail to a concept everyone agrees was interesting. Look, I can understand how some people might view this as a vanity page. But you also have to admit this is a borderline case. And I always, always believe that more information is better than less information, so in borderline cases, I will always urge Wikipedia to retain the page. Look at it this way: Keeping this page hurts no one. Deleting it potentially does hurt information-seekers. I agree with the poster who mentioned "Popo Bawa" -- I could come up with a list of 50 pages less relevant than this one. This page has been around since September, and no one would have said a word if it hadn't been valdalized, which has apparently been fixed anyway. So just let this go, move on, and everyone will be happy.</li>

<dd>There are two issues. One is that the page name Far-right is just bad grammar. The second is the confusion over the use of the terms Far Right and Extreme Right. There are several ways to solve this, as we have discussed on <a href="../../../r/i/g/Talk%7ERight-wing_politics_c0d9.html#Discussion" title="Talk:Right-wing politics">Talk:Right-wing_politics#Discussion</a>. I am arguing that the term Far Right is used differently by different authors, and I disagree that the term is always identical to "extreme right." This is disputed terrain among scholars.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 19:17, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No one (to my knoweldge) is suggesting that these terms are always used in the exact same way by everyone, all the time. No term is, but particularly not an inherantly POV term like "Far right". BTW, I could care less if the content all ends up on <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_right.html" title="Far right">Far right</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far-right.html" title="Far-right">Far-right</a>, or <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Right_54fc.html" title="Far Right">Far Right</a>, so long as its all in once place. Extreme right should simply be a redirect, based on its low number of google hits and lack of unique meaning. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So why don't we just move the page Far-right here, and then have a focused discussion about whether or not there should be a page <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_right.html" title="Extreme right">Extreme right</a>?--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 19:48, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>That</i> sounds reasonable. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:51, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree that that makes sense. We don't need 3 pages about the same thing. However, I am not entirely convinced that <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Right_2acb.html" title="Extreme Right">Extreme Right</a> == <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Right_54fc.html" title="Far Right">Far Right</a>. "Extreme" and "Far" have intrinsicly different meanings. Whilst the use of the word "Extreme Right" is less common, it is kind of like having <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Metal_8e27.html" title="Death Metal">Death Metal</a> as a kind of hyper-extension to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy Metal</a>. I don't think that anyone today disputes that the two now mean different things.

<dd>I disagree that your wording is more likely to produce the desired result; it's a needlessly over-complicated way of phrasing it, and it's not immediately obvious that it's not proposing a cut&amp;paste. We should say what we want, and what we want is for this article to be deleted and the "good" article to be moved to the correct name. The only risk is that the closing admin may forget to make the move, and surely any user who notices the omission will be able to rectify it? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:03, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope you are right, but I recently went through a vote where the majority wanted something renamed or deleted and the Admin ruled at the end of the vote that since there was no consensus to delete that simply leaving things the way they were was the proper outcome. There is a way to tag for renaming and moving and merging, as explained on this page:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>; but instead, this is a delete vote. Anyway, we can argue that the intent is clear, so maybe I am just overly sensitive to my last experience.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 23:58, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very Weak Keep with a large BUT</b>. Look at the contribution history - the article was obviously written by Daniel Hirst himself. Coming from academia, this sort of self-aggrandisation seems entirely inappropriate, and I think unless we can get someone who knows about this subject to write an unbiased peer-reviewed article, we would be better off having no article at all.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Q: is D.H. notable enough, strictly looking at the facts from his bio? A: Yes.

A: not that much, apparently. What is worse, I saw almost instantly this was an autobiography, I didn't need to look at the page history. That's why I find the argument used by Twrist even more compelling: as far as Wikipedia's integrity goes, this is not a good option. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">GregorB</a> 21:20, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. This biography is about the current leader of the Baha'is Under the Provisions of the Covenant. More work needs to be done to it and it will be tended to shortly. A simple Google of this individual brings up several dozen hits. He has authored nine press releases, been a guest on the Art Bell Coast to Coast radio show, and has been the subject of papers and a book written by the Professor Rob Balch of the U. of Montana as well as the historian Vernon Johnson. He is a central figure in the BUPC's history. He meets every requirement for a biography. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">User:Jeffmichaud</a></li>
<li><b>Definitly Keep</b>. To delete this page would be going against every standard of Wikipedia. Neal Chase has been one of the most prolific writers/contributors to the BUPC and has made more discoveries than can be counted in regards to the salient features of the truth to the Baha'i Revelation. He was the one who compiled the historical and accurate genealogy of Baha'u'llah that traces Baha'u'llah's lineage back through the Exilarchs seated on the Throne of David in Babylon,in an unbroken chain of father to son descendants of David all the way back to King David himself. He has been acknowledged by local and national media as being the one who accurately predicted the first bombing of the Trade Towers on February 26, 1993 as well as the Towers collapse on September 11, 2001 continually warning the world through press releases and published material of the exact scenario of the war in Iraq and the final attack on New York City. Neal Chase is acknowledged throughout the globe, in France, England, Austrailia, Africa, Russia, The United States, India, the Netherlands, the Dutch West Indies and the Comoroes Islands as the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, that descendant of David through Baha'u'llah who is seated at the head of the true Universal House of Justice. Whether you believe that fact or not, does not mean that it should not be given its equal space on this forum. This is the essence of Justice.

<li>KEEP <b>(duplicate vote)</b> As it is that the previous user is a member of the "Baha'i World Faith" who are in direct opposition to those who are Baha'is Under the Provisions of the Covenant, it seems that the only reason this user would seek to delete this page is that it is about a person who espouses different beliefs than his own, hardly a reason to delete other than religious prejudice. Mr. Chase has a number of published works through Page10 Publishers Inc. as well as BUPC Publishers which are neither "Dubious" or misleading or otherwise.

<p><b>Definitly Keep</b> Joseph Pepe Remey Aghsan was the adopted son and successor of Mason Remey and the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith after Mason's death. This Pepe himself attested to even though there are those who dispute with this fact. On this page, as I'm sure it will evolve, it will site letters in Pepe's own hand that testify to this important fact, that he was a Baha'i and firm supporter of Mason as well as the successor of Mason - the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. He adopted Neal Chase as his successor and this page is of utmost importance and is extremely relevant to the unfolding of the Baha'i Revelation in the world. <a href="../../../v/w/o/User%7EVwoodsong_9526.html" title="User:Vwoodsong">user:Vwoodsong</a></p>

<li><b>KEEP</b>Again, the previous user is a member of the "Baha'i World Faith" who are in open opposition to the teachings of the Baha'is Under the Provisions of the Covenant and thus want to delete any pages that profile members of the BUPC simply because he does not agree with the teachings that these individuals represent. A clear case of religious prejudice. Mr. Remey was the succeeding Guardian of the Baha'i Faith after Mason Remey who has a profile page on Wikipedia that is not in contest. Mr. Remey was an intergral part of the development of the Baha'i Faith and his page needs to be continued and expounded upon as the previous user has correctly cited the BUPC are numbered in the thousands throughout the world. <a href="../../../v/w/o/User%7EVwoodsong_9526.html" title="User:Vwoodsong">user:Vwoodsong</a></li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> In response to the question:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Has the person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in the specific field?"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pepe’s widely recognized contribution to the enduing historical record of the Baha’i Faith concerns his specific efforts and focus on preserving and rehabilitating the good name of his father Mason Remey, and the validity that in fact his father Mason was the true Guardian after Shoghi Effendi, and not a Covenant-breakers as non-authoritative people have levied against him.</p>
<p>Anyone and everyone that supported Mason as true Guardian was supported by Pepe of which he contributed a tremendous amount of personal and historical information pertaining to the Baha’i faith, which is recognized by both the Guardian groups and sans-Guardians alike.</p>
<p>In their publication “Mason Remey and Those Who Followed Him” the sans-guardians quote Pepe as an expert source and eye witness authority pertaining to the history of the Faith, the role of his father Mason, and his personal stance regarding his own role as guardian. No history of the Baha’i faith can ever be complete without the recognition of Pepe as the world’s leading eyewitness authority and chronicler concerning the person of his father Mason Remey. Though their motives are plainly to malign Mason and disparage Guardian groups, and confuse the issue, and though the do not produced the letter which Pepe had written to them, nevertheless their reliance upon Pepe as their source inherently shows his own undisputed and lasting contribution to the specific belief of the Baha’i faith – let alone the fact that he truly the guardian after Mason Remey and the grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Baha in the aghsan line. Other scholars of threw Baha’i Faith, such as, Brent M. Reed, has also commented on Pepe’s role in this as well: “letters from Mason Remey and Guiseppe Pepe, critical to understanding what really happened during the mid-1960 period of Mason's Guardianship.” (<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/boards/message_list.asp?discussionID=128960" class="external text" title="http://www.beliefnet.com/boards/message_list.asp?discussionID=128960" rel="nofollow">Reed, Beliefnet.com</a>)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The website is quite notable amongst punk fans such as myself. Although, it should probably be a disambig, with a page for the movement being the main article.

It would be better it was restructed as a representing a movement within the punk scene and not just one website (as there are more blogs out there run by conservative punks).

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town. This school is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on their own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. The article itself should be replaced by a redirect. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 12:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To any of the "keep" voters who voted "keep" automatically: please consider adopting the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> proposal instead, which I believe suggests that this article should be merged. By doing so you could hasten the adoption of a guideline which could help bring an end to these pointless and time-wasting AfD nominations. Please consider either changing your votes to "merge", or expanding the article: a couple more verifiable sentences, or a good photo of the school, would bring this undisputably over the threshold set by the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> proposal, making it a clear "keep". — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:13, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Wikipedia school proposal is a last desperate attempt to get school articles deleted against consensus. No one is going to do the mass merging anyway, so what's the point? You deletionists can't even be bothered to nominate many and merging will be more work. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 10:49, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>What nonsense. It is an attempt to get a clear consensus on the criteria for merging to prevent edit wars in the future. Merging is not more time consuming than an AFD.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This article, (and two more similarly dubious articles) are all from the same person 202.22.194.43 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.22.194.43.html" title="User talk:202.22.194.43">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.22.194.43_917a.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.22.194.43">contribs</a>). WhoIs queries show that the IP is from "Institute of Water modeling", the same institute the person promoted via copy paste jobs. My guess is that this is yet another case of some guy promoting three of his bosses, or perhaps the subject promoting himself. I'm from Bangladesh, and have never, ever seen these guys mentioned in any news papers, or technical communities.

<li>Sorry, but this is not a hoax. Ask any Welsh speaker (there are 600,000 of them). Try phoning the University of Wales.
<p>To cite the most simple of examples - "cath" = cat.</p>
<p>Now consider these instances of it occuring in a simple phrase - Mae gen i "gath" (I've got a cat - soft mutation) Ci a "chath" (dog and cat - aspitate mutation) Fy "nghath" (my cat)</p>
<p>The word is "cath", but anybody looking for either "gath", "chath" or "nghath" in a dictionary would not find it there.</p>
<p>Another example - try the town of "Porthmadog" (though not in a dictionary)</p>
<p>Dw i'n mynd i Borthmadog (I'm going to Port.)</p>

<li>I am a native Welsh speaker. I am sorry, but the complainant is uninformed. The content of the article is correct. More than that, the piece he/she has put in quotes is not a direct quote from the original article and unfairly represents what was said. I have two friends who are learning Welsh. They have real problems with mutations, and I have to say know more about the rules than me. They say their tutor often refers to treigloffobia.

<li>As has been mentioned above, the original content of this page can be easily verified by contacting the Department of Life Long Learning (Welsh Dept.), Stryd y Deon, Bangor, Wales. They will readily confirm that 9 letters of the Welsh alphabet mutate (in up to 3 ways, as stated), that a dictionary will only show the unmutated, radical, form of the verb, and that the vast majority of adult Welsh learners understandably perceive mutations to be a problem, especially when first starting. Some of these develop an irrational complex/phobia about making mutation errors, in complete disproportion to its importance. Tony.</li>
<li>The reluctance of some Welsh learners to speak - for fear of making mutation errors - and ways of addressing the problem early in order to prevent it becoming a phobia, are referred to on the following web pages -

<li><b>ALTER</b> --Somehow I knew this would happen. In my opinion Ward was first, Steve Punter second, however the systems they wrote for were highly price and not bought by the general public. Wards system worked for only a handful of people in his general area who had access via hobby. Electric Magazine was the first written for the Commodore Vic 20. The Vic 20 was considered to be a game machine and not a serious business manchine. The Commodore Vic 20 and C64 were the first affordable personal computers. As to Steve Punter...he had a system which was not really a bulletin board for the PET 32. My program predated his BBS for the newer and personal Commodore systems. I am open to an alteration and suggest words more appropriate.

<li><b>INDIFFERENT.</b> Hi, Mr. Shannon. This is Jason Scott, who did that documentary on dial-up bulletin-board systems. While I appreciate (more than most) that you have a long and respectful history with both bulletin board systems and the early personal computer revolution, I think you're going to encounter a lot of pushback and dispute calling yourself the "founder" of anything related to them. When you find yourself having to resort to semantics or trivialities (something being "too expensive" is not a reason for it not to be considered a precedent, something lacking features you later added does not make it an example of a BBS), then you're going to find that this environment, which depends utterly on semantics and trivialities, will not be welcoming. I offer you respect for your efforts at the dawn of widescale personal computing, but can't endorse your modifying history to aggrandize. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscott_f61d.html" title="User:Jscott">Jscott</a> 19:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>OK Agreed to Delete.</b> Thanks for at least some good woods Jason but I have to agree with you that getting into a semantics debate is not a cool idea. I'll just let the thing go. I'm too old to debate such things. This was the notion of a friend who worded it for me and I posted it. I see it as true but I don't want to sound like Bill Clinton defining the words. It does make me feel a bit sad however. Ah well life is that way to some of us retired folk.
<ul>
<li>Well, just so we're clear... Communitree BBS is from 1979, and ran on an Apple II, which is one of the first personal computers. (You can browse the circa-1982 commercial version's manual at <a href="http://www.flyingsnail.com/missingbbs/CommuniTree.html" class="external free" title="http://www.flyingsnail.com/missingbbs/CommuniTree.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingsnail.com/missingbbs/CommuniTree.html</a>). RBBS, which was created around 1978-1979 and implemented Ward's CBBS program, ran on both inexpensive CP/M compatible machines and later IBM PCs. (I have photos of a circa 1980 CP/M machine running a modified CBBS with notations going back a year or two by different programmers who were adding features, including both messages and file sections). Also pre-dating you by a few months are Citadel-based BBS programs, which Taren ran on a variety of computers, including the Ohio Scientific and similar brands. It's not really a debate, per se, whether you are a founder. It is a debate, and one I think you could win, that in the beginning of the story of personal computers, you were one of the guys working right there in the trenches to spread the word on these marvels. I would suggest focusing on that. --66.92.84.190 20:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I believe that Jason, being a notable historian will be able to do this better then my friends have done. I appreciate the more neutral tone that some have taken. I might note that there is another notable Bob Shannon who is a long time network DJ in NYC, This NY Bob owns bobshannon.com and he can be seaarched under that URL heading, while I have owned bobshannon.org for some time now. I mention this because at one point, Mr Shannon of New York might wish to be included in some way, shape or form under the suggested Bob Shannon name.-Sincerely Bob Shannon-Malo WA</li>
<li><b>Unusual Alterations</b> --Bob Once more here. I find it interesting that someone from Wenatchee and also from my ISP altered the present edition..and then another person from Virginia altered it to read I live in a shack. This ends up making me look more like the Uni-bomber in isolation. While we do live in relative wilderness territory, we have stores and neighbors close by. Our home was built 25 years ago and is a 3 bedroom octagon, NOT a shack. I have asked Jason Scott to rewrite the whole thing for me and do it justice. It would be appreciated if others ceased making obscure alterations. - Bob Shannon Dec 6, 2005 1:45 PCT</li>

<li>I think the publication claims made in the article would certainly satisfy notability. However, I have not been able to verify any of the publications with search engines either.

Carlos Nemer is not on either list. Despite overwhelming evidence, this just doesn't smell like a hoax.

<li><b>Comment</b>Yes, the article is improving, but currently no sources are sited and it includes references to Mr. Nemer's hobbies and interests, which are practically impossible to verify. Also, is the original author going to take ownership and continue maintaining the article?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Subject gets almost no Google hits. Short bibliography is incomplete: nearly all university professors publish papers of some sort. This fails to state share of authorship or distinguish type of publication. The subject's home country may have different academic standards from the United States, but from my knowledge of academia three baccalaureate degrees and two master's degrees is not particularly impressive in the absence of a doctoral degree. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 20:45, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I took this as consensus, but Zippy later argued that I was wrong in doing so, citing the comment he made on the earlier debate: 'as evidence of its noteworthiness, the phrase "heuristic squelch" yields 20k hits on Google, with a quick scan of the first 30 results showing that most point to this paper (~ 2 results appear to be dictionary spam pages) and the paper has been published for &gt; 3 years.' Because I may have acted improperly, I am undeleting the page and resubmitting it to the AFD. Future commenters, please consider Zippy's evidence. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EIngoolemo_dfa6.html" title="User:Ingoolemo">Ingoolemo</a>&#160;<a href="../../../i/n/g/User_talk%7EIngoolemo_94e8.html" title="User talk:Ingoolemo"><sup>talk</sup></a></p>

<dd>Briefly, the Heuristic Squelch, despite the (intentionally) silly name, is a humorous paper (like The Onion) published at UC Berkeley's main campus. The student population is over 20,000, and the paper is widely read. Given its 14 year run, a large fraction of 280k alumni (14 years x 20k students/yr) are directly aware of the paper. That, plus the Google evidence that mentioned the paper (20k matches to the phrase "heuristic squelch"), to my mind, make a very strong case that the paper is notable. For those of you tuning in, the previous vote was that it was not notable, but the first four voters of five had not seen this evidence at the time they voted. So ...</dd>

<dd><i>The student population is over 20,000, and the paper is widely read.</i> I read that as a handwaving attempt to link the student population (which is actually closer to 30,000) with the unspecified circulation figures.</dd>

<dd><i>...a large fraction of 280k alumni...are directly aware of the paper</i> A large fraction are also aware, as am I, of the statue of the pelican by the Pelican Building, the fire trail up Strawberry Canyon, the coffee house by McLaughlin Hall, La Val's Pizza, and the kiosk by the BART station which sold Chinese buns for 75 cents apiece. I doubt any of them would be considered worthy of an article, even La Val's. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - It is impossible to understand or appreciate the CRNC, one of the oldest and largest and well funded 527s operating in all 50 states with hundreds of thousands of members, without understanding Davidson's impact on it in the last election. Half the organization is still loyal to him and rabidly hates Gourley. Davidson was also a principal reformer in the California College Republicans, which has many thousands of members and does a significant amount of work for the California Republican Party and its candidates throughout the state. He may not be elected to any government post, but that doesn't mean his role in republican politics isn't significant enough to be of value to W'pedia users, particularly conservative college students interested in their principal political organization.BoomBox 17:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Michael Davidson is still involved in politics as the executive director of pro-business PAC. As suggested by earlier posters, "his" faction of the CRNC still looks to him as an inspiration and founding father. Michael Davidson's name will likely be remembered in CRNC politics for as long or longer than the current chairman, Paul Gourley, and both "establishment" and "reform" parties believe Davidson will be a significant player in politics in the future.

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b>: The claim that he was a "key player in the effort to recall Gray Davis" is ludicrous.

<li>Wikipedia doesn't exclude school clubs <i>per se</i>, any more than it excludes any other sorts of clubs <i>per se</i>. We aim to be more sophisticated than that.
<p>The first test that an article's subject has to pass is that of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. The <i>simple existence</i> of this newspaper is verifiable, as the school's <i>own</i> web site lists it as one of two newspapers. The second test that an article's subject has to pass is notability, whether the world at large has taken note of the subject, and the best litmus test for that is whether <i>anyone else</i>, independent of the subject, has found it notable enough to go to the trouble of creating some sort of non-trivial published work of their own (such as a book, a magazine feature, a paper published in a journal, or a television documentary, for examples) focussing on it. This newspaper fails that test. Researching, I cannot find anything written about this newspaper that isn't sourced directly from the newspaper itself. (Information about the newspaper <i>from</i> the newspaper suffers from the same non-neutrality, non-verifiability, and original research concerns that <i>all</i> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiographies</a> suffer from.) It's only other mentions <i>anywhere</i> are incidental and so minor as to provide no useful information about the newspaper itself (such as mentions in a list of awards to student journalists that lists the school newspaper that each works for). If someone else had, say, published a book entitled <i>The Review: 1946–2005: A history of student journalism at St John's School</i>, the newspaper would have passed the test. But there's no evidence that anything like that exists.</p>
<p>Having multiple, independent, reliable, sources is as much a part of good encyclopaedism as it is of good journalism. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:59, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>We can assure you that <i>The Review</i> has won many awards from the CSPA and the San Jacinto College Journalism Day. While we cannot find any references to the San Jacinto competition online for verification purposes, we can post some pictures of the certificates if necessary. The assertion that we overstated the number of awards won from the CSPA is false. We have won several CSPA awards in the past couple years alone. Again, while we cannot find any verification of this online, we have certificates that we could scan online. The poster also mentions that the award was given to an individual staffer and not the paper itself. <i>The Review</i> has won several awards for overall paper and front page layout.
<p>Our paper has hundreds of subscribers nationwide, and annually we sell bound copies of the year's issues. We have been a source for reliable, relevant, and provocative journalism since 1946. Certainly <i>The Review</i> deserves an entry.</p>

<li>As a member of the school in question, I feel that the newspaper has always kept everyone up-to-date on new developments. Since we only have a literary magazine that mainly only focuses on poetry and a corrupt yearbook that only puts their own pictures in the yearbook, we need the newspaper to know what is really happening at our institution. In fact, the paper is better than many other high school papers that I have seen.

<li>This discussion isn't about whether your newspaper should continue to exist.

If you want to make a case for that, please find magazine feature articles, newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, or other similar works that other people, <i>independent from your newspaper itself</i>, have published about it. Ask your teachers to help you, if you like.
<p>Don't be disappointed if you cannot find any. It just means that your newspaper is unknown to the world at large.

<li>I was going to cast a vote for speedy delete as silly vandalism when I did a Google search which came up with the links in the article. I then checked the "What Links Here" and came up with the Sarmi language links. I suspect that the vandals probably created it from scratch rather than through the links because the average vandal probably isn't aware of the Sarmi languages. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 18:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not intended to be a recipe, but an informative discussion of what goes into making cheddar. I'd happily change the content to match this, but my intention is to allow people to know what goes into the process, not specifically a recipe. Any advise toward this end would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Sorry, fairly new to this. Last entry was me. Any advise is welcome, but the process of making cheddar is more than a "recipe" in my opinion and more of a "process" - like the science behind a recipe more than the recipe itself. If this isn't intended for Wikipedia, let me know and I will do what merging I can. 17:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)JPPlautz</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's more than a recipe. Maybe title change to something like Manufacturing process for Cheddar cheese would capture the intent better.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Alright, a controversial topic, but I'll try to sum up the debate. As far as vote count goes we have 15 delete / 5 keep, the "conditional" vote at the end says the article is so poor that if not cleaned up it needs to go, and without any cleanup having taken place, it goes delete.</p>
<p>Two arguments have been put forward for deletion. The first is the way this article is laid out, at present it is an unannotated list of bluelinks, in other words, it looks like a category. I am not altogether convinced by "delete unless it's cleaned up" because AFD is not really meant to be emergency cleanup. The second, and main, complaint against the article is the difficulty of defining "White supremacist" and then deciding whether or not people fit that definition. "White supremacist" is usually considered to be a very derogatory term. Anyone calling another user a "white supremacist" here on Wikipedia would be quickly censured for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> for example. Who goes into that list, and who doesn't? Does Adolf Hitler belong? Some interesting arguments for why he <i>doesn't</i> are presented by Just Zis Guy, and whether or not I agree with them, the arguments are certainly though-provoking. Some of those arguing for delete have said that we can <i>never</i> obtain a fully satisfactory criterion, because it would mean trying to classify people according to their points of view, something which is speculation and unverifiable.</p>
<p>Arguments for "keep" presented are that the list is useful and that there should at least be an attempt to define white supremacist. One suggested definition for inclusion/exclusion on this list is whether or not the corresponding biography article states that the person is a white supremacist. It has also been pointed out that this is the <i>second</i> AFD debate, the first one, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_White_supremacists_969d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of White supremacists">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of White supremacists</a> ending with a "no consensus".</p>
<p>In my view, none of the suggested definitions appear to be fully satisfactory, defining a white supremacist based on what their Wikipedia article says appears to be somewhat self-referential. Defining a white supremacist as someone who killed a black person just because he or she is black is speculation over motives (is this a white supremacist or is the murderer just insane?) and would exclude people who profess such activity but don't actually do it. Defining it as someone who has made public statements leads to questions if the one who made them claims they were not part of a racial ideology.</p>
<p>It should be noted that for controversial topics, like this one, ending with a "no consensus" result are <i>often</i> relisted for deletion if the reasons given to delete are not satisfied or the conditions given to keep are not met within a reasonable period of time. I have read the previous AFD debate as well. Some of the "keep" voters there indeed called for clearer <i>criteria</i> for who is in and who is out of this list. At present, the only thing the article says is "This is a list of people who have been regarded as notable for their white supremacist beliefs." Regarded by whom? Themselves? Someone else? Convicted for hate crimes perhaps? An important condition for keeping the list has not been met despite a four month period since the last AFD ended.</p>
<p>To me the arguments for keeping are not strong enough to overrule a pretty large majority (75% delete). It appears we have a "rough consensus" for deletion here and I am calling this a delete decision. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:11, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This list is not and has no potential to become encyclopedic. "White supremacy" is an exceptionally vague term whose meaning depends heavily on specific cultural and temporal context. The only qualifier (apparently) is that the supremacist in question be "white." This could refer to actual skin color, or to the person's descent, or in a figurative sense to a person's sense of station and ideology.</p>
<p>I would ask of anyone who votes to keep what value this sort of general list has. For the most part it's unsourced, and might possibly qualify as original research. This isn't like a list of office-holders, which can be independently verified and which has obvious utility. It's a list of people that are deemed "white supremacist" in some manner, or deem themselves such. Today, this can run the gamut from conservative Afrikaaners to United States segregationists to members of the British National Party to German Neo-Nazis. Obviously, any term forced to comprehend such a wide spectrum loses any real meaning. Moreover, extended to the past, this term necessarily includes just about every supporter of European imperialism. Not just the Nazis, but also the Conservative and Liberal Imperialists, whose aim it certainly was to extend "white" influence over "native" (non-white) peoples. This list would then arguably have to include <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, just for starters. At the moment it also includes David Hume and Voltaire.</p>
<p>These people might fall within the vague definition of white supremacy, but only because that term has become so broad as to lose all meaning and importance. It doesn't say anything anymore. In short, this list is unencyclopedic, subjective, unverifiable, and anachronistic, and I would argue that its very nature precludes rectifying these problems. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 18:03, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Obviously, only the article about a particular person is the place with <i>sufficient number of eyeballs</i> to verify this claim (e.g., to what degree this label is valid; it must not be a simple slander; the person in question must be proved to publicly promote the white supremacy in one form or another, not just be a trivial racist, &amp;c.&amp;c.).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, cleanup.

<ul>
<li>My first question would be this: <i>how</i> it would be cleaned up? What would the criteria be? Shouldn't it have been cleaned up after the previous AFD? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 20:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>I think this is a job for a category, Mikka is right that it's important to monitor whether the articles specifically mention white supremacism. Editors on the articles would see the addition of a category and could debate the case; as-is, anybody can be added to this list without necessarily attracting the attention of those who may be best placed to verify inclusion.
<ul>
<li>That anyone can add anything to any list is already a plague of many lists, like <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, and it is dealt with. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can already see evidence of POV in this list. Nick Griffin is <i>not</i> to my knowledge a white supremacist. He <i>is</i> a racist, a thug and a thoroughly unpleasant character, but he is <i>not</i> a white supremacist by any definition I would recognise.
<ul>
<li>Then why don't you delete him and demand that his article specifically say so before he can be added here. I've alredy done this with some semi-NPOVish lists. Many of them were created on the eve of wikipedia with ots of garbage. It took certain efforts for me to convince people to give up some liberties in adding to them, but eventually these lists settled down. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is also evidence of subjectivity. By what definition of "white supremacist" does one include both Winston Churchill and Don Black? Does anybody here think those two would have seen eye to eye about <i>anything</i> of any substance?
<ul>
<li>Again: this is an issue of cleanup not deletion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The definition is also historically subjective. If you're going to include Disraeli you'd also have to include almost every Victorian public figure or writer. Why is Agatha Christie not in there? "Ten Little Niggers" and a uniformly white imperialist tone to her books, bung her on the list with Hitler and Oswald Mosley (but not, oh dear me no, not dear old Mussolini, I see)
<ul>
<li>A reasonable cutoff time is the moment when this notion gained acceptance, with some slack. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last and most importantly, it is fundamentally unverifiable. Most of those listed lived before the term "white supremacist" was even coined. Of those who didn't, many would deny the charge, some would be accused of it only by the most avidly liberal, others are so unquestionably obnoxious that mere association with them is grossly insulting and potentially actionable. How can there <i>be</i> an obvective measure of white supremacism that would fit both Eugene Terre'Blanche and Benjamin Disraeli?
<ul>
<li>Cutoff time. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 01:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Given that the term "white supremacist" is itself pejorative I think this article should be replaced by a category for those whose political activities are dominated by issues of race, which is verifiable, and see how that works out.

<li><b>Keep</b> - why are we renominating articles that already survived an AFD vote before? I suspect we'll get a similar result here. List is fine, but a bit POV.

<dd>What you have here is effectively list of people some of whose views on race would be considered obnoxious by 21st Century liberal standards. Seriously.

I'm shocked that it is not obvious to everyone that this category isn't the kind of garbage that warrants speedy deletion, worse yet survive the first nomination for deletion. As Mackensen clearly demonstrates, this category is original research POV at its very worse. The definition of white supremacy is extremely contested by historians and other academics in cultural studies. The concept is informed way too heavily by contemporary political values, not the values within the political cultures of most of the leaders listed in the category. No adequate definitions and context are possible in order to avoid POV opinions, even though in my opinion I think that the views of many of these individuals in the category would be considered "white supremacist" if they were alive today and writing the same things today. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:16, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Staying strictly neutral, I vote to <b>Keep</b> and to tighten up the criteria for inclusion to make it a strict membership. I.e. the individual must have published documentation or made public statements that espoused such beliefs. Historically there are notable individuals who have promoted ideas like this, and they have had a historical impact on European policies. So I think it's encyclopedic, even if the concept is decidedly dated and immoral for many people.&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:07, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>A very useful list is not necessarily encyclopedic. I also like the politics underlying the creation of the list. But if we are going to serve Wikipedia well, we must be intellectually honest and support the deletion of this list because it is an obvious violation of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_Point_of_View_9960.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View">Wikipedia:Neutral Point of View</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:45, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Obvious delete</b>. Cannot be verified because it categorizes people based solely on their points of view.

<li>Strictly speaking, it is not up to the AfD participants to decide which votes will and will not count, but to the closing admin, who has discretion to give less weight (or virtually no weight, in some circumstances) to votes by anons, newly registered users who are likely unfamiliar with the criteria confusion, and article authors who may be biased towards their creations. In short, unregistered users may vote, and closing admins may discount their votes. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:lightgreen"><i>BD2412</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 18:58, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b>. It's odd that someone wants to delete this article after so many years--And with no discussion! I removed those tags because the POV and style were edited to conform with wikipedia's high standards. I invented the Ubie because smoking KILLS 3000 people per DAY. This product makes money just like wikipedia's employees. Products that do not make money do not get to exist and save people's lives. This article was on wikipedia for months before some small band of goofballs decided that they only way they coudl compete with a guy who cured 27% of all cancer was to oppose him. The article is a simple encyclopedic entery about a total change in the way people smoke. Nobody would oppose this article unless they want to prevent people from learning about The Ubie or want the cigarette business for themsleves. <b>Either way. It's a crime against humanity to oppose this article.</b> It is not within wiki's charter to withold life saving information from the public on ligitimate topics covered by the site. FACT: The Ubie exists. Like <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipes.html" title="Pipes">pipes</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarettes.html" title="Cigarettes">Cigarettes</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigars.html" title="Cigars">Cigars</a> etc.. It is a smoking device unlike others. It is not simply a vaporizer which have traditionally required all kinds of plug in crap.. It is a truly portable lighter powered cigarette alternitive. This is a vital peice of information about smoking. Pipes have a page. The Ubie Has a (much more concice) Page. I was actually quite timid in introducing text about the ubie since the invention completely changes the history of Tobacco, Cigaretts and Pipes. It is a whole new concept merging aspects of each and it can save 90% of the 3000 lives that are lost every DAY to smokeing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.106.42.84 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.106.42.84_7896.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.106.42.84">contribs</a>) 17:42, December 1, 2005.</small></li>

<li>The article has no rational detractors. There is no product quite like the ubie. There are articles for cigarettes, vaporizers and pipes. The ubie fits all of them but it is also unique, which is why it has such life saving potential. It is sugested that wiki create a smokeless cigarette catagory.. That's not a bad idea.. But the ubie is not only a smokeless cigarette. It's also a pipe and a vaporizer. It's The Ubie. So it needs a page else one is constantly trying to describe that MOST cigarettes burn tobacco.. and MOST pupes burn tobacco and MOST vaporizers this or that.. The Ubie is a Ubique cultural artifact. For crying outloud.. there's an article on paperclips.. don't you think an artifact that can save 2700 lives per day warents a blerb? These people are just being stupid. The article was hotly attacked the moment it was posted which sugests some kind of motive beyind editorial precision. What is the motive for deletng it? Tobacco industry shills? I invented the ubie to save lives. What are the opposition's intentions? To jump on sandcastles? Or does the idea of squeltching schan important peice of information give them a rise? Is there an article on AZT? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.106.42.107 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.106.42.107.html" title="User talk:207.106.42.107">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.106.42.107_8d94.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.106.42.107">contribs</a>) 18:42, December 1, 2005.</small>

<li><b>why?</b> By asking for refrences, you're employing an Ad Populum fallacy. Just because this hasn't been picked up by mainstream philosophers, it doesn't mean that it's any less of a dilemma. Judge it on its own merits. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.239.186.98 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.239.186.98.html" title="User talk:66.239.186.98">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.239.186.98_8824.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.239.186.98">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Because wikipedia is not for promoting non-notable subjects. Something must first be notable in order to be documented by wikipedia. While it may have it's own merits, there is no place for it here until it is picked up by mainstream philosophers. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 14:27, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We most distinctly do <i>not</i> judge anything based on it's merits. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a textbook, and therefore includes articles on things which are notable, Whether or not those things are "good" or "bad". For example, we have discussions of various <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom.html#Historical_theories" title="Atom">models of the atom</a> which we currently believe are false. Were we to judge these based on their merits we'd find them lacking, but they're included because they're notable. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 14:49, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Hoax</b>. First, after reading this article, I'm still unclear whether this is a movie or a computer game.</p>
<p>Second, no movie listing on IMDB, &amp; a Google search fails to turn up anything.</p>
<p>Third, the only submission (2 entire edits, both to this page) of a contributor who didn't bother to create a home page.</p>
<p>Lastly, after searching on one or two actors' names in this article (neither found in IMDB), it became painfully obvious to me that these are all joke names. For example, "The Swiffness" as "Big Dick Black" or "Arrogant Worms" as "Jackagain Handhumper".</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Regardless of the article's verifiabillity using IMDB the article is a valid satire piece. I should know, I am the author. It is not a "high school production" at all. Rather it is still seeking funding for full fledged production and internet distribution. I'm sure Mel Brooks would have loved seeing his concepts marked for deletion.

<p><b>Delete</b> well-written and touching articles about two murder victims and their killer. That said, they're not encyclopedic, at least not based on what's written here. Nothing to indicate that the case broke new ground in the law, in the use of evidence, or to cause a law to be passed, all of which would certainly cause the articles to be encyclopedic. The event was certainly newsworthy, but it is simply not encyclopedic. Outside immediate friends and family, they simply will not be remembered becaused these deaths, as tragic as they were, had no impact on the wider community. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a repository of memorials.</a> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 21:57, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This murder was sadistic and caused a lot of fear in San Diego County. It took nearly 10 years to solve it. Erskine is a serial killer and rapist. I don't understand why it should be deleted it.

<li><b>Keep, Keep, Keep</b>. Three separate articles. Three good reasons to keep them. <b>1.</b> These articles should not be candidates for deletion per policy since they have encyclopedic information in them. Merger should be discussed on the talk pages of the articles. <b>2.</b> We're not writing for the future, we're writing for today. Sometime off in the distant future maybe one article. Today a large segment of the U.S. population wants to read about child murder victims not just the killer. Let's make these three articles an example of how to do it right. Please, think this through. This isn’t a smart move. Picture this: Someone writes a nice article about a child murder victim. They proudly announce it to people that care. It's deleted for lack of notability. Someone looks for the article, can’t find it, reads the deletion page, and notifies high profile child victim advocates. John Walsh, Marc Klaas, Nancy Grace, Dan Abrams, Greta Van Suteren, and more. Now picture this: Newspaper articles. Talk radio. Jimbo paired off against one of these advocates on cable news explaining why we delete well written articles about child murder victims, but keep thousands of dreadful articles. A foolish way to discover notability. <b>3.</b> This is a famous case. The boys were killed in a horrific manner. It was a cold case for almost a decade. Then a new DNA testing program was started. This case was one of the first cold cases solved by checking crime scene DNA against prisoner DNA database. <b>I suggest we close this deletion case ASAP and move the discussion to the talk pages.</b> --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 03:38, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I still don't see anything encyclopedic in these articles. Then again, I think it would be far more useful if <i>CourtTV</i> covered tennis, racketball, and other court sports instead of the overhyped celebrity-related court cases which they depend on to pay their bills. Based on this discussion, I doubt if I will nominate an article about a serial killer again. While I don't consider all such persons inherently notable, it is clear that my opinion is in the minority. Taking a look again at the articles for the two victims, they certainly don't have anything in them that convey any degree of notabilty. Their deaths while tragic are at best (or in this case worst) notable only because of who killed them and they fail to indicate why their killer was notable. They need either improvement to indicate why they are "notable" or merger. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred;">Caerwhine</small></a> 04:41, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, people can't exactly vote to keep or delete an article that doesn't yet exist, only on whether to delete the existing article, which was a blatant copyvio. Without the copyvio material there was nothing there at all. It's been deleted now, but of course that doen't stop someone writing the article as it should have been. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 16:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

So it may be necessary to make it clear that a vote is made <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prejudice_%28law%29.html" title="Prejudice (law)">without prejudice</a>, that the voter intends to allow for the possibility of recreation in a different form.

<li>As I understand it the repost thing is for where the content is identical (or as near as dammit) to the previously deleted article and therefore has already been the subject of a decision. It's about voting on an article, not a subject, after all. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 19:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is it? I question that logic. For one thing, this is a collaborative, ever-evolving project, and the contents of an article can change and evolve rapidly as time goes by. Therefore, if we look at it from the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a> point of view, an article should be deleted based on its topic, not based on its contents. A secondary extension of this argument leads us to the whole issue about undeletion. If an article is deleted, as this one might be, due to for example Copyvio, then recreation could lead to an automatic speedy deletion per one of the definitions of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>, namely recreating a previously deleted page. Therefore, a valid topic, such as this one, could be forbidden from being able to be deleted. Therefore, articles should not be deleted based on contents - they should be deleted based on the topic. By the way, is there anywhere that I can go to discuss this? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 03:48, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, of course a valid article isn't blocked from being created just because one with the same title was previously deleted -- just check out <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. There's no point in maintaining an empty page consisting only of a title just in case someone might want to write the article one day, just as pointless as voting on whether to delete or keep an article that hasn't even been written yet. Have your theoretical debate by all means, perhaps at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy</a>, but if you're going to vote on VfDs it would seem important to understand the process as it currently operates. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 14:21, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> Only 68 Google hits for Mr. Haessig. The company he worked for fares even worse, with three different defunct websites with only a blank home page being returned by Google.

<p>The page has limited use for Wikipedia. Since the products released changes constintly the page would have to be changed at least once per week. The page itself is nothing more than a group of pictures. This information could easily be done with a simple list on the Nintendo page. I suggest deletion. --<a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedi6_e417.html" title="User:Jedi6">User:Jedi6</a> December 1, 2005</p>
