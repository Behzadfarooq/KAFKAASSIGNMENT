<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - if Qur'anic literalism entails believing every word of the Qur'an to be truth, then this is something all Muslims are expected to believe by default- so there isn't much of a reason to have a separate article about it. if, and this is more likely, the article is about taking every statement of the Qur'an literally (i.e. that no parables, allegory etc. exist) then i think some satisfactory sources should be provided confirming that this topic is notable enough to merit its own article. for now though i am not convinced. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:21, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>On the Fence</b> I think this is a notable topic, I found a few references to this subject on google and an article should be written for WP, but without references, this article just doesn't cut it. The article needs major clean-up, but I don't know if it deserves deletion. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 19:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Qur'anic literalism is a very encyclopedic topic, just as <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a>. And yes, literalism and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> are two different topics. The article is verifiable, only issue is that this article does not have enought good sources at the moment, and that is an editorial issue, not a afd arguement. This issue is actualy <b>very</b> controverisal bettwen Shi'a and Salafi, Salafis insiting that God indeed has a hand (we just don't know what kind of a hand), since the Qur'an says so, while Shi'a view "hand" to mean power. And yes, we do have <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Fundamentalism_4079.html" title="Christian Fundamentalism">Christian Fundamentalism</a>. And by bringing up Ibn Taymiyya, Salafism and the bunch, you just confirm that the topic is real and notable in those circles.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 20:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Question:</b> Don't get me wrong-- I think it's good to have a lot of well-sourced articles about Islamic subjects on Wikipedia so that people can learn and broaden their horizons. <b>But do we really do justice to the Islamic topics by simply <i>mirroring</i> the Christian topics?</b> The two religions are very different and must be understood differently. The problem with this article is that <i>it doesn't actually say anything</i>. It just points to other articles that already exist (the same ones that I referenced in the above entry). In an AfD discussion we can talk about all the aspects of the article, not just the aspects pointed out by the editor who proposed the deletion. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 01:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral.</b> I proposed this article for deletion because it lacks sources. It is interesting and well written (after being edited), but surely there must be something more substantive that can be included.

<ul>
<li><b>Query:</b> It is well written "after being edited??" To what edits do you refer. I went to the article upon reading your post hoping to see improvements to the article that would change my position on deletion. I don't see any changes, unless you mean the infobox of Quranic articles on the side, but that is really only a list of articles- it doesn't say anything about Quranic literalism. <i><b>The article itself doesn't say anything about Quranic literalism</b></i>, either. It only names people and sects that are associated with the concept of Quranic literalism and links to articles already written about those people and sects. If there were anything at all substantive in the article I would change my position, but this is just a spaceholder for an idea with no actual work behind it. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Respectfully, the references that you have given in this discussion have been about Salafis, Wahabits, etc., and I don't see any that directly deal with Quranic literalism. I see only passing references to Quranic literalism. There is no article here. Even as a stub all I see is a proposal for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:OR">a synthesis of minor published references</a>. If there were one or two references cited that dealt EXACTLY with Quuranic literalism that would be a showing that there is a real plan and proposal for real work on a viable article. As it is there is no showing that anyone could make this into an informative article that is not <b>original research synthesizing minor references</b> in other published material. Show me one book or article <i><b>that an editor actually has his or her hands on</b></i> (not just a listing in Amazon.com) that deals directly with the topic of Quranic literalism. That'll change my stance right away. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 23:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, an article named "Introduction to Literal Approach of Salafi in Understanding Qur'an" is unrelated to an article about "Qur'anic literalism"? I guess we see it differently... --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:01, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That article does not identify its authors. Is an <b>essentially anonymous article that is just a few paragraphs long</b> the only thing available? The article says two things: (1) "Salafis believe in literalism." (2) "The way that Salafis believe causes problems between Muslims". It doesn't even tell us what those problems are, whcih would be interesting. The material isn't that helpful outside of a sermon in Friday prayer service. Pity the authors of that website didn't give their names or cite other references that people could go to for further reading. We have no way to <b>verify</b> that they are a <b>reliable source</b>. They are certainly a heavily biased source. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:22, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
