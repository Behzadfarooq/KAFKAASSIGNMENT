<li><b>Keep</b> I got very annoyed jumping between the different articles with information on this Wiki was the first place I came when hearing about this in order to get a un biased view and the lack of centralized article made this hard, it is redundant to have the information on multiple pages when a single centralized article could be created. This event is certainly notable, it involved many notable internet community for example something awful, newgrounds, YTMND and eBaum's World which are all considered sufficed notable to have there own articles. It is to be the subject of at least one radio show (real life not purely internet) and an article for The Inquire. It is also claimed that the FBI are involved, this IMO shows this is not ordinary forum feud.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know myself if WWWW1 is the absolute best name for this, but it made the most sense to me at the time. YTMND-Day or The Raid refer specifically to the attacks on Ebaums forums on Jan 7 and 8. That event is only part of what's been going on for the last week or so. That's why I named the article WWWW1. - <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchristl_6d06.html" title="User:Achristl">Achristl</a> 00:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I haven't even heard of any of these sites except for ebaumsworld and YTMND, and frankly, I wish I had never heard of them, because all they've ever done for me is to cause people to forward me really crappy links to stupid things on websites. And AFD is <i>Articles</i> for Deletion, not <i>Topics</i> for Deletion. This article needs to go. Nobody is calling it "World Wide Web War I". If someone wants to merge some of the information into the relevant articles on these sites, go for it.

<li>Some are nn I will admit, but YTMND, LUE (part of gameFAQ), Newgrounds (how could you not have heard of newgrounds I don’t know) and eBaum's World are all very notable. And so is Something Awful if it was involved. My comment about AFD was just meant to mean that the fact that this article is badly named is not a good reason to stop (or make difficult) a future better named article from being created. Also I have heard people call it WWW1 along with the internet war the creator of this article did not make it up, but that dose not stop it being a bad name. --<a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElfwood_93bd.html" title="User:Elfwood">Elfwood</a> 17:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So apparently the criterion for whether an article should be deleted or not is whether you've heard of the parties involved? If you really haven't heard of forums like Newgrounds or 4chan, that just means that you don't really know enough about this subject to judge whether it's notable. Your comments regarding "crappy links" pretty clearly betray your own bias against the subject matter, so I wonder why you care about this article in the first place. Also, Elfwood is right about the name. I didn't make it up, I just saw that other people have been using it. A re-name is fine with me, but a bad name does not a bad article make. - <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchristl_6d06.html" title="User:Achristl">Achristl</a> 18:56, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>rename</b>. This is hardly non-notable; the incident included a DDoS attack that broke 24 hours of continuous operation, and that's just for starters. This is <i>very important</i> to understanding the impact that eBaum's profiting from others' copyrights has had on the Internet, and beyond that it's an important sociological phenomenon on it's own. Forget <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_culture.html" title="Internet culture">Internet culture</a> for a moment. This shows just how far thousands of people will go to protect the rights of someone they barely even know over principle, to the point where they're going to lots of trouble to coordinate without a central communications location. Dismiss it as the petty actions of 12 year olds if you want, but it's clear that it was not. This was the culmination of a long-strained situation that was brought to it's breaking point. It wasn't a needless tantrum; it was an action borne out of the knowledge that nothing else was going to be done. It illustrates several aspects of social dynamics as they relate to the Internet perfectly. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 17:44, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, those who find internet culture non-notable need to pause a moment and consider the logic there. Why is it not notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia with the lofty goal of collating the sum of human knowledge, will it also exclude information on Andora as non-notable since most people in the world wouldnt know where to start looking for it on a map? I'll also add for those whinging about media coverage that I am a journalist and I know for a fact another journalist I am friends with will be devoting his radio show this weekend to the event. The show is on australian radio in Hobart, and is called Chez Geek. There will be a webcast of it in addition to a regular broadcast, but there does seem to be a good chance of it getting /.ed. --<a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearghul_15d9.html" title="User:Fearghul">Fearghul</a> 17:49, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I know that to some people this may seem boring and stupid, but, as an educated man (I'm not some emo teenager) this is worth noting. If wikipedia can have a page for the movie spaceballs (good movie by the way) it can have an article over a MAJOR INTERNET EVENT. I don't think you guys understand that thousands of people were a part of this. This is the "first ever grand scale" massive strike against a website. Whether you agree or disagree with the attack, that is irrelevant. It is your duty as a provider of information to not exclude something because it is not "pretty" to look at. Life is not always pretty. We cannot plead ignorance to events which do happen. This is real life stuff, and as long as we stick to posting the facts, which will fully come to light given time, these articles are of real merit. --The mk 555 06:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaceballs.html" title="Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a> was a movie produced by a major movie studio. It had a budget and theater take both measured in millions of dollars. How you can even begin to compare this nothing of a conflict to that is beyond me. And if you think this is the "first ever grand scale massive strike against a website" ... where have you been these past few years? <i>Yahoo</i> was taken down by a DDOS. <i>Microsoft</i> was almost taken down by a DDOS. Whitehouse.gov has been DDOS'ed. Compared to this incidents this little forum spat is nothing. Hell, have any of these sites even gone down?

Also, may I point out that calling it "Ebaum's War" is very POV, and actually rather misleading. Let's reserve the word "war" for real wars, okay?
