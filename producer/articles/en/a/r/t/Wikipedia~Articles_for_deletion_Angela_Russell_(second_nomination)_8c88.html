<dd>Yes, this is a blanket nomination. That's why this is the second nomination. The first time around, the original nominator started tacking on extra article mid-stream.

<li><b>Keep all</b> per <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>. I see that the usage of "notable" as a synonym for "interesting to me" is rearing its ugly head again: this should be stopped forthwith, please. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect information which might be "locally notable" into one place, otherwise we might as well get rid of all those articles on concepts in higher mathematics which hardly anyone contributing to this page is likely to ever either need or indeed be able to understand.

If the material is elsewhere on Wikipedia, then you really shouldn't be wasting our time trying to stamp out multiple copies, but rather simply make an edit redirecting the article to the central version.

<dd>Tony, I know you know better. In fact, the deletion policy says the exact opposite what you say it does. Under "Problems that may require deletion" on the second line of the table is "Subject of article fails one of the following consensually accepted guidelines: [...] WP:BIO (for biographies)".

JianLi makes a very good point about them not having any national notability by appearing on nationally broadcast channels. I also agree with him/her when he/she says "If we include every two-bit personality who has appeared on local TV (and that includes Jim Gardner) then Wikipedia will become an indiscriminate repository of information, vulnerable to the adding unverified information faster than we are able to verify it, cluttering the encyclopedia and pulling down its general quality." Each and every one of these people is a "two-bit personality" and that includes the people who have been not good enough to escape local TV for decades. Which leads me to wonder are some people voting to keep with their hearts, because they have seen these people for years? I really think that locals should maybe recuse themselves from the discussion since they would be bringing some bias to the table. <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irv_Weinstein_70ba.html" title="Irv Weinstein">Irv Weinstein</a> in Buffalo is just as non-notable as the rest of thsese people whose "Degree of celebrity is too localized, parochial and minor."

<li><b>Comment</b> - this blanket nomination is fraught with problems. The biggest is that the blanket seems to cover minor reportes who have been with the station a mere few months, which really doesn't make a strong case for notability.

<li>Jim Gardner does not meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards just like the rest of these people.

<li>Why must "widely" be interpreted as national or international? The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines specifically state that the criteria you are citing are <i>"not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted"</i>. The articles for each of the news anchors and reporters need to stand on their own merits. That's why I have a problem with this blanket deletion. It is a blind application of a guideline being interpreted as a rule without due consideration to a bolded admonition not to simply delete when the guidleines are not met. Achieving an iconic status within a locality works for me. For somebody like Jim Gardner, the information is verifiable, and will still be verifiable 10 years from now as he has been inducted as a broadcast pioneer. A keep for me. Applying the same sort of critical review to Angela Russell, there is a different outcome. She may become notable enough in the future, but for now, it's a delete or merge. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 19:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
