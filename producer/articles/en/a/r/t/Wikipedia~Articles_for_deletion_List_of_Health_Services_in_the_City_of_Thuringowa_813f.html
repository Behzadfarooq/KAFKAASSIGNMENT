<p>ok this is my page that we are talking about deleting i move this info from the main Thuringowa page and put a link to it on the Thuringowa city page, so can somebody please tell me why it needs to be deleted, i have seen a lot of other pages do this and they are all ok look forward to your replies <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 02:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>also i would like to add that i read this "Merged groups of small articles based on a core topic are certainly permitted" isn't this what i have done. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 04:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is currently obviously at a stub level and that is why it currently looks like a directory (although it does not have the features of a directory such as contact info, etc) but it does have the potential to become a full article, doesn't every (legitimate) stub have a right to be there because of it's potential to improve? This list has the potential to one day become a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_lists_c1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured lists">Featured List</a>, for examples: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sites_of_Special_Scientific_Interest_in_Cleveland_6e14.html" title="List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cleveland">List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cleveland</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_Paris_region_b7ed.html" title="List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region">List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oz_books_af0a.html" title="The Oz books">The Oz books</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_containing_Q_not_followed_by_U_d91d.html" title="List of English words containing Q not followed by U">List of English words containing Q not followed by U</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_member_states_6382.html" title="United Nations member states">United Nations member states</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_signatories_of_the_United_States_Constitution_111b.html" title="List of signatories of the United States Constitution">List of signatories of the United States Constitution</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Church_of_England_dioceses_4ec2.html" title="List of Church of England dioceses">List of Church of England dioceses</a>... etc. Thanks, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlec_mcc_15b6.html" title="User:Alec mcc">Alec</a> <sup>-(<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlec_mcc_3e19.html" title="User talk:Alec mcc">answering machine</a>)</sup> 06:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, WP:Not a directory. Thuringowa isn't known for it's prowess in delivering health services, which would be the only real reason for such an article. A list of health services should be a list of health serivces which have articles on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 10:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Wikipedia is not the yellow pages. Each article needs to be encyclopedic, and this is not defensible as one. The content in this article would be better included in the articles <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a> and a new article Kirwan Health Campus; also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_medical_facilities_in_Townsville_0425.html" title="List of medical facilities in Townsville">List of medical facilities in Townsville</a> could be moved to List of medical facilities in Townsville/Thuringowa or similar to incorporate the greater region. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 02:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per others - John Vandenberg's ideas regarding possible remedies of the situation have merit. The biggest problem I have with this article is the listing of trivial medical centres, which as we all know start and end without notice at any time, and hence is a list nearly impossible to maintain. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 03:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>this is a good one... first of all i was told by the person that gave the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a> its new rating, to put the lists on there own page (as i did) and now here i am being told by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> it would be better to include it in the article <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a> (this is where i took it from), and <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> tells me "we all know they start and end without notice at any time, and hence is a list nearly impossible to maintain" well i listed the major ones that have been here a long time plus as i am a local i would do the updating as needed, so i dont see any big problems here. so do what ever you people want as i have come to find that Wiki is a strange place where you do as one person tells you only to find that another 5 people don't agree ....why bother...and thanks to <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlec_mcc_15b6.html" title="User:Alec mcc">Alec</a> for seeing the potential and understanding why i moved this list to here. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 00:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Let nobody say that gathering <i>everyone</i> to come and build an encylopedia is easy or ends up being overly orderly! As a perfect example of this, you blanked the article and Zpb52 has very thoughtfully restored the prior text because your edit looked vandalish. Amongst all the confusion, an rather complete encylopedia somehow emerges. Let me clarify my own thoughts a little. Kirwan Health Campus "feels" like a notable subject, so you could move all of the content that relates to that organisation to its own article. I like what you have done moving this list over to <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Thuringowa_a2a0.html" title="City of Thuringowa">City of Thuringowa</a>, but what I was meaning was that the section "Health Services" should discuss the state of Health services in the region as a whole; and the details of each institution is probably best left to the website for each. By that I mean the current content of that section (i.e. listing the types of services that are available at "Bluewater Medical Practice") is rather fine grained information, and probably not necessary. Maybe you could find sufficient sources to justify an article on Bluewater Medical Practice. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 07:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC); updated <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
