<dd>Wow, well, I came back to look at this a couple days later, sorry for posting this, I wasn't, at the time, aware that school article's notability was so drastically different from other articles. When this was nominated it was a very small and seemingly non-notable stub. I know now that school articles are seen differently and are somewhat controversial. The idea that I am AFD spamming is a little extreme, I think this is the only school article I have ever submitted, certainly the only one in months. For the people that assumed I was doing this malevolently, I can only assure you that I wasn't. <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font color="black">cohesion</font></a><font color="#CC0033">★</font><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font color="black">talk</font></a> 07:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>In defense of those who have reacted strongly against your nomination, it can be difficult to keep track (at a glance) of whether a school on AfD is the result of a multi-nominator or not. Many WP policies and guidelines are so frequently ignored by many people on both sides of this debate and the constant level of acrimony was probably not directed at <b>you</b> specifically. Your nomination also happened to be sandwiched in with some nominations by <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComCat_ab6c.html" title="User:ComCat">User:ComCat</a>, who is a habitual nominator of schools to AFD - likely sparking the confusion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ahh, that explains a lot. Still, I would like to think this is a forum for getting consensus regarding whether or not an article should stay in wikipedia rather than an article death sentence. I don't always know how people will react when things are nominated, but at the same time I am willing to accept whatever the consensus is. I like, and will retain that view rather than the more cynical view that everything here has nominators that are fighting tooth and nail to have their article deleted. - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion"><font color="black">cohesion</font></a><font color="#CC0033">★</font><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion"><font color="black">talk</font></a> 08:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Your idealism is admirable, unfortunately a number of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" on the basis of the article being either a stub or "non-notable" have expressed the position that they engage in this process to "keep others honest" and "to see a victory of even one crappy school article deleted".--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:59, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Are you saying I am doing this, or am I just the scapegoat here? If you're going to publicly accuse me of something please have some facts to back it up.

<li>By the same user I would agree with you (and there are certainly users who do this), but I don't see any concerted effort by the nominator to repeatedly nominate schools for deletion, so assuming good faith this is not a "spam" nomination as <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> put it below.

<li>Good faith or bad faith, SPAM is SPAM. These school-type nominations are indeed excessive and they are indeed undesired.
