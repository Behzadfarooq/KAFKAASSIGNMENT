<p>The result was <b>keep</b>, no valid reason for deletion given. The deletion of the categories are not at all a precedent, because lists are utterly different from categories; they are more easily maintained, annotated, etc. This is precisely the reason why lists and categories are seperate. The article needs strident criteria for inclusion, etc. but that is outside the scope of this deletion discussion, and is being hashed out on the talk page, just as it should be.--<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_Black_def1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 22:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We've already gone through several rounds of killing categories about dead comic book characters. We need to <b>delete</b> the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dead_comic_book_characters.html" title="List of dead comic book characters">List of dead comic book characters</a>. The list is not maintainable. I found too many errors. Some will point out that the article says they could all come back. Fine. However, there are at least a quarter million dead characters in the history of comics! A few of those who were listed have been shown to be alive now (Dead Moira was an imposter) and other information was inaccurate (Captain Boomerang survived <i>Identity Crisis</i> to die in a different comic). So the article is wrong and, in fact, can never be right. Too many debatable deaths will be listed, thereby invoking POV. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 21:04, 2 September 2006 (UTC) P.S. Please pardon me if I missed a step, even with someone else helping me post this. I've never nominated an article for deletion before. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 21:10, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I voted for deletion of the categories, but I believe this is maintainable and useful as a list. To the best of my knowledge, for instance, Mysterio (Quentin Beck) is still dead -- he was replaced by his protege. -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 21:22, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As I argued during the recent Chuck Cunningham and Fonzie debates, material like this can be WP-worthy if someone is willing to watchlist it and stay on its back. I would support renaming to "List of notable dead comic book characters," but this is a list we should have. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 23:50, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't think renaming is necessary, and it's a long title already. There is currently discussion in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Comics_54b1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics</a> on merging a lot of non-notable character pages. We <i>could</i> change the criteria for inclusion to characters with pages. As the page stands now, there are none on it who don't have their own article (unless they're sharing it with other characters by the same name). -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 00:48, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Is everyone posting in this discussion really a serious comic buyer? I've been reading comics since the Sixties, and my brain hurts to imagine how ridiculously long, muddled, and inaccurate that list will get. Also, tory details are supposed to be written in the present tense in Wikipedia, also for numerous reasons. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 12:14, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not convinced there are that many notable dead characters yet. There are currently 53 characters on the list, and only 2 have stayed dead since the 1950s-1960s. The only problem with this list seems to be that it's not comprehensive, and might theoretically become long. It isn't yet. The lists on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book_death.html" title="Comic book death">Comic book death</a> (of characters who returned) are 115-strong, just counting Marvel and DC examples. I specifically voted for deletion of those categories because I felt list page did the job more elegantly and was more manageable. -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 13:27, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've also done some light work on this article (mostly looking to provide notability after it was split from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book_death.html" title="Comic book death">Comic book death</a>). I'm not attached to the article or anything but I'll note that when it was split there was <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_dead_comic_book_characters_0cc5.html" title="Talk:List of dead comic book characters">discussion</a> about changing the list chart to focus on the significance and/or impact of each character's death, improving notability and making it a genuine sub-article of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book_death.html" title="Comic book death">Comic book death</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> heh, fair question and I hadn't voted yet. I'm still mostly undecided. While I think notability is certainly attainable, my main concern is about ongoing maintenance. This kind of list has the potential to expand exponentially over time. That said, I suppose I wouldn't vote to delete based on a 'maybe' problem. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 12:27, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article needs work, but it could work very well with added notability and more defined rules. That said, I think the list should be limited to characters who have, at one point or another, starred in their own ongoing or limited series. This would keep entries like [[Superboy (Kon-El) and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> while eliminating others. That said, however, we'd have to find some sort of compromise for villains. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Zeal_c0bd.html" title="User:King Zeal">King Zeal</a> 18:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Agreed, we need some criteria for inclusion/exclusion. <i>Own series</i> seems a little too strict (what about team members? villains? Major supporting characters with years of history?). I think <i>own article</i> will do it. If truly obscure characters pop up, we can use that as a cue to clear out/merge those pages. Alternate universes are excluded <i>de facto</i> already, but that could be made clearer. Probability of return is a useless criterion. Who ever expected Aunt May to come back? -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 18:58, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The problem with <i>own article</i> is that it's easily rectified. If someone wants to have an alternate future version of the Hulk on the list for whatever reason, he would have free reign too as long as he made his own article for that character and added whatever content he deemed as "significant".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But you have a point. Therefore, I suggest we split the criteria amongst character types:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Major characters</b> - Must have held own ongoing/limited series. (ex: <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29_559e.html" title="Superboy (Kon-El)">Superboy (Kon-El)</a>)</dd>
<dd><b>Villains</b> - Must be recurring ("recurring" being defined as having faced opposing hero(es) at LEAST <i>three</i> times). (ex: <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Cold_4b6e.html" title="Captain Cold">Captain Cold</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Supporting character</b> - Must be one of the following <i>at time of death</i>.
<ul>
<li>The hero/villain's love interest. (ex: Gwen Stacey)</li>
<li>The hero/villain's "sidekick/aide/protege". (ex: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Brown_b73a.html" title="Stephanie Brown">Stephanie Brown</a>)</li>
<li>The hero/villain's "mentor". (ex: <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Mercury_7aa4.html" title="Max Mercury">Max Mercury</a>) (<i>Note: Parents/guardians should NOT count. No one cares if Batman's parents, Peter Parker's uncle, or Superman's home planet are still dead.</i>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>I also suggest explicitly excluding alternate universes (Ultimate, What If, Elseworlds, and so on), and characters in worlds where people just Don't Come Back. I've added some tentative criteria to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_dead_comic_book_characters_0cc5.html" title="Talk:List of dead comic book characters">talk page</a> -<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks">HKMarks</a> 06:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
