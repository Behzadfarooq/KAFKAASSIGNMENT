<li>He is still not worth noting, more than some people true but not enough to be included in Wikipedia. He worked in art departments of some notable Australian shows. Doesn't mean he's notable. He has worked with Latent Image Productions and Rebelstudio on WillFull which isn't notable, Latent Image Productions could be considered notable by the fact that the CEO was the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Producer_3dbd.html" title="Executive Producer">Executive Producer</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Priscilla%2C_Queen_of_the_Desert_a8a1.html" title="The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert">The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</a> but that was before Adam joined. That he was given finance to create a short film is great but if the film then doesn't do much it's not of any importance, yes it showed in a couple of film festivals where hundreds of other films may have been shown, unless the film is nominated for an award or receives acclaim then it isn't worth being noted.

The 7 news link does not mention him, his IMDb bio paints him as just another crew member. All of the links I've followed show the short films he's produced as being shown but there are no reviews of their importance, no online bio information on him outside the Australian film corporation and the only news article (the Age from melbourne) mearly notes the plot elements from <i>Luna and the Moon</i>. What we're still lacking is commentary on his importance from reliable sources. Even a news article about <i>Adam Bayliss</i> would help but I can't find that anywhere. There are mentions in the press that his films are showing at the festivals listed but no mention of Adam himself.

<p><b>*Comment</b> Well, it looks like were going down in flames here. I don't think that losing this artile will shake the pillars of WP, but neither would keeping it. I think that Adam is in the grey area of notability. Oh well; oh hell! However I think there are some confusing precedents being asserted here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Capitalistroadster says that we don't have relaible sources. But we have many citations in the bibliography. Is that because our sources are online?</dd>
<dd>(2) EdJohnston says <i>"we should be holding out for some outside press comment"</i>, what is the outside press? Is that referring to printed material?</dd>
<dd>(3) People keep saying he lacks <i>"importance"</i>, while WP Bio specifically says that "notable" is not as high of a standard as "important" or "famous".</dd>
<dd>(4) I think that people are equating the short length of the movies with a lack of impact. Because the genre is less noticed, doesn't mean it isn't noticed.</dd>
<dd>(5) People have said that the references are about his work rather than him. I think this is fallacy; when the body of work is notable so is the creator. Inherently the producers are in the background compared to the directors and actors, but their contributions are none the less notable.</dd>
<dd>(6) The author has provided some background information about Adam's TV work, but some critics above have focused on the non-notable contribution to the more famous genre, rather than look to the notable contribution to the less famous genre. It's a lack of being able to see the trees in the forrest through the clutter of underbrush -- a writting style of building to the climax, rather than putting the <b>NOTABILITY</b> in bold in the first paragraph.

<li>Kevin, I opened and viewed every single link listed under "Bibliography" and "Notes". Most of those links only cite his name, some don't even mention that and then you've got a couple that list his very, <i>very</i> minor professional TV credits. As I said, the links pad out the reference list and give the appearance of notability when in reality this guy simply isn't a notable Australian and he isn't a notable film maker. He's making not-notable shorts, some as part of courses, to send in as entries into film festivals and to community TV.

<li>Sarah, I didn't write this article. I found it at AfD in pretty poor shape and have worked to remove a lot of "puff" and focus on the only notable aspect, which is as a film producer. However, other editors have felt that citing information about his TV work was important; I moved it to the bottoom of the article to deemphasize it. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, there are links to sites which mention him as included in the festivals etc.; it's not how he is mentioned that is important, but where he is mentioned that supports the verifiability of the text. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>We seem to have different opinions on what is notable, but don't read in that I'm trying to subvert the process. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, it's an absolute stretch to call him an "award-winning Australian Film Producer" on the basis of the Raw Nerve Initiative. The Raw Nerve Initative is a partly government backed minor funding program, not an awards program. It gives a very small amount cash and very limited services to make a short film. That's it. <b>Sarah</b> 02:23, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Borderline satisfaction of notability requirements, in my opinion, so erring on the side of keep. <a href="../../../c/i/a/User%7ECiaranG_a34c.html" title="User:CiaranG">CiaranG</a> 23:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to point out that <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_International_Film_Festival_216f.html" title="Australian International Film Festival">Australian International Film Festival</a> is by no means "recognized"; it a new festival that has assumed the old name of a notable film festival, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra_International_Film_Festival_9203.html" title="Canberra International Film Festival">Canberra International Film Festival</a>. So much so that I feel a bit dirty having created the article on Wikipedia, but I had already done the research and felt it was important to point out how non-notable it was (maybe a dab page is in order). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 08:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks, I had not included the Canberra International Film Festival in the text but added it now, as his film is listed at that site --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:25, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have cut the article to reduce puff per Sarah's comments. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>*I agree with removing the citations to the "puff". I've done that in the past though and gotten into edit wars with editors who think that every piece of trivia deserves a footnote (I didn't put in those links). --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 15:18, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
