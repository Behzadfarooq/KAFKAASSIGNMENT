<li>An article entirely based on a marketing campaign with no tv show is not comparable to a show which has been running for two years that has plots and characters and spin-offs to report about.

<li>'<b>Delete</b>. I submitted the page for deletion, so my vote for delete probably speaks for itself. For the admin who reviews this, a couple of thoughts ... 1. on the David Tench discussion page someone has already noted that " ... the shows producers or Network Ten are clearly using wikipedia as a means of promotio ... if they continue reverting the content to marketroid speak I think this page needs locking or deletion .." and 2. two of the <i>Keep</i> votes on this page contain identical text ... "It is a TV show. It is coming soon." and "it's a TV show. And it's coming soon." ... given one of them is anonymously logged, it's not unreasonable to suggest that both keep votes come from the same source. The show, if and when it airs, should be recorded by Wikipedia, but under it's correct program title, and not under the banner of the network's pre-broadcast marketing.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. <b>I am not the same person:</b> Hang on... So because I re-iterate a comment someone made before, I'm suddenly the same person now? For the admin who decides this, please assume good faith and disregard Whoby's statement that everyone who wants this article kept is the same person (the same way I assume that everyone who raises Crystal Ball is not a Whoby sock-puppet). For the record, I do not work for Channel 10 or any associated media group. I simply came here to see if Wikipedia knew anything more about "David Tench" than I did.</dd>
<dd>2. <b>This is not Crystal Balling:</b> The reality is that David Tench IS an upcoming TV show. This is a verified fact. The show is coming soon (within the next month or so if the information we have to go by is correct). The article on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thank_God_You%27re_Here_97fa.html" title="Thank God You're Here">Thank God You're Here</a> started as nothing more than a stub <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_God_You%27re_Here&amp;oldid=46542955" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_God_You%27re_Here&amp;oldid=46542955" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> 5 days before the show premiered (which was the same time information was known about what it would be) and certainly not "2 years after it had plots and characters". As I also said before <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> takes this into consideration quite clearly in its opening line where it states <i>All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred.</i>. This event is verifiable and the subject matter (a TV show) would be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article had it already aired.</dd>
<dd>3. <b>People are coming here for this information:</b> It is clear that people are coming to Wikipedia to find more information about this show. What's better, nothing or a stub which clearly states "this is an upcoming TV show which Andrew Denton is behind"? If you delete the article now, it will be re-created in a few short months with the information about the marketing campaign likely mentioned under an appropriate sub-heading. Deleting the article now achieves nothing other than disappointing those who come here looking for what little further information there currently is. Yes, let's keep the marketing copy out of it (like we do many other Wikipedia articles). Yes, let's keep it to what we can verify. But no, let's not delete it simply to have it re-created a few days later when more information comes out. And if at such time a new name for the tv show becomes known, it is a simple matter to move the page to the correct title at that time. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 00:42, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Question: is David Tench a TV show or a person in a TV show? As I have said, when and if the show materialises it will get its due, but Wikipedia explicitly says it should not be used as a marketing or advertising service. This isn't a question of what you want, or what I want, it's very, very simple: Wikipedia has rules, and the David Tench entry seems in clear breach of them. IF the character of David Tench becomes noteworthy AFTER the show launches, then he (like the show) will get his due. The issue here is that Channel Ten are trying to use Wikipedia as part of their pre-launch viral marketing campaign. They've said as much in Australian newspapers. If people are curious about the ads, they can Google them. That's what Google is for. (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoby_3650.html" title="User:Whoby">Whoby</a> 02:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC))</li>

<dd>"<b>Is David Tench a TV show or a person in a TV show?</b>". David Tench is "[a] character [who] will be bringing a talk show to Channel Ten later in the year" <a href="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3193&amp;Itemid=44" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3193&amp;Itemid=44" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Whether the show is named after that character is yet to be known. If and when enough information about the character and the TV show warrant a separate article on both, then that will occur in due course. For now, a single article which refers to both is sufficient.</dd>
<dd>"<b>Wikipedia explicitly says it should not be used as a marketing or advertising service</b>". In what way does the current article advertise or market the program? Its current revision <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tench" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tench" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> states the known facts, discusses the marketing campaign and has example quotes from that campaign. As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>, Wikipedia's "rules" state "Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style". IMHO, the article currently meets that requirement. Wikipedia is allowed to talk about marketing campaigns (<a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi_Challenge_6d4a.html" title="Pepsi Challenge">Pepsi Challenge</a>).</dd>
<dd>"<b>IF the character of David Tench becomes noteworthy AFTER the show launches, then he (like the show) will get his due</b>". My argument is that the expected event is of sufficient interest that an article is warranted now. We know it is about an upcoming Television show. We know the event is going to happen. We have no reason to believe otherwise or assume this is a hoax. Such television shows (like upcoming films) are notable articles. No, I don't like that Channel 10 are trying to use Wikipedia as a marketing tool. However, like many other pages on Wikipedia whom people choose to abuse, it is up to the rest of us to ensure that non-biased, verifiable information is present and that all links to non-verified "fan-sites" or "presumed official sites" are removed, along with speculation. We should not delete the whole article simply because Channel 10 has chosen to abuse it. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 03:24, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree to the previous post. Someone please rebutt. Also note that a new commercial has come out stating that David Tench is a character on the show.

<li>And when the show launches, it will duly get an entry under its title. And if the character of David Tench is interesting or noteworthy, he might get one too.

<li>So far, there has been one mention of this in the Sydney Daily Telegraph television column. The intro states "Ten is still hoping that details of its new show from <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Denton_ef78.html" title="Andrew Denton">Andrew Denton</a>'s production company Zapruder's Other Films will fly under the radar at least for a while yet. But more bits and pieces are leaking out about the show which, for fun, let's call David Tench At Ten, Tench being the host of the show." There is very little hard information available about the show with a source speculating that the host will be different with speculation that Tench may be animated ala <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Headroom_f725.html" title="Max Headroom">Max Headroom</a>. The short article concludes "The show will be recorded Thursdays at Fox Studios and an August start is tipped."

<li><b>Keep and Modify (or even better, comment out for future use)</b> -- delete (or &lt;<i>!</i>-- comment out just in case they may be used in a subheading after the show is popular) the <b>quotes</b> that apparently make this entry a marketing gimmick.

<li><b>Keep</b> i agree with the idea of stubbing it rather than deleting it only to recreate it later. it is still an article of obvious interest - i myself went here after seeing the ads; there is no problem describing a marketing campaign <b>unbiasedly</b> (which is another discussion altogether); and i feel wikipedia has no problem being an evolving organism that is to have a "David Tench" page for the show and person before details of the show with a probably different name and therefore article, to be filled in later, have surfaced.

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't know what David Tench was, but I searched here and found it first hit, this is what wikipedia is about, information about everything. - ScipioII 13:15, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is about putting together verifiable information about things. The article can be nothing more than a series of speculations until the show comes out, in this name or another. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep'</b> This page will just come back when the show airs anyway, with infromation about the viral marketing. People will only come to this page after they've seen the ads, this wont help the viral marketing. I know I came here to find out about David Tench. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_BJ_c94f.html" title="User:Ted BJ">Ted BJ</a> 13:36, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia does not seem to be able to find verifiable references for this show. Go to a blog or search engine if you want to find out about speculation. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I came to wikipedia to find out more about the show and so have other people. Someone is going to recreate the article later when the show airs. Other future television programs are allowed to have their own article then why not this one? Erica Wellance 00:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>After the show screens the article could have some content, instead of being full of uncited <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As far as I can see, as long as the article stays neutural, it's not providing advertising for Channel Ten. There have been new ads-I only manged to see the end of one, but it does appear that David Tench is going to host/star in a show. This article is not doing anyone any harm, and as long as it doesn't turn into a list of speculations, it seems fine for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunny01_2d2f.html" title="User:Gunny01">Gunny01</a> 05:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article as it has been all along has been uncited speculation. Citing a "Chaser" article and putting up a screenshot of one of the advertisements are not enough to keep an article within the core policies of wikipedia, notably, the verifiability policy and the no original research policy. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
