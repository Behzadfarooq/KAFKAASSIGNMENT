<li><b>DELETE</b> -- This appears to be a vanity page much like the Andr√© Nilsen page. The person is not-notable, and apparently added the page himself. See the diatribe on the talk page. Even if you think this person is notable, it is just for one event, the organizing of the short failed human shield episode, and a mention on that page should be enough <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_shield_action_to_Iraq_ef54.html" title="Human shield action to Iraq">Human shield action to Iraq</a>--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 18:08, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Kenneth_O%27Keefe_d8cc.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Kenneth O'Keefe">talk page</a> for discussion on notability of human shield action and irrational denial of this on Silverback's part. It seems Silverback's prerequisite for non-notability is that it doesn't suit his politics. I'd also note that, although the human shield action didn't avert an invasion it may have played a part in stopping the US from bombing critical civilian infrastructure as they did in 1991 (a war crime), so in this regard it was a success. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 19:16, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>This man's one claim to fame is a publicity stunt, and for that we need an article to note his place of birth and marital troubles? The U.S. knew it was going to have to rebuild any infrastructure that it destroy, which is why it didn't destroy infrastructure even after the shields short stay. The shields knew it too, that is why they refused to "protect" military sites. However, despite Christiaan's presumptions, this is not about politics but about a case similar to the Andre' Nilsen affair, where there were no pointers to O'Keefe, until Christiaan, who was also a shield, planted the shield stories. How does a publicity stunt compare to winning a prestigious scholarship? Keep in mind these shields are not a part of a cohesive movement with any kind of integrity, some are not even pacifists and some (the Romanians) were even supporters of the Saddam regime.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 11:43, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's not surprising you see it in this way. The action was founded upon and relied on publicity, and, second, it doesn't suit your politics. Hence your label of "publicity stunt". I would agree that one reason the U.S. didn't target critical civilian infrastructure is because it might have to rebuild it (after all the invasion was an "investment" in self-interest) but for one critical point: lucrative reconstruction contracts are very much in the narrow interests of the U.S. power-elite. PR is another problem. Of course PR wasn't as much of a concern in 1991 because the world didn't have a laser-like focus on Iraq as they did in 2003 (which included the human shield action). The shields refused to station themselves at military sites because they were not there to protect military inrastructure but civilian infrastructure, that was bombed by the U.S. in 1991 - it's quite simple really. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 14:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>And you are being extremely dishonest Silverback</b> As for your inflammatory accusation that I "planted" the human shield stories I assume you'll be able to explain why <a href="../../../d/h/u/User%7EDhum_Dhum_eaee.html" title="User:Dhum Dhum">this user</a> is clearly the first person to mention the human shield action on Wikipedia at 01:27 on 31 Jan 2003 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Support_and_opposition_for_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq&amp;diff=632137&amp;oldid=632131" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Support_and_opposition_for_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq&amp;diff=632137&amp;oldid=632131" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> . Which is interesting because not only had I never heard of Wikipedia on the 31st of January 2003 but I was on a double decker bus traveling to Iraq at the time. Honesty is the best policy Silverback, you should try it some time. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 14:46, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, <b>DISHONEST???</b>, your example that I am dishonest is that I missed an entry that doesn't exist anymore except in a history? The worst you should be able to say is that "Silverback had bad intelligence", instead you are calling me a liar, where have we heard that before? On your talk page, you accused me not liking O'Keefe, but on the contrary I found his account engaging and quite similar with my own journey towards withholding allegiance to <b>any</b> state. You've admitted that you are no pacifist and stated you wanted to shove depleted uranium down my throat. I am more of a pacifist than you, this latest gulf war is one of the first I have considered worthy of supporting. It is one of the most moral in history, if you think that doesn't say much for the other wars in history, you are right. BTW, if you want to read O'Keefes story, the talk page is incomplete, you will have to read the fuller account in the initial entry of the history of this page I proposed for deletion. I like O'Keefe, I think he underestimated the purity of U.S. motives in this latest gulf conflict, thus was misguided in this action that is his one claim to fame, but given his bad experiences with the U.S. government perhaps his lack of objectivity is understandable.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 21:17, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Call it what you want Silverback, either way you look at it you betrayed other wikipedians by trying to make out that I was deceitful. You could have apoligised. What's the problem with Depleted Uranium, harmless as ice cream last time I talked to you. And please, let's minimise discussion of the Iraq war, your attempts to label it moral induces a strange mixture of laughter and vomit. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 22:58, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I apologize for using the term "planted", I was actually surprised I had used the term when I returned to this page and you had pointed it out. I thought I had used "posted". I want to cross it out and replace it with posted, but I am sorry to say, I don't know how.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 00:25, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well that's all fine but I didn't even "post" the human shield story, I only elaborated on what was already here <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 00:54, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The person created it himself because I suggested he do so when I first came across Wikipedia. Ken O'Keefe is of course notable; he organised the human shield action to Iraq of which there is an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> seems to be on a little anti-left-wing crusade. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 12:30, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - although I would have had a third party create the page, the person seems newsworthy enough, provided this isn't an orphan page and there are in fact Wikipedia articles that link to him. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:55, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> easily notable enough. If he or someone pretening to be him was naughty on your Talk page, that's bad, but doesn't mean this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Starblind</a> 15:03, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Stron Keep</b> - Couldn't care less about the Talk page, the article should stay. --Is Mise le M√©as, Irishpunktom 15:15, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It pains me to say <b><del>Delete</del><ins>Weak Delete</ins></b>, but I think that's the right thing to do. Much as I may agree with the guy's politics, and hold his actions in great esteem, it's an auto-biography (i.e. vanity) and very POV. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 15:34, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Upon re-reading the deletion policy, I've added "weak" to my delete vote, but think if it's kept, it deserves a {{NPOV}} tag. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 18:49, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree it's very likely an autobiography, but I don't see any POV there (can you point any out to me?) and neither POV not autiobiography alone is enough reason for deletion per the deletion policy. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Starblind</a> 16:37, Jan 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have to assume you are mistaken and talking about the talk page rather than actual page: <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_O%27Keefe_1ef6.html" title="Kenneth O'Keefe">Kenneth O'Keefe</a>. Can you review or explain what exactly is POV on <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_O%27Keefe_1ef6.html" title="Kenneth O'Keefe">Kenneth O'Keefe</a>? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 17:17, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The POV is "the Iraq invasion should have been averted". If it was written by a third-party, "Ken O'Keefe hoped he could avert the invasion of Iraq", it would have been a statement of fact (he did indeed have that hope) . Since it's written as an autobiography, it is (in my opinion) POV. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 18:14, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then it's worth noting that it <i>was</i> a <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">third party</a> who wrote that statement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kenneth_O%27Keefe&amp;diff=1653756&amp;oldid=1652707" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kenneth_O%27Keefe&amp;diff=1653756&amp;oldid=1652707" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and that such a statement is easily verifiable on the internet. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristiaan_20a6.html" title="User:Christiaan">Christiaan</a> 23:24, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Good short article, notable subject. Has the basic information so not a stub, and excellent NPOV, but we keep and improve stubs and POV articles anyway. Yes, it's <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a>, but that's not grounds for deletion either, just evidence of non-notability, and in this case we have other, better evidence. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:59, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the right response would have been a POV-check or NPOV tag, or just, you know, editing it, as has now already been done. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 00:43, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
