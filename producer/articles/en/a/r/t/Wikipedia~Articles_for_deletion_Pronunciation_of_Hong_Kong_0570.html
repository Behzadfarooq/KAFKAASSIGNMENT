<dd>I think the article should be kept, which is why I voted accordingly.

<li>Right now it includes information I removed because it was pure speculation ("'Hong Kong' only sounds somewhat similar to the Cantonese"), but Páll reinserted it without certifying it. Other than that it just explains that Hong Kong is a multilingual city (something very common all over the world) and that people who speak different languages pronounce it differently in their respective languages.

<li><b>Keep</b>; information is factual, verifiable. Merging with <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> is inappropriate, because this information is peripheral to that article, and because this article could easily be expanded (historical development of pronunciation in each language, linguistics information, the politics involved in an area with multiple pronunciations, etc.).

<li>Simple answer: we wouldn't. It's pointless, over-specific trivia that is not necessary in any way to an encyclopedic article, even on Wikipedia.

<li>Quoted from <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:naming conventions (use English)</a>: " <i>any non-Latin-alphabet native name should be given within the first line of the article (with a Latin-alphabet transliteration if the English name does not correspond to a transliteration of the native name)</i> ". In the case of "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China", "中華人民共和國香港特別行政區" is the native name, and there are many ways to transliterated it into Latin alphabets. — <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 17:56, September 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The most obvious native name is actually just "香港", while yours is the <i>full official title</i> that is only used in official documents and the likes. Stating just the common short form is not any kind of POV, but common sense. You're simply <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_lawyer.html" title="Rules lawyer">rules lawyering</a> a naming convention (not official policy), because you want a separate article for this nonsense and because you're ignoring that it's clearly mentioned in two other occasions in the same article, all visible without even scrolling down. That's not simply trying to be faithful to guidelines, but seems to me as an attempt to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">make a point</a>. Exactly what would happen if this became an exception to the convention? Would a band of rogue editors demand that X other articles follow the same format and demand a change in the naming conventions? Would representatives of the Hong Kong government angrily demand that we reinstate the way it is? No, only a few very rigid Wikipedia editors would ever care. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 10:20, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>First of all, please don't resort to calling people names.

If you want to change the titles of all of these articles, I suggest you take it up with all of the editors on each of these pages, but as long as we're citing policiies (of which there are none for what you propose and there is a lot of presedence for what was done on the Hong Kong article), why don't you go and take a look at <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 18:11, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Change <i>all</i> other country articles just because I want to make a well-motivated exception? Have you gond mad? You're not citing policy but a general guideline; these are called guidelines for a very specific reason. But if you insist on playing the rules lawyering-game, why don't you dig up the policy that says all guidlines needs to be changed to make room for small exceptions?

<li>The origins of this lie in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Talk%7EHong_Kong_7b2f.html" title="Talk:Hong Kong">talk:Hong Kong</a>, but the AfD would've come about no matter what. The initial discussion was about the lead and I was trying to explain how it's not particularly constructive to slavishly follow conventions if they result in clunky leads and conclusions like the creation of separate articles just to mention differing transcriptions and etymology trivia. I've tried to discuss this at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EPronunciation_of_Hong_Kong_a640.html" title="Talk:Pronunciation of Hong Kong">talk:pronunciation of Hong Kong</a> and by redirecting the nominated article to the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">main article</a>, but this was reverted without much attempt to discuss the matter. Furthermore, my removals of pure layman speculation concerning etymology was also reverted. What upsets me the most is that one of the pronunciation files I've recorded to be used in main articles is being used as an excuse to keep this warping of inclusion policy alive. If this goes through as an acceptable article I will have to stop recording any files like these every again, since they will only be used as just another excuse to fill Wikipedia with pointless trivia. If Hong Kong gets one, any other city where at least two major languages are spoken and has more than two sentences to describe etymology will be prime targets for further trivia-articles. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 06:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

For example, Hong Kong didnt become known as Xianggang despite the 1997 handover, another facet of the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_country%2C_two_systems.html" title="One country, two systems">one country, two systems</a> policy by Beijing. Until then, I would think this article can be <b>kept</b>.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 09:32, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Uhm, what exactly is it called if not Xianggang? And I'm not talking about the full official name. I'm talking about the common name in Standard Mandarin. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 13:26, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hong Kong is never refered to as "Xianggang" in correct English usage. (It's like saying "Wien" instead of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>). Native pronunciations have nothing to do with the English name or pronunciation. The soundfiles are there to be informative, not to serve as diction guides, or I would never make recordings in languages I'm not a native speaker of. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 14:13, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I made no suggestion that Hong Kong is refered to as "Xianggang" in English, so I do not know where your reservations lie. Meanwhile, you may be glad to know that <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas.html" title="Atlas">Atlases</a> produced around the world has increasingly adopted local spellings in placenames, so Wien is actually quite often used in world maps now. That said, you comparison of Vienna/Wien is not exactly comparable with Hong Kong/Xianggang, because Chinese does not use the roman alphabet. Both Hong Kong and Xianggang are English words, just as both Beijing and Peking are. So what are they in Chinese? 香港 and 北京 respectively!&#160;:D--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 15:31, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It seems that this is one in a series of articles that makes the point that some Wikipedia editors hate this Romanization scheme, and other Wikipedia editors hate that Romanization scheme. Unlike other voters, I actually <i>don't</i> think this article is awfully informative. That which is educational is pretty lexical. Further, the article is misnamed, as it's not about the pronunciation of the name, but rather what the orthography in the Latin alphabet reflects. That, as I said, goes back to how some hate this scheme, some that scheme. In all, it seems like a fork. If the material cannot or should not be merged to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, then it should be <b>delete</b>d as a fork, on the one hand, and as an unsearchable title, on the other.
