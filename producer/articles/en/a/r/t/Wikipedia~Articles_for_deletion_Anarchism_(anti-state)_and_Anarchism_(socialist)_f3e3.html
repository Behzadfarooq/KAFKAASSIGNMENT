<li>Although both pages, as well as various related pages, requiring a great deal of editing on several counts, and some need to be merged as well (this arrangement, for instance, vitiates the need for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">anarchism (disambiguation)</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left_anarchism.html" title="Left anarchism">left anarchism</a>), I do not believe that they need to be deleted outright.

After the dust has settled, it will probably be advisable to merge the edit histories of one of these pages with that of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, though.

<li><b>Delete</b> both and replace the anarchism page with what was there before. Anarchism has a long history of anti-state and anti-capitalism (whatever that is).

<dd>The answer to this question is that this vote is not just a show. An administrator will perform the actual deletion, but only if a large majority of the people voting vote to delete.

Delete the socialist entry. The government-and-censorship loving socialists need to keep their statist propaganda and censorship of genuine anti-statism off of the anarchism entry.

<li><b>Delete</b> both. Anarchism IS anti-statism - thats it. The state claims a monopoly on force. If the state enforces capitalism, then ALL (AC and AS) anarchists would be against that. A government, on the other hand, could mean your home owners association or even a democratic vote. It doesn't necessarily imply state-like powers since the option of secession (sell your home and move or find another union) is always available, though possibly not preferable. So I don't think ANY anarchist could be against government as long as it's voluntary (non-state sponsored). The free market implies all transactions are handled voluntarily absent any coercion. State sponsored capitalism would not be a truly free market. It seems to me that a simple definition of Anarchism would simply be anti-statism. It goes without saying that an anarchist would be against state sponsored capitalism, socialism, feminism, or communism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.238.102.176 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.238.102.176_90fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.238.102.176">contribs</a>) 18:11, 9 Jun 2005.</small></li>

<li>His reason wasn't that their theories aren't sound. His reason was that they are pro-state, therefore not anarchists. IMO he is wrong, and there are anti-statist versions of both socialism and capitalism. He's simply the other side of the 'ancaps aren't really anarchists' coin. I.e. Some intolerant ansocs can't conceive of stateless capitalism, and some intolerant ancaps can't conceive of stateless socialism. Here are some good <i>acid tests</i> for socialist anarchists: Do you think the State should outlaw sweat shops? Do you support minimum wage laws?

<li>I've had to think about this quite a bit. Emotionally, I feel like socking it to the socialists in order to support the "capitalist team"... but that wouldn't be encyclopedically sound, or NPOV. Thus... <b>Delete</b> "Anarchism (anti-state)"... though I actually agree with the content of this article more than the socialist one, it just doesn't make logical sense to have an article of this title; is there an "Anarchism (pro-state)" to contrast it to? But <b>Keep</b> "Anarchism (socialist)"; that's a distinctive political movement that deserves a page to itself, just not sole ownership of the unqualified "Anarchism" article. Then, move "Anarchism (disambiguation)" to "Anarchism", and rework it so its two most prominent links are to the two main political movements that are referred to as anarchist: "Anarchism (socialist)" and "Anarcho-capitalism". And then try to clean out some of the other debris the edit-wars have left. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan*</a> 23:28, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What is at issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The definition of anarchism.</b> Should it be defined according to its Greek roots, meaning "without political rule"? Or should it be defined according to some 19th century proponents who happened to be anti-capitalist?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Greek roots of anarchism means "without rulers", not "without political rule". Its an assumption that the -archy must refer to state politics. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillerc_2ebe.html" title="User:Millerc">millerc</a> 12:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is <i>not</i> at issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The size or importance of anarcho-capitalism</b> within the general movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this have to do with deleting Wiki articles? This is a little more complicated. Ideally, everyone could 'just get along' and create an unbiased article, with both definitions considered in a neutral manner. Practically, this approach hasn't worked well since too many people insist on their preferred definition by deleting any edits which are not in conformance. Most Wiki editors, regardless of which side of the definitional issue they support, agree to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a permanent edit war if there is only one Anarchism article.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here on this page, we are trying to decide whether to continue with the permanent edit war or 'split the question.' A vote to KEEP BOTH is saying that you think we should split the question, i.e. have a separate page for each definition. A vote for DELETE BOTH or MERGE is saying that you want to continue with a single hotly contested page, and continue the edit war. --<a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a> 20:08, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aha. Here is where we are not on the same page.

<p>In my opinion there only needs to be one main anarchism page (with a disambiguation page as well). This would be a basically socialist one ('cause that is what anarchism is). However, there should be a link to the capitalist page in the first paragraph so that people can see it if that is what they are looking for.</p>
<p>It seems that many people are trying to claim that there is simply two types of anarchism, capitalist and socialists. This is quite wrong. That are a number of different sorts of anarchism, all of them socialist (unless you happen to think that anarchism does not mean no social hierarchy or rulers, but rather simply no state). However, many anarchist violently disagree whether other forms would even work or be anarchistic. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrismw_46b5.html" title="User:Harrismw">harrismw</a> 01:44, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lets say the state as we know it disappears tomorrow. If you have a centralized plan for how everyone SHOULD live and want that plan enforced, I'd question whether you're an anarchist. In my opinion, the AC crowd has no plan and would leave it up to individuals as to how they'd live. Their version would allow the AS crowd to live out their socialist dreams as they please. On the other hand, the AS crowd seems to have plans for everyone and wouldn't be tolerant of the AC. My hunch is they'd immediately talk about outlawing the AC lifestyle - and that would require state-like powers. Honestly, I question whether or not an AS is really an anarchist (anti-state). This could be why the ACs are so adamant - they don't see the AS as serious or credible in their anarchism, and not worthy of the title anarchist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.154.113.253 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.154.113.253_04db.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.154.113.253">contribs</a>) 03:41, 11 Jun 2005.</small></dd>

<dd>Perhaps you are an individualist anarchist, a la Benjamin Tucker. Suppose a bunch of Wiki editors got it in their heads to define anarchism as anti-individualist, wrote at the top of the page that all anarchists are anti-individualist, and deleted all individualist thought from the general article except a link labeled 'not-really-anarchist' pointing to the Individualist Anarchist article.
