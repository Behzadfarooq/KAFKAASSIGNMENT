<li><b>Weak keep</b>, being the first of such a restaurant in France is notable in my opinion especially with the press the Muslim community got there.

This is getting attention in the European press and I could see someone googling this term or even searching for it in wikipedia. People writing term papers on the general topic might need information on this specific item. this is part of a backlash against Coca-colonialism among European Muslims. I am not sure, however, that the individual restaurant is not notable enough for an article, but however the term is notable enough to be searched by some and merged by us into the before mentioned article. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 17:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. Keeping this article around helps fight systemic bias on wikipedia and helps shed light on the frustrations felt by minority French Muslims. Many Americans feel that France has a coddling attitude towards those of Arab extraction due to the government's opposition to the Second Iraqi War. In reality, this could not be further from the truth. France has no form of affirmative action and many French Arabs are mired in unemployment and are victims of a form of unspoken racism. While one burger joint outside of Paris might not be notable in and of itself, the underlying social context is a valuable piece of the puzzle in gainging a grain of understanding of the racial crisis that has come to a head in modern French (and European) society. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 20:32, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed. If the only thing that can be said about this is the context it fits into, and the context is VASTLY more important, simply make an article on the situation instead of the object. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 21:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please do check, the French articles[<a href="http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050728/202/4ipo5.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050728/202/4ipo5.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] I looked at all mentioned Coca Cola, but they could be wrong I suppose. Note as well that the owners have prominently stated that they are non-political and are trying to make money. As businessmen, they saw an open market niche for halal fast food, but rather than wanting to dismantle McDonald's, a la <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Bov%C3%A9_ccbc.html" title="José Bové">José Bové</a>, they want to be McDonalds's.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the link to the French article. I was going on what I had heard in a news report a couple of months ago and could not find a citation either way in English, Spanish, or Dutch (the languages I could read. Just a quick point however; I never argued that the Beurs were "anti-American," but rather anti-globalization. These two terms are increasingly used interchangebly, which is somewhat misleading since, as you pointed out, many people that are opposed to the policies of the American government and MNCs are infatuated with the popular culture of the US. When pressed for an answer, even many Iranians, for example, will admit that they do not hate Americans, but rather the government and globalism. There are even Americans playing in the Iranian basketball league (no citation, but a search of the BBC will lead to the artilce. But I digress. As to the question of the French wikipedia's choice to delete their article, I fully respect their choice for their project, but I do not, in good faith, see how it bears on this particular discussion (see my user page for more on that), but I would, of course, welcome their imput on this discussion, if they so choose. I am, however, starting to lean back towards my "merge and redirect" vote as a result of the source you have provided, with the possibility of this article being recreated as a fork in the future if needed. I also see the logic of A man in Black's point about writing an article on the Euro-Arab trend of recreating elements of American popular culture without negative aspects of globalism. Does this sound like a good idea to others? What would be an appropriate title? <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 13:36, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
