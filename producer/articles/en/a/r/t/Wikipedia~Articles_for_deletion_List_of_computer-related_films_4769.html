<li><b>Delete</b> per Otto4711. The definition of "computer-related film", especially these days, is vague. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 07:00, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> From WP:LIST: "The list may be a valuable information source. This is particularly the case for a structured list. Examples would include lists organized chronologically, grouped by theme, or annotated lists." I agree the definition should be tightened, but the films included show that sensible criteria are being employed. Note that this list is further broken down by type, so use of categories would not be appropriate. Films are a useful source for understanding society's changing attitude toward computers.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 12:49, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> based on the ambiguity of "computer-related". That definition is a little too broad and undefined to make the list meaningful. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. All of the movies in this list deal specifically with computers, computer programs, etc. These aren't films in which a computer appears on-screen somewhere in the background for a second.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've edited the intro to define the list as including "... movies where activities involving computers play a central role in the development of the plot." If that is not clear enough, I am open to suggestions.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems to be heading for a keep, but I cannot really see the valid distinction between this and other "List of Films involving X, Y or Z" which seem to be heading more readily for deletion. Computers play a central role in our everyday lives these days, whether real or apparent, unlike 20 years ago. By the same token, computers are frequently involved in the plot of films. Films remain "modern" by becoming futuristic. The protagonist and villain in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Terminator_9e8e.html" title="The Terminator">The Terminator</a> series are cyborgs. Gone are the Bank heists by artillery (replaced by cybercrime), break-ins (now replaced by hacking), facial recognition software and wiretapping (replacing dumb security guards' surveillance), communications are now largely electronic (email, chat, blog). I think that arguably, a film such as "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27ve_Got_Mail_1c54.html" title="You've Got Mail">You've Got Mail</a>" would also qualify, because there's no email without computers; "<a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrapment_%28film%29.html" title="Entrapment (film)">Entrapment</a>" as it involves hacking into the computer security at the Petronas Tower.... Defined any more precisely, the list would be caught by "loose association". <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:53, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think "play a central role in the development of the plot" is pretty tight. Cyborgs are not computers. A movie about a bank heist where the robbers have to get past a computerized security system would not qualify as it is incidental to the plot. I think "You got mail" belongs on this list as it deals with the impact of anonymous e-mail on the protagonist's lives.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 12:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that the criteria for inclusion are tight, not loose. There are a lot of things that play a role in everyday life (cars, computers, politics, romance, weather) but it is also quite possible to have a film focused on one of these things as a main theme. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still maintain that the technology is used in most cases just to set the modern or futuristic context, and is not central to the plot in but a few cases. Let's take the <b>Matrix series</b>, which are arguably about political freedom. The Matrix is a substitute for "Big Brother" in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28film%29.html" title="1984 (film)">1984</a> - the computer therein defines the context because the explosive power of computers was not imaginable by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">Orwell</a> when he wrote his book. <b><a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I._%28film%29_613e.html" title="A.I. (film)">A. I.</a></b> is a modern-day <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio.html" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>, and is not really about computers at all, but about human adoptions/emotions, and the dilemma which is posed when a supposedly inanimate object becomes a sentient being. By my recollection, the central subjects of <b><a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_d14a.html" title="Jurassic Park">Jurassic Park</a></b> are genetic engineered dinosaurs, with computers being only a tool in that show, a bit like the computerized security system bank heisters have to get past. I think we may be caught in a debate where it is still possible to confuse the medium with the central subject. Either that, or there may still be some debate as to whether all the films included actually belong on the list. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't follow your reasoning. Why would the political symbolic elements of a film like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> totally negate its strong focus on technology? That would be like arguing that <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Wolf_8a30.html" title="Teen Wolf">Teen Wolf</a> doesn't really count as a werewolf film because it really symbolizes puberty. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:15, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Au contraire, mon ami. It's the other way around: Why would the setting and context of a film like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> totally negate its central theme, which is political freedom? What about the other films I named as examples? I contend that the problem lies not within the Matrix films, but the whold scope of this list, IMHO. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Plot devices in most fiction are employed to create situations where basic human conditions are explored. Jurassic Park is not about dinosaurs, it's about hubris and greed. It's central subjects are people. <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Dick_3f81.html" title="Moby Dick">Moby Dick</a> is not about whales. Still plot devices are important and it is interesting and appropriate to use them to group fictional works. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 11:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a>: I'm not saying that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> couldn't belong on a list of political films too. I'm just saying that having a symbolic theme (politics) doesn't negate the fact that there's a really strong focus on technology throughout the film. In other words, symbolic plot elements are not the only reason to group similar films together. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:36, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
