<dd>I see you are aiming to become an administrator, so I would appreciate some guidance. What in your opinion represents this <i>highest level</i> that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> refers to? Plus, you claim it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> but you give no reason. Would you please elaborate? I have made it clear in <i>my</i> entry why I think it passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Georgeg 16:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I’m afraid I don’t understand. I get the feeling you are either avoiding or not understanding the arguments and the issue at hand. Let me rephrase things to make it crystal clear:</dd>
<dd>WP:Bio states that a sportsman should be considered as notable if he or she <i>...performs at the highest level...</i>. I, and many others here argue that being picked to play for one's country on an international level (such as FIFA world cup or UEFA competition qualifiers) and especially against the likes of Germany, France, Ireland and so on, constitutes <b>that highest level</b>.</dd>
<dd>Now you obviously disagree with that. And fair enough, that might be your opinion. However, still in your opinion, and especially as a self confessed <b>potential future administrator</b>, what constitutes <b>that highest level</b> of achievement in a football player? In other words what should a football player need to have achieved in order <b>for you</b> to consider him or her as notable? Not in a community worker as you refer to above, (or in any other profession at hand) <b>but in a football player.</b> I expect you to have an opinion if you’ve taken the trouble to vote in this discussion. <i>(Also would you be kind enough to paste your reply in chronological order. ie below this paragraph and not above it)</i>Georgeg 23:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think there are some rules we all have to respect. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says exactly for players who have played for <b>fully proffessional league</b>. Cyprus is not a fully professional league and not only that, we are talking for a very weak championship, by which having just a participation in that league can not at all be considered notable. The level in Cyprus is generally low and not only the championship but the national team as well is very weak, one of the weakest in Europe. Getting the pride to play for such national team, can not be considered notability since, playing for such a national team cannot considered notability. This is not my POV, but however the rules in WP:BIO do not refer about national team participation, since if there was a notability by playing for national team, it would have been refered in WP:BIO. By saying highest level it does not mean playing with national team. Because national team have even, Cyprus, Faroe, Bagladesh, Somalia. It is natural that media in a report for a match will refer about player's name since he played in that match but however to be international can not be considered notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Highest level means by playing in Champions League or UEFA Cup groups, in a semi final or final of those competitions or playing in World Cup or European Championship. If he does that, even if he played for APOEL, then yes means that player is notable. I think if you want international appearances to be included, then change WP:BIO. But rules will be violated if that too non-notable player will be included.</dd>
<dd>I also recommend you to take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Football_Clubs_c635.html#Current_squad" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Clubs">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Football/Clubs#Current_squad</a>, for which players must be wikilink to have their own article. It says, (Current squad of the club. Players should only be wikilinked if notable enough to merit their own article. "Generally speaking, professional clubs should have wikilinked players, but semi-professional clubs should not". <a href="../../../k/r/b/User%7EKRBN_3818.html" title="User:KRBN">User:KRBN</a> 23:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, a semi-pro club would often have a few players whose earlier careers fit WP:BIO, so there would have some players wikified (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Albans_City_F.C._0754.html" title="St Albans City F.C.">St Albans City F.C.</a>). APOEL fit this definition and Makrides deserves to be wikified (and have an article). <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtVandelay13_daad.html" title="User:ArtVandelay13">ArtVandelay13</a> 22:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment for KRBN</b> KRBN, I would suggest you read <b>the whole</b> (and not just stick to the beginning) of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> paragraph for sports people. At the very end of the paragraph it clearly states that apart from playing in a fully professional league a player can be considered notable if he performs <b>at the highest level</b>. Now I have not noticed anyone in this discussion claim that every <a href="../../../a/p/o/APOEL_780e.html" title="APOEL">APOEL</a> player deserves a wiki article, because as it stands they might not. You seem to repeatedly overlook that <i>the argument here rests on Makrides’ achievements on the international stage</i> and not with his career in APOEL.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So would you be kind enough to clarify this for me: are you suggesting that 24 caps for the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_national_football_team.html" title="Cyprus national football team">Cyprus national football team</a> is not a notable achievement?

<dd>Also notability is not defined by the number of hits in a google search, this method of defining notability has an obvious bias towards modermn popular culture.

<p><b>Comment</b> StephP, what is the achievement? To play for a national team such as Cyprus??????????????? Cyprus may have got few good results in the last 2 of three matches, suprizes can happen howeverdon't forget how was this national team doing the last years (beating only san marino, malta and andorra). By saying that Cyprus is one of the weakest in Europe, I don't mean it is same level with Andorra. Highest level I don't mean only champ.League and Uefa Cup but also final rounds of World Cup, Euro etc.. Highest level sure are the world cup and euro final rounds and sure are much lower level (that's right cannot be defined as highest level) their qualification rounds by having teams such as Burkina Faso or Cyprus. However, I am asking you the same question, who told that highest level is just to play with national team, eventhought if this national team is Andorra or Cyprus. As about <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Valentine_f84b.html" title="Ryan Valentine">Ryan Valentine</a>, he is not having an article just because he plays for Wales NT rather that he plays for a fully professional league such as the English. Because of this, I have no right to purpose him for deletion since he satisfy the rules of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Of course you will tell me, Wrexham sure is weaker than APOEL, however, it is fact that plays in a fully professional league. If you are aksing my POV, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should have strengthen the rules of inclusion of footballers and such players, even if they are Ryan Valentine, shouldn't be even there and I would like to purpose him for deletion, however the rules are rules, anad we all must respect them in both cases about Makrides and Ryan Valentine. As for Kaiafas, despite I believe that you understand why he is considered notable, I refresh your mind that he is notable, since he won the European Golden Boot, which means top goal scorer of Europe. Becoming a European winner, there is no doubt about the notability of any player.</p>

<dd>For <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_the_North_East_f9ad.html" title="User:King of the North East">Mr King's</a> comments wikipedia's rules about notability and google search are specific and the fact that you want articles to be included up to your own ideas are obvious.</dd>

<dd>i am sorry KRBN, but to me you seem to contradict yourself. On the one hand you claim that Makrides does not meet WP:BIO criteria. On the other hand Kaiafas who (as illustrated in my previous entry) meets less of the same criteria by your definition, apparently deserves an exception due to the golden boot award. Unless I am missing something somewhere there is absolutely no reference in WP:BIO of golden boots (or any other award as a matter of fact) being a notability criterion. Don’t get me wrong, I think that Kaiafas was a great player and should never be considered for deletion, however you have to admit that by your own definitions so far, he does not meet your or WP:BIO’s notability criteria.</dd>

<dd>And yes, I agree with you. Cyprus is not the strongest football side in the world, but it is in the top 40% (73rd out of 206) of this planet. You’ve made it obvious that this is no achievement in your books but like it or not, Cyprus certainly competes at the highest level by most other editors’ opinion. So to answer your question with the thousand question marks, <b>yes</b>, I think 24 caps at international level is an admirable achievement. Unfortunately the meaning of <b>highest level</b> is not clearly defined in WP:BIO so we could go on and on and on as to what you or I think it represents. I guess we will just have to wait and see what the administrators think.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephP_6b99.html" title="User:StephP">StephP</a> 03:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't contradict myself at all. Kaiafas winning the golden boot, he became top scorer of Whole Europe!!! This is too strong reason to be called notable. Also if you want to compare those players, Kaiafas awarded in Uefa Jubille Awards as the best Cypriot footballer ever! And yes, becoming in the top of Europe is a great reason to be considered highest level Having capacity of 24 appearance with a weak nationalt team in friendlies and qualification rounds can not be compared for what Kaiafas had achieved. I will not have problem if you put that article also for deletion because it will be sure not deleted. Another last point, Imagine if any player who is international is considered notable; Andorra may have hundred footballers, same for Malta even if they play in the worst level of football and even may be someone has just one appearance.

<li>I hate repeating myself, but did you just skip this bit of my last paragraph? <i>Don’t get me wrong, I think that Kaiafas was a great player and should never be considered for deletion</i> I DON’T THINK KAIAFAS should be deleted. It is only the <b>third time</b> I am saying it! How clear can I make myself?</li>
