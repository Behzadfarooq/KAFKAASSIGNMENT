<p>The result was <b>delete</b> the list. There has been some dissent that a category would be too hard to define; this discussion, if someone wants to follow it through, should take place in the appropriate venue, which <i>isn't</i> AfD.</p>
<p>Noting the large amount of support in turning this listed into a category, I will be happy to restore this article temporarily in userspace for any user (in good standing, ie. who will not simply move it back to mainspace) who wishes to go through the list and add an appropriate category.

This is especially directed at TonyTheTiger (who noted below a request to do this); please ask when you're absolutely ready to categorise it immediately, to avoid a deleted article hanging around in userspace forever.

<li><b>Comment</b> The number of items on the list attests to the importance of such songs to modern culture. I think the list should exist somewhere.

The current version is original research (although not any more than any article on TV episodes; it is just listening to the songs and saying who gets dissed) but it just needs cleanup, not deletion.

<hr />
<p>Last year, an AfD tried to delete a number of articles about individual robots from the UK series of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot_Wars_788b.html" title="Robot Wars">Robot Wars</a>. Result was No Consensus, as it was thought some had notability (i.e. winners of series). Another AfD was suggested with a smaller batch of more obviously less notable robots. Today, many more articles have been created by a new user; these articles are often unsourced, have no context, or need rewriting. Some are about robots which fought one single bout and lost, never to be seen again. I would've thought using the 'reality show contestant' theory, these are therefore non-notable. This is a small batch to begin with, more (there are a lot) will be nominated if this AfD decides on deletion. (Or alternatively, if the decision is Redirect I will redirect all the non-notable ones in one go).</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related pages:</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Notable number in numerology which has been referenced in numerous literary works (the writings of William Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson, for a start), not to mention inspiring a major film only a few weeks ago. The article needs to be expanded and sources added, etc., but I feel the topic is notable enough to be kept. Content issues can be addressed at the article level. PS I have read the above noted and have discounted it. That's still a content issue, and not an issue as to whether this article has a place in Wikipedia. I say it does. All the note above did was make me change my opinion from "keep" to "strong keep". <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In general, yes, the rule is, even if an article is in abysmally poor condition, if there's something of merit to the subject, it's better to keep and improve it. Now it might be worthwhile to blank it in this case, but I don't know that I see a problem with the edit history being kept. Something like libel or copyvio would be grounds for deletion, but I don't know that that's true. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - They've made two movies about this number, so it's clearly notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> No article about a reasonable subject is beyond help. Since this subject has received some attention, it needs to be covered. I wouldn't mind merging it somewhere, but this seems like a content dispute, not a reason to delete. Lots of articles on Wikipedia are difficult to write, some attract the attention of some less than reasonable folks.

<li><b>Keep</b> The number 23 is notable due to it's presence in movies, several secret societies and other notable areas.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that the article is garbage, and sympathize with the plea of the nominator, but frustration over cleaning up an article is not a reason to delete it.

<p>This page has copyright violation issues which need to be addressed if the page is to survive (see talk page for further discussion). There are also questions as to whether this individual is sufficiently notable. Because the latter question is potentially nuanced, I am moving it from speedy deletion to AfD for community review. I take no stance on the issue. Closing admin: please make sure that copyvio issues are fully dealt with if the article is to be kept; right now it's in a sort of copyright twilight zone with permission from the orginal author but no explicit GFDL release from the original source material. <b><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a></b> <small><a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">JDiscourse</a></small> 01:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Mus Musculus is incorrect. The precedent is, in fact, for articles on the umbrella organizations for high school athletics <i>within an entire state,</i> and I am all for winnowing out those articles for smaller, splinter subgroups; I'm quite comfy with giving the CHSAA the heaveho too. That aside, no offense, IZAK, but just because something is known to a small percentage of Jews (sorry, that's a "small percentage of Jews interested in high school sports and living in the metro NYC area") doesn't make it "notable."

<p>After some serious searching, I can't find anything about this person. He wrote books but I can't find any reference to them. He was a PHD in nuclear engineering but I can't find any papers written by him. He is alleged to have committed suicide in 1973 as a result of Three Mile Island accident but that didn't occur until 1979. Article was written by anonymous author.

<li>Thank you for elaborating. However, I believe that the definitions of political affiliations such as "liberal" and "conservative" are far more vague -- or at least far more controversial -- than the definitions of ideologies such as "communist", "anarchist", &amp;c. Also, the arguments made against political categories (they are controversial/POV) can be applied equally as well to political lists. If we have to choose between keeping a list or keeping a category, I think that a category is the better choice. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStebbins_4720.html" title="User:Stebbins">Stebbins</a> 00:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. This "article" is an excellent example of why I gave up on the Wikipedia project months ago. How is this supposed to be useful? It is redundant to the category. Certainly, one could claim that the list could include information which a category could not convey--<i>but it isn't being used like that</i>, so it makes no difference. This is just more pointless listcruft. People like to contribute to these lists because doing so requires very little time or effort, but I have yet to see evidence that people actually find such lists useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> As far as I can tell this article is truthful. As to what to do with it, <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jambo.html" title="Jambo">Jambo</a> appears to be an incorrect usage be non Swahilli speakers in situations where Mambo should be used. So it appears we have a number of options, we can keep both, redirect Jambo to Mambo and explain the incorrect usage or redirect Mambo to Jambo as the more widely known in English even if it is incorrect. Personally, I defer to anyone who understands Swahilli to suggest the most suitable option. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP and format</b> Although this is not an actual known term, it is properly defined and basically it is coining a new term. As a clinical psychologist and dentist in SF, CA I would find it very useful in discussing certain areas of the human psyche. Wikipedia shall only thrive when it is inclusive of new, evolving terms. That is what makes english a very powerful language. It is inclusive, not exclusive. I have ascertained that the referenced work is published by Aakila Rose Publishing out of San Jose, CA and is scheduled for release April 1, 2007. And that one of the authors, doctor Salma Rashid, is the author of the article herein. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.194.88.167 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.194.88.167_c7b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.194.88.167">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Tolerate and Evolve</b>I came across this and another article due to interest in learning about a group named "Psychogenetic," some Punk-Rock or Rock group. And reading the discussion going on here, as a layperson, it sounds like stuffy old minds who have grown intolerant of advancing into new realms. I thought Wiki is suppose to be a progressive growing forum where traditional ways are at least attempted to be left behind. In reading this article I wonder why no one has actually come up with it before and made it as popular as genes or genetics. It certainly is clear that what it is defining is something that us lesser human minds do experience or have. My central point would be what do any of you deletion gents fear? It's a good concept and not a danger to anyone's sensabilities. I say use it to advertise Wiki to the masses so they can be drown here. It's creativity at its best. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ronalddavid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ronalddavid_507c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ronalddavid">contribs</a>) 19:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Must apologize, understood "AMC" as some kind of school and therefor considered the article as useless spam (i made the speedy). Nevertheless, since almost all of these couples don't have a wikipedia entry, i don't think a listing article is needed.

<p>I am listing this article for deletion as I feel the subject of the article is Non-notable - the only thing Warren P. McGuirk is suggested to be notable for is being the dean of a university &amp; having a local stadium named after him. Smells of OR &amp; seems like it was written by someone close to him. If this article can't be deleted, I'd also suggest that maybe it could be merged into a relevant article, such as the stadium or the university. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:35, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> He was the Dean of Athletics, so the naming is not absurd, but the question is whether the Athletics director at a university is notable. Many of them are. He's from U Mass Amherst.

<p><b>Introduction:</b> <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> has already been the subject of three AfD discussions and I do not lightly nor frivolously bring this 4th AfD. I reviewed the previous three AfDs and feel that they were all presented on the <s>dubious</s> <i>false premise</i> argument that the article was written as an “attack piece”. The first two AfDs were brought by Ms. Schwarz herself and the third was brought by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> at the express request of Ms. Schwarz. (Please see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_18b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz">1st</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_%282nd_nomination%29_7c7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (2nd nomination)">2nd</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barbara_Schwarz_%28third_nomination%29_624f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (third nomination)">3rd</a>.) I say <s>"dubious"</s> <i>"false premise"</i> not because I am doubting the nature of the piece in its various versions but because that is a very dubious argument for deletion. An attack piece would be corrected, not deleted, and various actions in that direction have been taken. No, I am bringing this AfD because I believe, in good faith, that this article does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> standards for inclusion. I make arguments for my position below that, I think, were previously either not made or, if touched upon, overshadowed by the nature of the previous discussions; both their focus on a improper argument and the presence of Barbara herself. Prior to bringing this AfD I <s>canvassed</s> <i>queried</i> the interested editors at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#AfD_.284th_Nomination.29" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz#AfD (4th Nomination)</a> and found more than adequate interest, in my opinion, to take this to the community for consideration. Thank you for considering my arguments.</p>
<b>Not Notable:</b> <s>Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press but is not notable.</s> <i>Barbara Schwarz has been noted in the press to a very limited extent but is not sufficiently notable for inclusion.</i> (edited - ja) Her private search for records for her private reasons gained her mention in a couple of news outlets. That is all. Below is my comment when I solicited comments at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#AfD_.284th_Nomination.29" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz#AfD (4th Nomination)</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry but the more I look at this article, the less it seems to belong here. Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper. Sorry, but lots of people are mentioned in the papers. They are not notable. For instance, I can Google <s>"most parking tickets"</s> <i>most+"parking tickets"</i><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=most+%22parking+tickets%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=most+%22parking+tickets%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and learn a lot about "McMillan Electric Co." reasons for racking up 1,497 ticket worth $74,375 in San Francisco<i>, as <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/24/MNGMPOAK521.DTL&amp;hw=McMillan&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=442" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/24/MNGMPOAK521.DTL&amp;hw=McMillan&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=442" rel="nofollow">covered</a> in some depth by the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> (correct &amp; add - ja). Certainly that does not make the firm notable enough for an article here. I could then Google them a bit more and maybe find out that they had some <a href="../../../o/s/h/OSHA_7b95.html" title="OSHA">OSHA</a> violations or filed a lawsuit or two. Still does not make them notable. But if a few editors here had a non-notable feud and dislike against "McMillan Electric Co." then they might be able to make an article that almost (but not quite) seems like it belongs here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some claim that her Usenet activity somehow contributes to her notability. Her Usenet postings are not notable for either their volume nor their content. There are lots of heavy posters on Usenet and lots of “interesting” material posted. That is not notable in itself and adds little, if anything, to any other notability. In my opinion, the only reason her Usenet activity has any “audience” here is because her postings were in vocal opposition to a small group of “anti-Scientologists” that also happen to be editors here. In my opinion, that very small group has carried their Usenet feud to these pages.</p>
<b>Non-public figure:</b> Ms. Schwarz’ FOIA requests, the basis of any notability claim, were brought as a private person for private reasons. That she got mention in the newspaper for their volume does not automatically make her sufficiently notable for inclusion in this encyclopedia. This is clearly and, at best, a “borderline case”. And <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Non-public_figures" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Non-public figures</a> states:
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm".</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
Ms. Schwarz clearly feels that she is harmed by the existence of this article and has asked for its removal. In a case of a non-public person such as this one, that carries weight for deletion.

<li><b>Comment on newsworthiness vs. encyclopedic-ness</b> - Being persistent in petitioning public agencies for private reasons does not a public person make, nor a particularly notable one. I am sure that most <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_education.html" title="Board of education">school boards</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condominium.html" title="Condominium">condominium boards</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_meetings.html" title="Town meetings">town meetings</a>, etc. etc. in America, for instance, have one or more people that show up to every meeting to make the same point over and over and over again. Sometimes those people are written up in the paper to fill up a slow news day. It is called a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_interest_story.html" title="Human interest story">human interest story</a>. Not encyclopedic. Not even particularly newsworthy but news outlets have to fill their papers or their <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">airtime</a>. The important thing to note is that these little human interest write-ups are <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephemera.html" title="Ephemera">ephemera</a>; if someone that knows the person sees it it is forgotten quickly. Not so an encyclopedia. Articles here should stand some "test of time". Barbara Schwarz does not meet notability standards for an encyclopedia. and she did not even meet the much lower newsworthiness standards for more that a few local outlets despite one story apparently going out on the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> (AP) wire, a cooperative tool for filling up newspapers and airtime. <i>Were she truly noteworthy, the AP story would have been picked by perhaps hundreds of member and non-member news organizations. There is no evidence that her story showed up as more than local filler in a small handful of outlets.</i> --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 02:04, 12 March 2007 (UTC) <small>(subsequent addition shown in <i>italics</i>.</small>)</li>
<li><b>Comment on the recent expansion of the article</b> - While <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee's</a> efforts to improve the article are appreciated, to the degree that such improvement consists of referencing public records documenting Ms. Schwarz' private efforts to uncover information for her own private reasons; to that degree such expansion does not speak to the notability of the subject. We know that she filed lots of requests with governement agencies. Such agencies are usually required to make records of such available to the public and many agencies are making to effort to make that material available on the internet. The existence of these records says nothing about notability. And actually, IMO, they add little to the article other than to make it appear more substantial than it has any right to be. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 13:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Conflicts of interest:</b> The subject of conflict of interest (COI) has been raised at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</a> in connection with both the existence of this article and with AfD discussion. There are, IMO, two clear instances of COI; cases where the involved parties have off-Wikipedia relationships with Barbara Schwarz that would cause them to be strongly biased one way or the other. That is <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a>. Steve has already stated that he is a friend of Barbara Schwarz and had told her that he would see about getting the article removed. Steve has admitted to his COI but has demonstrated that his clear intent is to respect the project and the process here. Tilman has a long history of acrimony with Ms. Schwarz on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology. The case for Tilman’s COI is made <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_Archive_10_6292.html#Tilman.E2.80.94conflict_of_interest_editing_this_article.3F" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz/Archive 10">here</a>. I will not repeat it, there are links that any interested editor can check. I also point out that Tilman proposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABarbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112127456&amp;oldid=112121555" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABarbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=112127456&amp;oldid=112121555" rel="nofollow">here</a> that I should be blocked for simply talking about another AfD which seems to be a rather extreme position that may be indicative of a COI. I propose Steve and Tilman either both vote or both limit themselves to no-vote comments. That will balance and they might as well just vote. The claim has also been made that I, as a Scientologist, have a conflict of interest in that I might think that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology and, for that reason and that reason alone, I want the article to disappear and so I have a COI. That is wrong on all counts. I do not think that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology for my own reasons that are not really germane here. I have <b>never</b> attempted to remove material critical of Scientology that is properly sourced and presented. I do want the article to disappear because I think that a petty, critical, and demeaning article on a non-notable non-public person who has repeatedly asked for it to be removed, should be removed. I am not going to recluse myself and I am not going to ask anyone with sympathies for or against Scientology to recluse themselves either. Besides the fact that such a request is neither proper nor enforceable, this is not about Scientology. This is simply about one article about one living person and a decision on whether it belongs in this encyclopedia. Thank you.</p>

<li><b>Comment - Notable</b> In the interest of providing both POVs, this is why I think she is notable. Her FOIA activity should not be looked upon as some sort of Guiness Book of World Records title, it is far more notable than that. Filing a FOIA request costs the government money, unlike the usual attempt to set a record. It costs even more money when the person filing asks the government to cover the costs. Moreover the the scope of her requests includes dozens of agencies. Below is a sample of references, it doesn't even scratch the surface of her activity.</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Thank you Anynobody. However, as court records and so forth these are primary sources.

<dd>Typically sources don't say "X is important". We are allowed to use primary sources as well as secondary sources as long as the article is not predominantly sourced from primary sources. When Person B is mentioned as holding the record for Y, we don't need anyone else to say "Person B is important." It's obvious to the casual reader that the world's record holder for Y is a notable person. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Court case documents are archived on government and legal websites for probably millions of cases and do not speak to notability. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Court case documents are also considered primary sources (and yes, primary sources exist on every person, notable or not), as are usenet posts. The use of primary sources are generally restricted to specific situations, or to bolster a secondary source which references the primary. I'll have to take a closer look at whether or not the primary sources are being used properly. Also, the fact that this is a fourth AfD is irrelevant.

This might be relevant background material if there were any real encyclopedic content in the <i>foreground</i>, but I see none - as others have commented, the record for most FOIA requests filed just doesn't cut it.

<li><b>Keep</b> In addition to the "Keep" points outlined above, the subject remains a byword within U.S. government information circles (and in the field of information-handling more generally) in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. The aspects of the article that have proved the most contentious over time (e.g., content on her personal beliefs and her relationship to Scientology) seem to me appropriate for inclusion (provided that they are, as they seem to be currently, appropriately sourced and NPOV), if for no other reason than that they are useful in fully understanding the FOIA issues raised by her actions. The subject has chosen to become, to whatever extent, a public figure, through involvement in public official processes, the press, and the Internet; a byproduct of doing so, in this day and age, is the possibility of being the subject of a WP article. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 08:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - Under the logic in your first point, it would then seem that every parent that sends their child to a public school is a public person? And every such child, too? After all, their schooling is "paid for by the public". And filing a lawsuit as a private person against a public agency does not, ipso facto, make the private individual a "public figure". Schwarz is a non-public figure.

<li>Yes, I'm quite clear on the concept of "fifteen minutes of fame". The problem remains though that she is well covered - but on the other hand, the synopsis makes her sound like she's a paranoid-delusional woman, or suffers from some other mental disorder. Whether this is the case is left to a psychiatrist, though. Strike that, and she's some woman who sued the CIA and made a s***load of FOIA requests. That said, in consideration of the way the article sounds (i.e., rather harmful), and that <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> makes a point on doing no harm (other comments above), I'm striking my previous vote. Yes, she's notable in being a record holder for FOIA requests, but this strikes me as a case of a woman who needs her privacy given any perceived mental disorders. <s><b>Weak delete</b></s>, per the "Do No Harm" clause in <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:25, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2,</a> "Do no harm" is a two way street. Barbara Schwarz is known to file frivolous and false reports to law enforcement about her perceived enemies, and spam vast amounts of defamatory libel on the Usenet about those whom she does not like which is any person who cannot accept her delusions as fact. While in Germany, her smear campaigns she ran for scientology as an operative in its notorious Guardian's Office caused much harm to the reputations of the perceived enemies of scientology. I believe this reliable, well sourced, and well enforced by community action factual biography on Wikipedia has the potential to cause her far less harm than a similar biography published on a web page or web site, which is a likely and inevitable result of being established in the wake of the vacuum left by deletion of this article. Such sites never have such the rigorous built-in protection and insistence upon verifiable data from reliable sources that any Wikipedia BLP article demands.

<li><b>Comments on Orsini's arguments</b> - 1) Orsini makes some claims that not only cannot be backed up in RS but which are really off-topic to the issue of the suitability of this subject for this encyclopedia. Even if Ms. Schwarz was "mean" to some (and I by no means take <i>that</i> for granted), that is hardly a reason for this project to be "mean" to her. "Do no harm" means just that; not "figure out if the subject deserves that harm be done to her", which seems to be Orsini's premise. 2) The concept that the existence of an article here will somehow forestall more vindictive mention on web pages is just silly. I mean, it hasn't exactly helped <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, has it? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comments on Justanother's arguments</b> - (1) The claims I have made can be backed up by simple observation and searches on Google. Are RS required for comments in AfD discussions, or does AGF prevail here? The project is not being "mean" to Schwarz in any way by insisting her article has reliable and well-sourced citations; in fact, it has been far more kind to her than she has been to those whom she has defamed and smeared by spamming the libel propaganda from the scientologist's "dead agenting" website. The hate site's front man even appears on video admitting they have no obligation to correct their mistakes. Further, the suitability of this subject for Wikipedia has already been answered by results of three previous AfDs, which favored keeping the article. (2) By comparing Barbara Schwarz to Tom Cruise: is this an admission by Justanother that Barbara Schwarz is, in fact, a public figure? As <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a> observed below, persons who wish to remain private figures <b>do not</b> publish a 90-plus part autobiography under their own name in a public medium accessible word-wide. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:08, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - <i>"By comparing Barbara Schwarz to Tom Cruise: is this an admission by Justanother that Barbara Schwarz is, in fact, a public figure?"</i> No, absolutely not. It is an observation that they are both figures hated by "anti-Scientologists", especially that insular group that frequents alt.religion.scientology. The only difference is that since Cruise is a public figure, there has been an incredible amount of "pile-on" criticism that is absent in the obscure Ms. Schwarz' case. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> -<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> you do not address the contradiction in your AfD statement, stating how the subject remains "a non-public person", after the subject published a 90-plus part autobiography, under her own name, in a public medium accessible word-wide.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Her notability is plenty established. Former cult leader, FOIA record setter, USENET celebrity, frivolous lawsuit filer. Even the Supreme Court of the United States has considered her and made her one of the only people permanently barred from the certiorari process. She is not a private figure. She voluntarily gave up that status when she became president of Church of Scientology in Germany and then again when she volunteered to be interviewed by the Salt Lake City Tribune. Her story was put on the AP Wire and spread through newspapers across the country. People that talk to reporters knowing their story will be published in a paper do not subsequently have the right to claim the details in that story are a private affair. The FOIA requests were not "in the late 80's" as user Cman suggests above. She has been making numerous FOIA requests even in this decade. Also it is inappropriate for Cman to threaten to add articles to Wikipedia that he deems unworthy just to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 19:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You left off the "IMHO" from my quote. Since I had already invoked a diff of Jimbo's comments in a reply above, I thought he should be afforded the opportunity to speak directly to this situation. It was my opinion that his previous comments related directly to this article, but I didn't want to speak for him. I suspect he would agree with me, but I could be wrong. And what is wrong with getting as many opinions as possible?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Upon further reflection, Crockspot's communication to another single editor, be it Jimbo or whomever, is his own business, and, as you say, there in no guarantee of what the net effect might be.

<li><b>Disclosure</b> - I should probably disclose that before I left Jimbo a note, I also left a note on Morton Devonshire's talk page, stating specifically that I was doing so because I knew that a lot of people watch Morty's page. If you want to call that canvassing, then fair enough. I happen to think that the reason this article was kept in the previous three AfD's is because the "votes" were overwhelmed by a minority opinion specifically interested in keeping this article. More/wider opinions are better, whatever they may be. I don't see anything wrong with letting a wider audience know about an AfD, nor do I see anything wrong with including my opinion about in in user talk space. If this is a violation, please let me know and I will modify my behavior in the future. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:28, 11 March 2007 (UTC)<b>Clarification</b> - Just to clarify, I did not leave Jimbo the note for the same reason I left Morty one.

I am sorry if you find this AfD annoying but I feel that this is the first true AfD the subject has had; the first one that was premised on a valid argument for deletion. I think that my feeling is borne out by the responses we are receiving. For my part, I fully intend to abide by the outcome of this AfD and will not bring one at any future date.

<li><b>Response to Comment by <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a></b> - Not necessarily, it depends on what else was going on when the AP ran stories that weren't picked up. For example, I imagine several AP stories weren't picked up on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> because of other events. The fact that it is worthy of AP attention speaks to notability in general. On a scale of media relevance, a person the subject of an AP item that wasn't picked up is more notable than someone who is not. It's also important to remember that media coverage alone does not determine notability. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe it is because the subject, being a former president of scientology in Germany, attracts pro-scientology editors to delete this article. Maybe it is because as the antics of the subject, one of their former leaders, have been quite bizarre. As is well known, scientologists have a history of trying to remove or truncate any material which do not represent a pro-scientology POV, or which may be seen as unfavorable to scientology. Maybe it's for those reasons. Or maybe not. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 07:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to Orsini</b> - Or maybe it is because a small group of (what I term) anti-Scientologists wants to keep this article here for their own purposes and I oppose that mis-use of this encyclopedia.

I left a link to this AfD on the Talk pages of a few editors who may have been interested in this article, as they had contributed to it in the past, and in one case because it may have interested him. I note also your "us and them" approach with who is pro-scientology and who is not; did it occur to you there are those who support the article being in Wikipedia who don't <b>care</b> about scientology, but more about the principle of retaining a reliably sourced article about a notable person in FOIA, internet abuse, <b>and</b> scientology?

Wow, Orsini, that sounds like a great way for you to contribute to this project. Because with your grand total of 12 Mainspace edits in 9 months here, you certainly are overdue. Just what is your function here, Orsini? 'Cause it looks to me like it is disruption and attack. And here you are attacking me with no proof other than your dubious word against my good record here. But I am used to it. So let's just stop the attacks on me and let this AfD run its course, shall we? This is not about me.

I will limit my future responses to attacks to the simple mention that this is not about me, and not even that if possible.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Zahakiel and Vivaldi. This is an overwhelmingly sourced article (there are a lot of FAs more poorly sourced) about a notorious, not merely a notable, person. She would not remotely be the only Wikipedia article about a person whose notoriety is based on the world believing her to be a nutcase. I'd like to finish with taking Angus and others to task for their startling revisionist view on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. To quote from that policy, "Original research is material that cannot be attributed to a reliable source." Court papers and news reports constitute the <i>very bloody definition</i> of "reliable source." I have no idea when Wikipedians got the notion that the only way information could be compiled was to pick up a book from someone who'd already done it and reword his verbiage, but that's dead wrong. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> - I think the issue is not that they aren't reliable, but that they are primary sources. Stringing together primary sources to tell a story is original research. An encyclopedia reports what others have already reported. We aren't doing investigative journalism here. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 06:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're misreading <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. Citing primary sources as backing up an assertion isn't original research. <i>Using those primary sources to draw a conclusion</i> is original research. Citing court papers to do nothing more than certify factual statements such as whether or not Schwarz has won a case and identifying the defendants in her suits, or to attribute direct quotes, is absolutely permissible. Beyond that, there are <b>twenty-four</b> cites to newspaper articles in this article. The investigative journalism's already been done, and those waving the OR! banner are not merely being needlessly officious, they're out of line. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:47, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I apologize, I thought you were referring to the voter in which case my comment would have been appropriate, I think. In answer to your question, "anti-Scientologists" feel that Ms. Schwarz reflects badly on Scientology (I do not feel that way for my own private reasons) so inclusion here is part of their attack on Scientology via Wikipedia that I reference in my "Reply to Orsini" above and in the COI sidebar. That they also get to strike back at their Usenet nemesis is thick icing and ice cream on the cake, IMO.

<li><b>Response</b> - <i>Her sole "claim" to notability is that she had an article or two written about her as filler for a local paper.</i> This statement has proven to be false, as an examination of the Talk page and the article itself will reveal.

The exact number of appearances the subject made in the German print media while the subject was the president of scientology in Germany is undetermined, although the subject’s self-published autobiography on a world-wide medium under her own name – this <i>non public person</i> according to you – states media articles appeared about her there. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother,</a> this AfD is based on faulty and misleading premises, and has been brought only to remove an article unfavorable to the image of scientology.

I could probably tell you a lot about me that would be interesting and I would be interested to know about you, too. Interesting, yes. But that is about it. But it does speak to why she got the little bit of press that she did. News outlets have to fill their papers and their airtime. So they write stories about things that they feel might be interesting. In this case a private person pursuing her private interests for private reasons with "interesting" motivation and to an "interesting" extent. A few local news outlets thought it interesting enough to spend a few paragraphs or a few minutes on. Not even 15 minutes of fame. Two minutes of limited mention, not fame, and a lifetime of exposure here. Seems a bit unbalanced, doesn't it (no pun intended)? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>BTW - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, I'm curious. I said all you were here for was getting negative aspects about the "church" deleted. You said check your "edit history". Was that a bluff? I'm confused. Orsini just mentioned that you've had over 500 edits since March 5th, and to me it all looks Scientology related - nothing in favor of only delete. When I accuse you of "Justanother is only here to delete everything on Wikipedia that is remotely negative to Scientology", you shouldn't get angry. You should just nod your head and agree. It's not a big deal if you're that one sided, I think other people should just be aware of what you're main intention here is. It's the same deal with Barbara Schwarz. People need to be aware of crazy Scientologists. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulhorner_4a3d.html" title="User:Paulhorner">Paulhorner</a> 22:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article isn't about anything. Or, its title is an unencyclopedic intersection of two things, and its content is mostly something else entirely. It's like having an article titled potatoes and cheese that talks about whether or not cows will eat yams.</p>
<p>The article describes, briefly, several evolutionary phenomena that are almost entirely unrelated to ethics. The single sentence that does attempt to make a connection has a {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag. Arguments like what this article is trying to advance - that kin selection and reciprocal altruism are relevant as formative processes in the evolution of human psychology - have been made in the literature, but aren't covered at all here, and belong in the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> article in any case.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> The title is wrong: it should be "Evolutionary ethics" but I do not want to move it during the AfD. (There is a name problem, because of an article "Evolutionary Ethic", meaning something altogether different.) Under the right title, there are 80,000 ghits, most of them real, starting off with the article "Evolutionary ethics" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, as R an S as it is possible to get. There is many books, and I haven't even started looking for journal articles--There's one back in 1895! They are in journals of philosophy mainly, but also psychology religion, and biology. (It is in fact so well known that the creationists have been writing articles against it. I'll add one for NPOV) , This is an elementary but still encyclopedic article, well sourced. and the books in the reference list are exactly on point. <i>Evolutionary psychology</i> is a very much broader topic. It would be good to have a much more detailed explanation, of course, but the article can and should be improved. If it is notable and sourced, there is no basis for deletion. I added a landmark article. I'll add Stanford and a few dozen books or so tomorrow., <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article can use improvement, but the subject of evolutionary ethics and the question of why ethical behavior has evolved are, as the article's <i>Further reading</i> section shows, encyclopedic topics and not original research.

<dd>It's not a matter of turning up sources, but of using sources to write an article. Remove the irrelevant cruft from this article and what's left might be enough to qualify as a stub called "Evolutionary ethics".

<li><b>Comment</b> but I'm not claiming that this is original research; I mentioned above that the evolution of ethics in human psychology has been discussed is a legitimate subject. (Maybe the potatoes and cheese was too cutesy to make the intended point&#160;;) I am, however, claiming that a) such content belongs in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> (which is a total mess, but that's beside the point), and b) this article is so devoid of content that it's useless as a seed of the appropriate coverage. Sometimes nothing is better than something, and this article so thoroughly fails to document its intended subject - from the title to the reading list - that it's not worth keeping 'until someone expands it'. Do you not agree that an article on the evolution of ethics that basically consists of 'kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and group selection might exist' is useless? It's as if <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a> contained 'Protein is a chemical found in meat. Amino acids are small molecules that are zwitterions.'

<dd>What I liked about the article at first glance was the careful effort at sourcing it. Most of the vague subject articles we tend to see here don't have good sourcing--if they have any at all; here, the ed. got most of the classics. The article can be expanded--there are a lot of details to talk about. Kin selection is obvious once you understand it, but not otherwise. And the balance been altruism with respect to different size units (band/population/species) can create some interesting dilemmas--both with apes and with people. . The problem in writing an article is picking out which examples to present. I think we have a usable outline. If the general art. is as bad as you say, it might be better to keep new content separate---but this is an editing question we dont have to bother everybody with. I've been doing AfDs too long--I may try some writing for a change. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Selfish Gene and most of Trivers' early work really have nothing to do with this, except that they informed later hypotheses about the evolution of ethics. Shermer's book is pop-science, good for a further reading list but not much good as a source. It'd be great if you want to write a good article on the topic, but it's hard to imagine that this material would be useful to work from. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 03:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Opabinia has it right, the topic is not unencyclopedic, but the article is exceptionally poor. Contra DGG it is very poorly sourced, there is only one sourced statement in the whole article. That the <i>Further reading</i> section contains all the classics (could also do with Lee Dugatkin's <i>Cheating Monkeys and Citizen Bees</i> IMHO) does not equal a well referenced article. As TBC points out, there is no reference linking the two aspects, and therefore the article qualifies as <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">OR by synthesis</a>. The lead section could form the core of a proper article, were it properly referenced (at least the first sentence absolutely must be supported by a reliable source). The rest of the article is a really poor collection of thumbnail sketches of other "main" articles on related topics which together do nothing to support the claims made in the lead section. It would be a very good thing if DGG wrote a decent article to replace this, but it's current state is unacceptably poor. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 17:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Opabinia regalis - this article does not document its subject at all. There is nothing to merge and its useless as a redirect anywhere - so it should be deleted until a real article can be written. If anything, it almost seems like a POV fork from <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_psychology.html" title="Evolutionary psychology">Evolutionary psychology</a>, because the author writes about about the ethical question and then tries to make connections for which there are no citations. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMus_Musculus_8efa.html" title="User:Mus Musculus">Mus Musculus</a> 14:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. The talk page states, "Trust me, this is straight up from the 1911 EB. In Wikipedia's infancy days, long before I got here, there was apparently this mammoth-sized 1911 article entitled 'Babylonia and Assyria' that was way out of date... Anyway, in I think approximately 2002, someone came up with the idea of splitting this behemoth up into component parts. This chunk received the title it has now: Proper names of Babylonia and Assyria. The original version was produced with scanning equipment, meaning some words were misread or appeared as jumbled symbols. Many of the vestiges of that original break-up have been more appropriately dealth with since then, but this one still has not. That is why the best proposals so far seem to be to carefully merge anything that isn't outdated, with the abovementioned articles." This suggests to me that there are parts of this article that have not yet been merged into the other articles on this subject. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 09:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - I made the above-quoted comment on the talkpage yesterday, and have been in favor of merging for the last year, but this is a neglected, obscure corner of the wikipedia, and there are many more urgent priorities...

I don't mean this as a personal attack, I'm just puzzled as to why you so adamantly insist this subject does not deserve its own article. So what if it wasn't a hit single or ever made it to the charts? It's an extremely funny song that has become the quintessential Bam Margera/CKY crew work- hilarious, creative, and totally tasteless. Not to mention that it <i>is</i> a pretty well written article. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDer_Kapit%C3%A4n_d960.html" title="User:Der Kapitän">Der Kapitän</a> 00:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Point taken, Deiz, but it's pretty much unsourcable. It is what it is; you can't find many in-depth analyses on it, considering it isn't exactly "high art" (although some would disagree). I can see why you dont think this topic should have a full length article, but what about a stub? 146.186.128.233 11:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no such thing as a "stub" as opposed to an "article" in the sense of an article of lower notability or importance, articles can be temporarily "stubbified" to remove damaging or controversial statements, or where a great deal of unsourced material is removed but some sources do indicate notability (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Raab_a674.html" title="Chris Raab">Chris Raab</a> being a recent example), neither of which applies here. Redirection does not necessarily mean deletion, and if reliable sources establishing the notability of the song were discovered in the future the page could theoretically be recreated if substantially improved. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">z</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 12:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If this particular article on a political party isn't notable, what makes any of the political party articles notable? There are over 100 articles on each of the state party organizations.

<li>What makes a difference between an article on a state organization and a county organization? In the same breath you want to delete this article, you say you may create an article on your county's Democratic Party. That's certainly hypocritical. To answer your question, Hamilton County is the fourth largest county by population in Indiana. It is a suburb of Indianapolis. Hamilton County is one of the fastest growing counties in the Midwest. <a href="../../../k/a/c/User%7EKaclock_871d.html" title="User:Kaclock">User:Kaclock</a> 21:56, 11 March 2007 (EST)

As far as your charge of hypocrisy, there's a world of difference between a suburban county with a population of 240,000 and the county with the 2nd highest population in the United States, with a decades-old nationally known reputation as a byword for Democratic machine politics. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>non notable product. The sauce is only on sale in one country, in one chain of stores, which does not reflect an accurate world-view. Indeed, that store has only stocked it in limited amounts, and only for less than 4 days now. A single mention by the BBC does not make a product notable. This article was speedily deleted by myself earlier, and this is a recreation that is unfortunately no better than the previous version because exactly Zero notablilty has been established. There's not notability for the company, for the sauce, hell even the singer it's named after wouldn't meet WP:BAND. Until this article achieves some REAL notability worldwide, or even significant notability in the UK (which it hasn't), it should remain off wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand why the nominator is saying that the article should be deleted because the product "is only on sale in one country.....which does not reflect an accurate world-view". I didn't realise we could only have articles on products which are available worldwide.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is on sale in a major supermarket in the UK. It has had extensive recent media coverage in a variety of places.

It's not a 'pop knowledge' site, for popular items only. It's a knowledge resource - all knowledge for all who want to know.

<dd>Apparently it comes down to three possibilities: An accurate article, an article that serves to direct traffic to the software creator, or deletion. After carefully weighing these possibilities, I'd prefer the first choice, however, as it has been explained to me that Wikipedia is not about accuracy, that is not a possibility. Option number two is in conflict with Wikipedia standards according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Your_first_article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Your_first_article" rel="nofollow">this page.</a> It is then my alternative choice that the article be removed and blocked from being recreated until reputable sources can be found. Until then, if someone wants accurate information, they can frequent MultimediaWiki for <a href="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=vodei" class="external text" title="http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=vodei" rel="nofollow">Their article</a>. Posting an article that conforms to Wikipedia guidelines appears to be incompatable with posting a truthful article in this case. With that in mind, this subject can do nothing but damage the reputation of Wikipedia.<a href="../../../q/a/b/User%7EQabala_770a.html" title="User:Qabala">Qabala</a> 20:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I see no legitimate reason for deleting the article as it is a very real concept and used in the same way as western <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">leet</a> which an article exists for.

<li>Yes, I am taking this close to the heart, because it is not the first time Russia-relaed articles are placed for deletion. A number of them were started in early wikipedia days of 2003-2004, when there was no such zeal of referring every line of text, especiall if the subject was valid and non-controversial. And running amok today deleting everything that does not fit todays's standard on a short notice is not fair. Some wikipedians became too obsessed with the role of a broom forgetting about <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_diligence.html" title="Due diligence">due diligence</a> of checking facts. The article in question is easily convertible into a verifiable stub: the topic is clearly not a hoax and its existence is verifiable. It is not surprizing that the term left little trace in 'net: its "active life" was about 15 years, and <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was not exactly internet giant. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 18:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In point of fact, it is the responsibility of the authors and editors involved in the creation of an article to properly source it, and complaining that we can't delete an article just because there's no proof of its assertions is flat out wrong: that's what AfD is for in the first place. If you're so certain the article is valid, I'm sure you would have no problem finding verifiable sources for our review. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:11, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>"per nom"</i> my ass. Did you happen to notice that I started the addition of references with <b>proofs of assertions</b> already? Or you only read nominations and article titles only?

<li>Tend to your own knitting, sir. We are well within our rights to decide for ourselves whether the <i>single reference this article contains</i> is credible and represents suitable verification. Until it is in a language we can read -- this being the English-language Wikipedia, last time I checked -- I don't find it to be, and given the extreme and unwarranted hostility of your tone, you'll perhaps forgive us if we ask for translators who are a bit less heavily biased. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 05:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>&lt;shrug&gt; . It is not my fault that Russian wikipedians don't give a slightest damn about the history of their own internet. Probably a national peculiarity, similar to the American one, who don't know the origin of the word <a href="../../../o/2E/k/O.K._fee4.html" title="O.K.">O.K.</a>. Anyway, I added several more references, including one published book. And these "a bit less heavily biased" translators, as well as quite heavily biased deletionists may as well learn to use google to ckeck basic facts. Once again, we are not talking about a hoax or vandalism. We are talking about inherent laziness, when <b>it is much easier to delete a quite interesting fact from internet history than to help colleagues out</b>. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per the multiple sources added since the AFD began. I agree with RGTraynore about the bias of interpreters, but the fact that NYC JD has suggested the topic is real <i>and verifiable</i> motivates me to suggest keeping. In the end, I was swayed by the fact that a significant portion of the argument to "delete" the article even now that it's been referenced stems from the notion that non-English sources somehow contribute less toward verification. Knowledge of a foreign language is equivalent to possessing technical expertise in a subject. I'm sure I lack the knowledge to understand the content of some of the sources noted at <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_physics.html" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>, but I will certainly not try to discredit these sources based on that.

Otherwise, according to you, they shouldn't be there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Divine Corsair (<a href="../../../d/i/v/User_talk%7EDivine_Corsair_a6f2.html" title="User talk:Divine Corsair">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Divine_Corsair_7c45.html" title="Special:Contributions/Divine Corsair">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> - There's not much, if anything, that can be merged at this point. The reason why proper sources haven't been found is that there probably aren't any, at least that would support the article's content in its current state. I'm trying to think of an appropriate concept to describe my concern, without rehashing the same "what is notability" debate that often takes place with "keepers", and the closest analog I can think of at the moment is the "in-universe" perspective for <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">writing about fiction</a>. This isn't exactly fiction, but the article does cater to a narrow "inside" viewpoint, and it seems there is nothing available to balance it. The fact is that this is probably a topic that can't be covered properly by Wikipedia. It best belongs in some other gaming wiki. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 16:23, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, Where does wikipedia draw the line between what is advertising and what is not? Just because this forum has more recognition than some forum a kid can create because he was bored, doesn't make it any more fair that they can't have a wiki and NSider can. I say delete it. Or at least <b>merge</b> it with the Nintendo wiki. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Living_Soul_39f9.html" title="User:Last Living Soul">Last Living Soul</a> 20:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Merging it into the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> article is no good either because, as someone else has already stated, it would be entirely out of place there. <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENuncAutNunquam_c57d.html" title="User:NuncAutNunquam"><span style="color:red"><b>Nunc</b></span><span style="color:gold"><b>Aut</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>Nunquam</b></span></a> <a href="../../../n/u/n/User_talk%7ENuncAutNunquam_ccd6.html" title="User talk:NuncAutNunquam"><sup><span style="color:green">Talk</span></sup></a> 03:58, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>It might be out of place based on the current article's structure, but that doesn't mean a place cannot be created. The main Nintendo article mentions little to nothing about Nintendo's marketing of its products, so why not simply create a section on marketing (or, an entirely different article?) Obviously the <b>entire</b> creation section shouldn't be merged, but there's no denying that an online community that dates back 10 years (if you count Loudhouse and HTS, Nsider's forerunners) has some significance and should not be ignored. -<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychoYoshi_46f2.html" title="User:PsychoYoshi">PsychoYoshi</a> 04:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - There are many people who have been captured directly as a result of AMW that do not have Wikipedia articles. In fact, many of them do not even have news articles about their captures in major news sources. In addition, it appears that the press has all but stopped following her immediately after her 2004 capture, so how many people will remember this 5-10 years from now? <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETML_9475.html" title="User:TML">TML</a> 04:44, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Each of your statements is wrong:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Every sentence in the article has a reference. Thus, it is not "totally unsourced", but <b>totally sourced</b>.</dd>
<dd>2) You have cited no precedent. There are precedents to support <b>keeping</b> the article at in the form of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Universities_Labour_Club_45da.html" title="Cambridge Universities Labour Club">Cambridge Universities Labour Club</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Student_Liberal_Democrats_20c5.html" title="Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats">Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats</a>. Note that these include university political societies.Hence, to claim that there is precedent is laughable.</dd>
<dd>3) Your cookie-cutter, cut+paste assertion that the claim to notability is the fame of its alumni is false. The 'Alumni' section comes at the end of the article. The actual claim to notability is mainfold:
<dl>
<dd>3a) The society is the oldest and largest (by current student members) student Conservative society in the country.</dd>
<dd>3b) The society is <i>not</i> a chapter of the Conservative Party, but an independent organisation unaffiliated to the party. The relevant chapter of the Conservative Party is the Holborn and St Pancras Conservative Future.</dd>
<dd>3c) The society is one of the largest student societies, of any sort, in London. Look at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_student_societies_50ec.html" title="Category:British student societies">Cat:British student societies</a> and tell me that there's any sort of policy or precedent.</dd>
<dd>3d) The society has a seat on the National Convention of the Conservative Party. It is, therefore, important by this <i>ex officio</i> status afforded to its President.</dd>
<dd>3e) The society has received a lot of attention in the blogosphere and the mainstream media. Most recently, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Rifkind_8179.html" title="Hugo Rifkind">Hugo Rifkind</a> wrote a mini-article on the society in his column in the Times on 2nd March 2007.</dd>
<dd>3f) The society hosts innumerable Members of Parliament, Lords, and the Shadow Cabinet. In the last two weeks alone, the society has hosted <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Galbraith%2C_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde_b9ce.html" title="Thomas Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde">Lord Strathclyde</a> (27/2), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Whittingdale_8267.html" title="John Whittingdale">John Whittingdale</a> (2/3), and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Ottaway_3d23.html" title="Richard Ottaway">Richard Ottaway</a> (6/3).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Given the above, I suggest that you, and the two people that have been misguided by your comment, reconsider your position. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 18:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Rather odd argument above: "though some past members of the society are clearly notable, they were not notable when they were members" This being a student society, that is by definition impossible--perhaps set as a deliberately absurd criterion. The reason schools, college, societies, are notable is because of their alumni--everything they might do in the organization would be irrelevant if there hadn't been alums whose real-life work made it worth thinking about in the first place--otherwise they would have been failures altogether.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The claim to notability is not solely alumni, as clearly indicated by the positioning of the alumni list at the bottom of the page (and the fact that I've threatened to delete that section for being unsourced; unlike the rest of the article, which is entirely sourced). Instead, its claim to notability is being the second-largest Conservative society in London and one of the largest societies at KCL, and hosting events with innumerable high-profile politicians (two weeks ago, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_King%2C_Baron_King_of_Bridgwater_af88.html" title="Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater">Lord King</a>; tomorrow night, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Soames_92c4.html" title="Nicholas Soames">Nicholas Soames</a>; next week, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Maude_0690.html" title="Francis Maude">Francis Maude</a>). There is very good precedent for keeping the article, in the form of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Universities_Labour_Club_45da.html" title="Cambridge Universities Labour Club">Cambridge Universities Labour Club</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Student_Liberal_Democrats_20c5.html" title="Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats">Cambridge Student Liberal Democrats</a>. I will try to diversify the sources, but the lack of diverse sources is clearly not the problem, as proven by the precedent of the Cambridge societies. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 22:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, the problem is diversification of sources, which needs improving. Note though, that there is little rule of precedence on Wikipedia per <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>; and if the Cambridge Society articles don't measure up, they should go as well. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 14:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This isn't WAX, because those articles have survived AFDs. The argument against using precedence (outlined in WAX) is two-fold, but neither of them applies in this case. First, it suggests that the other article may not have been put forward for nomination; this is not the case, as both of those articles have been nominated and found to be notable. Second, it suggests that there may not be direct parallels across which to apply the precedent; this is not the case, as they are all large British university societies affiliated to major political parties. Since neither rationale applies, it is sensible to take into consideration precedent, which is clearly in favour of keeping the article.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 14:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, it still needs good secondary sources, which still haven't been provided.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Major association in current and historical UK politics. With respect to historical notability, ck lede paragraph for list of members. Contrary to some of the above comments, <i>once notable, always notable</i> or else we are not building a general encyclopedia. It should not be necessary to defend this. None of the Kings of France or Roman Emperors are notable currently either. ( For the present day, the current figures listed above are N too. Really N members or alumni are enough to make a school notable, or even a club. Obviously no currently active politician is currently a member, it's a <i>student</i> society--though even here there have been some who were already N as members, including Thatcher and Disraeli.) It could probably be argued that this is historically more important than the two London Univ. ones, so each should be considered on its own merit. I added a book ref, and a journal article about its past notability. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article, and the other articles created for individual chapters of the book, contain cut-and-pasted <i>translations</i> of the chapters of Jerome's books, not articles <i>about</i> them. The main article, <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Viris_Illustribus_%28Jerome%29_cf1b.html" title="De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)">De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)</a>, has ample space for anything that needs to be said <i>about</i> Jerome's book, and it duly links to the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" rel="nofollow">external website</a> where the entire translation can be read, sans typos even. Any content could also be considered for the Wikipedia articles on the various persons covered, but I'm pretty sure there's nothing that would pass muster for any articles actually monitored by Wikipedia editors. Note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doug_Coldwell&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114137086" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doug_Coldwell&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=114137086" rel="nofollow">the editor admits</a> that he's adding these biographies from Jerome because "each biography has a <b>very special meaning</b> (if you study it very close)." <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a> theories about "very special meanings," and the public-domain sources a user wants to offer the public in support of his original theories, should be offered on his own website, not in the Wikipedia article space.

<p><b>In my Defense, here are my counter-points:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Since the point is that these links to these particular Chapters (i.e. Simon Peter) are basically a "cut and Past" or a "dumping" of text then it shouldn't be there. Apparently then the proper procedure is that a link should be provided to a website that has the English translation of this text. Sounds like the same thing to me. Apparently it is proper to link to the outside world to the text, however it is not proper to link to a Wikipedia English translation that is similar text. That doesn't seem to make sense. If one is allowed, then why isn't the other allowed, which is basically the same thing? Basically the ONLY difference is that one is an "External Link" while the other is an "Internal Link" to basically the same translation.</li>
<li>2. If there is some sort of "original research" in my English translations of these Chapters (which is supposedly just a "cut &amp; paste" and just a "dumping" of text); then wouldn't a reference to a website that has an English translation of basically the same thing be then "original research" material - since it is basically the same translation off the Latin of Jerome's authors that he wrote up as short biographies? How is it then that it is implied that mine is "original research" while basically the same text when linked "externally" is NOT?</li>
<li>3. The wording in the beginning of my article describing De Viris Illustribus and on top in small print on each of these Chapters was taken from the last item in the article on <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a> of "Historical writings". This wording and information has been in Jerome's article since March of 2002 (5 years) and has been allowed with no objection. I am just using the same wording and information. There is nothing "mysterious" here and it is not "original research". I am just working from another Wikipedia article (which is something that is allowed)= <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>.</li>
<li>4. This article of De Viris Illustribus (Jerome) is almost identical in wording, format, style, and general concept to <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Viris_Illustribus_%28Petrarch%29_28b9.html" title="De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)">De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)</a> that I wrote up some time ago, that has never had any objections to it. It has been edited by some other editors (very familiar with the subject) and basically all they edited was of minor edits (i.e. change of a category, spelling, typo's, minor word additions). There is nothing of "original research" here nor is there anything that is a "mystery". Simply following what has been previously allowed in other articles that have been around for a long time, even to the point of making a list of biographies. Another example of that is Giovanni Boccaccio's biographies <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Famous_Women_bf64.html" title="On Famous Women">On Famous Women</a> which happens to link to approximately 30 - 40 articles that are "stubs" that have no references or sources even where the material came from. That article itself doesn't even have a reference or source; but has been around for years. Where did that list of "Famous Women" come from? Is it a list that someone just made up? What is its accuracy? Can anyone check to be sure this is the true list of "famous women"? <b>No!</b> It is just a list of names someone made up, however it is allowed. <b>Why?</b> The quality of my articles are far better. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug Coldwell</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Coldwell_03f2.html" title="User talk:Doug Coldwell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Coldwell_22f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Coldwell">contribs</a>).</small></li>

Both <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Viris_Illustribus_%28Petrarch%29_28b9.html" title="De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)">De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Famous_Women_bf64.html" title="On Famous Women">On Famous Women</a> link to biographical articles that do not consist of primary texts, but are in the form of encyclopedia articles, so that I don't see that they are questionable by the same criteria that have been applied here. I'm not sure whether I know how to help resolve the confusion between an encyclopedia and a primary source, except to say that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_an_encyclopedia_94c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>, and that primary sources are not encyclopedic content, so that, yes, there are very different standards for articles and for linkable primary texts. The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm" rel="nofollow">translation of Jerome's book</a> is probably public domain but is not accompanied by any bibliographic information, so someone would have to find the same translation in a library (or get better information from newadvent.org) to confirm the text's copyright status, if it is to be brought to Wikisource (not Wikipedia). And a point of clarification: I am not calling <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> on anything, although I have pointed out that the article author's original research seems be driving the selection of content that goes beyond the normal bounds for other reasons. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 17:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I believe the key words here are "primary texts" verses just plain "biographical". Didn't realize there was a difference and that they should be handled different, however technically apparently there is. I have therefore taken out the links to the biographies that I did and put it back to just a list of the names (with no links). After you confirm what you need to confirm, then perhaps you will put Jerome's individual biographies on Wikipedia source (from whichever translation you think is appropriate). Meanwhile, did you look into the Reference source <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Famous_Women_bf64.html" title="On Famous Women">On Famous Women</a>. There doesn't seem to be one, should there be? Also these link to approximately 30 - 40 "stubs" that do not have references or sources of any types (apparently this way for up to 5 years now for many of them). The quality of these "stubs" that are years old are very poor. The quality of my articles are of a very high standard. Now of course I am biased, however you might want to check them out. They are all listed on my User Page under "Articles I started". Now this article of "De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)" is just like <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Viris_Illustribus_%28Petrarch%29_28b9.html" title="De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)">De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)</a> which has <b>never</b> had any objections from the onstart.

<dd>I don't see why. It's bandied about rather freely here, and some works (e.g. the lives of the saints) are commonly described as hagiography with no depricatory intention. As far as I know, the literal meaning is "writings about greatness" or something similar, which doesn't seem very condemnatory. In any case, I'm leaning toward thinking the present version of the article is worth keeping. I might've withdrawn my nomination if it were a younger AfD, but since it's about to run its course anyway, I'll let the closing admin have his say.

<li>Prod is a waste of time on very new articles, because they're still getting attention and will almost inevitably be de-prodded. I didn't use speedy deletion here because it has generated local press, and local interest topics <i>are</i> a contentious issue. Also, there's no consensus on whether people with hereditary titles have any sort of inherent notability. In any case, I don't know why you're upbraiding me about it when you could just mark the article for speedy deletion if you think it fits the criteria and be done with it. There's no reason that this AfD should prevent you from doing that. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 16:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Being the heir or child of someone notable does not mean one automatically piggybacks onto that notability.

I disagree that this is uncontroversial enough for prod and it certainly isn't a speedy candidate; the claim of notability is evident with sources. That having been said, it is a myth that prodding new articles is fruitless.

<p>I'm AFD'ing this rather than prod'ing it because I'm waffling a bit on this article, and thought it could use some discussion. I'm uncomfortable with this article because it smacks of advertising. Is a list of restaurant locations really encyclopedic? I can't really think of much use for this page. There's not enough detail to give directions to a particular restaurant, so it's just a list of cities that have a Cheesecake Factory. Heaven forbid someone would start a List of Mcdonald's article. I'm not aware of any paper encyclopedia (and yes, WP is not paper) that would have such a list. It seems to me the encyclopedic thing to do would be to say on the Cheesecake Factory page that there are X number of restaurants, and if anyone wants the complete list, they can go to the main corporate site. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 15:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable. There are no ghits for Pasion Mura, nor his works. I initially marked it for speedy deletion, but the author contested the deletion. Then, the only defense he provided was "This page is for information. I created it to increase the wikipedia resources." Furthermore, he did not respond to my requests to verify his claims on Pasion Mura's fame. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_H._Ping_f714.html" title="User:Sue H. Ping">Sue H.

<p>The article is about a musician with one album published by a label of his own creation. There's no indication of notability beyond that. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 15:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Julian Fane has recently (in February) released another album which I aim to add info about as well. Both albums have been reviewed at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allmusic.com.html" title="Allmusic.com">allmusic.com</a> which gets linked to by many album entries. Two record reviews except the short reviews at allmusic.com has been located: one in English <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/f/fanejulian-special.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/f/fanejulian-special.shtml" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> and one in Danish <a href="http://www.geiger.dk/anmeldelser/anmeldelse.php?id=1463" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geiger.dk/anmeldelser/anmeldelse.php?id=1463" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. I do indeed fail to see why <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Fane_a257.html" title="Julian Fane">Julian Fane</a> has any less notability than <a href="../../../j/e/g/Jega.html" title="Jega">Jega</a> with whom he is sharing record label (<a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Mu_3385.html" title="Planet Mu">Planet Mu</a>).

<dd>From what you say, it seems I misunderstood the text of the article. When you called it "Julian's record label" I thought you were implying self-publication and that it was one of the dozens of non-notable band articles that are created every day. Those references, and the article on the label itself, indicate otherwise. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 03:08, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - this is the third AFD for this article. The first closed with a delete but got overturned because people who didn't feel like they got a chance to participate wanted their say, and was kept the second time with no consensus. The previous AFDs are linked on the talk page. This article amounts to "collection of trivial one-liners used once on a popular show." It is not encyclopedic. The topic is covered, including examples, in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a> so there is no need to merge this content anywhere. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As noted on the talkpage, this list is extremely crufty and on top of that, it's entirely original research. Not a single verifiable source is cited and the prose reads like 5th-rate fansite material. Incomplete and sometimes wholly made-up (the "concept album" category is at best arguable anyway). On top of that, it serves no purpose beyond what a simple wiki category could do.

<p>The things cited by these articles are mainly web sites where one can download files, or web sites that are clearly themselves parts of the promotional campaign described at <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_Zero_%28album%29_d9a7.html#Promotion" title="Year Zero (album)">Year Zero (album)#Promotion</a>. Reading the sources cited by the latter, I see that we do not have a single <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a> amongst them to confirm such basic facts as the very existence of any of these mysterious USB drives, or the identity of "Elizabeth". The only things cited are pseudonymous postings on web discussion fora that link to other pseudonymous postings on other web discussion fora, in a self-referential nest of fan frenzy. This has all of the trappings of a publicity stunt and is unverifiable from sources that (a) are named and identifiable people (rather than possible pseudonymous <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>), (b) are fact checked and peer reviewed, and (c) have reputations to defend at all, let alone reputations for honesty and accuracy. Wikipedia is not a rumour mill. There's also strong evidence that this is a hoax. Notice the claims that <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectrograph.html" title="Spectrograph">spectrographs</a> can reveal fingerprints and telephone numbers, and compare them with what <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectrogram.html" title="Spectrogram">spectrograms</a> actually are. Furthermore, several of the articles contain <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">original research</a> into the domain names and telephone numbers, being performed directly by Wikipedia editors firsthand in Wikipedia itself. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I did a quick Google search and the references stacked up in Google Scholar. However, the authors don't all match, which is a bit suspicious. Anyway, the content still does not make any sense to me. I'll stick to my <b>Very, very weak keep</b> but I would support a <b>Delete</b> decision as well. Psychogenetics seem to be a bit of quack psychology, but that does not exclude it from Wikipedia as long as there is a strong <i>Critism</i> section in there.

<p>Previously, it had been decided that only Lost characters who were credited as "starring" (i.e. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Shephard_34da.html" title="Jack Shephard">Jack</a>, <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Eko_b22f.html" title="Mr. Eko">Eko</a>) or had flashback episodes devoted to them (i.e. <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Henderson_a0ae.html" title="Rose Henderson">Rose</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Nadler_9d53.html" title="Bernard Nadler">Bernard</a>) would be given an article. Numerous attempts were made to create a page for Danielle Rousseau, who has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Characters_of_Lost&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=114179512" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Characters_of_Lost&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=114179512" rel="nofollow">appeared in over 10</a> out of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lost_episodes_f69f.html" title="List of Lost episodes">over 60 episodes</a> of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a>. Recently the page has been created again without discussion. I propose that the information on the page be <b>merged</b> into <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Lost_234d.html" title="Characters of Lost">Characters of Lost</a>, the article be <b>deleted</b> and then turned into a <b>redirect</b> to Characters of Lost (for easier navigation through Lost articles on Wikipedia). If this AfD fails, then pages should be created for a few other recurring characters, most notably <a href="../../../o/t/h/Others_%28Lost%29_e312.html#Tom" title="Others (Lost)">Tom</a>, who has been in more episodes than Rousseau, Rose or Bernard.

<li><b>Comment</b> Though its important to have guidelines, the logic behind those is now out-dated. What if Rousseau doesn't get a flashback for another season or so?

<li><b>Comment</b> I was surprised to see the emphasis on the salons and spas in the articles. I would have expected more emphasis on the products the company manufactures and sells, especially because they are sold in nearly every salon in the United States and not just the Aveda salons. I'm not a beautician or an industry insider, but I expect that there may be someone on wikipedia who is more knowledgeable than me who can improve this article? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 23:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Okay, so someone left this comment on my talk page: <i>I'm not sure why you were surprised to see information about the Salons, and no, you cannot sell Aveda products LEGALLY without being affiliated with them. You must be an Experience, Concept, or Lifestyle salon in order to LEGALLY carry Aveda products. I am a representative for the company, and happen to know this firsthand. Aveda is not sold in every salon in the United States, to say so is an exaggeration. Maybe it would be best if you let the beauticians/Salon owners like us make the facts known, since you obviously did no research to come to your conclusion. Thanks. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 69.204.177.104 (talk) 03:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</i> I had called my esthetician sister (who promptly made fun of how I pronounced "Aveda") before making the comment to see if other salons could sell the products, since I've seen Aveda products but I've never been into one of their stores, and I guess I misunderstood. Anyway, the article still looks like an ad and still needs cleanup. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 03:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This company had done alot for the environment and has been highly successful; please help improve it, don't just delete it. Thank you.</li>

<p>Ill-conceived, impossible to complete attempt to list all appearances of deities/mythical figures in fiction. The list is relatively short but that's just because it has received relatively little attention: in theory, this list should contain every myth ever written (and many times, cross-referenced under every character that appears in them). Even just having the monotheistic <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> on the list would make for a list that's too long: see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_appearances_of_God_in_fiction_fe9b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of appearances of God in fiction">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of appearances of God in fiction</a>.

<dd>I've taken a look at some of the links on the list, and there are whole articles devoted to "----- in popular culture" for some of the items on this list and long sections in some of the Wikipedia articles for many of the others.

<p>Dense, unwikified article but don't let that put you off actually reading it, please. Skirts CSD-A7 - some <i>assertions</i> of notability, but they amount to very little. Most of article is a copy of a speech the guy made. Author says the article is his father's birthday present. The talk page carries a long list of external links that show a degree of notability or at least enough to make this an AfD matter. On that basis, we might need an article on this guy... but this isn't it, sadly.<b>〈<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RED</font></a><a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="red">VEЯS</font></a>〉</b> 21:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Author's Rebuttal: YOYO is NOT a "idiotic neologisms made up on the internet one day" Rather, it is an acronym that is now part of the public lexicon. I just did a Google search on "YOYO you're on your own" and found 20,500 entries. Thus, this acronym does NOT fall in the category of "...things made up in school one day." Unless you can cite another reason, then I believe that this entry should stand. - Jeff Trasel, 0658 PST, 12 March, 2007</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. All of the season 5 finalists have pages. All of the season 3 finalists have pages. And I believe all of the season 4 finalists have pages. According to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Idol_series_c517.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Idol series">guidelines</a> set forth by the WikiProject on the subject, finalists get pages. And yes, the pages stay even after elimination.

Those are links to the "What links here" section of the templates for each season of Idol. This is the #1 show in the United States and it's highly rated elsewhere. Almost all of the contestants have had careers beyond Idol be it Broadway, CDs, fansites, etc. They are all notable if they've made the finals. I know that many people don't care for the show and many don't like that we have this many articles on the show, but I think it's necessary. And if we delete this one, then we need to delete 12 participant articles or make them all redirects...and then decided on a one-by-one basis who gets recreated after the show is on for awhile. At some point, it's easiest to keep things as they are. And the thing is, we don't know who will be successful and who won't be at this point. I mean the arguably 2 most successful acts from season 5 finished 6th (Kellie Pickler) and 4th (Chris Daughtry). I think it's just too early to ditch these. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 22:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. So I suppose you're willing to let American Idol determine how many "finalists" there are--in this case, twelve.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes because that's what the show calls them. Those who make the top 24 are semi-finalists. Those who makes the top 12 are finalists (and it's been 12 for several years now). They've been referred to as finalists since season 1. Even the earliest Wikipedia articles on these folks called them finalists. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamyra_Gray&amp;oldid=3649959" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamyra_Gray&amp;oldid=3649959" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the first version of the article on <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamyra_Gray_5f11.html" title="Tamyra Gray">Tamyra Gray</a> from May 2004.

<li>I'd agree with that. I don't understand the rush. The second articles get created, they show up here. Give it some time. If it's next January and these guys aren't doing much, then we can delete.

He's just now getting his debut CD out and it's been almost a year since he was eliminated. Right now, all 12 finalists are notable because they are on the #1 show on television in the US.

<li><b>Keep</b> American Idol is the number #1 show on US television at present, and this (and all other Idol-related Wiki articles on the contestants who made the finals, the show's equivalent of the "playoffs") should be considered in the vein of other top shows when describing the "cast of characters", as it were. Sligh is a participant on this show, and therefore in the interest of the admittedly relative "historical accuracy" of the series' participants of the past, deleting the article wouldn't make much sense. Is the proposed deletion honestly based on qualitative reasons, or "political" ones of one stripe or other? And wouldn't a mere recommendation of expanding the article be sufficient enough for meeting Wiki's quality needs? 24.117.250.51 10:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>WTSHTF is NOT a "idiotic neologisms made up on the internet one day" Rather, it is an acronym that is part of the public lexicon. I just did a Google search on WTSHTF and got 6,490 entries. Then I searched on SHTF. It had 88,600 entries! Thus, these acronyms do NOT fall in the category of "...things made up in school one day."

<li>The "reliable source" factor is not what is at issue here, Arichnad! The meaning of this acronym is undisputable, so sourcing would only be an issue if the entry delved into the origin of the acronym. I cited the sheer number of Google hits on WTSHTF andSHTF to illustrate the POPULARITY of the acronym. If those numbers don't constitute common use, then you had better go through the Wiktionary on safari and start posting PRODs on several hundred *existing* wiki acronym entries for acronyms that are downright obscure, compared to WTSHTF and SHTF.</li>

<li>IMO, the key issue here is notability. I brought up the Google count as a useful data point in that regard. Clearly, those of you that have chimed in with "delete" votes would not have done so if you believed that the acronym was indeed notable. In some circles, such as survivalism and libertarian politics, WTSHTF and SHTF are widely known and regularly used without a second thought. Both the root phrases and their respective acronyms also seem to be more popular with certain age groups. I mean absolutely no disrespect by this--and please don't take it the wrong way--I'm merely making statement of fact. In essence, people that went to college in different decades are immersed in a distinctly different mix of popular culture icons, cliches, pet phrases, slang and so forth. This doesn't mean that any particular decade was/is better or worse than any other decade--it just means that the collective experience for each decade was different. As a data point, I went to college in the early 1980s. That was shortly after the comedy movie "Airplane" was released. (In 1980.) One of the most memorable jokes in the film included the phrase "shit hit the fan." Pardon my rambling, but I'm trying to relate--in a polite way--that there are generational differences that color perceptions and evalutaion of terms vis-a-vis relevance, popularity, and notability. Perhaps some other wiki editors would like to chime in on the notability of SHTF and WTSHTF, so that we can reach a wider consensus. I look forward to hearing from you, and will accept the consensus view with all due humility. I appreciate your input, folks!</li>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. It's horrid, but I think it outlines a picture of notability through her various community leadership positions and journalistic work.

<li>It's kind of pointless to have a "list of x" before we have an article on x itself. I wouldn't mind seeing an article about competing cinema trends, considering this list is aribitrarily defined, especially with sentences like "Sometimes, this may be coincidental as the result of two studios independently hoping to capitalize on a current trend." I don't think the idea of a "list of things coincidentally or otherwise competing against each other" should have its own article. Also, the fact that this is the third nomination shouldn't be precedent to end this discussion- a lot of good points were brought up last time. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I thought that it was supposed to be mentioned for procedural reasons if an article has been nominated before. I wasn't offering it as a reason to keep.

Also, I disagree with your logic that list of x is invalid if there's no article on x itself. Lists are often a far superior way to present information.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - there is no possible objective definition as to what constitutes a "similar theme." How many points of commonality constitute "a similar theme" and how is that determined without resorting to impermissible POV judgment calls? How much of a stretch is allowed? The list notes such films as "Lord of War," "The Last King of Scotland" and "Blood Diamond" as having similar themes based on their supposedly all being about "ambitious white protagonist[s] becoming involved in the violence of African politics" despite the films being about an arms dealer with clients around the world, a Scots doctor's relationship with Idi Amin and the Sierra Leone civil war, respectively. The films have similar themes only in a broad interpretation and that interpretation constitutes unacceptable POV. It describes "Flushed Away" and "Ratatouille" as being similar because they both have animated rats in them, despite one being set in a British sewer and the other in a Parisian restaurant. So many of the other items on the list suffer from similar problems that to simply remove them would result in a gutting of the list regardless. Additionally, there is no possible objective definition as to what constitutes "similar release dates." Most of the film pairings indicate that the films were released in different years. Some go so far as to capture films spanning from 2001 to 2006 and include remakes of earlier films as "similar." Given the incestuous nature of Hollywood it is unsurprising to find films with superficial similarities or minor thematic points in common, but that doesn't mean that such superficial similarities constitute encyclopedic information. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's why we're letting movie reviewers point these things out. Considering how frequently the media points out these things, sourcing should not be a problem. If it gets discussed in a movie review as being a similar theme and release date to another film, then it's not an original research issue, regardless of whether the films are two months apart or seven years, and there's no need for Wikipedia editors to invent their own criteria for exactly what "similarity" entails. Including all remakes, even ones decades apart, is an editing issue rather than any kind of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion criteria</a>, and such things can easily be pruned out by normal editing processes. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 23:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article does not appear to support the notion that there is a "trend" in Hollywood to release films with similar themes deliberately to compete with each other.

<li>If your concern is Eptin's statement that the "trend seems to only be getting more common" then I agree we should leave that out. But the WashPost article clearly delineates "a recurring phenomenon," if you're uncomfortable with the word "trend." When I read the list here, I think it already deals with your POV concerns pretty well. When a movie has significant differences as well as similarities, they are noted in the entry. But this sort of thing is really for the talk page, not for a deletion review. Theoretically, there <i>might</i> be a lot of POV concerns on a list like this; in actuality, it's not a significant problem. The list isn't flawed beyond the ability of a talk page to sort it out. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 05:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>What WaPo calls a "recurring phenomenon" I call a coincidence. And noting the differences IMHO exacerbates the POV problem rather than relieving it, since it requires editors to make subjective judgments as to what the differences and similarities are and whether the similarities outweigh the differences to a degree that allows or forbids exclusion. And I've already explained why appealing to movie reviewers or other external sources is problematic. Babe, Charlotte's Web and Animal Farm are all films about talking pigs. The Royal Tenenbaums and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are both about dysfunctional families. I Spit on Your Grave and The Accused are both about women dealing with being raped. Yes these are extreme examples (and they're from different years, which for purposes of these examples is not the point) but some of the items currently on the list are also pretty big stretches to tie them together. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Since you believe the problem is so compelling that the article must be deleted entirely I find it odd that you're not siting examples from the list. Actually, i don't find it odd. The problems are theoretical -- in actuality, this list isn't causing the kind of problems you're worried about.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is about neutral presentation. It doesn't say you hide differing viewpoints or delete articles that contain differing viewpoints, it says you present them neutrally. This article does a very good job of doing that. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 18:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I see above in your initial post that you do site examples you find problematic. I guess it just seems to me that the POV issues you're concerned with are adequately dealt with by including the rebuttal, i.e. "Both films are about rats but one is set in a Parisian restaurant and the other in a sewer system." or whatever. That's neutral presentation. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 19:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>But that's exactly the point. The very <i>existence</i> of this list is predicated on the notion that the similarities of the films are greater than their differences and that is inherently and fatally POV-pushing. If critic 1 says Films A and B are similar and critic 2 says they aren't then listing Films A and B on a "List of similar films" <i>at all</i> is giving undue weight to critic 1, even if the objections of critic 2 are noted. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. To me the list just says the similarities are noteworthy. I don't think it suggests the similarities are <i>greater</i> than the differences. I mean, the differences are <i>always</i> greater than the similarities. But that's not what the list -- or this AfD discussion -- is about. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 21:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

When articles have titles such as "Two Films, One Subject", it's a pretty good sign that the topic is real and receives real-world coverage.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> As has already been pointed out, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DICT" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a>, and this is a list just containing definitions of words. The policy is very clear on this matter: "Wikipedia articles are not:Lists of such definitions". You couldn't get a much clearer answer then that. We are not here to judge if the list is fun or interesting, we are here to determine if it is allowed by policy, which clearly it isn't.

<li>Notable as the list is in context. Ranking is not applicable to the genre but participation is an essertion of merit. Teams should be listed if able to prove active play in last six months at a large scale event. Outlaw rec ball does not a scenario team make. {Karpet} 20:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: as per my comments at the AfD for Ebony Simpson, this case dates from 1991 and 1991 cases are less likely to attract google hits than more recent cases - this was a very major news story for a long period of time - significantly more notable in my view based on coverage particularly by the tabloid press and women's magazines than say the Brian Burke scandal which <a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_6d2a.html#Brian_Burke_scandal" title="Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board">somebody thinks worthy of an article</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> states <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other.</i> I am disappointed that deletion debates focus on what people think might be notable rather than actual independent objective criteria. The Karmein Chan case was the subject of many many newspaper and magazine stories. I have difficulty with comments from people who were too young and/or not in Australia who would be unable to judge the amount of coverage this topic received.If they can't judge on that basis then they need to use the objective criterion provided by WP:Bio is that she meets the notability threshold. Notwithstanding these comments, I accept that as at the Ebony Simpson AfD, this article might be better merged with that of the murderer and discuss the murder and aftermath.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 19:57, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a horrific case that dominated Australian news for a good few years so surely that's reason enough to keep it. Also, if fictional television characters deserve to have their own pages then surely a murdered child involved in a major and still unsolved case should have their own page. And she is 'well known' to Australians. There are many celebrities who aren't well known in other countries not of their nationality yet they still have pages so the same applied for Karmein Chan. - Cosmic_quest 23:01, 12 March 2007</li>

In the discussion at WikiProject Cricket, it was noted that it should be possible to write a meaningful article when there had been <i>a real competition in place: domestic or international. Similarly for tours. The difficulty arises when, as in the 1877-78 Australian cricket season, there was very little domestic competition and no international interest, and is even more problematic for earlier years when there is very little record of anything much "official" happening.</i> The template for the articles is at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Template_talk%7EAustralian_cricket_seasons_2070.html" title="Template talk:Australian cricket seasons">Template talk:Australian cricket seasons</a> to make it easy for editors to create articles with a similar look and feel.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Having those seasons as redlinks makes it look as though there was cricket played but noone has written an article yet.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the case is indeed that "cricket played but noone has written an article yet" not that no cricket was played. For example the article <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915-16_to_1917-18_Australian_cricket_seasons_c1f5.html" title="1915-16 to 1917-18 Australian cricket seasons">1915-16 to 1917-18 Australian cricket seasons</a> states no cricket was played and hence I have excluded it from the debate as I agree that is meaningful information.

<li><b>Comment</b>. See <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercolonial_cricket_in_Australia_5058.html" title="Intercolonial cricket in Australia">Intercolonial cricket in Australia</a>, which is not an obvious title for non-Australians, but covers some of the ground in a single article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 23:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response to merger proposal</b>: Intercolonial cricket is only surely part of the first class cricket story. I think still delete empty articles not redirect to an article that only partly helps; redirects mask that the info is missing from the wikipedia just as the effectively empty articles do.

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's a thought. A difficulty is that we're up against, in all of this, our former (and respected) colleague's thought patterns (which aren't necessarily entirely logical, nor necessarily to be followed now that he is gone). The "predecessor" article to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercolonial_cricket_in_Australia_5058.html" title="Intercolonial cricket in Australia">Intercolonial cricket in Australia</a> is, for instance, called <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Australian_cricket_to_1850_2748.html" title="History of Australian cricket to 1850">History of Australian cricket to 1850</a>, which sounds more like what <a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzykhan_e423.html" title="User:Ozzykhan">User:Ozzykhan</a> wants for the whole 19th century, and which makes sense to me. But <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">User:Golden Wattle</a>'s point, which I agree with, is, I think, that we have a host of articles here that have no content that is worth merging into anything. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 01:57, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> only those lacking content. Most do not state anything other than "The 18XX-YY Australian cricket season took place in late 18XX and early 18YY).

<p>IMDB only lists her as an assistant director on a project <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0572969/" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm0572969/" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>, with no mention of the other films listed in this article. The only thing I could find to corroborate this article is the official website [www.alisonmcmahan.com] which was clearly the source for this article as it skirts the edge of being a copyvio. All the external links are websites associated with the subject to purchase her goods. I don't see any evidence of them being distributed by others. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I felt that this article was relevant to IMDB because she is linked to on other IMDB pages, because of her work with the Alice Guy Blaché biography and the critical analysis of Tim Burton. Since her name was in red on those pages, it seemed to me that it was appropriate to the link lead to something. If the use of her biography is a copyright violation, then I will happily edit it. Thank you for your comments. Rainb 06:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I noted, she only has one credit on IMDB.

<dd>It is true, I added the external link to her book on the Tim Burton page, which I did because her book was previously sited as an academic source for the page. The link that I followed that made me realize there was no page was the one on Alice Guy Blaché. I mistyped above when I wrote IMDB - I meant to Wikipedia - she is linked off of other Wikipedia pages. I apologize for the mistype. Rainb 00:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>One could suggest that this is a problem of recentism, there seems to be an article on every notable Australian murder, but rather than covering the crime in a good article there is an article on the victim(s), the criminal and they exist separately as biographies.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1992 cases are less likely to attract google hits than more recent cases - this was a very major news story for a long period of time - significantly more notable in my view based on coverage particularly by the tabloid press and women's magazines than say the Brian Burke scandal which <a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_6d2a.html#Brian_Burke_scandal" title="Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board">somebody thinks worthy of an article</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> states <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other.</i> I am disappointed that deletion debates focus on what people think might be notable rather than actual independent objective criteria. Ebony Simpson was the subject of many many newspaper and magazine stories. Dating from 1992 most of these are not online. She is still however mentioned from time to time in the newspapers. She is the subject of a book. I have difficulty with comments from people who were too young and/or not in Australia who would be unable to judge the amount of coverage this topic received.If they can't judge on that basis then they need to use the objective criterion provided by WP:Bio is that she meets the notability threshold. Notwithstanding these comments, I accept that as above, the article might be better merged with that of the murderer and discuss the murder and afermath.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 19:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
