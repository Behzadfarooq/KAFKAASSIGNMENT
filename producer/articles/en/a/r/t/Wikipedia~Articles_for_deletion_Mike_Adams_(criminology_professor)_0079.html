<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

</dl>
<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw comment total is 9-5 Delete (discounting one Delete vote that is that editor's only edit so far). One of the Keeps is Weak. So looking at the arguments. It's clear he's not notable as a professor or as a book author. I think I vaguely remember the email incident. I don't consider that as establishing <i>significant</i> notability. Lots of people get their 15 minutes on O'Reilly etc.</p>
<p>The Keep argument come down to two: first, he's a columnist on <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">townhall.com</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">townhall.com</a> is a notable site, and many of its columnists are clearly notable. This raises the question: does that mean that <i>all</i> columnists on townhall.com become notable by association (and by the presumably large readership of townhall.com). It's a hard question, but my answer is: no, not necessarily. We don't know how many townhall.com readers read <i>his</i> column. It's just not quite the same as being syndicated in a newspaper. In Adams's case I don't see enough proof of notability as a commentator.</p>
<p>The second argument is that his career as a gadfly is notable. Again, I don't see enough involvement in high-profile lawsuits, protest demonstrations, publications, and the like. I'm not seeing a strong enough Keep argument to overcome the arguments (and greater numbers) of the Delete commentors. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:49, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Townhall.com columnists are fairly well-known, especially amongst American conservatives. Adams was also involved in an incident a few years back that made national headlines, and as a result of the incident, he appeared on big shows like Scarborough Country, The O'Reilly Factor, and Hannity and Colmes, defending himself and his values. I don't know where to begin to look for sources about that on the Internet, but those facts would obviously improve the article. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicken_Wing_fd6f.html" title="User:Chicken Wing">Chicken Wing</a> 17:17, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. The article poses the subject from the title as a professor, but the keep nom so far only tries to show Adams' status as a pundit. As an <i>academic</i>, fails <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> guidelines for lacking academic awards, being recognized as a significant expert in his field by independent sources, lacking significant and well-known academic work. As a political figure, fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for lacking multiple non-trivial third-party articles. I find one story from a campus newspaper. No documentation for claims that townhall.com columnists are "fairly well-known", but I can say he has only 204 distinct ghits out of a possible 4,040 ("mike adams" "criminology professor"), and Alexa shows his website's traffic somewhere about 831,000th. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:53, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Adams is certainly non-notable as an academic, criminologist, or critic of homosexuality. However, as a persistent and active critic of public universities' speech codes and selective funding of student groups (as violative of the 1st Amendment), Adams is a <b>notable</b> gadfly. This notability should be emphasized in the article. I would give the articles' proponents a week or so to put that material in. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 21:57, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><b>Update.</b> For example, a federal judge recently ordered Georgia Tech to change its speech code which had been alleged vague and unconstitutional. See Andrea Jones, "Insults allowed at Georgia Tech; Conservative students' suit alters speech code in dorms," <i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>, Aug. 16, 2006, p. 1D. Adams was active in finding plaintiffs to file the lawsuit. See Mike S. Adams, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/2006/06/30/the_fruits_of_wrath" class="external text" title="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/2006/06/30/the_fruits_of_wrath" rel="nofollow">The Fruits of Wrath</a>," Townhall.com, June 30, 2006, and <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/" class="external text" title="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/" rel="nofollow">other columns</a> by Adams describing his role in the lawsuit. I think activism like this makes Adams <b>notable.</b> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 12:31, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Do you have an independent source for this, ie. not this guy's blog entry? Bloggers tend not to be notable, and I really don't think that this makes this guy any more notable <i>if</i> it is actually true. TV Newser 00:25, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b>: The use of the word "blogger" mischaracterizes (negatively, for the purpose of notability) the nature of Dr. Adams' columns. <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">Townhall.com</a> is a high-traffic website, one of the top websites among American conservatives, and many of the columnists there such as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sowell_4946.html" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Limbaugh_a874.html" title="David Limbaugh">David Limbaugh</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Williams_9612.html" title="Walter Williams">Walter Williams</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Parker_14dc.html" title="Star Parker">Star Parker</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Gallagher_11b3.html" title="Mike Gallagher">Mike Gallagher</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Bartlett_8c36.html" title="Bruce Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Shapiro_17d4.html" title="Ben Shapiro">Ben Shapiro</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Elder_266c.html" title="Larry Elder">Larry Elder</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Bozell_b44d.html" title="Brent Bozell">Brent Bozell</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Will_49be.html" title="George Will">George Will</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> and so forth are very notable, have their columns syndicated in newspapers, host their own radio and TV shows, or have prominently run for political office. I should point out also that a <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> search for "Mike S. Adams" returns 991,000 hits, the overwhelming majority of which appear to refer specifically to the Mike Adams in question. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicken_Wing_fd6f.html" title="User:Chicken Wing">Chicken Wing</a> 04:29, 2 September 2006 (UTC):::</dd>
<dd><b>Ditto</b> to Chicken Wing as to blogger vs. columnist. Townhall.com makes a distinction between its bloggers, who can be anybody, and its columnists, who (1) are invited to write and (2) do write columns, not blogs. Adams is a columnist, not a blogger. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>That said,</b> I agree w/ TV Newser that would be best to find sources other than Adams himself that talk about his role in the lawsuit. I am sure such sources can be found. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Running out of bold comment intros</b>: I don't know how important his role in the Georgia Tech situation was. I didn't bring that issue up. So I don't know if any sources exist w/r/t his contribution. Still, the fact remains, I'm not sure how a professor with a column on Townhall.com and hundreds of thousands of search engine hits could possibly be non-notable. How many inferior personalities have articles on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicken_Wing_fd6f.html" title="User:Chicken Wing">Chicken Wing</a> 20:58, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I'm relisting this as the debate has evolved but not yet been resolved. I think that <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">User:Pan Dan</a>'s rationale is compelling for keeping, and I would have closed it as a keep if there were any third-party evidence to substantiate the theory. That being said, I can't find any independent evidence.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I have to take back what I said about being "sure" about sources on Adams other than Adams himself. Using Lexis, I couldn't find anything on him in major newspapers or magazines, except that he was an expert source for <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> in its coverage of the Duke lacrosse rape case.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, using google, I did find this: "In his columns, books and public appearances, Professor Mike Adams has become something of a crusader for the first amendment rights of students," in Malcolm Kline, <a href="http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?id=604" class="external text" title="http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/articles.php?id=604" rel="nofollow">"The Bias of Blind Reviews,"</a> campusreportonline.net, Oct. 14, 2005, and <a href="http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/search.php?search_what=mike+adams" class="external text" title="http://www.campusreportonline.net/main/search.php?search_what=mike+adams" rel="nofollow">other write-ups</a> about Adams on campusreportonline.net.
