<p>Pilots for 9/11 Truth is simply <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">not notable</a>. It's run by a member ("JohnDoeX") of the Loose Change Forum who deflected and started his own web forum. While I know about this "group", because I have followed the Loose Change forum, blogs, etc, there lack any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that mention this "group". --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 14:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I wondered about this article's appearance in the templates. No vote at this time, but I doubt there's any press coverage <i>or</i> members who are active pilots. One of the debunkers of the Journal of 9/11 Truth was a military and civilian pilot, and his comments may me wonder how any pilot whose license is current could believe the "no plane" theories or that the planes <i>couldn't</i> have been "stolen" and flown by terrorists in the sense of the mainstream account. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 17:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have felt concern about this group because it appears to focus only on the idea that a commercial jet didn't hit the Pentagon, while not even making a serious case that is definative or scientific. The group says "it is impossible for this aircraft to have struck down the light poles." This implies that the lightpoles in front of the Pentagon came down in some other manner, which there is zero evidence for, or that their (NTSB) data is flawed. Many witnesses reported seeing a large jet and many analyses have shown that it indeed COULD have taken down the lightpoles, so I'm concerned about the poor quality of research this site is promoting while using the title "pilots" to suggest expertise. The most one can determine is that the data they used to reach their conclusions is wrong, but they don't even suggest this or any other conclusion from what I can tell. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBov_3265.html" title="User:Bov">bov</a> 21:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC) 21:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source." National in scope should be verifiable using the FAA Civil Aviation Registry, if someone cares to do so. He or she could also contact the public figures listed as core members. If further proof of international scope is really needed, I suppose we pilots for truth forum members could all descend here with our different IP addresses, but you wouldn't really like that... in other words, just because "mainstream media" coverage is somewhat lacking on certain issues, that does not mean an organization cannot be considered notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nine eleven researcher (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nine_eleven_researcher_7aab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nine eleven researcher">contribs</a>) 09:03, January 21, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>STRONG KEEP - Pilots For 9/11 Truth isn't notable?? There research on the flight data recorder of American 77 is flawed?? Are you kidding me? Have these people even bothered to look at the members list on the actual website or bothered to examine the Flight Data Recorder of American Airlines Flight 77 for more than five minutes? If so, they'd realize that not only is the NTSB's animation of American 77 too high during it’s approach to the Pentagon, it's also too far north to have taken out the light posts.</p>
<p>Question: If the NTSB's CSV file(hard data) on American 77 shows that hijacker Hani Hanjour reset the barometric pressure as he plummeted through 18,000, why does the altimeter on the NTSB animation not indicate this reset with a snapback of the altimeter hand? Question: Why did the NTSB release a flight data recorder showing that the yoke(steering wheel) was never pulled back on to level off the aircraft's final approach to the Pentagon in direct contradiction to what we've all been told(and shown through DoD pictures) for last five years that American 77 flew parallel to the ground just prior to impact? Question: Why is the vertical speed from the flight data recorder in total contradiction of the government’s account of American 77’s final approach?</p>
<p>This is NOT conspiracy theory as the mission statement of Pilots For 9/11 Truth specifically avoids theory. Instead, these are serious questions that are deliberately being ignored by the FBI and NTSB regarding a government-released piece of evidence from September 11, 2001. The burden of proof is NOT on Pilots For 9/11 Truth to explain what happened to American 77. The burden of proof is on the NTSB who released a contradictory piece of evidence that goes against the government's account of the fate of American 77 that the world has been spoon-fed for the last five year. Why is that so difficult to comprehend?</p>

<p>Pilots For Truth sources the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI (as noted in the recorded calls on their site). Tony thinks those sources are unreliable. Many in the 9/11 Truth movement would agree. The Flight Data Recorder provided by the NTSB is unreliable to the govt story as it is in direct conflict with the 9/11 Commission Report. Pilots For Truth exposes these conflicts. It seems some people here want to sweep the facts under the rug. Then again, anyone who references wiki knows its a place for bias and editing at will. Better off to go to the source site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.84.95.203 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.84.95.203_1f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.84.95.203">contribs</a>) 19:07, January 22, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>- Comment - Another cracker jack researcher comparing the Flight Data Recorder provided by the National Transportation Safety board to the Moon Hoax (perhaps he wanted to compare it to Elvis or Bigfoot as well, but didnt want to disrespect the NTSB).

<p>-Comment - I see we have another cracker jack researcher calling for delete. Several articles on the site reference mainstream media, the FBI, the NTSB and the 9/11 Commission Report. The site and forums get over 300,000 hits per month in its short existence so far.. and growing. As the owner and co-founder of the site, I would prefer when people reference our site, they reference the site itself instead of Wiki as Wiki is open to any type of edit from anyone. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.153.105.229 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.153.105.229.html" title="User talk:70.153.105.229">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.153.105.229_5842.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.153.105.229">contribs</a>) 03:50, January 25, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
