<p>I've been working on WP:AfC for almost a week now and I have some observations about the backlog situation.</p>
<p>It looks like the editors here are now more or less keeping up with demand - but it's definitely a struggle. But the backlog is so insanely long (an entire YEAR) that it'll never get cleared - we must accept that it's completely impossible. Even the archived pages marked as 'completed' are often not.</p>
<p>I have a proposal that would help immensely:</p>
<p><i><b>Split the AfC request page into three categories</b></i></p>
<p>So the top level 'WP:AfC' page would say:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Click here</b> if you wish to create an article about a living person</li>
<li><b>Click here</b> if you with to create an article about a living Band, a music Album or a Song.</li>
<li><b>Click here</b> to create an article about something else.</li>
</ol>
<p>By far the majority of the unanswered and rejected entries come from (1) and (2). They are almost all fail because they are very obviously non-notable. We can add a special reminder to contributors in each of these categories by giving a nice simple summary of the rules in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and asking people not to request articles that don't meet these criteria.</p>
<p>Hopefully, giving tailored advice for those two categories (which are by FAR the vast proportion of rejected articles) - we can cut down on the huge number of incoming 'junk' articles.</p>
<p><i><b>For the first two categories editors are not required to explicitly reject articles on grounds of non-notability</b></i></p>
<p>Instead, if a request is not picked up by an editor and turned into an article within 7 days, they are considered to have been rejected. This would save an immense amount of manual editing. It also pretty much reflects the reality of current practice. It's a real pain to have to add all of the justification and the pre/post templates for all of those bazillions of vanity articles.</p>
<p>It's no problem to scan a long list of those article requests and quickly identify the handful that need to be created - but to individually justify the rejection of all of the others is a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>Whilst this may not be the 'pure' approach that we'd like to take, IMHO it's the only thing that's going to keep the backlog down in the long term.</p>

<dd>You would never guess this after reviewing the logs; but there is currently a "wizard-like" interface that starts when you do the "click here to start" button. One of the questions it asks you is the type of article you're creating, and then it beats you over the head with the notability guidelines. In a nice way, of course. The auto-expire after seven days is interesting - how would you word the feedback to the submitter? <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 01:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are too many words on the interface - it needs to be radically simplified and guided step by step menu system: Something like "Click here if you are doing an article about a person"...new page..."Click here if this person is still alive"...new page..."Click here if the person is a sporting celebrity with no international wins..."...whatever. At the end, it can say "We don't normally accept articles about living sports celebrities unless they have international wins"...or whatever. The vast majority of people who come here are OBVIOUSLY total newbies - so anything remotely sophisticated will fool them. As for what we say if we hit the seven day limit is simply the truth "We're sorry - none of our editors felt that they should create your article.". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:22, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nightmare to maintain, unfortunately. While I understand your concern completely, what you propose would span literally hundreds of pages quickly. Assuming only 3 choices per page, you've got 354 pages to maintain at the 4th level and 1083 at the 5th.

<dd>I've been pushing through the backlogged archives a little bit. One thing to note is that On some of the really old pages (from Dec. 2005, Jan. 2006, and so on - I don't know when the templates were introduced), editors weren't really required to comment on unsourced requests, so many of the pages appear incomplete while they're actually completed. I do agree that this backlog is heinous! -<a href="../../../s/t/h/User%7ESthomson06_46cd.html" title="User:Sthomson06">sthomson06</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/h/User_talk%7ESthomson06_2c7b.html" title="User talk:Sthomson06">Talk</a>) 23:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It stands as a testament to the effectiveness of the rule that you have to have an account and to have had it for a few days before you can create an article.

<p>I've been playing around with something that I think could make things a bit easier to keep up with some of the mess around here. For an example, check out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-09_d886.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2007-01-09">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2007-01-09</a> that I applied the new template to. Basically, I figure that by hiding the articles that've already been marked, it's a lot easier to quickly skim down the page finding the articles that still need to be reviewed (since they'll stand out a lot more), and the page won't be so overwhelming for people to review. What do people think? --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 15:51, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One word: <b>NICE</b>. Is there a different variant in the outer border for accept vs. decline? It might be nice to see at a glance which ones were accepted or not.

<dd>Harry - My problem is that if I'm scanning the page really quickly, the incomplete ones don't stand out as much as they would with this template involved. Plus, since the page can get extremely long by the end of the day, this helps hide a lot of the unneeded clutter so that it's a lot less painful to scan through the page, everything gets a lot more organized and "clean" looking. Basically my theory is that the AfC can be a pretty arduous and thankless job (since there's a lot of garbage here), but still a necessary one, so why not make it as easy as possible for the volunteers to skim through the page and find what they need? --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 14:37, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>ShinmaWa - Take another look now, how's that? I think that should be basically what you're looking for. (you should notice the difference right away, since the top two sections are an accept and a decline) --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 14:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Now I've seen it in action for a day, I've changed my mind. Good idea. I've increased the red for the shading of declined articles as it better suits the green of the accepted ones. <i><b><a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarryboyles_b16b.html" title="User:Harryboyles"><font color="darkblue">Harryboyles</font></a></b></i> 13:37, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have another idea that could help make it easier to review from a glance at the table of contents: at <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">WP:ER</a> we started this thing where people who haven't been reviewed yet have an asterisk next to their name (which exists in the template you use to create your ER subpage), and the reviewer removes it. That way, a glance at the table of contents shows a potential reviewer which users have and have not already been reviewed. I like the system a lot (if I do say so myself!). Anyone object to maybe trying it here? I'd love to be able to use the TOC to skip right to the ones that haven't been reviewed, rather than scrolling. Would trying this out even be technically possible with the request submission process? Other thoughts?

<p>Hey, if people use this template to turn down an article, could you provide a further explanation? As it stands, we're telling people that their article is not suitable for wikipedia, and saying nothing else. I'm actually tempted to put the template up for TFD right now, but I'm going to hold back pending on how people respond to this message. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPart_Deux_5572.html" title="User:Part Deux">Part Deux</a> 16:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed the AfC tags from it (those only go around the article on the actual AfC page, and should get removed when the article is created), but it still needs a lot of cleanup. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 23:51, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>whoops...forgot this most important source for the finalization of the divorce<a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/14032007/325/abramovich-divorces-wife-russia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/14032007/325/abramovich-divorces-wife-russia.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Also was going to add the line at the end- "From her very humble beginnings, she now may be one of the wealthiest women on the planet, yet the divorce settlement was conducted in Russia, and would reportedly likely have been less than in the UK. The settlement went undisclosed, but even with a minor settlement she would become one of the most wealthy women on the planet, and at 39 years old. The Abramoviches have gone from one of the most wealthy and envied <i>couples</i> on the planet, to now perhaps the two most elegible, envied, and desired <i>singles</i> on the planet".......i dont know, maybe that <i>very last line</i> is too much, yet the rest of the article surely belongs, this is a highly noteworthy woman! Perhaps even the richest woman on the planet! Plus there are scores of news articles about the both of them, and this is all old public news at this point, and someone should have uploaded her long ago, well before the splitup even, its a shame that someone just now finally uploads her to wikipedia, she deserved it on her own merit not even considering the divorce and this latest news to her story, "rags to riches fairytale" yet perhaps a bit sour these last months for a spell at least, but surely with even just a billion dollar settlement she will find some way to <i>live happily ever after</i>, and so will he I would think with a good solid 10 billion <i>at least</i>, even if she ended up with as much as the other half, with a billion dollars in your pocket, love <i>inevitably</i> will find its way to you, you'll even have to fight it off many a time!!!-83.78.184.191 00:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the page it says "The easiest way to create a new article, however, is to <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;type=signup" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;type=signup" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">create a free Wikipedia user account</font></a></span> and then <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">log in</a>."</p>
<p>So my question is, "What's the point of this page?"</p>
<p>Why do for users what they can more easily do for themselves?</p>

<p>Cam is a very important person to his community. He exerts leadership that is not usually found these days in young people. His drive and determination gives him great influence over his school, and his presence on Wikipedia only helps him to be an effective role model in our community.</p>
