<p>This has a long list that violates notablity standards, WP:CITE, WP:V, WP:NOR, and WP:NOT 1.2.2 and WP:NOT 1.2.3.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Very Weak Delete</b>. Generally I vote on AfD's out of pure principle.

<li>Could you examine the nomination statement (again) and explicate to me how it proposes to delete the article based on controversy rather than the policies it cites? Once you've done that, perhaps you might also post a list of the 'delete' related comments which also mention the need to remove controversial content for the sake of it?

<li><b>Comment</b> to demonstrate the idiocy of this list, I have randomly chosen a word and its definition from the list: <i>shitdick -(U.S.-Ohio)Gay male; one who enjoys anal sex</i>. I ask, is this encyclopedic? Does it have a source for the claim of it coming from Ohio? Or was it that, some anonymous user from Ohio, excited they came upon this "dirty word" list, made up the word "shitdick" on the spot and inserted it into the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: To demonstrate the viability of the list I randomly chose <i>Jobby Jabber</i>, a term supposedly from Scotland that I had never heard of.

We do have a lot of idiotic knee-jerk trolling strawman arguments, not that those count.

<li>AFD <b>is</b> a debate; that's why it had its name changed from Votes for Deletion to Articles for Deletion. The problem is that often there can never be a winner, because there are bound to be crucial things which are simply a matter of opinion, and not fact. For instance, that perennial bugaboo, notability. Some people refuse to even accept it as a legitimate reason to delete, while others have different definitions of notability. For instance, this article is notable, IMO, because it compiles a list of different slang words regarding sex without necessitating the creation of a few dozen/hundred articles on each of those slangs, many of which are probably in themselves notable. You, on the other hand, disagree. It's purely a matter of opinion. This is why debates have limitations when it comes to real solutions to real problems. AfD is currently a hybrid of a debate, a vote and something else entirely. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 17:06, 10 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, Voice of All's nomination does not rely on notability one inch. It cites several bases in policy, not a one of which has been challenged by those saying "keep, because, oh well, because I can't be bothered to work on it myself by detest deletion of lists on principle".

<li>Indeed. While I believe that notability is what stops this encyclopedia from ballooning in size by 100 fold with cruft, that cost money to mantain on the servers, that is not the only reason I listed this.

<li>Those policies apply to <i>content</i> not <i>topic</i>, like I said. If there's an issue with the content, and the content is salvageable (which at least some of it is), the appropriate action is to tag it for cleanup.

<li><b>Comment</b>: All of you voting "Keep if cleaned up"... keep in mind the above, that your vote will be recorded as "Keep", that several voters in August said the same thing, that the article has not been cleaned up since then, that (IMO) it probably won't be now (if kept), and that, if the article <i>isn't</i> cleaned up, there is no mechanism to follow up and convert your votes to "Delete". (I am <i>claiming</i> to do so for the August voters, but (a) that may be considered outlandish and (b) it's very labor-intensive and can't usually be done, I just happened to do it this time.)

<li>You can't expect editors to follow up their AfD votes like that, watching articles to see if they're cleaned up, re-AfD'ing them after a time if they're not, perhaps contacting the other Keep-if-cleaned-up voters. It's too time-consuming. Also, its inefficent for each voter to follow up their own vote. Here I have done a batch follow-up for all these votes. They made their wishes clear at the time, and it's been <i>six months</i>. I think that's long enough to qualify as "cleanup was not implemented" for the purposes of <i>those</i> (August) votes. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:30, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep does not equal "Keep if cleanup up". The condition has not been meet after 6 months.

<li><i><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> 1.2.3</i> -- which prohibits <i>lists of such definitions.</i> However, this page is more than that: it has text at the top, references, and most important, many of the terms are hyperlinked to actual articles (thus, it is not just a list of dicdefs).</li>
<li><i>This list includes terms from several languages with nothing to assert their validity</i> -- They should be removed if not validated, regardless of the language: see above.</li>
<li><i>While some of these are obvious actuall terms, most are likely just cruft and made-up nonsense</i> -- an argument for cleaning up, not deleting.</li>
<li><i>...the last AFD was ridden with numerous sockpuppets</i> -- that's a matter for Deletion Review. The article should be evaluated as it exists, not because it somehow "escaped" AfD deletion earlier.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems easy enough to clean up. Much easier to clean up than a lot of the overblown political dreck on so many wiki pages. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskyWhiskers_b03e.html" title="User:WhiskyWhiskers">WhiskyWhiskers</a> 18:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, need for cleanup is immaterial to AFD, does not violate WP:NOT. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 23:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
