<li>It is a required spinoff from the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colditz_Castle_4245.html" title="Colditz Castle">Colditz Castle</a> article if you would have bothered to look.

<li>I'm afraid I don't understand the hostility. Are you assuming that I did not read the very first words in the article? Does spinning the non-notable off from a longer article somehow make them more notable?

<li><b>Keep</b> I assume you wouldn't have deleted it if it had remained in the main article, so you shouldn't try to carry out a "punishment deletion" now that people have followed Wikipedia's request and broken up a long article. I've never looked at either article, but the annoyance felt by someone who has edited them is quite understandable in my opinion. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 05:03, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well for starters the grounds "Not notable" is not valid for VFD. Not to mention the fact that yes these people are indeed notable as most are referred to in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colditz_Castle_4245.html" title="Colditz Castle">Colditz Castle</a> article I turned into a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">FA</a> (using exactly this kind of "not notable" detail). I find it extremely amusing that the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> article which has <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html#See_also" title="Harry Potter">several spinoff lists</a>, in particular a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_the_Harry_Potter_books_62e8.html" title="List of characters in the Harry Potter books">list of characters</a> (all of which are fictional) is perfectly acceptable, yet a spinoff list of <i>REAL PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY LIVED</i> goes up for vfd. Perhaps I did act hostile, I'm sorry, but the more I see this the more disgusted with WP in general I become. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 05:09, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am baffled. I have no idea why anyone thinks I am trying to punish anyone about anything. I will admit that I had not looked at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colditz_Castle_4245.html" title="Colditz Castle">Colditz Castle</a> article and just happened to run across this, but if I <i>had</i> encountered that article, I would most certainly have begun a discussion on the Talk page as to why this information was necessary. Since the information is now all that exists in the article under discussion, then, yes, VfD is the appropriate place to discuss the matter. Why would I want to punish anyone with whom I have had no dealings, and wouldn't anyone who has worked on any article under VfD discussion also be annoyed? Why is annoyance at this article being listed here be of any more significance than the annoyance of any other person at their information being listed for deletion? Please, everyone, calm down, I am not trying to start a war or even an argument, just a discussion. I see that you are somehow arguing that every real person deserves an article? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Barleycorn_399c.html" title="User:John Barleycorn">John Barleycorn</a> 05:12, August 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry but VFD is not the place to start the discussion. First the talk page, then to RFC, and THEN to VFD is the appropriate order, If you are unsure its always best to ask other people first, get a few opinions, ask the writers of the article on the appropriate talk page FIRST. VFD should be the LAST place to go to discuss article content, unless its obviously junk like User:XYZ's Band's Fan page. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 05:22, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

"For the purpose of the list below, notable is strictly defined as being very likely to get a consensus to keep if listed on VFD. Similarly, not notable is defined as being very likely to get a consensus to delete if listed on VFD." I'm straddling the fence on this one. It seems to me that the article is right on the borderline between "notable" and "not notable". Does anybody have any precedents they'd like to use? I'm currently leaning towards "not notable", and suggesting that ALKIVAR and Osomec think about starting a website dedicated to Colditz Castle for such trivia (which could be linked to from the Colditz Castle article). But it could well be that ALKIVAR's and Osomec's rudeness is coloring my judgement. Could we maybe stop voting on this for a week and come back when cooler heads might prevail?</s> <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyeddie_9d41.html" title="User:Crazyeddie">crazyeddie</a> 07:57, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. A list of those who tried to prevent the escapes is as useful as the unchallenged lists of those who escaped and attempted to escape from Colditz castle during WWII. Listing the German staff helps round out the article by showing another part of the German side of the story. If Harry Potter can list fictional characters, then we can list real German POW camp staff. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonBruce_2589.html" title="User:DonBruce">DonBruce</a> 16:41, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>A major difference between this list and a list of Harry Potter characters is that very many of the Harry Potter characters have their own articles, which the list of characters links to.

<li><b>Cleanup</b> This seems to be fairly important, but I can understand why it was considered for vfd. The page is simply a list, with a brief reference to the parent page.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Tries very hard, but lots of question marks which will never be filled, and lots of gaps; it is neither fish nor fowl. Table does not allow for promotions. Includes "<i>one from the totally separate SS concentration camp</i>". "<i>These are the named members of the German staff from 1939 to 1945 at Colditz castle</i>" doesn't fill me with confidence. Without access to the books listed as sources, none of it can be trusted; of no use to scholars or researchers. None of the sources look like official German personnel manifests. Keep the commandants, ditch the rest. in the midst of it someone has linked the word 'legal', which is... touching.-<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 21:12, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Seems like this list could be a useful reference. There are references provided, even if they don't look like personnel manifests. Maybe at some point someone would be able to fill in some question marks, perhaps descendents of the staff. 4.240.162.109 03:56, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the descendants were to do that directly, their additions would probably be dismissed as unverifiable, and rightly so. The additional information would have to come from books. There's probably much more to be written about Nazism and its appeal to many people, but perhaps not very much more in the way of Colditzcruft that's waiting to be published: as a sizable and apparently insatiable market for works about Nazi trivia (uniforms, etc etc) has existed for years, there has long been a big commercial incentive to publish. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:17, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
