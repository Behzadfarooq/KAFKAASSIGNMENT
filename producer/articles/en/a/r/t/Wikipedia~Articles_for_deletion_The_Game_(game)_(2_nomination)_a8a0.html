<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I don't expect this to be uncontroversial. However, there are no sources for this game's existance. None. Seqsea and others have clearly demonstrated this. That, along with the majority of keep comments come from new or unregistered users, and that th e arguments for deletion vastly outweigh the arguments for keeping, lead this to be deleted.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b>: I just spent a couple of hours scouring LexisNexus, ProQuest, InfoWeb, and Google for anything related to the game. Only Google returns results and they are all blogs or forums. From <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> (which is just a guideline): "Posts to bulletin boards and Usenet, or messages left on blogs, are never acceptable as primary or secondary sources. [...] Personal websites and blogs may never be used as secondary sources." From <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> (which is a policy): "If an article topic has no reputable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic. [...] For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. [...] And just because information is true, that doesn't mean that it meets our verifiability requirements — information has to be sourced if it is to have a place in Wikipedia." While this article represents a unique case, continuing to allow it without any hope for sources is in direct violation of both guideline and official policy. I still stand by what I wrote above—the game <i>does</i> exist and <i>is</i> played—but that is not enough to warrant inclusion. Until it becomes popular enough to have more than a handful of hits on Google, it should remain the province of college dorms, high school homerooms, and blogs. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 00:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have to keep this game by this point. No question The Game is inane, however it is now an established social grace to admit loss. When one says "I lost" half the room -no matter what the social setting- understands and confesses losing as well. To delete this game would be par with deleting hopscotch (an equally pointless but renowned game). 70.226.183.238 03:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)Nathaniel</p>

<li>I've defended the notability of this article through both of the previous A/VfDs, and on both occasions it was conditional that a lot of the crap be trimmed out of the article. Successive rewrites and re-rewrites have alternately removed and replaced a lot of it, and it's reached a point where there is no chance of ever salvaging it into a sensible article. I fully accept that the above argument is probably a case for cleanup rather than deletion, but a recent RFC attempt got nowhere. I just can't see this ever becoming viable. Right now, the article represents almost everything that is bad about Wikipedia; POV-pushing by both sides, massive piles of cruft flooding the article, chronic unverifiability (the very concept of the article means that a Google Test is meaningless) and breaches of almost any policy you could care to name. <b>Weak Delete</b> (only weak because despite the aforementioned flaws, The Game is a real phenomenon) unless <i>all</i> sides can come up with a solution before this AfD closes; which, sadly, seems increasingly unlikely. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 11:23, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me make this clear: I don't <i>want</i> this article to be deleted. I would like to see this article filled with accurate, authoritative, verifiable information from a better source than a single fanpage somebody made about the Game. The problem is that no such source exists. As has been discussed, the leading source on the internet for information about the Game is precisely this article. As such, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and will <i>always</i> continue to do so. Nobody knows who invented The Game; I don't, you don't, and from the anecdote of Mike Codling or whatever his name is, he doesn't either. There is no verifiable rule set; that means that the article is going to be filled with every minor rule variation that can be thought of. <i>That</i>, and that alone, is my reason for voting for deleting it; not because it's non-notable, or even that it's unverifiable, but because it's so unauthoritative that it's always going to be a crap magnet. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 21:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to say <b>keep</b>. If the question is just whether the game exists and is played by enough people to make it significant, then a simple google search for the phrase "I just lost the game" (with quotation marks) reveals how widespread it is. In fact, such a search reveals that by far the most common occurence of that phrase on the internet is in relation to The Game as described in this article. By nature of this game and the way it has spread, it's very unlikely that a 'source' in the usual sense is going to be found. Obviously this game has no historical roots that will be dug up. Even if someone were to step up claiming they invented the game, I very much doubt this would make a difference. Possibly if a prominent journalist wrote a news article about it then perhaps this would qualify, I don't know, but really I would argue that this is one topic that just won't have a 'source'. It is fairly obvious that this article has aided in the spread of The Game. Does that mean it should be removed? Absolutely not! It's irrelevant <i>how</i> it has spread, the point is that it <i>does</i> exist as the phenomenon described in this article. People have claimed that they used this entry as a reference when explaining The Game to others. Isn't that fulfilling its purpose as an encyclopedic entry? If someone asks for an explanation of a phenomenon or entity, pointing them to an encyclopedia entry or suggesting they 'look it up in an encyclopedia' is not an uncommon thing to do. 86.139.10.162 22:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but put a "lacking sources" template on it. I just spent a 5 hour drive with a bunch of college students where "I just lost the game" was said every 30 minutes.

Until recently it claimed that in Brazil it was called "El Juego", but that's Spanish; in Portuguese it would be "O Jogo". – <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyluciano_4d5d.html" title="User:Andyluciano">Andyluciano</a> 22:27, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is sufficient evidence that it exists, even though it doesn't fit the common pattern of some single authoritative source we can cite, and 2. Not providing <i>any</i> information about it, even though nobody is doubting said information's truth, would go against Wikipedia's true goal.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - it's been nominated for deletion before, and was kept. Why will it be any different this time? There's more evidence to support its existence than before. Granted, Wikipedia may be the singular major source of information on it, but that is perhaps because of The Game's nature to be spread by word of mouth rather than through online means. I feel that IAR applies in this article's case because of common sense. There seems to be consensus among those who DO want the article to exist that the rules are accurate and correct. If the article's contents are, in fact, precise, then why should verifiability be an issue with such a minor article? I could understand verifiability being crucial with more complex topics, but this is much more trivial than the proverbial rocket science. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrabblebrex_f9b5.html" title="User:Brabblebrex">brabblebrex</a> 20:57, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>POV / Neutral</b> Seeing as there seem to be a lot of new people putting their 2¢ in (including me), a quick summary:
<ul>
<li>Existance: "The Game" exists, seems to be the general concensus, though some would rather it not.</li>
<li>Accuracy: Is the content of the article correct, or is it (either wholly or in-part) hear-say and/or fabrication? Some of the content, while it may be accurate, reads like fiction or a good idea the author thought up/was told (Example: T-shirts with "The Game" on them), and are unverified by any of the references.</li>
<li>Suitability: This is the main point at issue; How suitable is it as content?
<ul>
<li>Does it meet the criteria of <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">What Wikipedia Is</a> and <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">The 5 Pillars</a>?</li>
<li>Are the sources <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>? (and if so, are they <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>?) This links in tightly to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>, as it is fallacious to have the Wikipedia article as it's own main source of information. Some feel that while there are external sites with information, they are tenuous. However, from the nature of The Game, it may be impossible to prove the validity of the content.</li>
<li>Is the article written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>? Is it written representing The Game as either a good or bad thing?</li>
<li>Just because something exists and is widely "known", this in itself may be insuffient if it is Not <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notable</a>. For this we need to address what impact has The Game had as a memes and on other games, plus evidence of that impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<dd>Personally, while I find "The Game" irritating and do not play it, I do not doubt it exists. However, I do have doubts that has enough source credibility and accuracy. Overall? Neutral - I'll let the more experienced folk on here guide me in this. -Crocos 07:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This whole thing reminds me of one of those sci-fi situations where a person goes back in time to stop some disaster, and once he gets there, he takes some action accidentally causing it himself. He went back in time because the disaster had happened, but then he was the cause of it. If he hadn't gone back in time, it never would have happened. The disaster caused him to go back in time which caused him to accidentally cause the disaster which caused him to go back in time which caused him to accidentally cause the disaster.</li>
<li>We seem to be involved in a similar loop here. Of the 22,000 google hits on "I just lost the game", 13,000 of them also contain the word "wikipedia". People keep looking for sources for this topic. Of course we can't find any decent sources; we ARE the source. This topic became notable because of the wikipedia article, it is notable because of the wikipedia article, and now we must keep the article because the topic is notable. If we deleted the article, likely the topic would stop being notable, but we can't delete it because the topic is notable.</li>
<li>There are two major methods of deciding whether an article should stay, Notability and Reliable sources. Usually they go together, this time they don't. Half the people here are saying that we must keep this because it's notable, the other half that we have to get rid of it because we'll never get a reliable source. Looks like a stalemate.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, and therefore there is no reason to delete an article that (accurately) describes a meme that is seen by many across the whole world, especially in the UK and USA. The fact that many people have not heard of it does not make it untrue/unreal/false/worthless - thousands of people seek Wikipedia for an explanation to this "game", and as an encyclopedia it is imperative that such an explanation is provided. Deletion of this article defies the entire purpose of Wikipedia, which (as I understand it) is to achieve an encyclopedia providing a detailed source of knowledge encompassing as many parts of existance as possible. The fact that this many newbies care enough to participate is testimony to how important this article is as a reference - does anyone honestly think people would bother to create an account on wikipedia just to vote in one article <i>just because a friend told them to do so</i>? Of course not. The fact that so many newbies have participated is, in my eyes, an indication of what Wikipedia is all about - a source of information to countless anonymous users who want nothing more than a source of reliable information about things that affect them. Do not take that away. <a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjr_xi_bca9.html" title="User:Djr xi"><b>DJR</b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjr_xi_f6e8.html" title="User talk:Djr xi">Talk</a>)</small> 22:04, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - It is stated above that this page is designed to gage general opinion of Wikipedia users, regarding the article. As such, I feel that it is notable that not a single person (below the age of 21) that I know does not play "The Game". This is the case with the wide majority of my peers, and through them my extended network of aquaintances quite easily spans the majority of Nottingham City. As such, I believe that it is quite clear that the article fulfils the notoriety requirements of Wikipedia. Previous posters have said such things as "If anyone still remembers it in a year (and has written about it somewhere other than their livejournal), maybe it'll count as notable then" when the article clearly states that the game has existed since 1993, and I personally have been playing since 2003, as have most of my peers. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.7.19.84 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.7.19.84_3def.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.7.19.84">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I thought about it long and hard, but decided my original decision was wrong. The game is notable yes, and it definitely exists - but we have no sources, it's therefore clearly against policy, and as others have pointed out Wikipedia is fast becoming a primary source for this, which is a bad idea (we delete other games made up in school to stop Wikipedia being used as a platform for spreading memes, which is exactly what is happening here!). With respect to the large number of users voting keep, (and of course welcome to those new to Wikipedia!), many of you do not seem to understand the reasons for deleting - nobody, or almost nobody, is claiming that The Game does not exist, however it is against the policies of this encyclopedia to document as fact something that we cannot back up.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason that there are not many websites about the game is because the upkeepers of those websites would lose whenever they keep them up to date. The best way to win the game is to pretend it doesn't exist. This article must be kept!

<li><b>Delete</b>. Whether it is notable is not the issue to me.

I have a lot of respect for Seqsea when it comes to conscientious referencing, and if he says he can't find reliable sources for something, then it starts to look very shaky indeed. The websites people are citing here on AfD as sources <i>do not qualify</i> on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Personal_websites_as_primary_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Personal_websites_as_primary_sources</a> says it quite clearly: "personal websites and blogs may never be used as secondary sources. That is, they may never be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website". This article has gone through two AfDs already, amid heated debate and promises to improve the article, and has had an RFC request which resulted in attention from non-involved editors. If, after all that, these are still the best attempts sources that can be found, it doesn't matter how notable the thing is (or isn't). The article can not be reliably referenced, will never be reliably referenced, and should not be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 11:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Surely as soon as a reference to The Game is published somewhere it will become verifiable. As with the argument for hide and seek, no one knows where it originated, but it has since been refered to in published material.

<li>""Keep"". The game is a widespread social phenomenon-- not an innnocuous schoolyard-type fad. Of course the game is unverified-- there is no central authority or any official sanctioning body that administrates game playing around the world. However, we do know that people, independantly, take part in the game; it is a relatively well-perpetuated phenomenon which this site, in fact, would only continue to propagate in popularity. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.80.142.210 (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.80.142.210.html" title="User talk:209.80.142.210">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.80.142.210_541e.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.80.142.210">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>It's looking like this could be one of the most critical AfDs in the history of Wikipedia; determining whether an article on a meme should be kept because lots of people know about it, or deleted because the strict interpretation of Wikipedia policy states that it's unverifiable. I truly hope that whatever admin ends up making the call on this is able to assess this article independently of their own opinions on the Game, because that's what I can see this boiling down to. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 22:17, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think that would be the worst decision that could be made, particularly considering that this is the third nomination for the article.
