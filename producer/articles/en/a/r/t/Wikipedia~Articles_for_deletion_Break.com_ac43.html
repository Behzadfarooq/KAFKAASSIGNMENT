<ul>
<li><small>Real96 The deletion policy is clear when it states "Pages that can be improved should be edited or tagged, not nominated for deletion". Also, What are you stating here? Because (Veteran Wika Archivist) is a "new" user he is not right in what he is/was doing? This user saw the need to edit this page, as it was obviously compiled by somebody within Break.com (with all the self back patting within its content). You have only been with us a few months yourself. This should never have been marked for deletion when only a clean up was necessary. I will recommend to Wiki admin that new members be restricted in these processes in future.</small></li>

<ul>
<li><small>Veteran Wika Archivist 18:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC) Response to the statement above regarding my contributions. I have been with Wikipedia for over 3 years and due to the nature of the recent amendments I have made to the Break.com page, am unable to use my real username without exposing myself to Break.com. Hence, my commitment to Wikipedia has spanned longer than a few months! I believe in telling both sides of a story for TRUE historical value! The Break.com page was nothing more than an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisement</a> before my amendments, and now reflect the true Break.com. Wikipedia has always been about ACCURACY, TRUTH and FACT! we cannot and MUST not show bias as editors!</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><small>A fine example of the bias I am refering to can be seen on the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Beattie_96de.html" title="Peter Beattie">Peter Beattie</a> page. This page is obviously edited by one of Mr Beatties 150 strong media entourage as it only reflects the few achievements of the Beattie government, not the current woes faced by Queensland under his rule. Editors need to have a very close look at this page. Whenever any of us try to ammend this page our work is undone within a matter of hours. Is this what Wikipedia is about? NO! Please have a good think about this. When you get to my age you will appreciate my concerns.</small></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Recent amendments I have added to this page have shown this site up for what it really is. I agree, it was originally an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement</a> probably set up by an employee of break.com, but now amongst the original self "back patting" the truths are coming out, thus, I strongly recomend we leave it in here. may teach them a valuable lesson! There are more to come! I also suggest that whilst these truths have been exposed, the page should be LOCKED. I also suggest Wikipedia barr the IP of the person who originally submitted this <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> from this page.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> its like an ad and is self promo. dont agree keepin it, this is an encyclpedia not a fun chat room. the truths about the site can go elsewhere.--<a href="../../../z/e/d/User%7EZedco_fe29.html" title="User:Zedco">Zedco</a> 11:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><small>Veteran Wiki Archivist 18:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC) Yes it was an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> which is why I edited it. Break.com has always portrayed itself as a squeaky clean site for kids. My recent modifications to this <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> has exposed this site for what it really is. Parents also need to know these truths to prevent their children from entering this site.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Non-notable? Spam? These users must not know <i>anyone</i> that works in an office with a computer. Break.com is one of 3 premiere "workplace diversion" media sites,(Break.com, Thatvideosite.com, eBaumsworld.com) albeit the riskiest of the 3(frequently unfiltered adult-oriented content). It is very notable, (though not my personal favourite). I agree with the "badly written" comment, but that can be redone easily.

<li><b>Keep</b> The content is sourceable and is encyclopedic. It by no means serves as an advertisement, and I can well understand the reticence of Veteran Wiki Archivist.

<li><b>Keep</b> agree with DGG. Alexa rank of 73 in the US is a strong indicator of notability. I think many of the comments here reflect an anti-commercial bias. Describing a company and its products is not necessarily advertising or spam. As far as the tone, I don't think it is any worse than the average WP article--sure it could be improved, but it does not deserve some of the overly negative comments registered above. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 23:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> A clean up was warranted but most of the content seems fine now. I cannot understand the removal of the "culture section" within the last 24 hours. There have been a few unnecessary deletes within the last 72 hours. I have edited several sections and have left explanatory notes. <b>I have also locked the page and recommend that this be finalised withing 24 hours</b>, will mention this to Wiki Admin.
