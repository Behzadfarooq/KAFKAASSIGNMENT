<p><b>Update</b> - the related (nomen omen) List of unrelated vehicles with identical nameplates was deleted for similar reasons. NOT deleting this article now would be nothing short of a case of WikiSchizophrenia.<br />
I also hope some of the editors of those articles managed to create a copy within their user pages, or perhaps will dig one out of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archives_118a.html" title="Internet Archives">Internet Archives</a>, so that it won't be lost. Those are really fun and it would be a pity of so much work just went up in fumes. They only don't belong in Wikipedia, but perhaps in some less encyclopedic and more relaxed, car- or trivia-oriented Wiki.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are fairly specific grounds for inclusion in the "list".

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, the article seems a bit lacking in focus and direction - it's not clear what actually constitutes an 'oddity' - mostly it reads just like some guy rambling on about things that he finds curious or interesting. I doubt that many people would be seeking this information - so it's mostly just a big waste of time for the editor(s). On the other hand, I'm not a 'deletionist' and I don't think this page is actually doing any harm beyond the $0.01 worth of disk space it consumes. It's not misleading anyone with false information (as far as I can tell) - so...meh...keep it I guess. (NOTE: In the interests of openness, I should note that I was surprised to discover that I'd actually contributed to the article - but that was only to correct <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Mini</a> to <a href="../../../m/i/n/MINI_%28BMW%29_9c2b.html" title="MINI (BMW)">MINI</a>). 18:49, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - so perhaps I'll just go and start this List of actresses whose given name is longer than family name. Also, how about List of motor cars whose front track exceeds their height?

<li><b>Comment</b> - which brings us back to the age-old <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">m:Deletionism</a> versus <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:Inclusionism">m:Inclusionism</a> debate. I'm an unabashed inclusionist and I don't have a problem with these ultra-obscure lists - even the two ridiculous examples you mention here. They are pointless - probably nobody will ever read them - but the cost in terms of disk space consumed by all of these ridiculous lists put together is negligable compared to even a single unnecessary 2000x2000 resolution picture of a <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> or something. The only kinds of lists I object to are the ones that are downright misleading or which will turn into untruths if not actively maintained (which they won't be). So I would delete a hypothetical List of the most popular candybars because in six months tastes will change and the list will be <i><b>wrong</b></i>. But List of actresses whose given name is longer than family name may be incomplete - but so long as it has the template at the top that warns that the list is incomplete - then we aren't misleading anyone. The red flag for me is lists with superlatives in the title "The most XXX" or "The worst XXX" - those are unmaintainable and must die. So what is the benefit to keeping these pointless articles? Well, it prevents flamefests between people who wish to delete them and the people who (often stupidly) created them. That's a good thing for harmony and peace in the Wikisphere. But this is a deep and ancient debate and we aren't going to resolve it here. The fate of these articles randomly depends on the ratio of inclusionists to deletionists who happen to sign the AfD. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm also an inclusionist, and am unhappy that this was again proposed so soon after a no-concensus was reached.

<ul>
<li>This was not my intention as nominator. The last nomination was closed with <b>no consensus</b> because the discussion sprawled over too many unrelated issues, and some reasons for deletion mentioned were not applicable or sufficient. Yet one important reason prevails and it has been omitted by most disputants and the closer, so I wanted it to be discussed specifically - as explained in the lead section. Unfortunately, only one of the persons participating in the current discussion related to it in their comments.

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, I'll take on the "indiscriminate list of trivia" item. That entry lists certain specific things that should not be included. Among these are Lists of Frequently Asked Questions, Travel guides, Memorials, Instruction manuals, Internet guides, Textbooks and annotated texts, and Plot summaries. This is none of these. It is an article about odd marques and makes of automobiles, where "odd" specifically means "unusual" (per wiktionary). These are all unusual. As for whether it belongs here, I feel it does. It was created and edited by many people, contains much interesting information, and is no less encyclopedic than most other lists (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recent_automobile_models_by_type.html" title="List of recent automobile models by type">List of recent automobile models by type</a> for a particularly ridiculous list). At least it's somewhat interesting, factual, and fairly complete... However, I have another suggestion: Perhaps this should be merged with the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marque.html" title="Marque">marque</a> article, since these seem in general to support that topic. --<a href="../../../s/f/o/User%7ESfoskett_16b5.html" title="User:Sfoskett">SFoskett</a> 13:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it could be a very good solution! I think the marque article could explain how marques and model names are used and give examples of some peculiarities, so that some of them listed here could be salvaged. Do you think you could do that? Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 14:11, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The "inclusionism vs. deletionism" debate is not helpful in resolving this AfD; people should leave that noise on policy-debate pages and discuss the facts of this topic and how they fit policies. "Let the troublemakers have their way to avoid fights" is neither WP policy nor a way to produce a better encyclopedia; this instead reduces WP's credibility. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:01, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I thought so, but I misread the source. He composed music not as an individual, but as a member of two ensembles (what role he had in those is unknown). The music was then performed in a bunch of places, not performed by a band that toured in all those places (so we have no idea if the bands are notable).--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 22:47, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article is linked from <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Bros._television_series_e439.html" title="Super Mario Bros. television series">Super_Mario_Bros._television_series</a>. This appears to be an episode of Captain N and the Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. I watched that show when I was a child so I know it exists. Wikipedia already has several articles on television articles, so it appears that a television episode is a notable topic for wikipedia. There has already been some debate about the notability of television episodes at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Television_episodes</a>. That page states: "First, create an article on the television show. Once there's enough independently verifiable information to do so, create articles on each season, or some other logical division, of the show. Once there's enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes, spin the information from episodes out into their own articles." If the article is too short, it might be a good idea to merge all the episodes of a season into one article. Also, one episode of this show consisted of a 15 minute "mini-episode" of Super Mario Bros., 30 minutes of Captain N, then another 15 minutes of Mario Bros. Thus, I think that if each episode has its own article, it might be better for the two "mini-episodes" that were aired as part of a bigger episode to share an article. In regard to the article needing references: shouldn't the episode itself count as a reference? <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 04:47, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an article about a non-noteable minor Atari game; furthermore, the only actual text in the article is a reference to a DIFFERENT article that says the game is "one of the worst ever on the Atari". On top of that, the only OTHER thing present in the article is a box that was ripped off the Atari Age website without permission. There is nothing in this article worth keeping. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 04:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the author wrote a book, likely inventing the term and the act, the book but not the term got a mention in a movie and a magazine, and there is no indication that it is a sexual practice in the real world. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:06, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The reference where she says that she heard it on a 1970s soap opera? That's highly doubtful given the morality at the time, and a soap opera is not what I would consider a reliable source. If the term existed before the book, I suspect that it was an obscure slang term with various meanings. Finally, as I said before, there is no indication that it is a sexual practice in the real world (similar to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">donkey punch</a>). I am not sure what would qualify as her as Canada's top sex expert. The only education given in the article is nursing. I would expect that Canada's top sex expert would be a physician (or at least a PhD) with additional training and possibly degrees in human sexuality, urology and obstectrics. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 13:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I suspect people would take her advice and try the technique- if she hadn't tried it herself.

<li>Is it not Wikipedia's intent to let others copy and use/distribute the Wiki articles for the spread of education/information? If that is so, the Kambojsociety website is simply placing the Wikipedia Articles of interest to them on their site for the spread of information. Probably they should somewhere say that the articles belong to Wikipedia.</li>

<li>I don't have much bad feeling about it, either, and I agree with you about our goals. The problem is just that it creates extra work for us if they do that with many articles (b/c things like this happen).

<dd>Looking at the article history, I see that was suggested in 2005 when this article was first put up for AfD (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_M%C3%A9gad%C3%B4me_b86d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mégadôme">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mégadôme</a>). I have no problem with merging into La Ronde, although I'm not sure if there is anything worth merging. The article strikes me as entirely deletable. Is a Nintendo promotional display noteworthy enough to merit mentioning in the La Ronde article? I can't tell from this article if the former dolphin talk is noteworthy or not. Maybe someone with more familiarity with La Ronde and this so-called Mégadôme could shed some light on this. --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 11:49, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia doesn't have articles about either of the high schools involved, but no doubt such articles would be kept if they were written. Nevertheless, having an annual "rivalry game" is common in high school sports, and the question should be whether the Muck Bowl is a notable example of that. It does get some Google hits, but many seem to be from local media or a local web forum. It gets no Google Groups hits at all. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 08:12, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. The majority of editors arguing for deletion brings it close to that point, but as there isn't a particularly overwhelming argument against the numerous, apparently independent web articles being ineligible to be considered "reliable and reputable" (several are certainly not blogs), it's insufficient. None of the evidence presented appears to have significantly changed the direction of the discussion, but little of it was directly replied to, leaving this discussion inconclusive. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 14:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

In contrast, Moulann is a completely independent artist. The two artists are representing completely different genres and markets. Remember that there is room in wiki for artists outside the mass media tradition. Moulann has been documented at least 3 times (that I've found online and personally heard) on CBC Radio One, Canada's most notable and credible radio station, as well as other significant Canadian and Asian-Canadian media.

Although the subject should be congratulated for attaining All American status, having ONLY THIS ACHIEVEMENT does not make the subject "widely recognizable" or "memorable" (as per the 100-year test in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies</a>) or "encyclopedic".

By the way, when <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states "at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States", I would suggest that the "highest level" in the subject's sport would be at the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> level. Ultimately, the question is: "Is the subject well known BEFORE being placed as an entry into the Wikipedia?" The answer is: "No." (And as an afterthought, what about an athlete for a sport like <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>, which is not a game included in the Olympics?

<li>I'm sorry, I don't understand. Just because something is verifiable does not make it encyclopedic or notable or worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia. Your referenced "verifiable" article <a href="http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-track/recaps/060906aaa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-track/recaps/060906aaa.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> states that he achieved 11th place at the NCAA Track &amp; Field Championship. That competition is not the "highest level" in the field of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_jump.html" title="High jump">high jump</a>, and his performance was not the "highest level" even within the competition. The Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_jump.html" title="High jump">high jump</a> has, as its illustration, "Gold medal winner Ethel Catherwood of Canada scissors over the bar at the 1928 Summer Olympics." Are you suggesting that the Olympic games are at a lesser level than the NCAA Track &amp; Field Championship? (When I read the phrase "at the highest level...including college sports in the United States", I'm assuming that the phrase means "at the highest level of a sport which could be played in college, including sports played in the United States not played anywhere else in the world", which takes precedence over "at the highest United-States-level of college-sports-in- the-United-States". There's a subtle difference, which goes back to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> example I gave earlier. )</li>

<li>Actually, it was the highest level at the competition, as it granted him All-American status. That makes him one of the tops <i>in the nation</i> that year. I've always read the "highest level" clause as "We have articles on professional athletes, which is the highest possible level for those sports, and articles on the top atheletes at the amateur level when there's no professional alternative," such as these track stars. The Olympic Games are an entirely different situation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:55, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>We don't have a hand-picked national team that competes internationally in these sports? I find that hard to believe.

<li>Badlydrawnjeff, it is possible to be a high jumper after college; see <a href="https://www.usatf.org/athletes/bios/oldBios/2004/Austin_Charles.asp" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.usatf.org/athletes/bios/oldBios/2004/Austin_Charles.asp" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> (also located in Wikipedia as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Austin_3019.html" title="Charles Austin">Charles Austin</a>), who was born in 1967 and "proved he is still a force by winning the 2003 U.S. indoor title.". According to the article, Austin even has an agent (Cubie Seegobin) . Likewise, college athletes do participate in the high jump in the Olympics, such as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollis_Conway_44f4.html" title="Hollis Conway">Hollis Conway</a>: "Conway went 7-8 3/4 in the event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, setting a U.S. <b>collegiate</b> record and earning a silver medal. He won a bronze medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain after going 7-8 1/2 in winning the U.S. Olympic Team Trials that year." There are also other international venues; check out the Wikipedia entry regarding <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations_f85a.html" title="International Association of Athletics Federations">International Association of Athletics Federations</a>. As far as Beauchman's earning <b>11th</b> place in the competition, there are only <b>ten</b> All American high jumpers <a href="http://ustfccca.cstv.com/sports/division1/spec-rel/061906aab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ustfccca.cstv.com/sports/division1/spec-rel/061906aab.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Furthermore, "He was the eighth American in the field" of that particular compeition <a href="http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-track/recaps/060906aaa.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-track/recaps/060906aaa.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, so apparently two All-Americans didn't compete in that particular <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_e914.html" title="NCAA">NCAA</a> competition (or did worse than he did?), and at least three foreign-born students did better than he did...? So I'm guessing a) that All American status is determined by one's overall performance during a season, and therefore b) that the particular competition in which he placed 11th was not THE highest level ("the IAAF" equivalent or "international ultimate-finale event") in his field.</li>

<li>At the collegiate level, this is THE highest level meet. Anything beyond, including the olympics, would no longer fall under the scope of the collegiate level. The status of All-American is awarded to the top 8 finishers and the top 8 americans overall in an event AT the NCAA National Meet. Beauchman was the 8th finishing american, earning the HIGHEST recognition by the USTFCCCA and the NCAA. The finisher in 9th was not an american, and because of this only 10 persons were awarded All-American status. While the specualtion about whether this is the highest level has been only that, speculation, as a track and field coach, I can assure you that this IS the highest level meet on the collegiate level, therefore satisfying the guidlines set forth by Wikipedia. Look at any collegiate track and field team schedule, and you will notice it is the final meet, and the meet most prized by all programs, with only their most talented and dedicated competing at that level.

<dd>Question 1: According to your explanation, is it correct to draw the conclusion that "All American" status could be conferred in the field of high jump in any given year upon anywhere between eight students (all top 8 finishers are American born) and sixteen students (top 8 finishers are foreign-born, followed by 8 American born)&#160;?</dd>
<dd>Question 2: Would the following situation be possible: Suppose all but one high jumper at this final event had been born outside the United States. The sole American-born student earns dead-last place among all the competitors. But he still would get "All American" status, correct?</dd>
<dd>Question 3: Is the NCAA National Meet limited to American colleges, or can colleges from other countries (such as from Germany) participate?

<li>The scenarios you suggested above would be possible, yet that american who finished last would still be the BEST american collegiate high jumper in the country, quite an achievement in itself. But I believe you are approaching this competition in the wrong manner. The amount of qualifying for the event means that only the BEST collegiate atheletes will make it to the meet, and only the ELITE will excel. All atheltes who wish to compete must meet a qualifying standard in order to enter a regional meet. Then at the 4 regional meets (east, mideast, midwest, west), only the top 5 are guarenteed a spot at the national meet(Beauchman finished second at the regional meet, losing first only in a jump-off with a florida jumpoff). This double qualifying means only the best are invited to the National meet, which is only for schools in the NCAA, which are US schools. International schools have different requirements of their students who are allowed to compete (no age limit or amateur requirement), so there is no world collegiate meet. I hope that helps.Tracksharked 03:55, 11 August 2006</li>

<li>Thank you for the clarification regarding my questions. It sounds to me that the NCAA National Meet is very important in the domain of the NCAA (or more specifically, Division I college athletics?), and is the final word in the realm of NCAA participants, but arguably it is not the final word for college athletes in general. There was nothing stopping him from participating in the Olympic trials during college or afterwards except for his desire to participate and his own performance in trials, correct? If Beauchman wins a medal at the Olympics, then he most probably would deserve to be included in the Wikipedia, for he would likely become "well known" (his name would probably be printed in every newspaper in the country, and he would probably appear on national television for the awards ceremony and/or interviews); otherwise, ONLY winning the NCAA National Meet or gaining All American status would be insufficient. The spirit of the guidelines in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBIO_f7ad.html" title="Wikipedia:BIO">Wikipedia: BIO</a> emphasizes that people must be <i>"widely recognized", "well-known", "whose work is widely recognized",</i> or of "<i>renown or notoriety"</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBIO_f7ad.html" title="Wikipedia:BIO">Wikipedia: BIO</a> states (bold emphasis mine) <i>"People who satisfy at least one of the items below <b>generally</b> merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is <b>likely</b> to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a <b>good deal of public interest in them</b>."</i> In other words, the criteria are not a <i>guarantee</i> for inclusion, but only increase the <i>probability</i> of inclusion: a person could be the winner of the NCAA National Meet yet also still be completely obscure to the general public, and therefore not worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia. I went over to www.ncaa.org, and typed in "<i>Beauchman</i>" in the search field; it replied with "<i>No results matched your query</i>".</li>

<p>1. As correctly noted above by Bugmuncher, there is NO SUCH THING as "Hawaiian English" in "The Constitution of the State of Hawaii". It is "English", NOT "Hawaiian English", that is an official language of the State of Hawaii. The stub/article makes a FALSE statement and misrepresents the law.</p>
<p>2. Hawaiian language is NEVER REQUIRED in any State of Hawaii activities UNLESS specifically "provided by law". There are NO STATE LAWS requiring the use of Hawaiian language. The stub/article makes another FALSE statement, and again misrepresents the law.</p>
<p>3. The mere optional use of a macron and an opening single quote (so-called <i>`okina</i>), by certain enthusiasts (zealots), does NOT create a "dialect" of English.</p>
<p>4. The claim that use of the two marks is preferred by the majority of Hawaii's people is the DELUSION of an "okina lunatic".</p>
<p>5. The stub/article uses the word "Standard" to describe "Hawaiian English". There is NO SUCH THING as "Standard Hawaiian English". Where are the alleged "standards"? Where are they published? Who has the authority to fabricate such "standards"?</p>
<p>6. The stub/article has NOT ONE reference, and NOT ONE citation.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Okay, really, you could have just linked the talk page. However, from reading this, uh, diatribe, it seems to me like there's some POV pushing going on here. Anyway, let me throw out a few academic references that I skimmed, courtesy of <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a>. Standard English and Student Bodies: Institutionalizing Race and Literacy in Hawai'i (Young, M., 2002; College English 64:4) addresses the way the pidgin and ASE have clashed up until now, with some specific information on the varying uses of it in the culture. There's also the ancient The English Dialect of Hawaii (Reinecke, J. E., &amp; Tokimasa, A., 1934; American Speech 9:1) which does, however, seem to address the creole more specifically. English Patterns in Hawaii (Odo, C., 1970; American Speech 45:3/4) talks about Hawaiian English specifically. Just by looking at JSTOR's results, it seems that what academic literature there is a bit old and may well be talking about <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii_Creole_English_d53d.html" title="Hawaii Creole English">Hawaii Creole English</a> instead.

<li>The above comment is unsigned, so it's not clear who to address. Anyway, pointing out that certain statements in an encyclopedia article are false is a community service, not "POV pushing".

<li><b>Delete unless completely rewritten before the AFD is over</b>. Hawaiian English exists, of course, but it is not a written standard distinct from American English, as the article implies.

<p>I have lived in Hawaii for about 50 years. Do any of you find my writing to constitute a "standard dialect" of "Hawaiian English"? If I had not told you that I've lived in Hawaii for 50 years, would you have known, from my written English, that I have?</p>
<p>Hawaii is very diverse linguistically. Diversity wreaks havoc on "standardness". Our statewide community is one of the most racially mixed, economically mixed, socially mixed, educationally mixed, and linguistically mixed, in the USA. We have over 800,000 short-term visitors (tourists) per year, nearly equalling our total population. A significant portion of our residents are military personnel and families who move on to their next assignment after a few years here. We have significant continuous immigration from around the world, and many locally born-and-raised people move away as adults because the <i>median</i> cost for a house is over $600,000 and most of us can't afford that. In such a dynamic, transient, and diverse population, you don't get a "standard" dialect of anything. If you search long enough, you might be able to find books that make almost any claims that you want to "verify". But just because something got published, that doesn't guarantee that it's claims are true. Anyway, if one of you people who want to keep the "Hawaiian English" article manages to write up an intelligent piece that does not make clearly false claims, that will be okay with me. But the current "rubbish", as Angr correctly described it, must be DELETED. Agent X 11:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Half-page entry on ppg 463-4, covering distinctive features, vocabulary, local usage (like giving directions: "Go <i>ewa</i> one block, turn <i>makai</i> at the traffic light, go two blocks Diamond Head, and you'll find the place on the <i>mauka</i> side of the street"). And before you ask, there are separate entries for "Hawaii", "Hawaiian", "Hawaii Creole English", AND "Hawaii Pidgin English", so no, they're no confusing "Hawaiian English" with anything else. And the nom's ranting about the <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okina.html" title="Okina">okina</a> is contradicted by the "Hawaiian" article, where it describes the glottal stop "where some have /k/, marked in technical writing by a reverse inverted apostrophe (’) and in general usage by an ordinary apostrophe (') (<i>mu’umu’u</i> or <i>mu'umu'u</i> for <i>mukumuku</i>, a loose-fitting woman's dress)..."

<li>To Calton --- You call The Constitution of the State of Hawaii a "weird tangent". It's quoted above. You should try reading the discussion, with comprehension, before opening your mouth. You should also read the article nominated for deletion. As you can see, if you actually read the relevant discussion above, I seconded the comments of Angr, who pointed out that a dialect is spoken language, as opposed to written. It is the writer of the Hawaiian English article, not me, who has claimed that the use of okinas in WRITING has created a dialect of American English. In asking if anyone finds my writing to constitute a "standard dialect" of "Hawaiian English", I am pointing out that nobody can. Apparently that was "over your head". As for your comment about glottal stops, you are demonstrating profound ignorance. The stuff you quoted relates to Hawaiian, NOT to Hawaiian English. In the historical development of the Hawaiian phonemes, Proto Polynesian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">*k</span> is reflected as Hawaiian <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʔ/</span>. Diachronic sound changes do not take place instantly throughout the lexicon, some words are like stragglers, and some simply resist a sound change even though the change affects nearly every other word in the language. That's why there are some variant forms, like <i>mukumuku</i> and <i>mu`umu`u</i>. The older form has <i>k</i>, the newer form has glottal stop. But again, your quote is totally irrelevant to Hawaiian English, and it demonstrates that you don't know what you're talking about. If you are interested in Hawaiian phonology, check out my contributions to the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_language.html" title="Hawaiian language">Hawaiian language</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_phonology.html" title="Hawaiian phonology">Hawaiian phonology</a> pages. When I first contributed to the Hawaiian language page, before having a user account, I put in a citation. It was the first and only citation in the article. Every single citation that's in the article now was put in by me. As for the use of directional expressions, like "mauka" or "makai", it's not something that everyone has to use. I've been speaking English in Hawaii for about 50 years, and I don't use "mauka" or "makai". Some people do. But the usage of "some people" does not make it "standard" for all speakers. When I speak Hawaiian (not "Hawaiian English"), which I speak fluently, then I use <i>ma uka</i> and <i>ma kai</i>, or <i>i uka</i> and <i>i kai</i>, or <i>ā uka</i> and <i>ā kai</i>, as appropriate in a given context. But I don't use those expressions when I speak English, which is my first language. The mere usage of four directional expressions, by a subset of people (who are probably trying too hard to show that they are "local"), is not very significant, and is not enough to justify an encyclopedia article on a "dialect". A dialect is characterized by speech behavior which is automatic and generally beyond the conscious control of the speaker, as opposed to optional, conscious selections of lexical items and expressions.

<li>Maybe a disambiguation page can help. The 3 expressions "Hawaiian Pidgin (English)", "Hawaiian Creole English", and "Hawaiian English", can be easily confused by people who have not previously considered technical linguistic terminology such as "pidgin" (not originally a first language for anyone), versus "creole" (a pidgin which has become a first language for at least some people), versus a U.S.-State-reckoned geographical variety of English ("Hawaii English", "Oregon English", "Arizona English", etc.). I would not be surprised if some publications have used the phrase "Hawaiian English" to mean the same thing as "Hawaiian Creole English" or "Hawaiian Pidgin", rather than to mean "the first-language English of people raised in the U.S. State of Hawaii, which is not creole (nor pidgin)". Perhaps there could be an article titled something like "English in Hawaii". Such an article could point out the simultaneous co-existence of many different Englishes in Hawaii, along with many other languages, and discuss the influences of those languages on "Englishes spoken in Hawaii". Since Hawaii has tourists from all 50 U.S. states, off-and-on all year long, every year, every different State-reckoned English is constantly being spoken in Hawaii. We also have Japanese-accented English, Filipino-accented English, Thai-accented English, etc., etc. However, supporting published sources may be lacking for such an article. Perhaps the only one of the different "Englishes of Hawaii" that has enough published discussion to support an encyclopedia article is the pidgin/creole. If <b>redirect</b> means that the current "Hawaiian English" stub/article will be eliminated, then that's okay with me. Agent X 15:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"DELETE"Absolutely a "must" for deletion, under the this policy: "Articles whose deletion should be uncontroversial but which don't meet the "utter rubbish" criteria for speedy deletion. This is often used for articles which appear to have genuine content but which the deleter feels are not suitable content for Wikipedia, such as advertising, vanity articles, and the like." Claypoole, across the web, has amply demonstrated that this entry falls into the "advertising" and "vanity" category. She is an entirely self-promoted "writer" of dubious talent and integrity. Long a thorn in the side of Indian Country, she persists in presenting herself as an expert on complex Native American issues and then waxing mystical about life and death issues. She has savaged the tragedy of the death of Anna Mae Aquash, even in the title of her self-financed (other than that paid for by Jordan Dill, another self-promoter) book _Who Would Unbraid Her Hair_. Claypoole, who is not Indian, apparently channels the occult notion that Aquash's hands were cut off so that her spirit could not have rest, as then her warrior braid couldn't be properly dealt with. In reality, the hands were cut off for another reason--not that you'll find facts in her writings. She is simply another Indian hanger-on with dubious credentials, mostly drummed up by her own self-promotion. Now she's into using her publicity to create customers for writers' retreats. **If you'd like to learn about her, visit the Google Groups alt.native Just a quick Google search turned up enough Claypoole blogs and various websites to support the contention of this article being "advertising" and "vanity."<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>==***Here is an alt.native post from Claypoole herself acknowledging that her book was published by Jordan Dill, a website operator: "From antoinette - Date: Sat, Dec 16 2000 5:14 am .... as some of you know, the work i wrote which was published by jordan s. dill, WHO WOULD UNBRAID HER HAIR, the legend of annie mae, ... " Other than her backer Jordan Dill's website, all of Claypoole's promotions appear on her own blogs and websites. Wikipedia doesn't need to be one of them.--Ardith010 09:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)Ardith010</p>

<p>Seems to be a commercial Advert. Google has only 10 hits, one is the company itself, two are Wikipedia, and the rest are from forums. <a href="../../../r/h/m/User%7ERhmoore_37a6.html" title="User:Rhmoore">rhmoore</a> 09:29, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well it's not. It's my page. It's hardly a company, either, it's a free game. And it's in development. I'm sorry if it sounds like an advert, I can see to it that I edit it around to remove anything that tries to.. advertise and make it a little more formal. It's very hard to do this, though, when the game isn't done, and you're just looking for forum members.</p>
<p>Commercial Advert? No. It doesn't make money so it's not commercial and it's not an advert. I can't find many other ways to word an unfinished game. Lassaris 09:05, 6 August 2006 (GMT+10)</p>

<p>The reason this game in particular is notable is because the developers are trying to keep away from many of the things that have been done in other MMORPGs... If this particular page is an advert, please edit as much as you want to draw it away from that, we are simply stating the facts... If this is deleted, why not delete the World of Warcraft entry? This was intended to be similar to that... Thellis 12:10, 7 August 2006 (GMT+10)</p>
<p>This game will be great as the team are fansastic to work with and we have members from all over the globe. Every thing has to start someware and suggestions on how to improve are better than deletion as we are 100% dedicated to making this happen. Yes at the mo we are bulding the game from using the forum as we want input from players and to expand our current vision to the best of the best and we are only in the first stages of work. We have lots of stuff in development from paper based design to be modled to in depth storys for quests. Why delete some thing that isnt finished?? Kainin 12:31, 10 August 2006 (GMT+0)</p>

<p>First, please see the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Overlinking_eb37.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Overlinking">original VfD</a> from 2004. That closed as <i>no consensus</i>, largely because of repeated claims that "This is not an article. It is an unfinished scrap of writing. It is on a legitimate topic, but has not been written yet." In short, two years ago, there was a claim that this was <i>not</i> just a piece of wikimeta and that it would grow into an article that would meet Wikipedia's expectations.</p>
<p>It hasn't done that. It it uncited. It sets arbitrary characterizations and "rule[s] of thumb" that fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> at best.

<dd><i>Comment</i> As per formulated title, this list should include not only products with AOC, such as cheese and wines, but also local specialties such as Castelnaudary Cassoult, piment d'Espelette, Perigord foie gras and <i>confit</i>... it needs not be redundant at all --<a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvartalf_4e9b.html" title="User:Svartalf">Svartalf</a> 02:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem then goes back to the lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> criteria for inclusion. What standard needs to be set to determine if a product is a local specialty? And how local do these specialties need to be? Would a cheese qualify if its production was unique to a <i>commune</i>? To a <i>département</i>? To a <i>région</i>? And once we try to expand this to any sort of recipe, worse problems arise. Without verifiable listing requirements, this is an invitation for everyone with a French grandmother to grant "local specialty" status to their favorite family recipe. Of course, if some appropriately-documented criteria for inclusion can be found, that would assuage many of my concerns. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The magazine caters to the "demoscene," by its nature a fairly insular community, and a community notable for other reasons than its numbers. An electronic zine pointed toward an audience that likes to create graphics programs in assembler code, that stays in publication for 10 years/32 issues is "notable" to me. Others may differ. Google hits for 'hugi diskmag' are about 15k, not huge, but, sampling a few of the hits, the publication seems to be well-regarded. Very nice website, too. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> 22:33, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although the article does need improvement, I strongly disagree with the suggested unnotability of the publication. Hugi is an "underground diskmag", yes, because it concentrates around the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a>, an "underground subculture", however, Hugi happens to be one of the most notable demoscene zines.

<li><b>Abstain —</b> , since I'm the author. Hello wikipeople, it's me, the author of the Ducklet DeskPhoto article. Thank you for the spanking. I will be honest, open, calm, and reasonable in this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm new here (well, new to Wikipedia--not to the planet), so I didn't know all the rules. Common sense gave me some inkling of what the rules probably were, but I knew that wasn't enough so I did a fair amount of due diligence before posting the article in question. I read about posting policies, etc. for more than an hour before and during the writing of the post.</p>
<p>I learned many important rules and guidelines while doing this research, and ran across a number of examples that helped my education as well. Among them were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stick to the facts. I tried to do that.</li>
<li>I noticed there are many articles on software programs, so I gathered that an article about a software program was (at least in some cases) appropriate. From these I found the Infobox_Software template (and learned all about templates in the process, whee!).</li>
<li>As hard as I tried to find guidelines on posting about specific types of content, I was unable to find anything specific to software projects. Thanks, Haakon, for using the wording "non-notable software project" in your nomination for deletion--that helped me find the <i>proposed</i> Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">Software Notability</a>. The proposal seems reasonable so I won't dispute it here, even though it's only a proposal, not adopted. (Besides, this wouldn't be the place to dispute it anyway.)</li>
<li><b>Be bold</b>. I saw this recommendation many times. I like the spirit of this recommendation--pull lurkers out of the woodwork to have more people contributing. Nice.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was in the spirit of <b>be bold</b> that I finally decided to go ahead and post my article even though I still wasn't sure if it was appropriate. If it wasn't, someone would point that out to me. (As you have done.)</p>
<p>Oh well. Live and learn. I said I would be honest: I will honestly admit that my goal was to do a bit of PR and generate interest in the software. I can also honestly state that I tried my best to do so in a professional manner and tried hard to follow all the rules of Wikipedia that I knew about, and even to follow the <i>spirit</i> of Wikipedia since, being so new, I couldn't possibly know all the rules. My attempt to follow the spirit shows, I hope, in the tone of the article (facts, not hyperbole or opinion) and in the similarity it bears to Wikipedia articles about other software programs.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm not sure how you got only 4 hits on Google, Haakon. Just a a factual point, when I search for ducklet deskphoto or +ducklet +deskphoto or "ducklet deskphoto" I get 16-17 hits. I'm not disputing that it's not notable--it's not like I get 13 million hits or anything--but it's also not 4.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading all this.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm 57 years old, was somewhat involved in counter-culture movements (like everybody else was) in 1966 forward, and the Sexual Freedom League was pretty well-known 'back in the day.' I found the article as it is enlightening, no doubt it could be improved. Margo St. James was also known as "the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realist.html" title="Realist">Realist</a> nun," something to do with a prank performed with the assistance of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Realist_4112.html" title="The Realist">The Realist</a>'s editor <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Krassner_d687.html" title="Paul Krassner">Paul Krassner</a>. The SFL may indeed have existed on the "fringe" of notability, but in the mid-sixties many things later subsumed to the mainstream -- all of the 'counter-culture' that came into its own by 1970 -- was 'non-notable.' SFL did, if my memory may be trusted, score frequent mention in Krassner's (now) well-respected publication (I was an avid reader). 40 years after its peak, 500+ hits in Google does not seem shabby. Lack of contributors is easily explained -- many lifetyle casualties in that era. Records like this are rare and historically valuable, though difficult to source. Sam Sloan lived in a time of historical nexus, characterized by conflicts of old and new, something similar was portrayed in Milos Forman's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_8881.html" title="The People vs. Larry Flynt">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a>. I don't think the occurence of his name is a problem. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> 18:39, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

"The Realist Nun" was a well-known prank of its time, in my circle, anyway -- zero hits in Google, but Google groups offers three hits, ranging from 1995 to one a couple of weeks ago. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBustter_0784.html" title="User:Bustter">Bustter</a> 10:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Lack of G-hits is my main concern, and I still have some doubt as to whether Bustter and/or Sam Sloan may be socks, but am still assuming good faith for now. If it's as notable as Bustter claims, it may warrant an article, but how much content can it retain while remaining verifiable? Maybe Sam Sloan or others could write a book about this and others like it that can then be cited as a source in an NPOV article.

<li>I don't believe that the magazine poses as a directory, but rather a source for current information on fan film projects. It is just a matter that, within Wikipedia, there is no more thorough listing of fan films under this forum. The closest may have 25-40, but we are surpassing 200 fan films listed, and are prepared to add another 70 in the near future. In addition to discussing over 200 fan films in its' publication history, the magazine also talks about related issues, to include financial distress, legal ramifications, potential future projects, and other real issues that fan film companies have faced.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to point out that, in Issue #3, we covered KISS and the potential for a fan film based on the 100+ tribute bands across the world. I think <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">cholmes75</a> would have liked the article.

A forum without media coverage and just 100 members just doesn't have the notability for more than a mention in the stormfront article, which is already there.

<p>This article is about a "future product," the "iPhone." However, there is no evidence that Apple intends to release a telephone, or that such a telephone is even in development. Unlike products such as Microsoft's Zune, which the company has stated it intends to release, Apple has never made any statements regarding the production of a phone. This page is not at all encyclopedic, citing sources that are nothing more than rumors and speculation. Until there is something more than guesswork to back up the existence of such a product, this page should not exist. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulus89_6ad4.html" title="User:Paulus89">Paulus89</a> 19:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has an Alexa rank of 13,519 and claims over 650k accounts, though I highly suspect that they are counting every account ever made rather than active accounts (they delete accounts after about a month of inactivity). I've seen 500-1000 players on at once, maximum. Its notable, but IMO browser-based games have to stand up to a very high standard of notability to be recognized on Wikipedia.

<dd>Right... that editor was me. And I apologize for giving you a headache, as I noticed that I misspelled the proper name for the website,and moved the article thussly. I would think in this case the impact of the website should not be judged based upon webiste hits, but in terms of the cultural impact on the Video Game Remix community. If you were to ask any of the people at OLR, or OverClocked Remix for that matter, they'd definitely say that OLR is notable.</dd>

<p>Okay, welcome to the discussion, and it's good to see you being sensible about this (website and other internet-phenomenon-related AfDs can tend to degenerate into sockpuppetry and "zOMG but itz teh best siet evar, fewels!"). Wikipedia has established guidelines for what constitutes a notable website at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. To sum it up briefly, for a website to be notable enough for an article it either has to have been written about in multiple <i>non-trivial</i> publications (i.e. not blogs or forums or such), or to have won a major independent web award, or they are a site that distributes their content through another well-known site independent of the creators. As it stands, OverLooked ReMiX does not appear to meet any of these criteria. The AfD process takes a week, so if in that time you can provide references that prove otherwise, then this strengthens the case for keeping the article. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 20:59, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this counts as a non-trivial source exactly but ThaSauce, a news website covering the video game remix community, has had several articles submitted, approved, and featured on the subject of OverLooked ReMix, a list of which is <a href="http://www.thasauce.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;new_topic=28" class="external text" title="http://www.thasauce.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;new_topic=28" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --Phanlax 23:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OverLooked ReMiX is a parody of the main site for video game remixing, <a href="../../../o/v/e/OverClocked_ReMix_d57a.html" title="OverClocked ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a>. That site is so popular that it has even spread to OLRemix.org and VGMix.com, all of which have different standards in remixing and whatnot. If OC ReMix is considered just and follows the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, then why doesn't OL ReMiX? A parody of a popular site is deserving of a spotlight, too. DJ15Nario 20:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While YES, many people see OverLooked Remix as a parody of OverClocked Remix, I'm bothered by this. Instead of being closely connected to the happenings of OCR, we ourselves have grown and flourished into a legitimate online community. We ARE NOT OCR, nor should we EVER BE OCR. Our remixes are of a different brand. Simply because they may not be made with the most expensive musical equipment, just because they aren't all hardcore techno/trance, just because our remixes are meant to be funny sometimes as compared to OCR's serious tone, we ARE STILL a valid community with many members. OverLooked Remix remixers may not be professionals, but we do care about what we do and we do work to better ourselves. The community of OverLooked Remix is our outlet. As stated before we are tracked on thasauce and many of the people from OverClocked Remix enjoy coming to our site to see what we have to offer. By having this wiki, it will help inform others of the site and possibly help inspire young budding remixers (who are valid musicians, just of a different type than popularly thought) to work on their dreams, and not be discouraged by the high 'standards' that OverClocked Remix has. The OverLooked community has been talking about finally getting a wiki for a long time, as we respect this site and the content it contains, and if we were to have this deleted it would be a major blow to our site's morale. This wiki IS VERY important for the community, as many of our members are really looking forward to both reading and contributing to the article. We would like to simply have the respect that the other 'big' remix site has. Please consider keeping the OverLooked Remix wikipedia article. --GregZor 03:19, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe that olremix.org is a site worth documenting because, as the others before me have said, it is a thriving independant community. It doesn't get hitcounts quite as high as the other sites for the justifiable reason that it has been around for a fraction of the time (one and a half years versus six and a half for ocremix.org). However, for such a relatively new site it does impressively well, and gains popularity all the time. It is not premature to give olremix a spot on Wikipedia because it already posesses sufficient content and activity to warrant a reference for any and all curious about it. In addition, i think that olremix is also a stand-in for a whole genre of music which has been (forgive the pun) overlooked by other videogame remixing sites such as vgmix and ocremix. This genre is Home Music; independant, low-production amateur composition, rather than the professionalized mainstream rock/techno which is the exclusive domain of ocremix.org and its affiliates. If olremix.org is not represented, this whole subculture of the "gamer/musician hybrid" will be unrepresented. --The p00t 04:15, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Web specific-content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria: 3. The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster. -- Here it is right here. OverLooked Remix's content has been distributed via the website www.thasauce.net. This site is independant of OLR's creator. ThaSauce is also very well known among the remix community for the fine reporting it does on such remix sites such as OverClocked Remix, VGMix, AnimeRemix, and The Video Game Music Archive. Once again, let me stress that it IS independant of our admin/creator. Our content has also been distributed through several radio shows unaffiliated with OverLooked Remix such as "VGFrequency" AND "The Jump Button (WHFR FM)". I believe that our exposure on these mediums helps identify OverLooked Remix as a valid community AND helps the site be considered "Web-Specific Content".--GregZor 03:03, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This all seems really stupid you know, you guys should be worrying more about the truth and neutrality of articles than whether or not one is "notable" enough. You're prohibiting information to be put on a website that is about giving information, when you should be helping correct information where it is not correct.--Phanlax 04:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personally fail to see how an Alexa rating alone can substantiate a site as notable or not, especially since eon8 was receiving enough hits to cause intermittent server functioning, and its noteworthiness was debated. If a site as trivial as ilovebees.com gets its own, somewhat extensive page, and it too had a niche community involved with it, I don't see any reason why OLR shouldn't have its own article. True, the Halo series attracts quite a crowd, but then again, so does music. The media attention criterion is covered, though barely so, by www.thasauce.net, and whereas it's not CNN, it's popular among remix enthusiasts. We can thus conclude that OLR is, in fact, noteworthy within the remix community, which should be enough to satisfy your concerns. <b>Keep.</b> ~Tarrasque</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep.</b> I agree with Tarrasque. Just because the OLR page isn't popular doesn't mean that it deserves to be deleted. DJ15Nario 02:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Tarrasque. Oh, and everyone using the Alexa arguement, look <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html#Alexa_test" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">here</a>. This clearly states that the Alexa test itself is biased and requires software installation and MSIE for it to work and, not only that, it can easily be viewhacked. I don't know about you all, but I'm using Firefox and haven't even heard of Alexa except in my <i>spyware logs</i> while scanning with Ad-Aware. Hell, even simply <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=alexa&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=20&amp;sa=Nj" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=alexa&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=20&amp;sa=Nj" rel="nofollow">Googling</a> Alexa will turn up results on how their toolbar can be considered spyware and sites offering to "boost your Alexa ranking for free".

I just want to say that even those elitists in OCR sometimes give a tribute to OLR. it happened first with the Bound Together project by Joe Cam (which purpose was right actually to show how different websites can collaborate), and now with the Tim Follin project by Liontamer (who ISN'T some noob, but an important man on OCR, who also ran the radio show VGDJ and featured OL Remixes in VGDJ #69). link is here but I don't know Wikipedia tags so do it by yourself: [<a href="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=75109" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=75109" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>] then again, I'm new to all this wikipedia policy thing, I just wanted to say my 0.02$ kthxbye (hey, how do I sign this?) -Nineko</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> OL ReMix is absolutely worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. It is, in fact, (despite, perhaps, its best efforts) one of the premier game music remix sites on the 'net. This AfD is Wikisnobbery at its worst. Alwarren@ucsd.edu 17:45, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I vote <b>keep</b>, even though I am not fully aware of Wikipedia policy and even though the site is very, very, very weird, I think it's become big enough that it can't be ignored by a casual Video-game Remix seeking surfer. Plus, if Vgmix and OCR deserve their own pages I think this would at least be relevant enough to have a mention. Though, I think the article's language is in serious need of an over-haul, it definitely sounds like it was written by Adam D. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHannuMakinen_8a4a.html" title="User:HannuMakinen">TheHande</a> 21:13, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well all I can say at this point is someone needs to actually go to the site and see for themselves just how developed the site is and how much it has to offer.

<li>Actually, barbarism must have some standing in the linguistic community, as it appears and is defined in the article "Bad Grammar in Context" from Brown <a href="http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/mdh/bad-grammar.pdf" class="external free" title="http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/mdh/bad-grammar.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/mdh/bad-grammar.pdf</a></li>

<p>Instead of deletion, perhaps the article should be expanded to include the controversy over the political correctness of using a word that implies savageness to describe poor grammar.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a linguistic term analagous to a solecism, which no one seems to be wanting to delete. Even if it's obsolescent, it's because linguistics has become descriptive and thus contemporary linguists do not presume to declare a usage a barbarism, not because it no longer exists as a concept or because some other term has replaced it. Phrenology isn't practiced by doctors or psychologists anymore, but that's because it's been abandoned by professional communities, not because it doesn't exist as a concept or as a historical phenomenon or because it's been subsumed into some broader current practice. Moreover, the illustration with an Anglicism in French is useful, although this would be too much for a mere dictionary entry.--<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a> 02:13, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's mainly a dicdef for an obsolete term, but it gets used in discussing grammar. Grammarians tend to slice things differently from each other.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> As I will post momentarily and in greater detail on Talk:Bonza bottler day, Bonza Bottler Day is not a “so-called holiday,” a “web thing without legs” or a hoax. Regardless of whether one views it as frivolous or otherwise, the references, external links, and even commentary at [Talk:Bonza bottler day] and on this page (i.e., Nojybles’ submission, below) evidence Bonza Bottler Day as an actual – not virtual – occasion that is acknowledged and celebrated in the USA and abroad via live events, radio broadcasts, and virtual and online media of various forms. Disdain for the quality of “special events” such as Bonza Bottler Day that are listed in <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>, and for the people and purposes that rely upon that resource, does not diminish the fact that <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>has been endorsed by sources that Wikipedia describes in [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">Reliable Sources</a>] as “likely to be reliable, and [which] are regarded as reputable sources for the purposes of Wikipedia”. Here are some such endorsements:</li>

<p>.In his endorsement to delete the article (above), Calton acknowledges the existence of newspaper articles that cite Bonza Bottler Day (and the fact that he hasn't read them because they reference <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i>.) However those articles, one should note, were published in media outlets that meet Wikipidia’s [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">Reliable Sources</a>] guidelines.</p>
<p>•It is worth mentioning that my interest in Bonza Bottler Day is more than frivolous. I frequently use the history, purpose and uses of the event as a case study when teaching university courses at the college and undergraduate levels, professional seminars, and educational talk shows about business and public affairs, and in articles that – although published in blogs – have been cited elsewhere and elicited favorable - in some cases, grateful - responses. Some respondents were already familiar with the holiday and enjoyed reading about it; some of those people appreciated learning about implications or details that they were previously unaware of; and other respondents enjoyed learning about the holiday for the first time. Please note also that, despite the existence of greeting cards and a variety of directories, almanacs, calendars, and written and online media about Bonza Bottler Day, Wikipedia:Bonza Bottler Day was the source for the “Best Answer - Chosen by Asker” when an Australian submitted a copy of the article in response the Ask Yahoo! question: [<a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" class="external autonumber" title="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>] and here [<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" class="external text" title="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060726205737AaevHuj" rel="nofollow">What is Bonza Bottler Day?</a>].

<li><i>Calton acknowledges the existence of newspaper articles that cite Bonza Bottler Day</i> NO, Calton acknowledges the inserted newspaper references, and notes that from the headlines that they are obviously NOT about this so-called Bonza Bottler Day but about <i>Chase's Calendar of Events</i> -- meaning that as references they fail the "non-trivial" test, no matter how much respectability you try to attach to the sources. And given the ludicrously low standards for submission and inclusion in <i>Chase's</i>, they're not up to the "reliable source" standard -- no matter how much quoting of their ad copy you do. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:49, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand and share your concern. However, I first learned about Bonza Bottler Day several years ago when conducting research in support of a marketing course I was developing and associated radio broadcast. Further investigation unearthed a number of articles, almanacs, calendars and even greeting card sites that referenced the holiday, its founder and its sponsor. Subsequently, other people who have heard/read my discussions about the holiday have furnished additional sources and references. I thought it would be appropriate to compile that information in Wikipedia.--Lisatolliver 04:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>As a newbie on Wikipedia I have addressed the Bonza Bottler Day deletion and now wish to do the same with Elaine Fremont. As I knew Elaine but lost touch with her over the years, I was glad to find a reference using her name. I originally read of her holiday and it's title in our local paper but also learned of Elaine's death from an automobile accident. Consequently, I was so shaken by her passing that I forgot the title. I recently searched on the web and was able to find reference and the information that I sought. Therefore, I request that this information remain for others to locate and understand the history and purpose of the holiday. I feel I should add, Elaine was a friend from church - not a friend of a friend or any of the sort. A real, flesh and blood, lovely girl that Lisa Tolliver has referenced and whom I personally knew. Elaine had a great sense of humor and would probably be laughing at Carlton's blunt and callous desire to eliminate something that he/she obviously has difficulty in understanding. Lighten up - smile - enjoy life and next month - celebrate Sept. 9 / Bonza Bottler Day with a box of cookies and surprise the office with a smile! --DKnebel 03:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC) <small>User's third edit -- the first two being to Talk:Bonza bottler day</small></p>

<dd><i>I recently searched on the web and was able to find reference and the information that I sought.</i> Free "callous" advice: that means this article doesn't belong here. Wikipedia is not a publicity service or promotional vehicle: its intent is to record stuff that already has notability, import, and -- most importantly -- verification. Frankly, I find your clumsy attempt at emotional manipulation grotesque. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - The current hard copy edition of Chase's indicates that Bonza Bottler Day is trademarked. The fact that the trademark is not in the Library of Congress federal trademarks index indicates that it is trademarked in one of the 50 states. I have sent an inquiry to the holiday's sponsor to inquire which state it is trademarked in, since a link to the listing in the relevant state trademark database provides another reliable source. A reliable source that has already been provided is the reference by Steve Clark, [<a href="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=14556037&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1155151967&amp;clientId=56233" class="external text" title="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=14556037&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1155151967&amp;clientId=56233" rel="nofollow">whose article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>] does not rely upon Chase's and is published in a reputable newspaper. Additionally, the Bonza Bottler Day article info box types the holiday "[Humorous observances]" and the article is internally linked to [Hallmark holiday]. That seems appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several issues seem inappropriate and inconsistent about this entire discussion. ONE: Bonza bottler day lists more external links and references - including those above which are reliable - than multiple Wikipedia [Humorous observances] and [Hallmark holiday] articles that have neither been marked as Afd nor the subjected to heated contraversy such as this. Consistency with regard to RELIABILITY OF SOURCES would dictate that the those become Afd too. TWO: Consistency with regard to NOTABILITY would dictate that ALL [Humorous observances] and some [Hallmark holiday]s be deleted or that Bonza Bottler Day not be deleted.199.97.121.99 20:14, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> I can't even get to the references – they're all behind some kind of registration firewall. This and the other "funny holiday" articles should go. Until today, I didn't even know any of them existed excluding April Fool's Day (not that I'm some kind of notability barometer - I'm just saying). Not to denigrate Bonza Bottler day observers to whom I'm sure this is important, but every day is bound to be some kind of "Third Tuesday in April Day" or "National Underarm Deodorant Day" or something. Besides, tomorrow could be "National Toenail Clipping Day" in the U.S. while it's some other kind of "official" or humorous day in every other country around the globe. 120 countries with 120 different "official" days for any given calendar day, multiplied by 365? I think it's ridiculous and unachievable to include all of them or to even make the attempt. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 01:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is also <a href="../../../t/o/l/Category%7ETolkien_studies_954d.html" title="Category:Tolkien studies">Category:Tolkien_studies</a> that would encompass this sort of thing.

There are certainly more widely known and published authors and scholars and journals that would, in my opinion, be more deserving of articles than Ms Ellwood (for example, Verlyn Flieger, the journal Tolkien Studies, and so forth). On the other hand, I had never heard of Ms Ellwood before, and I am grateful to Wikipedia for drawing her to my attention. Would it contravene some ethics code if I kept a copy of this article in my user space so that I can add her to a list of Tolkien fandom "people" in future?

<li>The British Library is the main UK legal deposit library so it holds just about everything, so its not really a good indicator of notability or respectability.

<li><b>Merge</b> as subsection into new article Archaeology of the Orkney Islands (I volunteer to create a basic stubby article about this topic). The Orkneys are a notable archaeological site in the UK but currently no article seems to cover this archaeological topic or the modern organizations associated with this. It would make better sense to put this short-lived group into a context that explains the significance of Orkney archaeology which includes their modern equivalents e.g. The Orkney Archaelogical Trust<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Orkney+Archaeological+Trust&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Orkney+Archaeological+Trust&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. If in time, the subsection becomes very long, it can be spun off as a separate article. I would also consider an edited merge of the articles of persons associated with the antiquarian organization. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:37, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge or rename to Archaeology of the Orkney Islands</b>.</s> Bwithh's suggestion makes sense. I think it's important to recognize, though, that the work of learned societies is worth recording, and that they are generally of greater notability than the local archery club. As well, the edit history on this article is worth noting. Some of the edit summaries show a pattern of incivility. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 03:09, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perfectly fine little article on a learned society. Sure, it could be merged somewhere, but I see no eason why it <i>needs</i> to be, and there really is no reason to take this to AFD. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> has also been edit-warring to put a speedy tag on this, which I find highly inapproppriate. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 10:09, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this society is notable enough. As well as publishing scholarly articles, the society was involved in helping preserve newly-discovered sites, e.g. <a href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_061/61_296_301.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_061/61_296_301.pdf" rel="nofollow">at Rennibister</a>, and <a href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_083/83_236_240.pdf" class="external text" title="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_083/83_236_240.pdf" rel="nofollow">recording new finds</a>. The society's publications are part of the archaeological record - this article tells people a bit about them. They took an interest in non-archaeological history too - so I'm not sure about a merge.--<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 13:07, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, there is also a proposed guideline, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, which seems to go beyond the current WP:BIO guideline. It states, <i>"As a compromise between those who would keep all candidate articles and those who would delete all articles on yet-unelected candidates, this guideline states that articles on elections should be written before articles on individual candidates. Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written."</i> Well, if an article can be written about a <i>candidate</i> that satisfies these criteria, then surely by extension, an article can be written about the <i>election winner</i>, i.e., officeholder/incumbent. Although the proposed guideline seems to contemplate state-level elections, given the examples that are provided, the policy is still open to discussion and could be extended to county-level elections. Deleting articles in the absence of a clear policy or guideline is not a good idea, especially when said articles are part of a WikiProject that is committed to expanding them. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 20:29, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b>: In the name of consistency, I'm not sure how county-level officeholders differ from schools. A quick browse through [Category:High schools in the United States] reveals that there are numerous schools listed that would fail nearly every test under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, save the 100 year test; of survivors, many would pass the 100 year test solely because the actual structure is still standing and/or in use. Of course, other schools will probably be gone or unused, 30, 50, or 99 years from now. Finally, <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> is seeking to <i>upgrade</i> many of these articles. High schools just don't seem encyclopedic to me. I would support standards around schools, but that would result in an awful lot of AfDs. --<a href="../../../i/s/h/User%7EIshu_6fd7.html" title="User:Ishu">ishu</a> 19:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was The question of whether the ability of lists to annotated is worth the cost of list/category duplication is old one, thoroughly argued. Ultimately, the weight given to the benefits of annotation is a subjective one: some will find this feature more useful than others. On a question of subjective cost/benefit analysis, recourse to a simple tally may be helpful: this is a rough, but fair, way to estimate the community's judgment of the subjective merit of these list. Here, 9d/4k = 69%. There is previous precedent also supporting deletion here in List of British Actors.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special concern regarding these lists. For at least some of them (Iran, Vietnam, Bengal), the community should evaluate the question of systematic bias; for others (particularly Jewish American, or anything-American), systemic bias is less a concern. Since these list vary with respect to a key factor, and since the raw margin favoring deletion is barely sufficient to invoke admin discretion, I will invoke admin discretion to call this discussion <b>No consensus</b>/default keep. Especially given concerns of systemic bias in covering the developing world, these lists should <i>not</i> be considered en masse, but separately. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Until the AfD discussion on the List of British Actors, no consideration had been given to the encyclopedic value of these lists. All of these lists have categories.

<dd>BlueValour is right. If all actor pages were nominated at once more people would complain about the bulk nomination. Voting <i>keep</i> at this point just slows down the process pointlessly. It won't bring back List of Canadian actors or List of British actors so I don't see why <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Iranian_actors_11ca.html" title="List of Iranian actors">List of Iranian actors</a> should survive but not them. For one thing, actor listing have become a "craze" that needs to die down. Everyone complains about "Red links! What about the red links?!" A User on another afd put "As WP:NOT says, "Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed."" Just because an actor exists, doesn't mean they automatically deserve a wikipedia article. Furthermore, it's a sad fact that red links don't attract anyone to make articles. If someone is devoted enough to set time aside to make an article for an actor that isn't vanity, it's good evidence that article is worth being here. Can't use that self-pruning method on red links. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You're asking for something that will never happen, Yuckfoo. Categories are maintainable. Once an actor article is created and checked for legitimacy, you simply add a note for a category. Lists can go on infinitely with anonymous users adding unmaintainable names on a daily basis. Nobody in the right mind will plan on spending their months preparing the red links in List of German actors (from 1895 to the present)..especially when its very likely that bundles of translations will be needed. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or Rename/sort</b> A list of <i>senior</i> officers - say, of general rank and higher - would make more sense. This list currently has headings for "Sergeant", "Lieutenants" (spelt wrong), "Corporals" and "Regular Cadets" of which there must have been tens of thousands and quite possibly, hundreds of thousands. Or perhaps list could be renamed to List of notable Japanese Army Officers (WW2) and each name reassessed for notability.

<dd>I disagree with this for several reasons:
<ol>
<li>The Federation might have gained notoriety over just a shooting, but it gained notoriety nevertheless. As such it deserves its own page, which should be built up. Some ideas include a photograph, reactions to the event, and its future trajectory as it handles the event.</li>
<li>I think that its better for organizing article structure to include a very short paragraph on the site of the event, and then link to further information. The article on the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting_e26a.html" title="July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting">July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting</a> should be on the event itself, althought building a web to peripheral information is definitely needed. Inclusion of detailed information on the Center diminishes article quality, whereas including just a short blurb on the site, without further elaboration does a diservice to the site itself.</li>
<li>Deleting this page is eleminating information that is now needed in an encyclopedic article. Before the shooting this Federation was indeed one of many, after the shooting it is encyclopedic material. It would be a disservice to our readers if we didn't improve information on this Federation in its own page, as much as it would a be a disservice to provide this information only in an article connected to a tragic event.--<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerejota_902d.html" title="User:Cerejota">Cerejota</a> 02:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
