<p>I have decided to <i>suggest</i> deletion of this article again. First, this article was deleted <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_SimCity_5_84b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SimCity 5">before</a>, little has changed since then. Second, most of the information in this article can easily be placed in the "Future Updates" section of the existing <a href="../../../s/i/m/SimCity_4_c130.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> article. Third, very little is still confirmed of the next SimCity including the title of the game, so this article can not go very far at the moment. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamaron1_cdcc.html" title="User:Camaron1">Camaron1</a> 20:51, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep it!</b> Let us remember that they are currently occupied with Spore right now and making the game the best it can be. The game has gone 3 main sequels and they'll probably go on for four considering the popularity of the game. Just give it time and wait for Spore to be released. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.104.147.99_b6c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.104.147.99">208.104.147.99</a> (talk) 01:03, 22 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> Even with the sources, this article is a little too crystal ballsy for me. One of the references is some obscure russian website that had supposedly had a launch date once, but it isn't there now. In another one Will Wright was asked what direction the game was going he answered "We haven't figured out what it is."

<li><b>Merge</b> per Anthony. Nothing wrong with indicating SC5 is in development but until an actual release is announced, it's too much Crystal Ball.

<li><b>Strong Delete and Protect</b>: First of all, although SimCity 5 was confirmed in 2004, little has changed. In fact, the "proof" that SimCity 5 was being developed is all crystalballery, it only said "a new SimCity game". That could mean a number of things. Also, SimCity may or may not be developed by Maxis, it could be done by another of EA's lackeys. There is just little that can be placed here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheListUpdater_226d.html" title="User:TheListUpdater">TheListUpdater</a> 21:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. EA said that a new SimCity game is in development. EA makes the game.

<dd>I would like to point out that the comment made for a SimCity being in development in the 2007 outlook was very ambiguous. The reference was very brief and it is not clear if the reference was to SimCity 5, and not SimCity DS. Also, while I respect your views, I would appreciate it if everyone <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">kept a cool head</a> while commenting. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECamaron1_33de.html" title="User talk:Camaron1"><font color="red">Camaron1 | Chris</font></a> 18:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> due to a lack of confirmation that the game is actually in development. The sources given only indicate that the game is in 'early planning' or 'in the pipeline'. I haven't seen any evidence that a single line of code has been written. There is basically zero actual information on the game. I also <b>oppose merge</b>, as the existence of a SimCity 5 would not constitute an 'update' to SimCity 4. They are games in and of themselves. Updates to SimCity 4 would be things like patches, expansion packs, downloadable add-ons, etc. --<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubSeven_abca.html" title="User:SubSeven">SubSeven</a> 19:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Even if the game is going to be released, there is no need to keep the article as there is no specific information about the actual contents of the game itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> verified by multiple reliable sources, no prediction of content beyond that which is verified by said sources, I don't honestly see what's wrong with this article. If your only complaint is that the game hasn't been released yet then sorry, that isn't part of the deletion criteria (see <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_3.html" title="Halo 3">Halo 3</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenaries_2.html" title="Mercenaries 2">Mercenaries 2</a>, etc.) <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> 22:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

While the development of these games are clear, as shown by the articles, that can not be said with SimCity 5.
