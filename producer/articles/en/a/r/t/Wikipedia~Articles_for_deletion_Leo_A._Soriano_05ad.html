<li>Google is not god!! Those smart buggers can not index pages that do no exist, and have difficulty mapping PageRank to languages they do not understand (e.g. Google is known to not perform well in Russian and Chinese languages; local search companies still have the edge on them). Your Italian fellow is lucky that he lives in a country that speaks a language that is understood by Google (refer to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Translate_60da.html" title="Google Translate">Google Translate</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/s/SYSTRAN_8749.html" title="SYSTRAN">SYSTRAN</a>); <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_language.html" title="Filipino language">Filipino</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog_language.html" title="Tagalog language">Tagalog</a> are not (yet)<a href="http://news.ituloy-angsulong.info/does-google-understand-other-foreign-languages.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.ituloy-angsulong.info/does-google-understand-other-foreign-languages.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Philippines is a developing country, so much of its news isnt available online, and Google doesnt index offline material (well except for books and journals). Assuming that Google indexes every page is silly; once you accept that, it follows that pages with less utility are not indexed. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 04:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b>. I've amended the article to include a number of new factoids with sources. Leo Soriano is one of three UMC bishops that represent the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and for a while he was one of only two elected; the third position was vacant. We are talking about the 12th largest country here (by population), and he is one of three people who represents a major church for that population. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 04:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm gonna play devil's advocate here... The article talks about what position he has, but not really about anything he has <i>done</i>.

<li>Yes, I have voted keep becausse I believe he is worthy of note, and if he doesnt meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, we should be looking at why; I suggest that the reason is due to locality, and the fact the modern press (online news and blogs) dont care about people of this ilk. To make sure there is no doubt, I have no association with this man, the UMC, any other religious body or the Philippines. I am merely concerned that a major Bishop of a notable Church is being considered for deletion when a stub for a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholic_Bishops_of_Chicago_118d.html" title="List of Roman Catholic Bishops of Chicago">Bishop of Chicago</a> would not be. In my opinion, the post and the mans actions should be considered synonymous (unless their term is cut short due to controversy); he is elected to those positions by his peers and parishioners, because of his actions. The problem in this case appears to be that the actions that put him there dont appear to be readily accessible outside of the UMC publications (some of them are not directly affiliated). So do we assume that he did nothing?? Or do we <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and leave it to be expanded over time. His <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_Bishop_c4dd.html" title="Resident Bishop">Resident Bishophood</a> puts him as one of three most senior in his Church in his country and his other positions appear to put him amounst the upper management of the international UMC. I cant see how Wikipedia benefits by having this article removed. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think it's easier to justify he would qualify as notable on the Filipino or Tagalog wikipedias. You could argue that since English is an official language of the Philippines that he could be notable here as well. I changed my vote to err on the side of caution. Something of a tossup in my mind. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 06:54, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>An article with only primary source references does not imply any intentional desire to create an un-encyclopedic entry or that the sources are inaccurate. It does say the encyclopedic content of the article would be greatly improved by the addition of reference.</p>
<p>The three core content policies of Wikipedia are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, In general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a> are created at or near the time being studied, often by the people being studied, and so provide a good foundation for beginning to building an article. But primary sources are by definition often <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">orginal research</a> and due to <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> concerns may not be written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>.</p>
<p>The addition of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">Secondary sources</a> which are usually based on primary sources and other secondary sources by a third party who is not connected to the source, provides for a more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and being based on the combined research of others would not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">orginal research</a>. Here you see that the addition of secondary sources assists the editor to write (and readers to verify) an article that meets all three core content policies of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Additionally, an article must meet a minimum threshold of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> in order for it to remain on Wikipedia. One of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Rationale</a> for requiring a level of notability is that a in order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources. Everyday Multiple articles are proposed and considered for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_Today_0ca9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/Today">deletion</a> per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> an article that is not clearly notable is not likely to survive the deletion process. Keeping in mind that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">the burden of evidence</a> lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">Jeepday</a> 20:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And you believe that <i>The United Methodist Publishing House</i> is the same as the organisation the runs the <i>Uniting Methodist Church</i>&#160;? Could you elaborate. I'll happily eat my hat you you can prove that they are the same body, or have strong ties. Otherwise, the common element in the name would also mean that <i>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> would also need to be considered a primary source for any matter relating to New York. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 00:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While non-christians might not get it, bishops are usually notable as politicians are. The article itself has numerous assertions of notability, so that is not really the issue. As for verifiability, well the internet is western-centric when it comes to news, so just because he doesn't have that many "Google hits" mean he isn't in the news. What needs to be done is to find more appropriate references using local newspapers/tv news/etc. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 14:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the issue for me is that there's not much about what he's actually <i>done</i>, rather just what positions he's held. If the article talked about how he was instrumental in doing such and such or founded the thingy, then I dont think there would be much of an issue. As it is, it's a somewhat passive article. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 14:41, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
