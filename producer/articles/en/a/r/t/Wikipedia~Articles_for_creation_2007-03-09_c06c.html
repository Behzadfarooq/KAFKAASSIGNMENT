<p>The Hangman's Paradox</p>
<p>A hangman is stationed on a road at the crest of a hill. He asks each passerby where he or she is going. If the passerby lies about his destination, he/she is hanged.</p>
<p>A man comes up to the hangman. The hangman asks "Where are you going? Answer truthfully or face the gallows."</p>
<p>The traveller replies, "I have come here to be put to death by you."</p>
<p>The traveller was replying truthfully. So the hangman shouldn't hang him. However, he had come to the hangman to be hanged. If the hangman let him go, the traveller would be lying, therefore he should be hanged.</p>

<li>This is actually a good suggestion, but there is no point in creating a redirect to an article that does not exist yet. I would suggest that you write up the article for Methanococcus jannaschii and then submit that article here. Then we can create a redirect. Even better, you can create a user account and submit the article yourself. If you do not choose to create an account but you want to submit the article, send me a message on <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanMS_16c9.html" title="User talk:DanMS">my talk page</a> when you have submitted the article.

<p>Fame Nyc was started back in the early days of 2005. It is a sreetwear brand that hails from the roots of grafitti and the "stick up kid" life style. The brand has all but one purpose and that is to get the fame out of it. Fame Nyc was created by Anton Y. but also has several more members to the Fame Nyc Team. Fame Nyc is advertises by "sticker bombing". Fame Nyc stickers are noticed ll over Nyc trains and is even written by Grafitti writers abreveated at FNY. Fame Nyc is still underground and soled mostly out of the hands of the Fame Nyc Team. Fame Nyc is planning a huge summer season in which it will come out with new hoodies shirts and costumized Nikes.</p>

<p>Madrone combine intricate riffs, earth shaking drums, driving bass, and impassioned vocals to form a sound unlike any other. Recently they finished recording their debut EP "Cause and Compromise" with producer Scott Spelbring (Dave Matthews, O.A.R., Jason Mraz, SR-71) and mastered by Grammy winner Jay Frigoletto. Madrone has toured extensively throughout our area and in many surrounding states including North Carolina, Washington D.C., and many more, several times weekly, and to bigger and bigger crowds. Also opening for such national acts as Roadrunner Records artist Theory of a Deadman and Dot Point Records artist Deaf Pedestrians, and already booked with more notable acts for the coming months. Madrone is consistently ranked "Most Requested" on 96.3 WROV's Unsigned Show (achieving Most Requested of 2006), the show is one of the highest rated unsigned programs on the East Coast, on a radio station nominated for Rock Station of the Year for the United States in 2006. The band's web address is www.myspace.com/madrone - the debut EP will be released April 21st 2007.</p>

<p>Cisqo – Program Director/Music Director Top 40 WJJS – “I grew up back in PA watching LIVE and FUEL blow up, and they have this same kind of spark...and the ladies love 'em”</p>
<p>John Persinger – The Roanoke Times – “Whereas 90% of the harder bands around town get lost when the pace slows, Madrone shines....brightly. As they drop the noise level, the beats become more intricate and the bass begins to sway hypnotically. For most acts, playing the decelerated part in a song means strumming the same 4 chords they've been playing, just without all the distortion. The guitars I heard went in a different direction, abruptly taking the shape of early Zeppelin with the airy quality of U2”.</p>
<p>Scott Enright – A&amp;R – Interscope Records – “Love the sound, dig the “TOOL” vibe!”</p>

National Bomba Day is the hispanic celebration of everything dome-shaped. Celebrated items range from the Louisiana Superdome to the Dome of the Rock. The holiday occurs on September 5th of every year, and during the festiviries, worshippers rotate three-dimnesional objects in their heads, while praying towards a dome-shaped shape. During the festivals, la Fruta Bomba [the Bomba lord] gives the new year a new name [such as the year of the pig, 2005].</p>

Panaque maccus, commonly called the clown pleco or ringlet pleco, is a dwarf loricariid. It originates in Colombia and Venezuala in a clear water biotope. Their natural environment driftwood tangles near riverbanks.</p>
<a name="Panaque_Maccus_in_the_Aquarium" id="Panaque_Maccus_in_the_Aquarium"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-09_c06c.html" title="Edit section: Panaque Maccus in the Aquarium">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Panaque Maccus in the Aquarium</span></h3>
<p>The clown pleco attains a maximum size of 4" which makes it an ideal species for small (10 gallons+) aquaria. In the aquarium, panaque maccus eat primarily vegetable matter and they must be provided with driftwood, as wood forms a large part of their diet. Their diet should also occasionally be supplemented with higher protein foods such as shrimp pellets, bloodworms, glassworms, etc. Loricariids are constant grzers, due to this fact, they produce large amounts of waste. They should be provided with a strong current in the aquarium and plenty of surfaces to attach themselves. Ideally, the aquarium should be a river set up, using pvc pipes to achieve a one directional flow. The water should be fairly warm, 78F-81F. Multiple individuals should be kept in a larger tank with plenty of hiding places to allow each fish to establish a territory. The clown pleco is a reclusive fish and will rarely stray from its chosen piece of driftwood, usually swimming no more than 6" in either direction in search of food. They do well with tankmates and are a good species for a community aquarium. Mature males of this species will develop interopercular odontodes on the rear half of the body.</p>

<p>Russ Hogue (born December 26, 1974) is a boxer/kickboxer/martial artist from Belleville, Illinois. Russ started training in martial arts at 5 years of age. He earned his first black belt at the age of 15, under the tutelage of the late Bill Beatty and Jim Boucher, former 3 time world kickboxing champion. For 6 straight years, Russ was the top ranked sparring competitor in the Midwest. During this time, Russ was also a nationally ranked tournament competitor winning, national events such as the Blue Grass Nationals, the Budweiser Karate Classic and the St. Louis Silver Sun Showdown. In 1993, Russ was named to the US Karate Team as an alternate for the Pan Am Games.</p>
<p>In addition to open karate tournaments, Russ has competed very successfully in both boxing and kickboxing. As an amateur boxer, Russ won the St. Louis Golden Gloves in 1993 and 1994 where he represented the St. Louis National Golden Gloves team in 1994 (fight stopped due to a hand injury). He had an amateur boxing record of 23 Wins 4 losses. As an amateur kickboxer, Russ compiled a record of 31 Wins against only 1 defeat. After losing his amateur debut, Russ went on to win all remaining amateur bouts grabbing a number of accolades: IKA US Title (1994), KICK MO State Champion (1993), USA KIA MO State Champion Heavyweight and Super Heavyweight (1994) and the CKC MO State Title (1994).</p>
<p>After turning Professional, Russ continued his success as he compiled a record of 17 Wins against 3 Losses and 7 KO’s. His most notable matches included: a loss in only his fourth pro-fight, where Russ (3-0 3KO’s) was pitted against former US Champion Zennie Reynolds (39-8). Russ later defeated Zennie Reynolds by technical knockout in their rematch. He also lost to current North American and World Champion Steve Whitter (Canada). Russ most notable victory came in a closely contested bout where he defeated current World Champion John James (Grand Rapids, MI) by split decision earning him a spot in the world rankings by KICK, WKA and WKF. For the next three years, Russ fought sporadically due to a number of injuries. In 1999, Russ won the WKF US Heavyweight title in a 10 round decision over Mike Scott (New York, NY).</p>
<p>Grand Master Richard Osborn awarded Russ with his 5th degree black belt on November 4th, 2006. He was also inducted into the Martial Arts Hall of Fame in February, 2007.</p>

<p>Reverse transcriptase is a unique DNA polymerase directed by RNA. It binds and transcribes RNA into DNA, commonly refered to as copy DNA (cDNA) as it does not contain any exons. This is the reverse of the normal process (and hence the name) where DNA is transcribed to RNA in order to translate it, making proteins.</p>

He has a background in tourism and Aboriginal social development and has been working in Aboriginal social services since 1998. He has been a successful proposal writer, program coordinator and event planner and is a certified Career Development Practitioner and Job Club Coach.

<p>Brandon currently resides in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. After arriving to the west coast in 2001, he quickly found employment at the First Nations Employment &amp; Enterprise Centre as the Youth Employment Counselor later moving on to co-facilitating job finding clubs to all urban First Nations people living on the downtown eastside of Vancouver. He is now working for the Urban Native Youth Association as the Native Youth Learning Centre Coordinator developing and delivering employment programs to assist at-risk Aboriginal youth find work.</p>
<p>Brandon learned the structure of the social service delivery and understood the vast need of services in the Aboriginal community early in his career. He became inspired to continue his work for the Aboriginal community developing and delivering social planning programs for Aboriginal people at the grassroots level. He has played a huge role in several social service developments in the Aboriginal community. Just before re-locating to Vancouver, he assisted in writing a proposal that secured $50,000 to start a restorative justice program for Aboriginal youth in his communities.</p>
<p>Brandon’s career started when he moved to Barrie, Ontario to study a two-year Hospitality and Tourism Management program at Georgian College (1996-1998). In 1998, he was hired by a local Aboriginal organization called the Barrie Area Native Advisory Circle (BANAC) to assist in the development of a regional Aboriginal tourism association to support local Aboriginal tourism operators. While working on this project he revealed the potential to be a leader. In 1999 Brandon was elected chairperson for the Aboriginal Tourism Management Program Development Committee at Georgian College. He accepted the position with enthusiasm and dedication and chaired the committee’s development by encouraging others to follow his vision in ensuring integrity and accountability.</p>

<p>Annual event on the coast in SW Western Australia. Almost grown men cross the fine line between standing on the beach looking like an idiot and actually catch fish. Although they’re not invited, the sensitivities of women are fully catered for as the event is now no longer held on Mothers’ Day.</p>
<p>Food is meat based, despite not having a full complement of gall bladders. The waking beverage is generally beer. Polysyllabic grunts at the campfire are punctuated by monosyllabic conversation. Fishing is competitive with only whole salmon counting –shark attacks don’t rate.</p>
<p>Participants fly in from interstate, get to the beach by 4 x 4 only to eventually take a long walk with a shovel to admire the view and contemplate “It doesn’t get any better than this”.</p>

<p>Major General Robert Jesse Travis was born on January 13, 1877 at Conyers, Georgia, the son of Dr. A. C. W. Travis and the former Allie Livingston. He received no formal education until the age of twelve. In 1891, he enrolled in the preparatory school of Emory College; he later attended Emory College and was graduated with first honors in 1897. While at Emory, Travis distinguished himself as a champion debater, and as editor of two campus publications, the Phoenix and the Zodiac. He received scholastic medals in Greek, Latin, the natural sciences, and mathematics; he was also president of Phi Gamma society and a member of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi_Phi_2f8c.html" title="Chi Phi">Chi Phi</a> social fraternity. After graduation, Travis took a position as principal of a Madison, Georgia high school to finance graduate work in law and economics at the University of Georgia. He received the Bachelor of Law degree in 1899. While attending the University of Georgia, Travis was awarded the Ready Writers' Medal, was president of Phi Kappa society, and a charter member of the Sphinx men's honorary society.</p>

<p>General Travis' military career began in 1899, when he entered the 1st Georgia Infantry on August 25. He was transferred to the Coast Artillery in 1902. In World War I, Travis (then a colonel) commanded the 118th Field Artillery. For his valorous wartime service, he was awarded the Commander's Cross of Poland in 1919, but was not allowed to accept this award immediately, as the U. S. State Department did not officially recognize decorations of the Polish government at that time. Travis received his commission as major general in the National Guard in 1924. In the same year, while attending a convention of the National Guard Association in Louisville, Kentucky, Travis proposed to the convention that the National Guard become a part of the U. S. Army on a regular component basis. The convention adopted this resolution, as did Congress two years later. In 1932, General Travis participated in the dedication of a National Guard memorial in Paris, presided over by General John J. Pershing.</p>
<p>During his military career, General Travis served as president of the Georgia Reserve Officers' Association, the Georgia National Guard Association, and the National Guard Association of the U. S. respectively. In 1911, General Travis was officially retired from active military service at a military review at Fort Jackson, South Carolina in which 17,000 troops marched in his honor.</p>

<p>In addition to his military career, General Travis practiced law from 1899 until his retirement in 1951, serving twice as attorney for the city of Savannah, and also as attorney for McIntosh and Effingham counties. In 1932, Travis was an unsuccessful candidate for the Georgia Supreme Court. He was rent control attorney for Savannah under post-World War II restrictions set down by the federal Office of Price Administration (OPA).</p>

<p>General Travis was actively involved in a number of civic and fraternal organizations. He served as the first president of the Municipal League of Georgia. In 1918, Travis became Grand Master of Georgia Masons. In 1919, General Travis was decorated by the Grand Masonic Lodge of England. In addition to his Masonic activities, General Travis served as preceptor of the Scottish Rite, and prior to his death, he was the oldest living past potentate of Savannah's Alee Temple of the Shrine. Travis was a past president of the Georgia Sons of the Revolution and the University of Georgia Club. He was also a member of the Colonial Wars Society, the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences, the St. Andrews Society, and the American Legion, among others. The Wesley Monumental Methodist Church of Savannah claimed General Travis as a member.</p>
<p>General Travis was an amateur historian of some note. He turned over historic deeds and records to the Georgia Historical Society, and his endeavors in this field were instrumental in leading to the discovery of a Revolutionary War battlefield in Savannah. After exhausting genealogical research, Travis also compiled a Travis family history, published in Savannah in 1954.</p>

<p>General Travis married the former Rena Falligant (1881-1964) of Savannah on November 27, 1902. The couple had four children: two sons, Brigadier General Robert Falligant Travis (1904-1950), USAF, and Colonel William Livingston Travis (l908-), USAF (retired); and two daughters, Rena Travis White (1915-) and Cecilia Darracott Travis Smith.</p>
<p>His son, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, was a distinguished flyer in World War II, and later commanding general of the Pacific Air Command until its termination in 1949, was the man for whom Travis Air Force Base in California and Travis Field, Savannah's municipal air-port, were named.</p>
<p>Publications of Robert J. Travis include: an article, "Sidney Lanier," in The Georgian, III, no. 4 (January, 1899); The Travis (Travers) Family and Its Allies: Darracott, Lewis, Livingston, Nicholson, McLaughlin, Pharr, Smith, and Terrell (Savannah, 1954); Travis, George M. Napier, and Robert L. Colding co-compiled the Masonic Manual and Code of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Georgia, 3 eds. (Nashville: Brandon Printing Co., 1920).</p>

<p>James Paul Hilton (1961-) is an internationally published essayist, poet, and alternative health author, as well as a medical educator and civil liberties activist. Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1961 Hilton dropped out of high school, became an Eagle Scout and certified emergency medical technician(1977), all by the young age of 16. By his ninteeth birthday he was working full time as a paramedic in Tulsa, Oklahoma and then continued his education in the heart of "Amish Country"(Lancaster,Pennsylvania). By 1981 he was employed by busy Broward County, Florida as as an emergency medical specialist where he earned a GED, studied medical hypnosis, and began to teach advanced cardiac life support techniques to doctors, nurses, and other paramedics. In 1984 while working as educator of paramedics for the City of Hallandale, Florida he blew the whistle on inadaquate training and "sloppy medical care," landing himself on the front page of The Miami Herald, triggering an official inquiry, ending up blackballed from working, and then for the next year and a half literally homeless on the same streets where he once saved lives. In 1987 he met his soon to be wife, Salome, and resumed teaching at hospitals and medical schools across the United States. In 1989 he ended up as the first paramedic in Gallup, New Mexico, epicenter of the Navaho, Zuni, and Hopi Indian tribes where he learned about the highly secretive "medicine men." That same year he went to his wive's native New Zealand were he ultimatley became a dual United States/New Zealand Citizen, a businessman, an outspoken environmental activist, and authored an alternative health book sharply critical of profit driven medicine entitled, Burden of Proof (1992). While promoting the book in neighboring Australia, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in three states tried to have it banned, propelling it to become a best seller. After repeated appearances on national television and after crisscrossing both countries on a lecture tour covering every major city, twice over, the book was reprinted three times. Because of the historical link between the martial and healing arts, while in Australasia, Hilton took up Shotokan Karate (traditional Okinawa style), went on to study and teach judo, and ultimatley earned a black belt in karate. In 1999 he was keynote speaker at the Natural Health Society of Australia's annual conference in Sydney and earlier that same year was invited by tribal elders to speak at a Maori Marae in Rotorua, New Zealand. In 2001 one of his his poems, Arlington County Medic -75, penned in honor of the victims of 9/11, was republished by Zondervan International Publishers and was also commended by several United States Senators including presidential candidate John Edwards, who described it as "inspiring." Hilton has written nine books, hundreds of published essays, poems, and letters, and was awarded honrary membership in the Natural Health Society of Australia as well as, for several years, a member of the National Association of EMS Educators in The U.S.A. Much of his work can be found in the Library of Congress, the National Library of New Zealand and the National Library of Australia.</p>

<p>Auto destruct is a playstation game produced by electronic arts in 1997, it involves the player taking control of a prototype road car in order to defeat lalazarus, the leader of a insane and desperate gang of thugs wanting to take over the world. The game begins with the player being recruited by "the temple", although the origins of the temple are unknown, it is clear that it is a secret organisation devoted to justice and prosperity. The temple then supplys the player with a race bred car capable of fireing weapons and deploying traps, the name of the car is unknown.</p>

<p>The gang of lzarus are a band of rebels styling themselves after a modern salvationists religeon/mafia.Little is known about lazarus except the fact that his discilples would sacrifice their lives for him. Lazarus's gang operate outside the law and have connections throughout society, their "scriptures" emphasise the importance of martyrdom for their cause. Nearly every disciple that is apprehended alive will stay silent and will desperately attempt a bizarre form of harakiri at any opportunity.</p>

<p>The car starts off standard but becomes frequently upgaded once the game begins, it has a fuel level and damage meter so when low on either, the player must find a garage or repair shop or both in order to replenish the general health of the car.</p>

<p>machine gun (class 1 and 2): the machine gun is an all round weapon capable of destroying most enemies as long as the stream of bullets is concentrated, it fires 7.6mm standard armour peircing bullets.</p>
<p>Rockets/Heavy rockets: These explosive tipped rockets deal big damage if aimed correctly as this is much easier said then done.</p>
<p>Homers/Heavy homers: These are similar to regular rockets except these are much easier to aim as they have heat seeking techology, it is most useful againsed airborne targets.</p>
<p>Laser/Double laser: The paticularly deadly weapon utilises laser optic technology capable of firing a 500mw pulse charge through solid matter, it is useful againsed tanks and most land targets.</p>
<p>Cannon/Heavy cannon: Slow but deadly is best used to describe the cannon, should only be used in the hands of a skilled professional as a missed shot may be your last.</p>
<p>Mine: The mine is used as a deterent to major tailgators, it is quite usefull if used properly, but disciples of llazarus have been known to deploy mines if being chased making this weapon unpredictable.</p>
<p>Oil stream/Smoke screen: Used as a trap to slow enemy cars in pursuit.</p>
<p>Bomb/Bouncer: A bomb will cause spectacular damage if used properly, however like the rockets it is quite hard to master the difficult aiming. The bouncer is a bouncing variant of the standard bomb.</p>
<p>Swarmers: As the name suggests, this weapon deals great damage by unleashing a hailstorm of homing rockets, although some new comers to this weapon may be left off guard by the amazing rate of fire causing a quick depletion of rockets.</p>
<p>Plasma: Fires a direct pulse of plasma energy through any target.</p>
<p>Laser beam: The deadliest weapon in the game, it fires a 700mw laser stream of energy capable of cutting through any kind of armour, however, this weapon depletes extremely quickly.</p>

<p>Brementowne Mall was located at 159th Street and Oak Park Avenue in Tinley Park, Illinois. It opened in the early 1970s, with twin movie theaters and a variety of stores. The mall lacked a big-name department store anchor; instead, it featured Gately's, an independent department store that opened in 1975 (its other location, in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago, closed in 1994). Other "name" stores included Walgreens and a Dominicks grocery store, as well a Hallmark card shop and numerous smaller retailers and a video arcade.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, the movie theater moved to the other side of the mall, where is was rebuilt with four screens.</p>
<p>The mall began to decline in popularity when the much larger and well-anchored Orland Square Mall opened a few miles away. To draw more traffic, the movie theaters were increased to six small screens in the 1980s and began offering second-run movies at bargain prices.</p>
<p>The mall's troubles continued, with Gately's closing in 1994 and Dominicks soon following. After its closure, the Gateley's building went through several temporary incarnations, including a Lands End outlet, before becoming office space for the Star and Southtown Economist newspapers. The Dominick's space became a supply store for teachers.</p>
<p>The movie theaters hung on for awhile, along with the adjacent Lindy's/Gerties restaurant. With the rest of the mall virtually deserted, it was eventually purchased by the Menard's home improvement chain and converted into a mega Menard's store. In the early 2000s, Menard's also absorbed the movie theaters.</p>

<p>John Steinbacher is one of the towering personalities of the 70s and 80s. He is a prolific author and his many books are still in demand.

He is the editor of The Challenge magazine. A native of Alabama, He was reared in Oregon and presently makes his home in California.</p>
<p>Ten of his best sellers are presently listed on Amazon.com, including his latest “epic masterpiece”, Wayfarers of Fate. One 30 page booklet, It Comes Up Murder, is listed at $180.00 and a 40-page booklet on the death of RFK is now listed at $98.00. Both originally sold for 50 cents.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Christian Science Monitor called John “A national phenomenon”. Some of his huge sellers include Bitter Harvest, The Child Seducers, An Inward Stillness and The Conspirators, Men Against God.</p>

<p>On October 28, 2005, the L.A. Times said the Vatican had beatified seven priests and one nun who suffered torture &amp; death in the Spanish Civil War, rather than renouncing their faith. Again, a page out of Wayfarers.</p>

Oberstgasm is a phrase recently coined by a Bright Eyes fan in Connecticut. It is meant to describe the rush of joy felt when looking at a picture of musician Conor Oberst. It is also used when referring to the joy felt when listening to Conor, thinking about him, drawing him, writing fanfiction including him, saying his name, watching him undress, and listening to any of his old/current bands including Desaparecidos. It was supposedly created about four months ago and has since then caught on with many fans of Conor in Manchester, Connecticut as well as in chatrooms spanning all over the internet.</p>

<p>Many people search in their lifes for many different creatures like vampires,werewolfs,licantrophy,spirits,phantoms.... But can anyone tell who is the strongest creature of all? There are three creatures that rule the others:Avatars,Saiyan-jins and Nosferatu Vampires.</p>
<p>Avatars are human-like creatures that are born with the powers of the elements:water,fire,earth and air.They can control these natural elements at their will.There can only be four avatars in the world at once,wich for the four elements.When a Avatar is killed he will be ressurected and start a new life in a new body.</p>
<p>Saiyan-jins are a powerfull race.They have the capability of dominating their ki.The saiyan-jins have many transformations like the Oozaru(saiyan-jins transform into giant-apes when hit by the full moon in all it's might,if the have a tail.).The legend tells that a saiyan-jin when hit by a enourmous amount of ki(normally because of rage)they can transform into the so called Super Saiyan(in this transformation they become extremely powerful,their eyes turn green and their hair growns and becomes golden). The super saiyan form can increase it's power and become the Super Saiyan 2 or Mega Saiyan(their strenght growns even more and their hairs increases a little). The ultimate state of a saiyan-jin is the Super Saiyan 3 or Hiper Saiyan(Their face becomes a little deformated with no eyebrows, their hair becomes extremely long and their energy becomes so powerfull it can destroy a planet only by reaching this face)</p>
<p>Nosferatu Vampires aren't like normal vampires or gouls.They don't turn into dust when hit by sunlight,they don't die withouw drinking blood and they aren't killed by stakes,fire,holywater or crosses.Although they're very sensitive to any kind of light,they appear like ghosts-very pale.Sometimes they don't appear in the mirror or if they do it becomes deformated in some cases.They have the same tipe of ki as saiyan-jins but in a dark version.It tells the legend that they (after they're vampiric form)if they are touched by a enourmous amount of ki (normally by rage too) they turn into the "Nosferatu Form" wich is so powerfull as a super saiyan 2 of the saiyan-jins.They're hair becomes bigger and turns pure black,they're eyes turn red,eyellow or orange,their teeth grows,they're surrounded by a bloodly red ki aura and their muscles increase.It is also known that after this form they're reach an ultime form(as powerfull as a super saiyan 3)-The Super Nosferatu(only reached when full moon).This is like a demoniac giant creature surrounded by shadows.</p>
<p>This creatures are incredibily strong and their existing is always oppressed.</p>
