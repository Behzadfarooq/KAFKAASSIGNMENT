<li><strong>Keep</strong>. This man is for real – I work for a Kent/London borders free newspaper in the UK and I had an assignment to interview him just before Christmas. He is only beginning grassroots press work/campaigning now to get in the public eye, so he said. McClintock comes across like Tory leader Cameron with his beguiling mix of pragmatic speech and political principles. Clearly, he will have to match the depth of his ambitions with media to match – he must be a technophobe!

<li><b>Keep</b> Like many others have noted, this article should be given a chance to develop more. It's as simple as that. If it's still a fluke in one to two weeks or so, then I recommend a merge. In terms of notability, Boyd qualifies for several valid reasons already mentioned, including it's numerous press references, attention, relative size (biggest nationally almost), band, and the like. Finally, seeing as McKinney is apparantly the fastest growing city in the nation, I'd expect it's three high schools to be covered in some detail. And Soltak, it makes absolutely no differences whatsoever WHO wrote it. It could be a dog for all anyone cares. The important thing is the relevance, accuracy, and contribution it makes to Wikipedia as a whole. For that reason, I question you motives behind even mentioning your theories on the author. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewtheart_6f71.html" title="User:Andrewtheart">Andrewtheart</a> 04:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with Andrewtheheart and and the other keep-sayers. This article needs a chance to develop more. I didn't intentionly post the rosters for name-dropping reasons, although i didn't know that you weren't able to post records, <s>I guess I could have just put "The Football Team experienced an unsuccessful first season, with not a single win."</s> And yes Soltak, I'm a student that attends MBHS. The last time I checked it wasn't against the rules for students to create/edit articles here on wikipedia or to be bold in editting. For those of you that don't know, a marching band that made sweeptakes at UIL and advanced to the finals at the Denton Golden Triangle its first year is a very difficult task to accomplish, thus making the band alone notable enough to have its own article. This School is also making tremendous progress in the academic field and in its extracurricular programs. The only reason you saw blank sections is because I was on break when I created this and therefore was not able to get citable information from the club sponsors themselves. I say give this article some time, and it will expand enough to become worthy enough to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">Zader</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_Concordia_c1a6.html" title="User:Zadernet/Concordia"><b><font color="blue">n</font></b></a><a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadernet_f2d6.html" title="User:Zadernet"><b><font color="black">et</font></b></a> 10:34, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well <b>Calton</b>, you might have copied the already existing discussion to his page as you could probably imagine I didn't find it “irreælevant” since I took the time to write it, and as it address the requirements set up in “Notability (web)” directly.</p>
<p>Looking at the requirements set-up in the “Notability (web)” section. We have:</p>
<p><i>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The content has been published in, among other places,&#160;:</dd>
<dd>Black &amp; White World II <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-9724569-1-0</a></dd>
<dd>Black &amp; White World II <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-9724569-1-0</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The website has won several awards. Among them from Jerusalem Post.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, there are several grounds for notability:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an event on one of the most visited blogs and which is widely reported and talked about outside that blog (google has about 10k hits and technorati reports hits from many sites besides LGF).</li>
<li>The cartoonist Cox &amp; Forkum, themselves widely used and “read”, draws (and publish) an annual cartoon to mark the event. e.g.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.coxandforkum.com/archives/000751.html" class="external free" title="http://www.coxandforkum.com/archives/000751.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coxandforkum.com/archives/000751.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>In the voting for the winner, there are several tens of thousands of individuals participating.</li>
<li>It is an recurring event, for now five years straight, meaning people will come looking for information (as I did actually) next year, and find is missing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally have no whatsoever affiliation with the blog (or any of the individuals in the voting) so there is no personal gain for in “spamming”. In fact I came here to seek information on the event, and when I found it missing, decided to provide it. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune_X2_d1ac.html" title="User:Rune X2">Rune X2</a> 09:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Speedy deletion tag was removed by the creator. I suppose I could ask for speedy deletion again but I'd rather have wider input on this. First, given that the creator of the article is Youngpolitics (<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungpolitics_8a97.html" title="User talk:Youngpolitics">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Youngpolitics_4390.html" title="Special:Contributions/Youngpolitics">contribs</a>) and that these are his sole edits, we have to assume <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Secondly, there does not seem to be any evidence of third-party coverage so notability is a big question mark. Third, the "latest news" on that website is "we are now on Wikipedia" so we might also consider the whole write-up to be spam. So why am I not asking for speedy deletion? hmmmm... I guess because I'm a sucker for kids with good intentions. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 02:09, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know if this was discussed before, but the history section is extremely long, I don't really wanna see it gone, but I guess a page about an ethnic group should contain a bit more than history. As EgyEgy said in the ratings page, we need more about culture here. I can write some, but I have no structure, so I'll need someone to administer how this is gonna go. How are we gonna expand the culture section? Cuisine? Arts definitely could use some expansion. Habits and traditions, as in what? As in family life or as in what? I hope my point is getting across. We need a bunch of stubs that we can fill in, someone needs to see the big picture though, and I suck at that. Anyone get what I am saying because it's late here and I think I'm incoherent. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarkaron_a04e.html" title="User:Karkaron">Karkaron</a> 02:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC) <small>This signed comment was actually added by Nardelli (<a href="../../../n/a/r/User_talk%7ENardelli_660d.html" title="User talk:Nardelli">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nardelli_29a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nardelli">contribs</a>), not Karkaron —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 03:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>You are not incoherent. I totally agree- this is a history article, not an article on the Egyptian people. It has several flaws:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The demographics section is mostly about Egyptian immigration to other countries, not nuts and bolts demographics, like birth and fertility rates, health, age structure etc, etc..</li>
<li>The History section is totally overweighted and overwhelms the whole article. Compare to other articles like <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_people.html" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedes.html" title="Swedes">Swedes</a> and you see a much shorter History section, and more on the people themselves. The History section dominates about 80% of this article. What exactly is the focus?</li>
<li>Within the history section itself, there is too much detail. I mean, do we really need to know about the god Hapy? Is it burningly urgent to know that Council of Chalcedon convened in AD 451? we really need to know that Solar worship was embodied in the cults of Ra and Atum? What exactly does this have to do with the people as a whole? Again, compare to other similar Wikipedia articles and you can see this article is totally skewed. How did it receive an "A" rating on an objective basis?</li>
<li>The article also has some questionable statements, like "Modern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the French expedition in Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798." Is this really so? Why does modern history begin because the French appeared? It would be more accurate to say that the French or European impact greatly lessened Egypt's insulation under the sultanates. And what about the reforms of Muhammad Ali? Are they an afterthought?</li>
<li>Key information is missing on culture as stated above. What is the detail for example on why the Egyptians do not always view themselves as Arabs? What can be said about the "Egyptian national character"? What are some outstanding features of Egyptian culture etc. etc? If you look at the Dutch and Swedish pages, they have such a section and are not totally overwhelmed with historical detail. A lot of that should move to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Egypt_24d7.html" title="History of Egypt">History of Egypt</a> article.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article needs a complete rewrite, and I think it can be done like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut the History section by at least 90%. It should just be a summary type thing or sketch with a link to the main article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Egypt_24d7.html" title="History of Egypt">History of Egypt</a> A lot of websites so something similar in about 60 lines.</li>
<li>Expand a Culture section to tell us who are really the Egyptians. For the rewrite, I recommend you look at other similar articles and then work up an outline- cusisine, music, arts etc etc and go from there.</li>
<li>Include a "National character/How others see the Egyptians" section, like the Dutch and Swedish articles. This is very important for the Egyptians since historically they saw themselves as unique and even today do not simply consider themselves just another set of Arabs. They are a distinctive people, and that issue needs to be explored fully.</li>
<li>Also to be considered for inclusion is at least some brief discussion on relations with other peoples surrounding Egypt like Israel. This is also important for the Egyptians have put their own distinctive stamp on that issue. The 1973 Crossing Operation for example is generally regarded with respect by most non-Egyptian military analysts, see Herzog's Arab-Israeli Wars history for example, more so than the uneven performance by many Arab armies. This is only one example of course, but in this and many other ways, the Egyptians have made their mark. This needs to be brought out on a page like this. Obscure details about the 451 Council of Chalcedon or ancient solar calendars belong elsewhere.Nardelli 05:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Consensuses: Delete areticle and rewrite totally like Dutch People or Swedes articles. Moved duplicate history section to its own article called Historical perspectives on the Egyptian people. now focus can be on egyptian people not history. Nardelli 02:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into the main <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters.html" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> article. The main article doesn't actually <i>have</i> a trivia section, it just links out to this page. It's also acceptable for a movie article to include <i>some</i> real world trivia. However, even if it's merged, there needs to be an effort to find sources for individual claims. If you can source some claims and not others, then delete the unsourced ones and keep the sourced ones. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 05:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As SkierRMH mentioned, I created the article because there'd been complaints with the trivia section being a part of the main Ghostbusters article. I figured that this would be a 'positive' resolution as I have felt most of the trivia, pending accurate descriptions and sourcing was valid for inclusion'. Trivia isn't included in real encycleopedia because they don't have the luxury of near infinite space or the resources of people who'd be willing to try look it out such as us, I say that isn't a problem with Wikipedia and that trivia isn't as 'evil' as some seem to regard it as. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 09:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Can't see any good reason to have a separate article for this. --Lee Vonce 17:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> anything that can be sourced back to the main article. Very shoddy cut-and-paste job. The first sentence reads "Lindsay Buckingham was also approached..." implying something else is supposed to be before it. A lot of it <i>can</i> be sourced, but isn't, for example: the Slimer character was not just <i>rumored</i> to be based on John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd has stated many times that it is based on him. This trivia section isn't really that large compared to some I've seen, so it doesn't need its own article (if you can call this an "article"). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 23:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I explained on the article's discussion page, I am more than happy to make any changes needed to keep SPOTBOWL's entry within Wikipedia's encyclopedic guidelines.</p>
<p>In its defense, SPOTBOWL is a website that has attracted MILLIONS of hits over its three years of existence. Its presence on Wikipedia is legitimately in the public interest and addresses the long-standing trend of America's fascination with Super Bowl advertising.</p>
<p>SPOTBOWL's entry is no more self-serving than the entries of pop culture or entertainment-based websites like <a href="../../../j/i/b/Jib_Jab_ee05.html" title="Jib Jab">Jib Jab</a>, <a href="../../../t/m/z/TMZ.com_f613.html" title="TMZ.com">TMZ.com</a>, and others like it.</p>
<p>Please let me know what needs to be changed on the SPOTBOWL entry (tone, content, etc.) and I'll be happy to make the changes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Shoffner1974 (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoffner1974_8552.html" title="User talk:Shoffner1974">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Shoffner1974_92f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Shoffner1974">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p><b>delete</b> from as I suggested AfD in the first place. Article sounds like it's written by website's creator. Don't think we need an entry for all websites in Wikipedia - there are search engines for that. Fbooth 08:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The page is not encyclopedic. It is more instructional than informational, containing suggestions and ideas for design. It also contains much POV text, with phrases such as "A sweater made as a gift usually delights its intended -- but it may never be worn again if it does not serve some practical purpose."

<li><b>weak delete</b>/ <b>Strong cleanup</b>, the article as it stands now is inappropriate--far too many "shoulds" and opinion statements. It's POV and not encyclopedic. However, if rewritten, it could be legitimate, so I'd say give it a chance, come back in a couple months, and if it's still like this, delete it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> Write on the article where possible, not it's deletion debate (I swear I should make that an essay or something). In my opinion deletion should be reserved for bad topics, and not bad articles. From the vast number of sources (IE dedicated magazines, with significant readerships, to knitting; college courses taught in knitting...) this appears to be a notable topic. It does strongly need cleanup, something I'm not really qualified to do, knowing nothing of the topic, but I'm confidant some editors who know more than I could make this a great article. AfD is not Requests for Cleanup, problems with voice, sourcing, POV or tone are better addressed by editing rather than nuking the article unless they are terminal and intractable flaws (like unresolvable POV definitions for lists, or nonexistant sources). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> you'll usually find me on the deletionist side of any fence, but I don't understand why this article is on afd and not tagged for cleanup or somesuch.

True, it's not comprehensive and needs work on the tone (more on that on the talk page), but we don't delete articles because they're incomplete or need editing. I'm also a bit concerned that the nominator chose to bring this to afd despite having engaged with the author on the talk page and being directly told of her intention to work on it. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 00:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This has absolutely GOT to be the most fatuous, useless, incomplete and unreferenced list in the whole encyclopedia. What does "known" mean? There are literally millions of opiate addicts known to the appropriate medical services. Is there quoted, compelling evidence that the living people on the list have been, AND CURRENTLY REMAIN, addicted?

<li><b>Keep</b>, each entry is well sourced. If you want to change the title from "addict" to "user" I would support that POV change because of the negative connotations of the word "addict". Also notice that each entry has an article in Wikipedia already, and this in not a telephone book list. This is less subjective than the "alcoholic" list, everyone has a drink, but not everyone uses opiates and mentions it in an interview, is arrested for possession, or dies from an overdose. I agree deceased is not a good label. for dead people the birth and death year would look better. An an overdose tag added for those that died of an overdose. Also an arrest for possession would be a good tag. Also note no one has mentioned a specific Wikipedia rule that it is in violation of. The list is verifiable and isn't a telephone list or a memorial. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 23:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I recall I voted keep last time because there's some historic/cultural significance to opiate use, moreso than most other drugs. However I'm no longer sure this is the best way to deal with that. Maybe "opiate use in history and fiction", or something, would be better.

<ul>
<li>I'd add though that on reflection I'd have a slight problem with "opiate users." Opiates are historically significant for pain management and are still used on occasion. When I was in intensive care I had to use an opiate for pain once or twice, but I did so as little as possible (less than the doctors wanted) as it made me feel strange. Still I could be classed as an "opiate user", if only for a brief time, but I find that notion vaguely absurd or unuseful. If you switch to "opiate user" could you somehow make it clear this is recreational use?--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Not really. I'm quite aware of the concept of racial anti-Semitism. I know some of its origins, and even a little about its history, although I wouldn't pretend I could write a quality article about the topic without a lot of library time. <i>However</i>, the current article we do have doesn't seem to focus on the topic either. The article makes no assertion that the Dreyfus Affair was motivated by race rather than religion (I'd like to see some supporting citations here in particular, as it contradicts the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreyfuss_affair.html" title="Dreyfuss affair">Dreyfuss affair</a> article rather directly). Our article on the <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogroms.html" title="Pogroms">pogroms</a> includes a substantial quote from the <i>Occidental Quarterly</i> that indicates an economic, rather than racial, motivation. And the closing conspiracy theory section also makes no real distinction; <i>Protocols</i> is arguably religious anti-Semitism (see especially Protocols 14, 17, 23) or anti-Zionism, rather than being motivated by race. In general, the article does little to <i>demonstrate</i> (rather than state) that the topics discussed involve differences between racial and religious anti-Semitism. Again, though, I'm not suggesting deletion is the answer here ... but this article needs a lot of work to support what its trying to say, and so the nominator's position is understandable. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 11:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Paradoxically, I see this dissection into separate kinds of anti-Semitism as dilution of the unique phenomenon which anti-Semitism is. I am surprised that adult people fail to keep in mind that if you meld several things together, you get something unique that cannot be described as a sum of of the components. Even racial anti-Semitism of Hitler was rooted in economical/"class" anti-Semitim. At best, the article could have sense if it were written in the style "racist aspects of anti-Semitism". Let me give you an analogy. A <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet.html" title="Magnet">magnet</a> has its north pole and south pole. But there is no such thing as "north magnet" or south magnet" (yes, I know people are looking for <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopole.html" title="Monopole">monopole</a> and yes I know all analogies are false; I am presenting it not as a proof of something, but as a demonstration that inseparable issues do exist, and they must be treated with clear awareness of their inseparability). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 17:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wouldn't oppose renaming it into Racist aspects of antisemitism. The article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> grew too long and it was broken (not by me) into subarticles. Let's discuss at talk how to improve the entire series, but IMHO, AFD is a wrong way to go. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 21:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> If there's anything of value in this article, then it can be merged with the main article on anti-Semitism. I don't see any valid reason to have a separate article based on a semantic quibble. Isn't "racial anti-Semitism" still "anti-Semitism"? --Lee Vonce 17:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The distinction between religious, racial ("modern" or "classic"), and ideological (or "new") antisemitism is one that many scholars adhere to. We have one article that explores antisemitism in general, and other articles that explore the variants cited by academics. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strotha's input sounds (i haven't consulted that specific page beyond the box at its top) like as serious a misreading of the page as is their confusing a guideline with "Policy" (casing as in original). The clearly marked <i>guideline</i> on conflict of interest needs revision to correct a serious fuddlement if it says or means what Strotha attributes to it: with (at most) very few exceptions, lack of notability is reason for deletion <i>without further requirements</i>, and CoI is of interest on an AfD only to the extent that <i>need to rely on</i> sources with a CoI suggests non-notability. If Strotha has given a reasonable interpretation of the page, evidence of that should be posted on <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a> <a href="../../../v/p/p/WP%7EVPP_9f2a.html" title="WP:VPP">Policy pg)</a>, for the widest possible discussion of how to avoid giving others the same impression.<br />

<p>Responses to Comments:</p>
<p>-MER-C, per alexa.com darkmists.org has been online since September 5, 2000. There is no ranking data evident because the contact information was incomplete before; it does not say ranking is below 100,000. I had revised the contact information yesterday and hopefully the ranking would show up properly in a few days' time (per alexa). This issue has been resolved then, and if we look at existence online, it's been more than six years.</p>
<p>-Edison, I am sorry, but the remark "Delete per nominator" is not helpful and does not contribute to this discussion on whether the entry about an RPG MUD should be deleted. From your remark, there is no specific reason/direct explanation given on why it should be deleted or what any contributor could do to make the entry "more notable". "Delete per nominator" is simply agreeing with the nominator's viewpoint. This is not a "voting session" but a "discussion page".</p>
<p>-QuagmireDog, what do you think a text-based MUD could do to become "notable"? What content should we be referencing? We have stock classes/races as well as our own unique blend. Our areas are mostly original, though. Should we include a listing of all our areas (close to 300 of them) and indicate the full names of the builders for originality? There is no mention of an award because our players came to the game by word of mouth originally, and it is only recently that we have explored marketing more over the internet.</p>
<p>For the record, the original contributor of the Wikipedia entry is "SweetAndy" one of our players and not a game administrator; therefore his comments are not for self-publicity. There have been additions to the page from other players and then the admin staff from a few days' ago.</p>
<p>Dark Mists has been in existence since 1996. There have been other text-based MUDs whose entries have been retained. I have looked at their sites... there are no mention of awards and no other references listed other than their own website or forums, even unofficial ones created by players. I have also looked at their alexa.com ratings and some of them show "No Data" as well under "Traffic Rank".</p>
<p>We would work with the reviewers in resolving the notability issue if there is concrete detail that could be provided as to why this page entry should be removed from Wikipedia.com, keeping in mind that we are speaking of a text-based MUD where players log-in to assume a medieval fantasy role, interact with others socially or have player-versus-player combat with one another in a more traditional fashion, and not a graphical MUD where players log-in to be "entertained" per se, visually. Overall, I feel the remarks all fall under the category of "This page should be deleted because it ought to be deleted.", especially stating the term "unencyclopedic". ArzosahDM 05:38, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'concrete detail' has already been provided. The article does not pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the guideline used to judge notability of web content. "This page should be deleted because it ought to be deleted" was not the assertion, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was linked twice already and you've obviously seen them since you've replied to myself and the other contributor who cited it.</li>
<li>Notability is shorthand for external review and/or observation. Non-notability is not shorthand for "this is crap" or "we need more in-universe info", it's highlighting the lack of sources. Coming to WP and seeing something you're involved with personally described as non-notable can easily feel like a personal attack and a negative judgement on the quality of the subject. That's something I can quite understand, but it isn't the intention, it's just Wikipedia terminology for something which hasn't demonstrated outside attention within the article itself.</li>
<li>WP is a tertiary source taking details from secondary sources to provide details for articles. Without secondary sources the article is not providing a rounded picture of the subject, nor is the article doing something which hasn't been done by elsewhere by Darkmists and its fans.</li>
<li>Articles stand or fall on their own merits, that other MUDs which appear to be in the same position are listed here has no bearing on this AFD process, see <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> for details. There's nothing to stop such entries being listed for AFD at any point, just that nobody has had the time or inclination yet.</li>
<li>A notable award, of some sort, would have passed one of the criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Other things which would help would be reviews, reports etc. from folks not involved with Darkmists. Those outside reports would also have to come from a reliable source (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). If yourself or anyone else finds something that seems to come from a reliable source then please provide it for discussion. The other criteria (distribution through a well known source) doesn't seem to apply. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 08:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete this ASAP.</b> While I am an administrator at this game and in general like the idea of having a Wikipedia entry for our game, this entry is being used as a verbal war in public by a few players who have bad attitudes toward the admin of the game. (Reference <a href="http://newdarkmists.16.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=491" class="external free" title="http://newdarkmists.16.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=491" rel="nofollow">http://newdarkmists.16.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=491</a>) It is a waste of our time and yours to be attempting to maintain an objective look at this entry. ---DM Immortal, 1/11/2007 noonish
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> if you regard this as an "attack page" you could suggest <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a> under criterion G10 - Pages that serve no purpose but to disparage their subject or some other entity (e.g., "John Q. Doe is an imbecile") - by putting {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-attack_4f04.html" title="Template:Db-attack">db-attack</a>}} at the top of the article. However, it would seem that ArzosahDM contests the deletion so it might be better just to let the AfD run its course. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 13:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a>, my contention of the deletion was made prior to recent disparaging entries. ArzosahDM 10:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Arnie was also among the first to discover that some new music was starting to come out of England. One fateful day in 1963 he heard of a record that was topping the charts in the UK, got himself a copy sent from abroad, and was the first in the US to play it. And that record was . . . well, it was only “Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor (On the Bedpost Overnight)” by Lonnie Donegan.

<p>Also if you check the "what links here", from Arnie Ginsburg you can see he was credited with breaking the track "Louie Louie" by the Kingsmen also sourced in the Arnie article and you will see how popular he was and notable.

<p>If I may something for myself: I did write this article. I don't think that it is a "vanity" article, I think that the content is of general interest. It is not just "one of many court martials". As far as I know, there had not been in the Israeli armed forces' history another case of a soldier while on military service writing political graffity on 117 tanks and other military vehicles, and I don't think there were many such cases in other armies anywhere. About press coverage: I can certainly mention for example, a two-page article in "Hadashot" newspaper, which I well remember because the Prison Commander and his officers saw it before me (the officer charged with censoring prisoners' letters brought it to his office before finally delivering my wife's letter to me). And there were several articles in other newspapers, both new reports and commentaries. Adam Keller 13:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suz Andreasen is a prominent American artist in the field of Jewellery Design as well as publishing/writing and music. There are hundreds if not thousands of links to her work on google. Not many photos of her as she is shy about having her picture taken but this should not be relevant. In primary sources like text books and art books I have a few dozen which is a great deal consider she is only 42. She is in major museums, showed at SOFA (this is no small feat I can tell you in the world of functional art) and here is the link: <a href="http://www.sofaexpo.com/NY/2006/fact.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sofaexpo.com/NY/2006/fact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sofaexpo.com/NY/2006/fact.htm</a>. All of this and more makes her a notable person. I included her parents in the article because her father, who invented memory wire, was exposed to toxicity and got Multiple Myaloma and died when she was only 20. It was under his encouragement that she pursued metalsmithing. Her mother, who is a noted scientist an author was also mentioned because it was through Nancy that she learned to write. These are only there because of her background - not as any form of nepetism as Suz Andreasen does not need it as she is entirely notable in her own right through her works which are easily found. Also, if is sometimes important to include geneological background when a number of notable persons come from the same family. Example: Rembrant Bugatti the sculpture was the son of Carlo Bugatti the Car designer.</p>
<p>It appears that under this category of Jeweller Designers, more individuals are needed and good editors as well. Since I am a PHD student at Bard College in the curatorial dept, I can tell you definitively that this individual should be nominated. As Mango said, there are hundreds of primary resources for her life's works, it is just a matter of handling the article in a way that is appropriate and meshing that with the given category.</p>
<p>That being said, I will note that in this category I see alot of inconsitencies. Example: Efva Attling From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Efva Attling, was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1952 and is well known today for being an avant garde jewellery designer. In the early 80's she played in the band "X Models" and released the hit single "Två av oss" (Two of us) her passion for design continued by working for Levi's and H&amp;M before in the mid 90's staring her own distinct line of jewellery. Today top celebrities from Madonna to Jennifer Aniston and Kylie Minogue have all been seen wearing her unique designs. She lives with Eva Dahlgren, popular Swedish pop singer.</p>
<p><br />
In my assesment this designer Efva Attling has less under her belt than not only Suz Andreasen, but many other designers I would like to see included such as Dorie Nossiter, Archibald Knox, George Jensen, JAR, - the list goes on and on. This person, Efva is included as a person of note, seemingly because she has Madonna as a client. Ms Andreasen is a couturier for Oprah Winfrey but I did not mention this because I felt that in a scholarly approach, this should not be the primary argument.</p>
<p>So, please illimunate me as to how and why the various designers who are listed under "Jewellery Designers" are there as opposed to the person I am currently working on who seems to have more credentials than most included on Wikipedia with the exclusion of Picasso and Lalique?</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, not because the article fails in quality the person does in notability. Having won a few prestigious national awards is certainly enough for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but that article needs a lot of work.

<s><b>Keep</b></s></p>
<p>In rebutt to Alf photoman this is not a weak keep. When you say that having a few prestigious awards is not enough, you should then release and not keep most of the jewellery designers you have under your heading of Jewellery Designers. Further - this person is of note - not only because she has won prestigious natiional awards but because of her work in areas of arts - publishing, music as well as functional design.</p>

<li><b>keep</b> tho perhapos it should count since I think was the one who removed the speedy tag. But I did so on the basis that she might be notable, and it would be worth a debate.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The editor has to flesh this out considerably. Until I read the talk page, I was fairly underwhelmed. It was not at all clear to me that this person was particularly notable. I now think she might be, but I am somewhat puzzled that the editor was not able to get more information about the subject in the article, given that the editor apparently knows the subject personally. Compare this biography to other biographies on WP and use them as a guide for how to convince us of notability.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 14:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Response to Weak Keep:</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest that perhaps the last post was underwhelmed because the editor does not have expertise in this area and I have been basically hammered to death about NOT going on more about the subjects personal life nor my insights as that would not be in keeping with WP:BIO. I have read all of the bios in this category and quite frankly, with the exception of Lalique, I was not only underwhelmed to quote Filll, but also feel that I have done en excellent job at editing this. If you look at my edits, I have done now more than 40-50. I am more than happy to add more but at this time, I would like to see not only a little more support from editors to keep, (especially those who know about functional art and design) but also a little less waffling here. The rules are the rules. I am following them to my best and to the letter. So - once this is put up, and the consensus period is over, (which is should be soon and we seem to have a consensus that it should be kept) then I am more than happy to elaborate further on not only her, but other designers I have knowledge of either through research or personally - dead or living. Let's try and be a little supportive here. We do this in our spare time. I love doing it, but editorial rules must be followed and I have done that.

<p><b>Why delete</b></p>
<p>It seems to me that if there is a google search that shows and confirms the term Aga Khani than it should be mentioned. Most of the Pakistanis know the followers of Aga Khan as Aga Khani so 140 million people according to the user should be disregarded. Maybe as in the artice on nation of islam there is a link to the criticism of Nation of Islam, than a similar link should be placed for Nizari Ismailis</p>

<li>'Aga Khani' refers to <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizari.html" title="Nizari">Nizari Ismailis</a> (for whom the Aga Khan is the current Imam), which already has an article, so there's no point in it having a separate article. While having a redirect may seem harmless –– (1) the term is something that arises out of ignorance; it is never used in an academic setting which makes it unfit for an encyclopedia, (2) the community does not refer to itself as 'Aga Khani'; if anything, it is considered pejorative by members of the community. (3) people searching for 'Aga Khani' might as well search for 'Aga Khan' and come across the same thing – so having a redirect doesn't serve much purpose.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi All. The term <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khani_a94c.html" title="Aga Khani">Aga Khani</a> literally means <b>of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a></b> in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>/<a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>. A rough translation would be <b>Followers of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_393b.html" title="Aga Khan">Aga Khan</a></b>. Though I don't know much about the sect, you can rest assured that it exists.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As with Nation of Islam which has both sides, why is Users here getting so upset as in Nation of Islam there is a separate section of their beliefs. So there is nothing wrong with having this article.

<li>It seems to me that as in Nation of Islam Article there is a link to critism of Nation of Islam where the other side is also listed could be a proper compromise so both sides have their opinions listed. why not do the same here. An insert a link to a new article where the other side is also told</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>* In todays world we in the United States see bombings between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq and than witness all kinds of individuals stating that they are the main stream Islam, while in fact Mainstream muslims who constitute over 99% of Islam in Shia and Sunnis but people dont know who to look at. In fact, if one is to look up the suicide bombers it is clear that most of them are members of a sect that follows extremist views such as going to heaven by killing innocent people, while vast majority of muslims are clearly opposed to this. In order to understand Islam and the mainstream Islam it is incumbent upon the editors to have these cults and sects in one section where it is all for see what these small sects really beliveve in. For instance, the Qadianis claim they have 200 million followers while in fact they have less than 10 million members, the Aga Khanis are less than 5 million members, the Nation of Islam maybe one half million, these sects are not mainstreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in Christianity there are the cults such as David Koresh's Branch Dravidians, and the Chritian Identity up in Idaho, those cults do not represent mainstream Christianity, and these cults are listed separately. If one is to look up th Encyclopedia of American Religion, Fourth Edition by J. Gordon Melton, The Encylcopedia lists every single religion in America, including each of the cults mentioned in this article. Thus to delete this article would be unfair.</p>
<p>In fact it would be the same as deleting on the Nation of Islam article the critisms of Nation of Islam. In fact if one puts up anything in the Ismaili article the users who are followers of that particular brand of Islam call it vandalism, while in fact it is a viewpoint which is different than that held by the followers. In one instance a statement was added to the Wahabi sect and a user from Israel objected, eventhough, I doubt very much that Israelis have a very deep understanding of Wahabis, the user called it vandalism, while in truth and fact the United States Government and in particulara the FBI has stated that Wahabis are extremists and that the 9/11 hijackers were all wahabis and that Osama Bin Ladin proclaims himself to be a Wahabi, but the reference was deleted as being untrue and as vandalism.</p>
<p>Here if one is to listen to the argument put forward by the adherents of the view that Islam is a pluralistic religion and all are accepted, than we would not be witnessing over 90 dead bodies in Iraq everyday. In fact my own nephew who was with the 4ID in Iraq was a victim of the cultish violence, in fact he won a purple heart for his bravery. We have to identify the cults in Islam so that the world can see that these cult followers even with their billions of dollars who have bought our Government in Washington, do not in fact represent Islam.</p>
<p>Obvioiusly, the Mormon cultist who was marying off 12 year old girls also did not consider himself to be a cultist. If only the viewpoint of the particular follower of the cult or sect are listed than Wikipedia cannot be called an Encyclopedia but rather a proponent of only the views of the sects or cults that want to propogate their own viewpoints.</p>
<p>I hope that the editors are mindful of the viewpoint that to make a complete encyclopedia all viewpoints must be published.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to consider the above.</p>

<p>Former members of this cult or sect have numerous websites that say the same thing, I have not seen the Aga Khan file a defamation suit anywhere in the world to say that these are false. Every cult in history has said that anyone who says anything about their cult or sect is clearly libelous, see former members of the Church of Scientology or Branch Dravidians or now Aga Khanis.</p>
<p>Everyone says the same things. So to put forward both views is what Wikipedia is all about.</p>

<p>Tagged for speedy as empty but is not. I would say this is excessive treatment of a single mention in a single verse of the Bible.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm one of the researchers of the article - I'm an educator/administrator in the public high schools here in California - also, I maintain several web sites which deal with eschatological issues (small traffic, around 15,000 hits per day or 1,000 visitors per day) - Now, what I have done here is to elicit some input on the topic - a topic that is exceedingly significant in the scheme of eschatological-biblical subject matter (It will NOT be a waste of time and interest . . . the exposure of this topic will be staggering - you wait and see.) I intend to bring scores of authors, theologians, etc. into the arena. Not only will it involve Christians of all stripes - but the nation of Israel and those of Jewish ancestry - the "theological history" of this topic is staggering! Therefore, I, along with a number of others will input into the topic - and, I am pleasantly surprised that no one, up to this juncture, has dared to enter into this most significant eschatological topic: THE TWO WITNESSES - who they are (from a wide-variety of propositions) and why, when, and where they will accomplish their witness. Bear with me - by the time this is completed, it will have geo-political ramifications of immense priority - and it will be fair and balanced in its presentation (viz., objective). Thank you for your indulgence - I/we hope to have all the material integrated into the topic within the week. The "Two Witness Crew" (all 10 of us!).... and, incidentally, it is not completely unreferenced as one critic amongst us all alledges - grant it, it's exceedingly brief - but those of you "in the know" realize we've got an elephant by the tail! Let's be reasonable - why do you think there are over 1.5 Google responses on this topic - is not that sufficient? I think so. Frankly - if the "Left Behind Series" can sell upwards of 65 million copies - and, now the video games - there is an immense interest here! This topic was presented by me at a joint Christian-Jewish seminar as a "paper" and was originally accepted in several theological journals. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.129.87.139_e9e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.129.87.139">71.129.87.139</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.129.87.139.html" title="User talk:71.129.87.139">talk</a>) 04:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> They are certainly important figures in a massive religion.

<li><b>Keep</b> I realize that the "enthusiasm level" of this article will increase with time, along with efforts to alter the research presentation prior to its completion "within the week" which we have promised, prior to commencing on the project. The nature of Wikipedia in a project of this nature needs a bit of patience - and, since we are somewhat new to this, we appreciate the help - especially on designing appropriate links that are less "sightly" (perhaps "down below" would be better - help:}) - we've included another section on the religio-politico ramifications of the Two Witnesses - Note: We've capitalized the topic purposefully for effect; however, in our opinion, to not do so would "diminish" the topic. thanks for everyone's patience!

Please look back through the history of the last several edits. There is a long scholarly history of comparative religion, taught at major universities, comparing the doctrines and beliefs of Christianity with those of Buddhism. This is an important and encyclopedic topic, but the article is obviously undergoing a polemic edit war. Those who have studied comparative religion should take a look at the article and use Wikipedia edit policies, and perhaps RFC to straighten out the POV edit warring going on. Keep the article, perhaps bring disruptive editors under control using the tools available. There is clearly information relevant to the interaction of Christianity and Buddhism that is better located here than in the two separate articles. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

About the biggest thing was a local notice of hearings on water rights. If there's anything meeting WP's general standards, I didn't see it. If this is a place notably "relating to cities and science and art", that hasn't made its way to newspapers and magazines. In other words, please demonstrate that it <i>has been noted</i> in reliable sources, don't just handwave without evidence. I don't have my mind set against including this creek's article, I just need to see something that meets WP standards.

<dd>Not convincing at all. So the guy is also a film actor in addition to being a would-be suicide bomber? If the guy is so notable as you say, where are the references to all his terror acts for which he is so wanted?... You have added a bit to the article but conveniently avoided mentioning any terror acts, and you also linked to a another Wikipedia page that you yourself created initially. Apart from the fact that this is clearly not NPOV, i.e - a biased article, this person and his obviously missing deeds do not justify an article. And again, Wikipedia is not a shrine for promoting personal agendas. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Hyams_dbfa.html" title="User:John Hyams">John Hyams</a> 11:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Pointless article. Half of the US doesn't know about this camp and Wikipedia is not a tourist guide to show what fun things there are to do at this camp. The sections are useless and small because their isn't enough infromation In one of the paragraphs it talks about John Stienbeck, a famous artist. This isn't notable enough. It's tone is better though. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarpet9_91e2.html" title="User:Carpet9">Carpet9</a> 23:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article does not assert notability; looks to be a convention that's been around just under a year. I initially speedied it under CSD A7, but am wondering whether that really applies. Also, someone really needs to brush up on his Latin. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 15:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>A few reasons nullarbor is noteworthy/important: 1. It is the only demoparty in Australia 2. It has the biggest demo scene presence in Australia. 3. It is a major part of GO3 - a very large event, including companys such as Epic, lucas arts, nVidia, midway. 4. It supports Perth's IGDA and Siggraph. 5. It is now running for its 2nd year, not 1.</p>
<p>Also, how is nullarbor any less/more notable than: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7DX_(demo_party)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_demo_party</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_(party)</a> etc...</p>

<p>Yes, user who created article is a co-organizer of the event. Yes, I am a new user, and I would be happy to put some kind of disclaimer about it or whatever. As such, I don't know how to argue whats notable and whats not, I'm not sure how to argue the 'reliablility', the event was co-organized by the australian Department of Industry and Resources, which seems to be what is required in terms of notablility? (government org), and was also organized with Edith Cowan University (academic org). Plus plenty of other organizations (ACM SIGGRAPH, IGDA, etc.) Because of the name, its difficult to assert its 'notability' independantly, (since you cant just google for nullarbor) , but google "nullarbor game" returns 43k results and "nullarbor plain" returns 133k results, making this event about 1/3rd as notable as the nullarbor plain, which I'd say is pretty notable..&#160;? In my opinion nullarbor is more notable than many of the other demopartys or game development competitions already listed in wikipedia.</p>
<p>I should stress nullarbor is a free, non-profit, volanteer run event. -- 16:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>'<b>Comment</b> I know of at least two thousand stubs that dont meet the level of sources that this article has to accompany it. What does concern me is that the editor (who wasnt welcomed or explained policy to) is the promoter - I am not sure the correct policy or procedure relative to work through this - however I would caution at this stage any continued delete on sight promoters- at this stage - about dont bite the newcomers and - good faith - as I believe the editor has shown however strange the subject and the article appeared at first - that the subject somehow exists in this wonderful and strange world we live in. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 23:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>'<i>Response</i> I also do not understand how it fails WP:NOT. An explanation on the magazines and the "association" with the event:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1. Xpress mag was not paid to publish an article or advertisment for the event, they did it from they're own free will. They independently decided the event was newsworthy for their audience.</li>
<li>2. Propel Arts magazine is produced by Propel Arts, and independent group, funded by ArtsWA. Some funding from nullarbor came from the Department of Industry and Resources. These are seperate funding bodies, so there is no conflict or association with the event here, other than both organizations belong to the WA government.</li>
<li>3. reAKT!magazine is compeltely independent afaik. It is not funded by the government, it has no association with nullarbor. (I do not know much about this magazine, I might be wrong)</li>
<li>4. HUGI Magazine is published online from Vienna, Austria. It is completely independent from the event. The magazine publishes newsworthy events in the demoscene area.</li>
<li>5. ECU Magazine is published by the same body which funded the event. This is a non-independent source. However, the magazine is academic in nature, and so I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up the 'independance' of the references of the publications. -- <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboeing_b157.html" title="User:Aboeing">Aboeing</a> 10:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It's a well written article, and I wish more demoparty articles had non-scene references.

<dd>Hmm, maybe there should be a rule about nominating an article for deletion within 2 minutes of the article's creation? I'm sorry, most articles need a chance. Post a message on the talk page, saying "hey, is this notable"? Give them a chance to say "oh, yeah, I hadn't yet posted the bajillion news items about it yet, I'll have that done in the next 30 minutes" or even a couple days. This falls under <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Then, if they haven't said anything in a couple days. Let it slide. I'm not a fan of deletionists. Yes, I understand where you were coming from, and (aside from probably not assuming good faith) there was nothing technically wrong with this AFD, but was it really necessary? Very little content is not a reason to delete an article. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> those are the criteria.

<dd>To be fair, Merope did see a very early version of the article, and made a justifiable choice in deleting. The only thing I can say is that I'm a novice wikipedia user, so I was planning on incrementally adding content, I did not realise that you needed to add a complete article on creation. I think it would have been better to have a comment and then deleting it if the article is not improved later, however I can understand not everyone might have the time to go through this procedure. I have asked some other people unrelated to nullarbor (other than they were there) to add content. Hopefully that will happen soon. I would like to know what Merop's objections still are to the article so it can be addressed. (Also, "The author has then modified the comment" is not true, another editor made those changes, as you can see from the history I have not touched this article since I was informed of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a> "self promotion") -- <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboeing_b157.html" title="User:Aboeing">Aboeing</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As outlined on the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Talk%7EGames_Workshop_Online_Community_e365.html" title="Talk:Games Workshop Online Community">talk page</a>, it is not an indiscriminate list of advertising links for fansites. The article outlines the official Games Workshop Online Community, the wider fan-based community and the Worldwide Campaigns run by the company (which are a part of the community). Games Workshop itself has encouraged fansites, especially in regard to "house rules" (<a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_Online_Community_bb6c.html#_note-house_rules" title="Games Workshop Online Community">1</a>). However, to be included in the article, any fansites must first assert some form of notability, be neutral, and most importantly, be verifiable. Between the 23rd and 30th October, a number of articles underwent AfD:

<dd>The result was to delete these articles, but the emerging consensus was that they be mentioned in this article or at <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Ring_Online_Campaign_e542.html" title="War of the Ring Online Campaign">War of the Ring Online Campaign</a> where appropriate, by merging important information that could <i>cite sources</i>.

<dd>Also, no site can be mentioned if it has fewer than 2000 members. The Lord of the Rings sites listed do not fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as they outline their notability; for example, they demonstrate that they have won indepedant awards, been published in independant and verifiable sources, distributed through independent online websites and publication, been the subject of 'non-trivial published works', appeared on radio, run e-zines and online campaigns, and provided articles on the aspects of the Games Workshop hobby. Personally, I think the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_Strategy_Battle_Game_b876.html" title="Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game">Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</a> it long enough already regarding the online community, and that the detail which asserts notability with sources is best off here.</dd>
<dd>As for the Warhammer sites, they can undergo review individually and be removed or copyedited as appropriate. Also, the small sections given to them within each system (LotR SBG, WFB &amp; W40K) could be merged into three single, more managable sections. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 16:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the only website that asserts any real notability is the "Last Alliance" one, which has some citations. No other website listed does so - I don't believe hosting your own awards, having "comprehensive submission guidelines" or having a few members who have had a fan-submission published in <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Dwarf_%28magazine%29_aeee.html" title="White Dwarf (magazine)">White Dwarf</a> makes a website notable. <s>It should also be noted that that "emerging consensus" was only for the Last Alliance site, because, as mentioned, notability has been asserted.</s> --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 16:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - it was also suggested for "Cheeseweb" and "The Dark Council". In regard to the One Ring, it is the oldest continuous forum site on the internet for LotR SBG, and the first to publish a fan supplement (on material which was later covered in an official GW supplement). It also runs campaigns and e-zines. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - running your own "e-zine" or online campaign does not provide notability, per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>- <i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and <b>independent of the creators</b>, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i> (emphasis mine).

<dd>As for consensus, it is clear from the editors' comments at the AfD's, and how no one objected.

<li><b>Comment</b> - all I see with this article is an attempt to circumvent the AFDs (note that both "Last Alliance" articles were speedy deleted) for these websites' articles by lumping them into this quasi-directory (and directories fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). The "Worldwide Campaigns" section is word for word out of the Games Workshop main article; other than that, this article is nothing more than a web directory (with nothing more than the arbitrary threshold of 2000+ members being the prerequisite for inclusion, it seems). The only comment I can find that supports the "emerging consensus" is from <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> in the "Dark Council" AFD- and it supports what I already suggested, that the little meaningful content in this article can be mentioned in already existing articles (in external links). --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 17:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article is not trying to circumvent the AfDs - note how "Cheeseweb" and "The Dark Council" are <i>only mentioned in name</i>, whereas their respective articles were considerably longer. The "threshold" is merely a guideline to quickly identify non-notable sites - they still have to assert notability and be verifiable. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:55, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<b>Keep</b> - I'm in the process of getting together a list of the "best" forums for Specialists Games, using the Moderators of the SG forum (of which I'm one), which in itself was one of the few GW forums to survive the cull. I could just pull out any old list, ut I'm trying to find the ones that are worthy of being mentioned. In my opinion, as an old-time GW gamer, it's the community outside of my own little gaming circle that keeps me interested. For example, without the biggest Bloodbowl forum (talkbloodbowl) I'd never got into tournaments, and wouldn't have met so manypeole that I consider as friends. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkson_9263.html" title="User:Darkson">Darkson - BANG!</a> 00:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This article is about how the Games Workshop has created an online community, and how it has influenced the company's games. For example, as Darkson has noted, GW's support for its specialist games is almost exclusively via its forums. The same is true of their Middle-earth naval ruleset, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_at_Sea_44c9.html" title="All at Sea">All at Sea</a>, which aside from a few White Dwarf articles, is entirely on the internet. Of the 300000+ registered members of the Games Workshop website alone, not all of them post on the fora; many of them are there to receive newsletters or use the site's article resources.<br />
In regard to the community as a whole, the unofficial sites of the fanbase are just as important; for example, the articles produced by each respective site for the public, and the content featured in White Dwarf, are key hobby resources; also, the influence the community has had on the Worldwide Campaigns, and indeed in creating their own; and indeed the huge backlash by <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth_canon.html" title="Middle-earth canon">Tolkien purists</a> against the company's rendition of the Knights of Dol Amroth. All these have impacted the hobby and the sales of the products. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 15:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: no, it's not. The article is about "the registered members of any internet fora or websites specifically for the Games Workshop miniature wargames" (or at least, that's what the first sentence says) and it is currently not much more than a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">directory</a> of forums related to GW's games, very few of which appear to actually be notable. An article along the lines of "Influence of the fan community on Games Workshop's products" (preferably with a less clumsy title) would be encyclopedic if decent sources could be found, but this isn't.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That is not a reason for deletion - that is a strong motion for cleanup. The reason the notable ones don't have articles is for "forumcruft", etc. By limiting the length of entries, it helps avoid superfluous NPOV edits from anons - in fact, you could easily cut down non-notable material, and restructure it per some of the points I have outlined above.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Firsty, there are a broad number of sites within the community, as is stated in the article (hence having to cut out the site directory). The article covers how these sites collectively contribute to the community, and a lot of the information is spread across the internet. The "broad notability" of this community of sites is the influence they have had on Games Workshop miniature wargames; a non-community member would, for example, be interested in the hobby articles and rulesets available on these sites, or in how the community has influenced the production of miniature figures. (<i>Eg.</i> In one magazine, the community was mentioned as having "huge wealth of material").<br />
It should also be made clear that the community is <i>not</i> a computer game, and the online campaigns are just an organising of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniature_wargames.html" title="Miniature wargames">miniature wargames</a> collectively, to play out the effects of each game on a map (so these more similar to a chess tournament than to an online game - in fact, they were originally run by mail before the internet). This article is very important for the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> parent article (and also the parent <a href="../../../g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html#Miniatures_games" title="Games Workshop">articles covering its games</a> and products), and you would not find out everything on the official site; this article covers the contributions of other sites to games such <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_SBG_d5fb.html" title="Lord of the Rings SBG">LotR SBG</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle_df5e.html" title="Warhammer Fantasy Battle">WFB</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer_40000.html" title="Warhammer 40000">W40K</a>, and also the specialist games for which they are almost the sole resource. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 19:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> addressing Grimhelm's last comments:
<ol>
<li>Except, as already mentioned, most still fail <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for notability.</li>
<li>There is no proof that "the online community" has actually influenced model production. That's a big assertion that would require some reference to back it up; I haven't seen such yet. Same goes for the claims about the website that affected Orcs during Storm of Chaos- you have no citation that proves that that website actually influenced it in the way this article claims. In fact, there are absolutely no secondary sources to this article, and it shows- the descriptions of each website read more like advertisements than neutral commentary.</li>
<li>Your example is flawed because that magazine was White Dwarf, which is directly tied into this- it's a primary source, and it wasn't referencing "the community" as a whole, it was referencing exactly one website (The Last Alliance).</li>
<li>Again, none of those sites are notable- not a single one of them would survive an AFD (the only one that <i>could</i>, TLA, has already failed), which is what I meant earlier- this "article" is nothing more than an attempt to avoid an AFD for each website by collecting them into a quasi-directory and claiming it's an article about a "community". Yes, it's slightly better now that it's not just a big list of websites, but not much better. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 03:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As mentioned above, this is not about the individual websites. It is about how a group of websites have influenced a company and a hobby. In the Warhammer section, we now have only two mentioned in passing, and mererly to illustrate the point. I also added two references to the statement about sales as you asked - and one of them <i>is</i> a secondary source. I would improve this more, but with it so close to AfD closure already I'm not sure if it would be worth the efferot. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 07:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>: I beg to differ. It <i>is</i> about the websites. There's no content to the article besides discussion of the websites. There's no secondary sources proving its assertions- yes there's the single secondary source, but it doesn't support what the article states (it is a financial statement saying that GW had a shortfall in 2005, but it doesn't mention the online community's effect at all, making it worthless as a reference). As I said in my last comment, not one of the assertions are backed up. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthBinky_672c.html" title="User:DarthBinky">DarthBinky</a> 12:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: But this is collectively, and not individual random advertising as you assume. For example, you said: "<i>Same goes for the claims about the website that affected Orcs during Storm of Chaos- you have no citation that proves that that website actually influenced it in the way this article claims. In fact, there are absolutely no secondary sources to this article, and it shows- the descriptions of each website read more like advertisements than neutral commentary.</i>"<br />
What website do I claim affected the Orcs? <i>Anyone</i> who took part in that campaign was part of the community, and the article merely states that the community influenced the campaign. It does not credit it to one website, and the two sources given are the secondary GW sources (in this context GW was reporting on the progress of a campaign played by the fanbase). Also, there are no "descriptions of each website"; any websites cited are only mentioned as sources in relevant context to the community and the hobby as a whole - not a directory of advertisements as you claim.<br />
And for the financial statement, that was the year Games Workshop started releases non-film related material, to which many Tolkien purists had an adverse reaction. I have given a source of a reaction to the release and one on the sales that coincided with that time, but if I did some more searching I could easily find additional sources. And even now, that still only leaves <i>one</i> assertion that you dispute. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 17:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to make it clear, I am disputing both content and the name of the article, especially the name because such intranet never existed in Myanmar and I do believe I have made that point quite clear in my contribution to the talk page, so I dont know where this "sounds like a content dispute" comes from. <a href="../../../o/k/k/User%7EOkkar_3307.html" title="User:Okkar">Okkar</a> 21:10, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Myanmar Wide Web" should be clarified to state that it was a term dubbed by Reporters sans frontières to describe the government-administered intranet in Myanmar, and it should be expanded to described exclusively the term's origin, basics on how the intranet functions, etc. All other information should be removed and placed in the article named <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_in_Myanmar_ef51.html" title="Internet in Myanmar">Internet in Myanmar</a>. --<a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> 06:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So it appears that the name "Myanmar Wide Web" was a creation of reporters, as opposed to have actually existed. While I am not discredting "Reporters sans frontiéres", according to <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> it is worth noting that the name "Myanmar Wide Web" was just a pure fictional creation as opposed to actual existance. We must not paddle what the reporters write as "facts", especially it was just a fictional name created just to sensationalise the article. This is a very dangerous ground we are working on now, if we are not careful, we will end up paddling whatever we read in the news paper, including and not limited to, yellow press. Surely that is not what Wikipedia is about. <a href="../../../o/k/k/User%7EOkkar_3307.html" title="User:Okkar">Okkar</a> 09:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The guy is certainly minor, but there is sufficient curiosity and interest for people to search for him on Wikipedia, and for 14 editors over 6 months to build up a small article. This is certainly a borderline case, but we can afford to give it the benefit of the doubt. It would be good to have some kind of page count for such articles so we can have some idea of interest. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 00:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. The deletes make strong arguments based on the guidelines, but I find myself agreeing with SilkTork. The article is acceptably written and it seems to cobble together just enough little bits of notability to make me reluctant to support deletion. I can't say he is the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works - <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jamesbradford1" class="external text" title="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jamesbradford1" rel="nofollow">this</a> is about the best I could find. However, the notability guidelines can't anticipate every situation and I think multiple, albeit minor, verifiable claims to fame are enough for a small article. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i> 23:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This individual may not be famous, but he has participated in enough significant and notable projects within the last 12 months for him to be JUST NOTABLE ENOUGH for inclusion. The debate as to whether reality TV subjects are notable enough to be included on Wikipedia has been going on for some time, but it is generally considered that if they have other notable achievements then they are notable enough. This person contributed published music to the soundtrack of a major television show; I don't know where one can go for verification of that outside of IMDB, but I have the show in movie files on my own computer and can verify that he is listed in the credits of four episodes for contributing music. This would seem to indicate that at the very least he is actively working in the entertainment industry, and it would be foolish to delete the article only to have him accomplish more over the coming year and have to re-enter it completely.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. The currently-redlinked Water bar (service) - that is, a bar that just serves water, rather than alcoholic drinks or juice - is a potentially legitimate topic, and it makes sense for a dab page <i>if</i> this article is ever going to exist. However, as it doesn't (as yet), there's no need for the dab page and it might as well be deleted. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 18:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>merge</b> per Otto. Googling "water bar" trail (which gives hits only for the phrase "water bar") yields est. 18,300 hits, and waterbar trail (which gives hits both for "water bar" and "waterbar") yields est. 27,200, so "waterbar" is (presumably) about twice as commonly used as the separate words and should probably be the final location of the merge. If someone does write about bars that serve water, that could go at Water bar, with a header at the top mentioning <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterbar.html" title="Waterbar">waterbars</a>; the extra overhead of a disambiguation page is unnecessary. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 23:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak Keep</b></s>. The cleanup exposed some things, such as that he has had a minor, but not trivial, role in a major US film, a fair number of German roles which sound reasonably impressive (I'm not a German acting buff, so open to changing opinion if someone more knowledgeable says that these roles are either very impressive or not impressive at all), and that the Marilyn Monroe expose has had some coverage - that adds up to a keep, weak only because of lack of German acting knowledge.

<li><s><b>Weak keep on condition that the Marilyn Monroe section is cut down + further referencing or removal of unsourced claims</b></s> Firstly, thanks again to Guinog and others for their efforts in revamping this article. I still think this article is problematic, but is a borderline keep needing better referencing - based on his TV acting career, and absolutely NOT on the Marilyn Monroe stuff.</li>

<dd>Many of the article's claims have yet to be referenced - his early purportedly "championship winning" skating career is unverified. His stage career is unverified (and we have little idea of what level he was acting at - key player or minor role). The claim that he was the lead in an award-winning short film is unverified -"Susanne Aernecke"+"Josephine" gets 9 google hits of which 2 are somewhat relevant (counting all the multi-language imdb hits as the same), neither of which confirm that the film won any recognition - its not even listed in Aernecke's IMDB profile<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=zS7&amp;q=josephine+%22Susanne+Aernecke%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. I can't find anything much with an alternate search using the film festival name either<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=otm&amp;q=%22hofer+filmtage%22+josephine&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> (24 hits for festival name + josephine + susanne; perhaps my German isn't good enough but I'm not seeing anything relevant here).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition there was some puffery-by-association over his film roles that I've now removed - his role in The Name of the Rose was a minor bit part as I pointed out in the first afd. Just because you've had a bit part in a movie with a Hollywood star (or in a German TV screenplay by a famous writer) doesn't confer encyclopedic notability by association.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that the database references used are reliable, I think being a non-bit part actor in a major-award winning TV film is arguably sufficient here (though we don't know the extent of his role). Though as far as I can tell by references/searfching, Fremde liebe Fremde won ONE Grimmie not multiple and that was for its lead actress. Other awards went to the cinematographer, director, writer (again, the problematic notability-by-association puffery issue). I'm going to make adjustments accordingly</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the Marilyn Monroe business is not significant encyclopedically (there is no evidence even that he is an especially important collector, or that this legal case is especially significant, plus Wikipedia is not news report archive), and is at best a cut-down trivia section - otherwise there are undue weight issues which verge upon <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">WP:SOAPBOX</a> misuse of Wikipedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Growing up in Germany and holding German citizenship helps a bit with the TV expertise, but I commend you for not trusting me on this. I have no credibility that would be sufficient for a Wikipedia entry, which is why I searched for reviews of his performances. The shows and movies he lists are amply covered on the web, so his roles are certainly verifiable. Do they give him notability? I don't think so, unless I read some review that actually comments on his acting. On the MM scandal, I only glanced them over and watched the KCAL clip, but in what way do those clips differ from interviewing the next-door neighbor of a shooting victim at the scene of a crime in your local 9 o'clock news? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:59, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(unindent)We are not assessing the article as originally written by the subject. We are assessing an article which is the result of a standard editing process by other editors, including myself, none of which, to my knowledge, had any acquaintanceship with Mark Bellinghaus beforehand, so there is no COI. As far as I know, none of these editors has any personal investment, or any particular interest, in Marilyn Monroe memorabilia (I certainly don't), so the accusation of soapbox is equally misplaced, as is the suggestion of a campaign by a single purpose editor. These are simply <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herrings</a>. It is not an argument for deletion to single out the least important roles. These are there to flesh out the picture, and could for that matter be left out with no great detriment. It would be more useful to have proper observations on the more important (and referenced) roles, for example, <i>In 1991 he played actress Meret Becker's brother Kurti, in the multiple award-winning Fremde, liebe Fremde (Foreigner, Dear Foreigner). In 1993, he played Malte Borrell in the TV show SOKO 5113. He played Knut Sonntag in the hit TV show Immer wieder Sonntag, written by Herbert Lichtenfeld.</i> There does not seem to be a refutation of their worth, only that no reviewer noticed them (or at least no reviews are quoted, which is a different matter), but they are referenced, which is the wiki requirement. There is no wiki stipulation that reviews per se are mandatory. Regarding the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> flags {{Template:fact}}, these are specifically for information which "is not doubtful"; I see no reason, from observing the original editor's general behaviour, not to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> that they are true, unless anyone can point me to evidence that indicates differently. The MM clips and quotes differ from a next door neighbour, because the latter is interviewed as a bystander (i.e. it could be anyone), whereas Bellinghaus is interviewed purposefully because he is considered by those media to have something of particular significance to contribute through his prior learning and knowledge. I consider that I and other editors on this article have followed the guidelines properly and not thrown them anywhere. At the moment there are two reactions to the two parts of the article: 1) the Monroe is the important part 2) the acting is the important part. I suggest that, taken together, they delineate an individual who is not major, but who is of note, i.e. "notable". <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's a nice (in both senses of the word) lateral approach, but of course has to remain hypothetical and has not (yet at least) been incorporated into the guidelines. I'm particularly interested in the less mainstream aspects of culture and society, as I find they're a valuable aspect of the whole and think there should be a place for them in wiki, provided a degree of notability is credible. I've speedy-deleted plenty of "non-notable" articles which are commonplace — mostly subject-created — but occasionally one seems worth bothering with, despite its genesis and even its initial state. I have enjoyed and found my knowledge enriched by articles of this nature, some of which might well not have been started without their self-author, but would certainly (as in this case) not had any chance of being kept had independent editors not found them worthwhile. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment from Mark Bellinghaus</b> For anyone interested, Mark has left me a lengthy argument for keeping this article on my talk page (he mistakenly addresses me as Brad Patrick, the Legal Counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation, presumably because he saw the link I have to a Brad's anti-spam message on my userpage). As the argument is lengthy, I think it best that interested persons should look at it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bwithh#Your_contribution_to_Mark_Bellinghaus_page" rel="nofollow">my talk page here</a>, rather me pasting here. If it is preferred that it is pasted here, please go ahead and do so. Note that I have previously emphasized to Mark that 1) this is a community discussion 2) he is welcome to join in 3)it is not my sole decision whether to keep this article or not or whether to cut down the Monroe section in a kept article or not. As Mark's message is intended to persuade people to keep this article based on what he views as the importance of the Monroe controversy, I am bringing it to the attention of the afd discussion group here. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>sidenote</b> Mark has pointed out to me that there are other unreliable blog-based sources in the article (in the Monroe section) - I agree with him on this - such as the "Citizen Media" link - (I did not <i>add</i> these links however, as he thinks). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 11:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I added the Citizen Media link, and it doesn't look like a blog by the classic definitions. It claims to be a New Mexico news and education group, has multiple articles on different subjects, and the writing reads like it's written by someone who knows a few things about journalism, and is trying to appear balanced. Anyway, even not counting The Citizen, that leaves the Long Beach Press Telegram, KCAL, and two from the Los Angeles Independent, which would be all right sources for the controversy and subsequent lawsuit, but aren't really about Bellinghaus per se - they don't say much about him, they're really about the exhibit. Trialsanderrors writes the German roles aren't much. So I'll change my opinion to delete on an article about Bellinghaus, and a weak vote for rewriting about the controversy - weak, because I've had enough and am not going to do it if no one else will. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:09, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have strong doubts the LA Weekly has the editorial oversight in place to comment on Bellinghaus's acting career in Germany or even his status among MMM collectors, which moves the source into <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="WP:V">dubious reliability</a> territory in my book.

<li>I'm not happy with the overly chatty details and NPOV of the article either.

<p>This is an unsourced one sentence stub (since August 2005)related to sea level and global temperature. Very few Google hits which are not ambiguous or mirrors of this Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I will write two short articles, one for geology, and one for biology, although I'll probably change the name for the geology one to Thermal maximum. I ordered the main source for Quaternary climate change use, have a couple of articles that discuss the Late Jurassic/Cretaceous thermal maximum without using the word, and can write that one in the next day or two, and have retrieved a couple of biological articles, and will get that up. Wouldn't hurt for folks to drop in on them and copyedit, although I <i>generally</i> spell check. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 15:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Uh, thermal optima are well-studied phenomena of the biological and geological/climatic sciences. Obviously the article is a piece of crap, and maybe it's not on the web, but here are some articles, abstracts and pages about it that are not google mirrors--did anyone search a scientific database or scholar? The definition is completely wrong. In biology the term is used in introductory textbooks, it's not even particularly technical, it just refers to the maximum temperatures for biological processes that an organism can withstand. Redirecting it to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocene_climatic_optimum.html" title="Holocene climatic optimum">Holocene climatic optimum</a> is akin to redirecting <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a> to <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Wisconsin_%28BB-64%29_a60f.html" title="USS Wisconsin (BB-64)">USS Wisconsin (BB-64)</a>. <a href="http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C6063%5Carticles%5C4932%5CLWJDJCFP68GT98CE.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C6063%5Carticles%5C4932%5CLWJDJCFP68GT98CE.pdf" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, <a href="http://www.gi.ee/~veski/10616.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gi.ee/~veski/10616.pdf" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2002.tb00902.x" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2002.tb00902.x" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> (biology), <a href="http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=4669050&amp;q=&amp;uid=789176956&amp;setcookie=yes" class="external autonumber" title="http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=4669050&amp;q=&amp;uid=789176956&amp;setcookie=yes" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=4320210&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=4320210&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://heronpublishing.com/tree/summaries/volume23/a23-1031.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://heronpublishing.com/tree/summaries/volume23/a23-1031.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12970841&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=12970841&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://www.proteinscience.org/cgi/reprint/10/9/1887" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.proteinscience.org/cgi/reprint/10/9/1887" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=485151" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=485151" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=JPEWBUVDEDB38LFV9TH2V1437D4Q75MA&amp;ID=40530" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=JPEWBUVDEDB38LFV9TH2V1437D4Q75MA&amp;ID=40530" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, <a href="http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/4/780" class="external autonumber" title="http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/4/780" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>, <a href="http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053160048" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053160048" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>You are welcome to fix the article. Sounds like Thermal Optimum could be a good article if fully rewritten. Out of curiosity, do your sources support the claims of temp and sea level for the specific period cited&#160;? I could not get all your cites to open , but the biology ones belong in a separate article. The first few do not appear to give the sealevel claims now in the article. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Oh, the article's totally wrong so I couldn't even figure out what they were talking about. I can disambiguate it later, but I just changed it. I'm slow at research and only wrote a bit, as I am not the least bit fond of writing articles without sources. I will read what I can today and change it again tomorrow. I included some abstracts, but if you're interested in any of the pdfs that you couldn't get to open I can e-mail you saved copies, they're just stuff I got off a friend's computer on Quaternary climate change. Although my background is in geology, all I've really read about it are studies on those organisms that live in tidepools that Darwin wrote about, lizards that lose their tails, and amphibians. It is, however, a well known topic in the sciences, and Wikipedia has tens of thousands of articles on less important topics. It must be made usable, and probably disambiguated into two articles, but it shouldn't be deleted. I will fix as much as I can in the next few days and add sources, then research it a bit more carefully. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is useful as it as , and will be the gateway to the more detailed articles expected. The terminology and the concept have been common for decades. There will certainly be sources, and notability is undoubted.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think I would rather just delete it right now, then I can put up the biology and the geology/climatology articles and make this page a redirect. I'm a bit uncomfortable putting anything on Wikipedia without research, and I just haven't done any. DGG is correct, though, there is no way this topic can fail notability. I would feel better deleting for now, posting the contents to my talk page, then I'll get a new article up as soon as I get my resources. The library sent me the wrong IPCC text today, so it will be a bit longer. But, do not delete for failure of notability and its lack of direct connection to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocene_climatic_optimum.html" title="Holocene climatic optimum">Holocene climatic optimum</a> and its Japanese resources--Japanese and Arab researchers do a lot of research in this area, as well as American and European (predominantly French in the latter). <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I tried a few of the links and some of them linked to the related area of a city, some to a disambig (one of which didn't include the shopping mall as a choice) and I found one which linked to an actual shopping mall (which is probably suitable for deletion). I don't think this list serves a purpose, it redlinks to a lot of articles most of which shouldn't be made, and provides almost no information other than the name.

<p>I'm nominating flarbenslarb for deletion because I'm pretty sure it's a hoax. I had previously prodded it, but the creator removed the tag and added a link to a page which contains nothing other than the same one line of text. Flarbenslarb gets 0 Google hits, and the page says it's a <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian.html" title="Hawaiian">Hawaiian</a> fruit, which seems pretty unlikely with a name that's full of letters that don't exist in Hawaiian. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinball22_a948.html" title="User:Pinball22">Pinball22</a> 18:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Notability of the family seems to be limited from what I could find in searching a bit. Most of the content should probably be moved to a Benjamin Goriely article stub, at most. Bigger problem is also that the creator's username suggests a serious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> violation. Either <b>rename and stubify</b> or <b>delete</b> without prejudice for recreation by a neutral source (but I still hesitate to think a family article is necessary if specific family members meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> then they can have their own articles). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 18:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The topic of CIA prison aircraft has been active in public debate for the past few years so it is a notable topic. The article includes two independent references from major media outlets (i.e. not fringe media prone to hyperbole) to a CIA aircraft with this tail number and the articles allege use as a CIA prison aircraft. Perhaps the term "rumored" should be changed to "alleged" to provide a more professional tone. <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpolk_d8a6.html" title="User:Epolk">Epolk</a> 19:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> If it is about that aircraft, that's where it belongs. This is not clutter. That's like saying, "Don't include anything but acting/technical information in an article about <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, make it all its own article."

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Uhh, why? Shouldn't the focus be less about the model of the aircraft and more about the subject of contention, which in this case is the alleged act of transporting prisoners? Why should your average reader care about the <i>type</i> or <i>registration</i> of the aircraft involved? They're more interested in what is occurring and why. Let's put it this way. If it were a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-700</a>, an <i>extremely</i> common aircraft, do you think this content would then belong in the article for that type? It would quickly get booted out for distracting from the core subject. Why should a small article about the Learjet 35 be any different? The answer to a weak article is not to lump it into another only passingly-related article. I suggest this article be given a proper name related to the act of rendition, and beefed up with proper sources. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 00:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> But that appears to be what the article is about the rumor of the type of airplane. If it's a <i>rumor</i> about Angelina Jolie, does it get its own article? No, it's in <i>her</i> article, although if it is a big rumor or hoax that gains serious notoriety it may get its own article in addition to being mentioned in hers. This is <i>what</i> the rumor is about, the type of aircraft. It may not be as common as a 737, but Learjet 35s <i>are</i> rather common aircraft. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I think you misunderstand...the rumor isn't about the <i>type</i> of aircraft, it's about one specific aircraft, one of hundreds of Lear 35s. There are not hundreds of Angelinas, just one. And, most importantly, rumor goes against the verifiability that's the core of Wikipedia. That having been said, some aircraft model articles have a "trivia" section, and maybe a one or two sentence summary of this article in the Lear 35 article (or instead of "trivia", maybe under the heading of "specific aircraft of note"?), with this article then becoming a redirect is a compromise that can be lived with. Thoughts Joseph? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 02:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Yes, it is certainly trivial, and I do understand, or had thought that it was about one particular plane that happens to be a Learjet 35. The rumor is tied directly to Angelina, one single actress, which is why I switched from battleships as analogies, because I couldn't remember the correct title for a particular one, and this rumor is tied directly to <i>a</i> Learjet 35. Yes, a trivia section or specific aircraft or note or some such is appropriate with a redirect--but, in this case, if and only if it is correctly sourced. Without sources, delete. Rumors do get articles on Wikipedia, if they are of note, just like nonexistent animals (<a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptozoology.html" title="Cryptozoology">Cryptozoology</a>) and scientific hoaxes (<a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_man.html" title="Piltdown man">Piltdown man</a>). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> (<a href="../../../k/p/_/User_talk%7EKP_Botany_1d80.html" title="User talk:KP Botany">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KP_Botany_6fca.html" title="Special:Contributions/KP Botany">contribs</a>) 02:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - In response to all the above, including several suggestions for an article on and listing rendition aircraft, I have created just such an article, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendition_aircraft.html" title="Rendition aircraft">Rendition aircraft</a>, which includes the info from the individual aircraft articles Joseph identified (these have then been merged and redirected). In doing so, I tried to cull out all the rumors. Where I could, I documented with references to verifiable media articles. Where I couldn't, but where the information seemed like it might be important, I added {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags. I will leave these in place for a while, allowing other editors the opportunity to help cite the statements. Eventually, if no citations are generated, I will then go back though and deleted the uncited information in accordance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I have also included the appropriate info from the N221SG article, and if this AfD does not result in deletion, I strongly suggest that it be redirected to the Rendition aircraft article. In doing this, I hope I have satisified everyone's concerns about not having unverified information and rumor in the encyclopedia, while still providing users with valuable information.

<dd>No darts, you seem to have actually read what people wrote here, considered it, and related it to the articles of concern and Wikipedia policies and the value of an article--I'm not even going to check the article you created as I might have a heart attack from the shock.

The intro says "people related to the subject of quackery or anti-quackery," so if you go the their article and it doesn't say they are ANTI-quackery, then Wikipedia is calling them a quack for their scientific, medical or nutritional claims, which is libel per se and clearly violates our policy on defamatory statements, at least for those who are still living. Note that this is often a more libellous claim than is explicitly made in the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> is there a policy for including local air dates for every single country in the world where it is broadcast? Further, is there any way to verify this information? I just don't see what it adds to the article. The information is not on localized versions (beyond what it is called in each country, and there's questions about that too), it's just the network and an incomplete listing of unreferenced dates. The Simpsons reference provided contains information about each country, not just an airdate, and the Rome article is not about the debut of the series in other countries (barring Britain), it's about the airdates of individual episodes. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 12:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> says "Lists with International broadcasting information, or syndication information is often not desired here", where "here" is the introductory paragraph, implying that such lists are appropriate elsewhere, though the project page doesn't mention it again. Clearly, including such information is the de facto standard, which is why I'd like to expand this discussion.
<dl>
<dd>"elsewhere" is not specified, but I read <a href="../../../t/v/_/WP%7ETV_d668.html" title="WP:TV">WP:TV</a> to mean [not within project TV/wikipedia].

<dd>Usually, what happens with these things is the network advertises the series on TV, so a local viewer comes to Wikipedia and adds the information. Theoretically, it's verifiable in the sense that if you lived in that country, you could turn on your TV and see the ads for yourself. (See <a href="../../../w/e/e/Talk%7EWeeds_%28TV_series%29_b3c9.html#Broadcasters" title="Talk:Weeds (TV series)">Talk:Weeds (TV series)#Broadcasters</a> as an example.) Beyond that, the networks frequently do publish schedules and occaisionally announce the premiere of a big show via a press release, so we could simply enforce a higher standard of verifiability if that's the problem.</dd>
<dd>The Simpsons page is slightly better, in that it does go into detail in some instances, but the only part that's sourced is the Spanish version and most of the countries don't have any more information than would fit in a table. (eg. <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_of_The_Simpsons_e34f.html#Broadcasting" title="Broadcasting of The Simpsons">Broadcasting of The Simpsons#Broadcasting</a>) If the prose is preferrable to the table format, we could start migrating them to a longer format. (See also <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Smallville_broadcasters_and_home_video_releases_8abf.html" title="List of Smallville broadcasters and home video releases">List of Smallville broadcasters and home video releases</a>.)</dd>
<dd>As for Rome, I guess you didn't see it, but the main article does have the international broadcast information, including the dates of the series premiere and first season conclusion. (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome_%28TV_series%29_81a4.html#Broadcasting" title="Rome (TV series)">Rome (TV series)#Broadcasting</a>) The only thing it doesn't have is the local name, presumably because it's simply "Rome" in the local language. For some series, the name of the show doesn't translate that easily, so the show may go by completely different names. (Smallville is "Young Superman" in Japan and House is apparently known as "God of Medicine" in Hong Kong.) Including the local name in such cases is important because viewers might otherwise think that the shows are different. Not that it's important in every case, but putting it in a table format means you need to have the name for all of them. <font color="#F06A0F">–</font><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><span style="border:1px solid #F06A0F;background:white;color:#F06A0F">&#160;Þ&#160;</span></a> 21:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>May I personally say that this article is entirely truthful once some editing has been made. There has indeed a sport been invented called Arcade Tennis by myself and my friend and is now played by other people in the communityand we feel it has the ability to grow increasingly. I feel that my friend has maybe added some statements in the article which I have highlighted and deleted accordingly. We feel that this new article may help Arcade Tennis gain a bigger following and even without this page the sports members are increasing. I feel very disappointed by this remark made and want to assure you that it is entirely truthful and authentic.User:Greg=Liamfrason</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Even if everything in the article is factual, there is no independent source to verify this, which is essential to a Wikipedia article. Furthermore, I show no evidence that a sport as you describe is played anywhere else, and even if it is growing in your community, it needs to be recognized by mainstream sources before it could be included here. My apologies for sounding harsh, but I see this every single day here. If you would like to discuss this with me further, please take it to my talk page so as not to clutter this discussion. <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrshawk_a0ba.html" title="User:Skrshawk"><span style="color:green"><b>skrshawk</b></span></a> ( <a href="../../../s/k/r/User_talk%7ESkrshawk_c0ff.html" title="User talk:Skrshawk"><span style="color:purple">Talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skrshawk_7816.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skrshawk"><span style="color:purple">Contribs</span></a> ) 21:53, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested proposed deletion. Original prod reasoning: <s>This person is almost certainly not notable enough under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to merit inclusion.</s> <i>The only assertion to notability is directing <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_of_War_%28video_game%29_cb4f.html" title="God of War (video game)">God of War</a>, and that is pretty weak.</i> The log indicates this has been speedied three times, but not for any reason that would justify speedying it again as reposted content.<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 20:54, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It would be better to mention the tram lines in an article on the cities they serve, and link to the official website to allow readers to see a transit map and check hours of service and frequency.

<li>This would probably add only one or two sentences. Unless you are able to expand these articles into at least a good-sized paragraph, into a justifiable stub, I think the status of a former railway station or even terminal would not be enough to save from deletion. And as most of the nominated articles are a cut-and-paste of: <i>"<b>Tram stop name</b> is a tram stop in [location]. It was opened in 1999 and is situated on Midland Metro Line 1."</i>, it is better to recreate the articles into something worth reading than to keep these uninspiring single-sentence statements. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 02:33, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> simply being on a former heavy rail line does not make them worth keeping. There is still little that can be expanded upon <i>about the tram stop as is</i>. Again, citing Sheffield articles, the tram stops on former heavy rail are not listed, but the old stations are (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attercliffe_Station_3e5d.html" title="Attercliffe Station">Attercliffe Station</a> for example). Is this a better possibility? It would only need a rail enthusiast or two to create easily expandable stubs. please also see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_St_Paul%27s_tram_stop_%282nd_nomination%29_43e4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/St Paul's tram stop (2nd nomination)">this</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner"><b><font color="red">L.J.Skinner</font></b></a><sub><a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner"><font color="green"><i>WOT?</i></font></a></sub>|<sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_lewisskinner_f7ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/lewisskinner"><font color="blue"><i>CONTRIBS</i></font></a></sup> 02:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's nothing indiscriminate about having articles concerning all stations of a specific railway system. That's an objective criterion, and the information within directly concerns the matter at hand. I'm also concerned that the nominator is on some kind of deletionist crusade.

<li>I hope you are referring to L.J.Skinner, the original prodder of these articles, not me. I am the nominator of this AfD, and <i>I</i> didn't say the articles are indiscriminate. I am part of a <a href="../../../n/y/c/WP%7ENYCPT_908e.html" title="WP:NYCPT">transportation WikiProject</a> and have created articles about railway stations myself. Whenever I do, however, I try not to create such articles containing one sentence only, as is the case with most of these articles (especially the ones closer to Wolverhampton). I have no problem with expansion and recreation. Although I could, I would prefer to leave that task to somebody who is more familiar with the area. I said I was partial to a merge/redirect, and that may now be my preference in light of all the discussion. Finally, I don't say "delete" in many articles, certainly rarely (if ever) in transportation articles, and I don't have the inclination to target articles that may violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as some other users do. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 23:36, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>re comment</b> I really don't have strong feelings toward this article and my opinion would change of course in case no serious sources are brought. I just believe that this article should never be a list. I totally agree w/ you in that if it is kept as a list it would be biased but i am supporting it as an article; a discussion on how Islam regards cults. Mainstream Islam classifies many other <i>beliefs/sects/doctrines</i> as cults and that is a fact and we should only bring sourced facts like who says X is a cult and why. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 12:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>re comment</b> No credible sources describing <i>Islamic cults</i> have been brought forward, instead this article has expanded chaotically and is now labelling significant historical Muslim communities as <i>cults</i>. Even when viewed against developments in the Islamic world, this article goes against the Muslim spirit of respect, moderation and rational dialogue. By contrast, recent endeavours among Muslim authorities of all interpretations have been aimed at increasing mutual respect.</dd>

It brought together scholars, leading authorities and representatives from eight Shia and Sunni schools of thought (Madhahib): Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi‘i, Hanbali, Ja‘fari, Zaydi, Ibadi and Thahiri (each of the so-called <i>cults</i> on this page typically adheres to one of these schools).

<dd>In Islam there is no concept of a <i>cult</i>; it is a term borrowed from western, orientalist lexicon. Its application in the context of Muslim communities is tantamount to an accusation of appostacy. By its nature, this article will sew discord and disagreement and undermines the building of mutual respect between communities. It neccessarily promotes fictitious propaganda issued by people without authority or standing, because those who do have legitimate authoity in the Muslim world are committed to reaffirming respect and setting aside disagreement (as noted above).</dd>

<dd>From a wikipedia standpoint, this all boils down to three things:
<ol>
<li>This article contains <b>no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a></b> (and one would be hard pressed to find any), and the claims asserted by this article are <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">not verifiable</a></b>;</li>
<li>The title and very nature of this article <b>precludes a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a></b>. It is a <b><a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a> of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a></b>;</li>
<li>The article inherently engages in inventing or asserting new information (<b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></b>) by its declaration of the existance <i>Islamic cults</i>, which have no basis in the history or traditions of Islam; and by unilaterally applying the term to any group the editors wish to malign. Currently, the article appears to condemn the entire <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> community as a cult (see the main article under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_Cults&amp;oldid=99941680#Jaffri" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islamic_Cults&amp;oldid=99941680#Jaffri" rel="nofollow">Jaffri</a>).

<dd>Thanks for this comment; it helps to illustrate that there is unity within the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. When I saw this article &amp; afd, I expected that the article will contain a list of Islamic groups that are not listed on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. A closer inspection shows that Islamic Cults is a bad start at that. However, a quick comparison of the two articles shows that many of the "groups" on Islamic Cults are not found on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Assassins_ede3.html" title="The Assassins">The Assassins</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahabi.html" title="Wahabi">Wahabi</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haruriyya.html" title="Haruriyya">Haruriyya</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zindikites.html" title="Zindikites">Zindikites</a> ... to list a few that WP has real articles about). Are any of these likely to be added to <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>? If so, I think a quick <b>merge</b> is in order, and then the Islamic Cults article can be deleted. Of those I have listed, which are not candidates for the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article; what would you call those "groups" that fall outside of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>?

<dd>Your suggestion is well-intentioned, but a careful examination of the groups that you mentioned reveals that many are pejorative names of groups that are already listed in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>. For example, <i>Assassins</i> or <i>Hashshashin</i> are pejorative references to the 12th century <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Ismailiyah" title="Divisions of Islam">Ismailis</a>, and the <i>Wahabi</i> prefer the term <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Salafism" title="Divisions of Islam">Salafi</a>. Both groups are already listed in the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article - it is quite comprehensive.

<dd>Actually the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> article already addresses this. It includes an <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Other_sects" title="Divisions of Islam">Other Sects</a> section describing those that consider themselves to be Muslim but are not recognized as such by the mainstream, and a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html#Related_Faiths" title="Divisions of Islam">Related Faiths</a> section of groups who do not consider themselves to be Muslim, but who have a historic connection with Islam.

<dd>This still doesnt address the perceived gap I am talking about. If <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> is to be NPOV, it should be possible to reach all sects from it. The more direct the link the better IMO; I cant find a link between <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizari.html" title="Nizari">Nizari</a> (or many of the other groups I've run into over the last hour of research). The problem is that there is bound to be some Islamic groups that are not "sects" (i.e. they are radical deviations from "core" values) and as such I doubt belong on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a> -- however they are often notable (similar to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html" title="Branch Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_groups_referred_to_as_cults.html" title="List of groups referred to as cults">List of groups referred to as cults</a>) -- personally I think a list of these groups would be a good idea, as it draws a line between Islam and those groups, with intelligent explanations of why they are a "cult". That new page can then be added to the <i>See also</i> section of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divisions_of_Islam_db8c.html" title="Divisions of Islam">Divisions of Islam</a>, and watched like a hawk to ensure it stays in reasonable shape. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 01:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The difficulty here is that there are attempts by individuals to invent groups, make baseless claims about their beliefs and practices, then assign their invented moniker to communities practicing valid, historic interpretations. It generates propaganda, confusion and mistrust. These groups are further maligned through labels such as <i>cult</i>, <i>apostate</i> etc in an attempt to narrow the historic pluralism of Islamic interpretation.</dd>
<dd>Radicalism is the antithesis of Islam and has nothing to do with it as a religion. Of course there are radical political movements that seek to use religion as a vehicle; however, this phenomenon is not exclusive to Islam. And unlike Christianity where there is a clear separation between Church and State, Islam does not traditionally make such a distinction; so it becomes difficult to distingish a radical religious movement from a political one.</dd>
<dd>So the dilema: is it possible to create a credible article, with reliable sources, a neutral point of view, and free of pejorative monikers and invented <i>sects</i>, that justly situates certain groups outside the boundaries of mainstream Islam? Given the fluid, pluralist and inclusive nature of Islam and its history, I think that would be very difficult. If we refer back to the <a href="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr07062005.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.jordanembassyus.org/new/pr/pr07062005.shtml" rel="nofollow">statement of the International Islamic Conference</a>, it is inclusive, affirming the fundamental beliefs of those who are Muslim.

<dd><b>Comment</b> John Vendenberg's hope for an "Islamic" term that could be used instead of "cult" strikes at the very heart of the matter of why this article must be deleted permanently. There is no word in Islamic languages that adequately translates as "cult." The reasons for this are many, one of which is historical. Unlike in Christianity, which had a central church to define an "orthodoxy," there is no such institution in Islam. While there have always been very vigorous debates in the 1400 years of Muslim history over which interpretation of Islam is correct, the idea of "cults," in the negative English sense of that word, has not arisen. The terms commonly used to describe different groups within Islam (or even accused of deviating from Islam) include "hizb" (Arabic حزب), which generally falls much more within the realm of political parties; firqa (Arabic فرقة), which simply means division; tariqa (Arabic طريقة), which means "a path"; and al-milal wa'l-nihal (Arabic الملل والنحل), which basically means "communities and groups". None of these can be construed to mean "cult" in the sense that it's being used in this article. In fact, the Encyclopaedia of Islam (2nd ed, published by E.J. Brill), which is the standard scholarly reference work for subjects such as these, never uses the term "cult" in this sense in any of its thousands of articles dealing with Islam, nor is a single Arabic, Persian, Turkish or Urdu word in the extensive glossary of the Encyclopaedia of Islam translated to mean "cult" in this sense. The term simply does not exist in the major Islamic languages, and it carries cultural baggage in English that does not translate into the historical experience of the Muslim community. Dr. D. Gimaret, in his article on "al-milal wa'l-nihal" in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, even suggests that the word "heresy" is inappropriate, let alone "cult," and instead prefers to call this branch of religious polemics as "doxographical" rather than "heresiographical." In short, we cannot impose a category such as "cults" on Islam, when that category simply doesn't exist in Muslim works written in Islamic languages, any more than we can force Christianity to be studied in terms of Islamic concepts that may have no relevance to the Christian tradition. 74.12.145.234 21:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>* In todays world we in the United States see bombings between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq and than witness all kinds of individuals stating that they are the main stream Islam, while in fact Mainstream muslims who constitute over 99% of Islam in Shia and Sunnis but people dont know who to look at. In fact, if one is to look up the suicide bombers it is clear that most of them are members of a sect that follows extremist views such as going to heaven by killing innocent people, while vast majority of muslims are clearly opposed to this. In order to understand Islam and the mainstream Islam it is incumbent upon the editors to have these cults and sects in one section where it is all for see what these small sects really beliveve in. For instance, the Qadianis claim they have 200 million followers while in fact they have less than 10 million members, the Aga Khanis are less than 5 million members, the Nation of Islam maybe one half million, these sects are not mainstreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as in Christianity there are the cults such as David Koresh's Branch Dravidians, and the Chritian Identity up in Idaho, those cults do not represent mainstream Christianity, and these cults are listed separately. If one is to look up th Encyclopedia of American Religion, Fourth Edition by J. Gordon Melton, The Encylcopedia lists every single religion in America, including each of the cults mentioned in this article. Thus to delete this article would be unfair.</p>
<p>In fact it would be the same as deleting on the Nation of Islam article the critisms of Nation of Islam. In fact if one puts up anything in the Ismaili article the users who are followers of that particular brand of Islam call it vandalism, while in fact it is a viewpoint which is different than that held by the followers. In one instance a statement was added to the Wahabi sect and a user from Israel objected, eventhough, I doubt very much that Israelis have a very deep understanding of Wahabis, the user called it vandalism, while in truth and fact the United States Government and in particulara the FBI has stated that Wahabis are extremists and that the 9/11 hijackers were all wahabis and that Osama Bin Ladin proclaims himself to be a Wahabi, but the reference was deleted as being untrue and as vandalism.</p>
<p>Here if one is to listen to the argument put forward by the adherents of the view that Islam is a pluralistic religion and all are accepted, than we would not be witnessing over 90 dead bodies in Iraq everyday. In fact my own nephew who was with the 4ID in Iraq was a victim of the cultish violence, in fact he won a purple heart for his bravery. We have to identify the cults in Islam so that the world can see that these cult followers even with their billions of dollars who have bought our Government in Washington, do not in fact represent Islam.</p>
<p>Obvioiusly, the Mormon cultist who was marying off 12 year old girls also did not consider himself to be a cultist. If only the viewpoint of the particular follower of the cult or sect are listed than Wikipedia cannot be called an Encyclopedia but rather a proponent of only the views of the sects or cults that want to propogate their own viewpoints.</p>
<p>I hope that the editors are mindful of the viewpoint that to make a complete encyclopedia all viewpoints must be published.</p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep</b> Exposing cults is not the point, the issue here is that both sides of an issue must be represented. Thus, if former members of certain cults believe that the subject cult is a cult who is a third party to say, therefore it should be included. Furthermore, like in the Hindu Cults in the US the former members did come forward, however the cult members tried to destry the former members. Look at the history of the Church of Scientology.

<dd>The notion of <i>cult</i> has its origins in Christanity, and the word and its connotations have evolved in the Western milieu. By contrast, the traditional languages of Islam do not have a word analogous to "cult". Islam is an inclusive tradition, and has evolved multiple schools of interpretation, each distinct but mutually respectful of one another. This pluralism, which is central to the Muslim ethos, is founded on the Qur'anic injunction, and provides no basis for the notion of <i>cult</i> in an Islamic context.

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. For whatever it's worth, the raw numbers are 6-5 in favor of Keep. There was one suggestion to Merge with the disambiguation page, but disambiguation pages are supposed to be as spare as practicable. Clearly there is more here than can be contained in either a disambiguation page or in a Wiktionary dictionary definition. It seems a little fishy to me to have an article on a term, and I don't know if we want to go down that road for very many words, but there are a few words that merit it, I guess. I think the Delete arguments are cogent and strong, but I don't see them as strong <i>enough</i> to gain the article's deletion. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cross between a disambig (which already exists at Evolution (disambiguation)) and a dicdef - or more accurately, a bundle of dicdefs. No sense in having this "article" at all, as it reproduces the content and use of the disambig page, less well. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 21:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> (or more like a question): Can this material be moved to the diambiguation page? Or is it the wrong format? Can it be merged with something? I personally have used this article a couple of times and I admit I was a bit surprised to find two sort of disambiguation pages (<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_%28term%29.html" title="Evolution (term)">Evolution (term)</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Evolution (disambiguation)">Evolution (disambiguation)</a>) It would be helpful to have them all on one. I also am a big fan of etymology, which really is not an encyclopedia function but more of a dictionary function I admit. But I still like etymologies. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is already on the Disambig page, without the brief summary statements - and there is a great deal more on the disambig page which is not here. The "groupings" of use are presented here in text, with a link to one article. On the disambig page, the "groupings" are presented by actual groupings within subsections, with links to all articles within the group. So while the explanatory text on this page might be interesting, the links presented are woefully incomplete and may give the reader the false impression that the term which <i>is</i> linked is the only example. In that sense, this page is inaccurate. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 10:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's also piffle. Additionally, Filll speaks of etymologies, but nowhere in the article is there a classical etymological example. Such an example would be thus:
<dl>

<dd>Perhaps. But what you are really refering to is semantics, not etymology. An etymology merely gives the source of the word tracing it through its "evolution", may offer cognates from other languages, and, if possible will go back to the probable <a href="../../../p/i/e/PIE_6ab0.html" title="PIE">PIE</a> root. The differences of the senses of words is part of the study of semantics. Thus, what you really love is <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semantics.html" title="Semantics">semantics</a>.</dd>

<dd>Note that I intentionally left out the cognates so as to not clutter the etymology. Had I decided to do a full-blown etymology, one which you would still find lacking, it would have looked as such:
<dl>
<dd><i>evolvere</i> to roll out, unroll &lt; <i>e (ex)</i> out + <i>volvere</i> to roll, turn, cognate of Gr <i>ειλυειν", to roll up &lt; PIE</i> *wel- <i>, to roll, to turn &gt; PIE</i> *welg <i>&gt; OE</i> wealcan <i>&gt; ME</i> walk<i>, cognate to Ger</i> walken<i>, Frankish</i> *walken<i>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>However, were I to do a semantic matrix, it would be much larger tracing the uses of the Latin word, as well as an similar processes among the cognates. However, in order to do so, I would, if I were to do it professionally, have to load it with semantic and linguistic terms that would likely make the matrix less graspable by a layperson than desired. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 13:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>expand</b>. A dab page is limited to providing links to other articles and very brief, non-paragraph descriptions. <i>Evolution</i> is a sufficiently important, and sufficially complicated and multi-faceted, word to merit a distinct article. This could prove to be an exceedingly valuable page if we start using it to present the many different definitions of "evolution" not only in different scientific fields or colloquial contexts, but also as it's understood differently by, for example, various creationists. We lack a page for exploring the ambiguity and conflict over how to define <i>evolution</i> in various contexts, and this could easily serve that role. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 11:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. The only new ingredient in this article that does not appear in the (much more comprehensive) disambiguation page is the etymology.

The reason I support the deletion of such an article is that defining "evolution" is either a task for disambiguation or it is a game meant to promote confusion (especially problematic as a creationist POV-pushing device). For what it's worth, evolution as a "term" doesn't really exist. It is a concept with a very vague definition (change over time). Much of the content of the article is not explanatory or, worse, an original amalgamation of ideas that stray very close to creationist pandering. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 15:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Defining 'evolution' is either a task for disambiguation or it is a game meant to promote confusion"? Um... wrong. <i>Amazingly</i> wrong. Defining "evolution" is the only way to <i>avoid</i> confusion, and is the primary means of preventing it on every site that seeks to avoid ambiguity, including TalkOrigins. It is because creationists commonly leave evolution <i>undefined</i> that it is so difficult to point out the simple error in their usage of the word, and that allows them to easily equivocate between different definitions of "evolution". Any general-use text on evolution, including Wikipedia, must define evolution in order to be meaningful and comprehensible, and the importance and complexity of the term is sufficient to merit an article discussing it (heck, TalkOrigins has spent many <i>pages</i> discussing it, and to <i>enormous</i> benefit for improving clarity and avoiding confusion there), rather than a dab page (dab pages aren't in article-space anyway, and should not be relied on to present highly important information where alternatives are available). Explaining the definitions of evolution in different contexts is not "creationist pandering", and this accusation is not only absurd, but also <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a> and a failure to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. If the article contents need clarification, then improve them; don't delete an important and noteworthy topic, thus giving the creationists exactly what they want. For someone who is so passionately opposed to creationism, why are you so eager to promote bias and ambiguity in Wikipedia that only <i>helps</i> creationists? It is bizarre. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 18:14, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Look at the associated defining evolution section on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>. Contrary to what you are saying, creationists spend much of their time trying to "define" away evolution so they can bask in the glory of their arguments. "Macroevolution" vs. "microevolution" in particular is a term creationists love to bandy-about in their definitional and operational soccer games: it leads to such arguments as from whence evolution "philosophically derives" to absurdities like insisting that Christians can only believe in evolution that removed information rather than adds information. This is a creationist exercise, it is under the purview of their gaming. As I see it, defining evolution is a task that really can only be accomplished well through disambiguation, otherwise we will end up with a host of NPOV, verifiability, and reliable source problems, especially considering such points as "word ownership" and "neologisms". --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 16:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> Delete</b> As hoax, "Liberty City Revenge" weighs in with a whopping 0 google hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Liberty+City+Revenge%22+&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Liberty+City+Revenge%22+&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>.

<p>This is a procedural relist of an article whose second afd was closed as it had been created by a banned user (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criterion 'G5' of our criteria for speedy deletion</a>). A decent proportion of the 'delete' opinions wern't by socks of the banned user and so I think it's worth a relist.</p>
<p>As there are so many views etc on there, I've temporarily restored the deleted AFD at User:Robdurbar/Wikipedia:Articles for deletion - Rec.sport.pro-wrestling (second nomination). That should allow users to refer to arguments or views expressed there. I'll delete that once this AFD is over.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The issue is one of notability. There is a usenet newsgroup about almost every subject, so Individual usenet newsgroups can't be regarded as notable unless there is something exceptional about them. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.folklore.urban.html" title="Alt.folklore.urban">Alt.folklore.urban</a> is a good example of a notable newsgroup; the dozens of alt.fan.* groups are a good example of why not all newsgroups are notable. In this case, does the article make a case for the notability of rec.sport.pro-wrestling independent of the notability of pro-wrestling? No, I'm afraid it doesn't. It is not exceptionally old, nor particularly high-traffic. Being quoted as a source for fan opinion makes it just that: a source, not an article of its own. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 18:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do find that it is neither exceptionally old nor high traffic. It was created in 1990. Usenet started in 1979, and many of the old "big 7" hierarchy groups date from the late 1980s. The number of posts is not exceptional. The group uk.politics.misc has approximately the same number of posts per month at the moment. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 20:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So what you are saying is because the group wasn't created in 1979 at the BIRTH of usenet then, in your opinion, its not old. So 17 years for a usenet group is not old. Ok...right. Well I am sorry, and I do respect your right to an opinion mind you, but that totally smacks of Internet elitism to me. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 22:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh dear, perhaps my meaning wasn't exactly clear. I'm considering whether this particular newsgroup can claim notability on grounds of age. It turns out to be 17 years old, which is no "spring chicken", but it's not an exceptional age for a big-7 usenet group (the great renaming happened in 1987). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 23:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is (apparently) the Danish team "Vestbjerg Vintage Idrætsforening" which also doubles as the "national team" of a fictional nation. It's not notable in either capacity, as far as I can tell. There's no substantial coverage about them in reliable independent sources, and judging from the article there seems to be little verifiable information about them at all. They also don't seem to play in any professional league. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, they argue that it's not notable because it does not meet the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guideline</a>, which states in pertinent part:

<dd><i>A topic is <b>notable</b> if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent of the subject itself</a> and each other.

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Which in the case of this team is very much not the case.

<dd>The issue is not whether they exist. The issue is whether they have enough <i>substantial</i> third party coverage to be notable.

<dd>I'd support this if this team would be representing a real country instead of a figment of the imagination - but in that case, we <i>would</i> have substantial third party coverage.

<li>There is every comparison. Sealand is definitely not accepted by the UK as a separate entity. This is not a national football team in any sense of the phrase. It is a non-notable Danish amateur team who have hitched themselves to a non-notable North Sea platform for the purposes of making a story. At least the Aland Islands have a permanent population and the people representing the team could have been born there or been resident for enough time to make themselves eligible. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 19:45, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice to re-creation. I strongly feel that the topic of this article is potentially notable: the area in question is indeed not the German land, but a purported non-independent nation occupying territory presently German. The NF-Board appears to encompass other, more well-known, quasi-nations such as Greenland and Chechnya, and the organisation seems to exist to provide a forum for the "national" football activities of such non-independent and unrecognised "nations". I imagine we would feel comfortable including an article on the Chechen national team, if it existed and had played "quasi-international" matches or local "friendlies", a criterion which has clearly been met here. I should note, btw, that <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> is wrong when he says the team has never played a match: matches appear to have been played: see the team's website. However, while the subject is borderline notable, I am still plumping for deletion in this case for one simple reason: inadequate references supporting notability, from sources other than the team's own website. ( My own suspicion is that the purported "nation" of South Lower Saxony will never exist, but that would be crystal-balling, so plays no part in my decision. ) <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:56, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
