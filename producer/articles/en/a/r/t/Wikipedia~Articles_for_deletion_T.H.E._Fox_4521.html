<li><b>Keep</b> This should <i>not</i> be moved to Comixpedia, though it should certainly have an entry there. It is exactly the sort of cultural history article that adds worth to Wikipedia. The comic ran to several hundred strips (I have almost 200 just from September 1987 to the end of 1989, and it reportedly ran for over twice that period). Characters from it appeared in the San Bernardino County Sun, TC-128 and Carousel News &amp; Trader (<a href="http://www.carousels.com/articles.php" class="external text" title="http://www.carousels.com/articles.php" rel="nofollow">originally</a> the Carousel Trader). At the time it was most active - before the web which the WP:WEB guidelines cover was even invented! - it was distributed on <a href="../../../c/o/m/CompuServe_944e.html" title="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Link_c93c.html" title="Quantum Link">Quantum Link</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/GEnie_e7c7.html" title="GEnie">GEnie</a>, three well-known early online service providers. It had a separate section on at least the last of these. The only reason we still have any of it now is that people thought the comic worthy enough to keep archives of it from over fifteen years ago. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 05:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To elaborate, I think the article really lacks references. However, it does seem to be a very early online comic, quite possibly the first, and that makes it notable. Furthermore, the nomination refers to websites, a historically later albeit related matter; my common sense tends towards keeping. Also, if Ekaitis’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1886249210" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1886249210" rel="nofollow">book</a> is/becomes notable enough, the whole thing could be merged in Joseph Ekaitis. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 19:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As the article stands, it's a clear delete, however, it looks like the article could be improved if GreenReaper can better track down sources. I'd be satisfied with 1) Keeping this with notability and unsourced concern templates for a few months and then revisiting the deletion issue if necessary, or 2) Deleting it without prejudice toward recreation, moving it to GreenReaper's user space so it can be improved, and then back to mainspace when it is more properly sourced. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree quite strongly with your assertion that it is a clear delete. If a topic is worthy (and being the first comic regularly distributed online plus having its own section in GEnie is sufficient for me) but the <i>article</i> is not good enough, that just means the article needs to be improved - which has been the case for just about all Wikipedia articles at some time or another. This one certainly <i>can</i> be improved, and I had intended to do so myself several months ago (that's why I took the time to convert all the images that I have from Commodore format) but managing WikiFur, writing up my reports on a few conventions and the imminent release of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> have intervened. The latter has not yet happened, which is why I'm still busy.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>I'm not really sure where you're coming from with "more properly sourced", either. An interview with the author taken at the time of the comic seem like a perfectly acceptable secondary source (the fact that the interview took place at all is also a measure of notability), and the comic strips and website are good examples of primary sources that can be used to confirm it. It would be nice to have specific references to confirm the specific claims about publication made in the interview. However, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that such information can be used as long as it is not contentious - and they're hardly claiming to have been published in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 19:41, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since when was a bulletin board a reliable source? Its essentially self-publishing, which is one under vanity-press. I realise you're not going to be able to come up with something from OUP, but come on, surely something notable can do better than a BBS. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 00:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I know, that was pretty much the best there was online at the time, aside from <a href="../../../n/s/f/NSFNet_e3ed.html" title="NSFNet">NSFNet</a> . . . and yes, I'd love to have more offline coverage, but it's hard to see who outside their community would have covered one guy "uploading" comics to an esoteric, mostly text-based service that <i>maybe</i> one in a thousand North Americans knew existed at the time. It took twenty years for online content creators to be recognized by <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>. Ironically, given that BBS's <i>were</i> community-run, the closest equivalent nowadays would probably be an interview by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a>.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Another confirmation of material mentioned in the interview - Spiffy Spring Special '95 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.info/msg/8c42013c5b53f4ad?dmode=source" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.info/msg/8c42013c5b53f4ad?dmode=source" rel="nofollow">is mentioned</a> in a rec.arts.comics.info post, and T.H.E. FOX is listed as one of the comics featured within it. I haven't seen any further mentions of the comic, though the publisher has a few other publications that are available online at Mile High Comics. Note that the comic is not notable because it was particularly <b>good</b> (it's certainly funny, but Joe was not a professional artist at the time, and it is clearly outclassed in technical quality by more recent work), but because it is the first that we can confirm as being regularly distributed online. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 04:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you have no proof that it was the <i>first</i>. No independent investigation or reliable sources which state it as such. A Wikinews interview would have the same problem. I realise we aren't going to have a published peer-review scientific or historical paper on the likely "first online distributed webcomic". But something independently verified and published by a reputable publisher or collator of cartoons (perhaps a large comic book house) should be possible. The problem is that esoteric here means obscure, and obscure for webcomics generally means non-notable. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 12:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
