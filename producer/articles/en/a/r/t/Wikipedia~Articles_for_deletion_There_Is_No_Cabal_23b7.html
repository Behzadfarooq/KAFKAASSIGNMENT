<p>Neologism, the jargon file website while it defines that the term is used on usenet, the rest of the article is complete <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. There is no basis given in that source for how the term is used, what is meant by its use, or why it is used. The article puts forth unsourced theories and draws unsourced conclusions, all of which is original research. I'm not arguing the notability of the statement. If you want to argue for keep, please address the points raised, this is a debate for concensus, not a vote. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 14:54, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article definitely needs to be rewritten, ideally with some sources - I won't argue with that. Also, discussion of power structures in Usenet are not appropriate to that article.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - It needs to be sourced a little better. As of right now, it's an OR dicdef. It's obviously notable and I don't like the idea of deleting it considering that it is referenced so often in Wikipedia discussions. Also, the self-reference doesn't seem appropriate here. When it's something like <a href="../../../r/f/a/RFA_09f8.html" title="RFA">RFA</a> or <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a> that is obviously fundamental to Wikipedia and soemthing a newbie would search for, having heard the name, but not knowing about namespaces, the self-reference needs to be there - but this one is an inside joke and really not appropriate for a SR. Personally, I think the article needs to be rewritten substantially ... but deletion doesn't seem necessary. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:58, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I've never heard this statement before and reading this article hasn't exactly helped me. Is it a statement used by members of the cabal? Is it a statement that implies in actuality just what it says, that a cabal does not exist? Do people really use it, or is it just some Internet message board people? Unless this can be unambiguous and sourced, this is useless, and I'm not seeing much potential for development. If someone rewrites it to address this stuff I'll reconsider.

<dd>Again, this isn't on notability and whether it exists, its about the fact that other than its existence the rest of the article is unsourced and a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:04, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google groups can't be used as sources, the Jargon file only sources its existence and The words of wisdom page linking to it is of no concern. How about some valid ones that actually address the problems with the article? The fact that nonthing outside its existence is sourcable?

<dl>
<dd>Did you follow the link in Jargon File to "Backbone Cabal"? I've also added the original FAQ from alt.conspiracy.usenet-cabal that addressed the issue- and while postings from Google Groups are unacceptable as reliable sources for matters not directly related to Usenet, they are a reliable primary source for matters related to usenet itself. There are enough sources to meet WP:V; everything else is context for interwiki links. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 00:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>faqs from newsgroups are again not usable sources. Usenet posts are NEVER usable as primary or secondary sources on usenet. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">WP:V#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29</a> points to this <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Using_online_and_self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Using_online_and_self-published_sources</a> which clearly states: "<b>Posts to bulletin boards and Usenet, wikis or messages left on blogs, are never acceptable as primary or secondary sources</b>" That doesn't say "unless you're talking about usenet".--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:00, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>the backbone cabal link is pretty meaningless since the it says "This phrase did not come into existence until after the cabal dispearsed" and the backbone page makes no reference to the phrase.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:03, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>and since there are no credible sources outside the mention in the Jargon File, everyone claiming how notable it is should really reconsider that. I believe this falls under only being notable to a limited a group, as in those within a small circle of all the people who used usenet, and not so notable that the only attention its received outside the usenet circle is a small mention in a dictionary style book.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 01:27, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Notability has been stipulated to not be in question. So the term exists. As I understand the argument of the nom as of now, (it seems to have shifted around a bit, I can't quite tell though) the contention is that the article is bad, and that no one has fixed it since it has existed, and that it's not sourced. The nom seems to have a strenuous objection (near as I can tell) to the use of the Jargon Dictionary. The JD is a published and purchasable work with an ISBN, which is itself highly notable and has existed for a very long time relative to most internet things, by a notable author who many recognise as an expert in this area of culture. I think the objection to the JD as a source is therefore clearly unfounded. I think the article itself could stand improvement but is already sourced and cited adequately enough as of this moment. I think the suggestion that this article is OR is spurious. <b>Strong keep</b>. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 12:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>actually I've addressed the Jargon dictionary being a source, its only a source for an explanation of TINC and absolutely nothing else in the article. The rest of the article is unsourced OR, and once thats removed all you're left with is "TINC = There is no Cabal and this was used on usenet" and that in no way qualifies for an article.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 13:17, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Actually", you <i>haven't</i> addressed the issue to my satisfaction. There is lots of info out there on this term. Reasserting that it's OR doesn't make it so. Feel free to remove material you clearly feel is unsourced though, and justify your work on the talk page for each removal. No change in my view that this is a strong keep and that there is a lot of spuriousness in the nomination. And no, I'm not in any cabals, to the best of my knowledge, well, except <a href="../../../r/o/u/WP%7EROUGE_ace2.html" title="WP:ROUGE">that one</a> I guess. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 13:36, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Bear in mind that the linked "backbone cabal" article in the Jargon Dictionary contains more information on TINC. Calling the rest of it OR only works if you discount the official FAQ as being of dubious source, which is an unnecessarily strict reading of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_archive1_7649.html#Bulletin_boards" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources/archive1">this</a> discussion in the WP:RS archives- especially since the authorship of the FAQ never came under challenge from the author, who was <a href="http://www.cosc.iup.edu/deb/spring96.html#InitiativesandResponses" class="external text" title="http://www.cosc.iup.edu/deb/spring96.html#InitiativesandResponses" rel="nofollow">intimately involved</a> in Usenet at the time. As for the unrelated assertion that the term is defunct Usenet trivia, a quick scan of the talk and Wikipedia namespaces should be enough to permanently disabuse anyone of that notion. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 13:39, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given the source, the contemporaneous references and the publications I'd call this reliable enough. Plus, there is apparently no dispute that the phrase exists, has existed for a long time, and that this is the most common explanation of its origins; I'm not sure what needs to change here. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 15:42, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Precisely. Usenet was full of nerds, and the nerds propagated the TINC meme. And the mem crossed from Usenet to Wikipedia, and has been around for over twenty years. I'd say that was pretty good grounds for assuming it has legs... <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 19:21, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and in editing it, there would be nothing left, other than whats covered in the Jargon file. Which would be about 2 lines and doesn't qualify for an article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I obviously believe TINC, although apparently that does not count for much (I stopped keeping track of such things when I got booted out of TC 8 or 9 years ago). I'd go into the whole spiel about "There is No Documentation" or "There is No References" but Dave Hayes might crawl out of hiding. And, the irony of deleting the "There is No Cabal" page knows no bounds.... --Mschnierle 06:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The topic is verifiable in that it exists, and since you want to bring up noteworthyness, please provide some credible citations to support that comment. If you read above, I mentioned that once all the non-verifiable information is removed, you're left with only a line or two and its not worth its own article. In addition this article has been here a long time, and its been in the unsourced, original research state that it is now for about the same amount of time. If no one wants to maintain it and bring it up to wikipedia standards why keep it? Maybe to save time we should just create one-line stub articles on every notable topic and piece of information on the planet and hope someone comes around and actually turns them into something worthy? There is no credible source for this outside the jargon file. That speaks to its notability and to th expandability of the article. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:15, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That'd be a great Idea! We could maybe then have people slowly adding to those, slowly refining it. We could even put them on one of those new fangled things called a "wiki". It'd work great!

<li>HA! I was going to say "Gosh, what next? Are we going to call this usenetcruft?" . But someone actually came in and said that. TINC is relevant to wikipedia in many ways.
