<p>The second vote should be reopened, rather than starting a third one. Starting a third vote puts the delete side at a disadvantage, in effect rewarding Cyde's inappropriate closure on the last vote-- a kind of move that typically gets people de-sysopped if someone wants to make an issue out of it. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 08:36, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I apologise if you thought that was the case - My only intention is to try and douse the fiery flames, and clear up the mess where possible for this entire fisaco so that a fresh, proper discussion on this article can go ahead. - <i>Best regards</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 10:49, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. Would you be able to copy the votes from the second thread and paste them onto the third? Or contact the people who chimed in on the second but have not posted a response in the third? <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:04, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it would be better to do neither. There is already a dispute on the "vote-stacking and canvassing" itself that caused the mess at the previous AfD, and surely none of us want to see this repeat itself. Furthermore this AfD will go through its full 120-hours voting period, so those who are really interested in this article should have done so by then. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 11:11, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because of the dispute, I asked <i>you</i> to do it. If you are contacting people on the strick criterion of having chimed in on the last AfD thread, no one would question your motive. You'd clearly be acting as an admin taking care of a 'housekeeping' matter and only 'housekeeping.' Cyde abused his admin powers and disrupted the last vote. Someone should clean up the mess. You're the best person for the job since (as far as I know at the moment), you're not associated with either the "keep" or "delete" camps. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 11:19, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's a fair point, however why don't we wait 24-48 hours and then check the votes against each other. If there is a gap we can discuss it then.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also think it was a mistake to discard the previous AfD and start over from scratch; that's not something that should be done so lightly. It's an inconvenience to everyone who took the time to vote the first time around, since it forces them to stop by and vote again, and it doesn't actually help with the issue at hand, since everyone who was informed of the AfD still remains aware of it (the vote, so to speak, remains 'stacked.') I can understand the urge to get involved and try to solve problems when you see a big argument on AfD, but as I see it, two successive admins have now gotten involved and, through their efforts, managed to turn what should have been a minor disruption into a major one. This sort of thing <i>does</i> happen fairly often; closing admins should be able to handle it without freaking out and cancelling the vote twice in succession. Remember, there are always people willing to disrupt things for kicks; all this tells them is that disrupting an AfD to the point where it gets discarded is dead easy. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 13:09, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A quick look at what links to the AfD shows that 70.84.56.166 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.84.56.166.html" title="User talk:70.84.56.166">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.84.56.166_2d25.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.84.56.166">contribs</a>) has been vote stacking.

<dd>This can't be entirely accurate. I got spammed and I had not voted in any of the previous AFDs, although I did vote (and no more) on the review. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 14:11, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah, I got a message on my talk page as well. I'm guessing it's because I voted delete on the most recent (prematurely closed) AfD. I'm not a big fan of such things, but does it violate policy? In any case, this makes me think twice about contributing this time, and ironically makes me less likely to "help" the person who put the message on my talk page in the first place. Whereas I would have run into this new AfD eventually (I do a bunch of AfD stuff) and would have voted for sure then. Hm, this is a quandary. But like I said, I still don't know whether I should contribute to this AfD given the vote-stacking that is going on. At the end of the day, what <i>is</i> the policy about this kind of thing?!?--<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 15:31, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just coincidentally I found a case of "vote stacking" in another AfD today. It was only 4 users, not 20 plus, but is this a new prinicple or what? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:06, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think vote stacking implies a sizable number of notifications such as in this case (33). 4 seems pretty harmless. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Graham_a3b5.html" title="User:William Graham">waffle&#160;iron</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Graham_e6a3.html" title="User talk:William Graham">talk</a></sup> 16:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems we're making "vote stacking" the new <i>crime de jour</i> at Wikipedia. Speaking for myself, I was alerted to this vote, but am quite capable of applying my own understanding to an issue. Some of us try to avoid aggravating ourselves by watching articles where we know a core of editors stand ready to advance their views and harass into silence though who disagree. I am grateful to those who alert me to important debates on subject of interest. Some people (especially the anti-Bush POV warriors) watch Bush articles like hawks, trying to advance a highly POV political agenda that is inappropriate to an encyclopedia in which Jimbo (for one) has declared that NPOV to be a "non-negotiable" Wikipedia policy. How dare you people who are raving about "meatpuppetry" imply that I or any other regular editor is a pawn of people you disagree with? I am more than disturbed by the attempts to stifle opposition and judge and throw out Wikipedians' opinions under the new rubric of "vote stacking." -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> 16:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering that the vote was restarted, being notified of a new vote is a courtesy. Also, I don't think the evidence that the IP was merecat is very compelling.

<ul>
<li><b>Likely</b> than the Anon Texan and merecat are the same user. It's patently obvious that merecat is evading his block to spam talk pages (including mine, damn it all). Based on talk page evidence, I wouldn't disagree that they're tied to BigDaddy777, but we don't have records going back to October. [edit] Actually, I'm not sure about the BigDaddy connection. But he and the Anon Texan are definitely the same user. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 11:31, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's a <i>discussion</i>, as opposed to a vote. The best argument (grounded in WP policy) carries the day, not the "side" with the most "votes". As I said, your opinion will be considered, whether or not you register an account. Practically speaking, more people are likely to take ideas seriously from a registered account than from an IP, which is unfortunate, but there you go. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 19:31, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>IP addresses are actually less private than usernames. Usernames can only be examined by a checkuser procedure at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> which has very strict rules to prevent abuse and only a few high-level admins have that access. The IP address will give us your internet provider and in some cases your city. I don't know what #64 is getting at; I think he assumes that since your IP address and a known address used by <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">User:Rex071404</a> have the same first octal (216) you must be getting service from the same company and therefore you could be Rex is disguise. But I think that is incorrect as the two numbers actually belong to different ISPs and the fact that the first digit it the same means nothing. (In fact, 64 is also the first number of an ISP in Canada that has a lot of sockpuppets attacking articles on Candian politics). Yes, #64 is an AOL user and I would greatly prefer if he/she would log in so I know who I am talking to. Regarding registration, if this debate is the only reason you are here it probably won't matter since decisions are made on the basis of community consensus (not exactly a democracy and not exactly voting) and people who come here for a single issue are not usually viewed as contributing to the community consensus. If you plan to stick around and edit more articles that interest you then you should certainly register. It will make more more private and it will associate you with your edit history which (as long as you are not disruptive in some way) will add to your credibility over time. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 20:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thatcher, your information is interesting. I think that 64 has an axe to grind or is a sockpuppet. I made one or two edits to the article (after voting) and they were basically immediately reverted by <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">User:Nescio</a>, that's how I go interested here. Are Nescio and Prometheus in league with each other? PPan has been spamming the talk page and nescio has been owning the article. Plus, by y count nescio made 5 or 6 reverts to the subject article today ("Rationales"). I'm suprised none of you have noticed <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.239.38.136.html" title="User:216.239.38.136">216.239.38.136</a></p>

<li>no, it means google only has a half dozen proxies that it uses for cellphone based browsing, and they're probably more overpacked than AOL servers, btw changing your ip to look that close to mine, only proves that you're deliberately selecting a specific ip, which only goes to show that thatcher hit the nail on the head here, this <i>is</i> pointless and confusing, bye bye--<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.8.html" title="User:64.12.116.8">64.12.116.8</a> 20:55, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

But what I do know (if we take what you say at face value) is: a) you are highly skilled at tracking other users, b) you are highly knowledgeable about how to mask your true ID by using (as you said) a "proxy". Frankly, I seriously doubt the truth of what you say here. What I think is that you are a sleeper-sock for one of warring sides in this dispute and you are going around stoking controversy and making accusations and complaints so as to derail this AfD.

However, I am still incensed by the fact that these people who are voting are showing total ignorance regarding the facts and the references that are available via ACTUALLY BOTHERING TO READ THE RELEVANT ARTICLE AND ITS DISCUSSION PAGE. In addition, Nescios rfc against merecat, and my arbitration case against merecat seem highly relevant. Why is nobody listening to me when i provide rational and logical argument? Merecat is now proving the hard way that merecat is willing to violate any rules, and play the game any way that it takes to WIN. Working with merecat is a COMBAT experience, and, this VFD is just an extension of that. If people actually bothered to take complaints made by both me and nescio regarding merecat seriously, all of this would be reduced to noise A WEEK AGO. Instead, what we have is an on going combat game of the system, with the highest level of the game intereferance being votes, allready stacked even for just this last and latest vfd. Cyde closed the second VFD for good cause. Anybody who is paying attention, and not acting from bias, would see immediately that that entire vfd was yet another TRICK, used by a pov pusher. A pov pusher who is willing to cheat the consensus process by selecting a mob of people from his own camp to come vote. A pov pusher whos accomplice makes unfounded attacks of the ad hominem sort versus nescio; IN the VFDs OPENING paragraph. (Too which nescio responded, rightly, that was a VILE thing to do.) The VFD was a blatant pov bias from square one. But still, the process continues, pushed on by vote stacking and ignorance. I'm now going to quit this rant, and go collect assorted proofs that voters haven't even bothered to read the relevant materials. I hope that the sanity around here does extend far enough into some sort of actual logic that such proofs impeach a current vote. (My assumption being that they would be allowed to revote if they could bother to proove the second time that they had actually read the article and its talk page.)

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC) One afternoon, i stopped by wikipedia for a short browse, and discovered one merecat. Slyly using ad hominem attacks and straw man arguments and fallacious reasoning and beating Nescio over the head with outrageous and mean behavior. I took pity on Nescio, and have decided that this constitutes my first reality test of wikipedia. Please note that I HAVE NEVER PERSONALLY TOUCHED THE ARTICLE. Please note that I HAVE ONLY BUZZED AROUND ON TALK PAGES.</p>
<p>Nescios articel IS Factual. Nescios Article did have the rough beginings to start the Defense Echo. Nescio WAS working to improve the article, and was trying to get others involved in making thearticle more NPOV. Nescio Tirelessly put up with extravigant abuse, and consistantly moved to compromise. Nobody stood behind him, and attacks against him and his argument from others other than merecat were frequent. Merecat ran around in circles stirring up as many people as possible. Nescio did his job and defended his turf. He identified a factual topic worthy and noteworthy enough to be tackled by an article, and he wrote the article.</p>
<p>Nescios article never claimed to be finished. Both nescio and myself seem to still believe that the defense echo has yet to be forthcoming. Until that echo arrives, the article IS biased because it lacks its balancing MPOV anchor.</p>
<p>I have looked at every mention of a rule at the rule page. People keep citing me rules and i go look at them and they aren't what people think they are. The rule most often cited is easilly dismissed as a confusion between soap box and movement. A movement is no longer a soap box.</p>
<p>I say the article is Biased as it stands because it is. I say, fix the article, and quit rigging the system and the game with blatant pack psychology mob warfare. I say that all as a sociologist and an aspie. I know mob psychology when i see it.</p>
<p>I also know formal logic. Nobody has given a cogent reason why the article should be deleted. Bias as it exists is not grounds for deletion. All of Nescios sources and references are factually in order. WE even let the name be changed, no real resistance AT ALL. We compromise. The other side takes advantage and breaks the rules. <b>I fight because Nescio faces a wrong mob otherwise alone.</b></p>
<p>As far as the issue of whether or not we are "in league." I consider myself Nescios defender. He himself has hardly if ever adressed me. I have come to believe he may even resent my take on the best courses of action, or some of my tactics. If it is an issue, the fact is, I act Alone. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 22:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Knock it off, Prometheuspan. Remember the policy <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>; to suggest that any person only voted the way they did because of a talk page message is to attack their character and integrity. I don't think Mackensen (a former arbitrator) voted delete on the second AfD because of Merecat's spam attack, do you? Further, I have found other instances of "vote stacking" (involving far fewer than 30-plus messages) on other Afd debates. If you want to set up a witchhunt be my guest but you better check all the AfDs and get all of the "vote stackers." And don't forget to discount all the votes Nescio recruited to AfD2 that are repeated on Afd3, they're no good either, right? Make your case for the article if you can; wikilawyering and attacking the process is the fallback position for people who are losing their argument. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:33, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Although experience tells me <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratio.html" title="Ratio">ratio</a> has left the building, and I therefore will not comment on this AFD again, your misrepresentation warrants an apology from you. Clearly I responded to several editors trying to stack the vote on the 2nd AFD. Although apparently not good, my actions are not equal to those that started the rigging of this AFD. And to assert I even did that on this 3rd AFD, while it was Merecat evading his block using sockpuppets, is ludicrous. It would be great if you retract that incorrect allegation.<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 00:43, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>You recruited voters to your side for Afd2. I have no problem with advocacy (in moderation), and I firmly disagree with the admins who think that blocking on an unwritten policy without warning first was the right way to do business. Prometheuspan took it upon himself to declare that Strothra's vote should be impeached because Merecat solicited him. Surely if Strothra's vote is invalid then so are the votes of the people you solicited, and even though you solicited them for Afd2, their votes should not count in Afd3 either, unless we grant that every voter was completely unaware of the closing controversy and came upon Afd3 as pure as a newborn lamb. I don't think you did anything wrong. I was simply pointing out to Prometheuspan that he was casting a very broad net. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:13, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please note that some of the citations you have made are not "legal efforts", those are petitions. Please read the articles you cite. States have no power to impeach. Citizens of individual states have the ability to push their legislators in Congress to begin impeachment hearings but have no authority to actually impeach. Impeachment is a matter undertaken at only the very highest federal levels of government in the legislative branch as a check on the power of the executive. You seem to never have even taken a grade school civics class. You should read a book on how the U.S. federal system works - it's a good thing for every citizen to have at least some familiarity with it. --Strothra 05:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>Yeah. Mirror mirror. Why don't you have a look at it yourself?</p>

<p>Also, please know that I am very intimately familiar with constitutional law. There are no "loopholes" in the U.S. Federal Constitution only interpretation. The U.S. Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of constitutional interpretation and has never interpreted the statute for impeachment to give any rights to states in that process because the states are already represented through their state congressmen in the legislative branch which handles the investigatory process. --Strothra 19:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

   Note that this article is not titled "Movement to impeach George W. Bush".

<p>Also, please stop posting after a long list of good arguments and saying that no-one has made a good argument against the article. Say that you disagree or that you think the arguments are wrong, but it will save us all a lot of trouble if we start listening to what each other is saying.</p>

"assuming bad faith" no, I am assuming good faith, and people like yourself are showing well why that is a fallacious assumption. "Arbitration against me." I welcome that, at least admins would actually be forced to listen to me instead of ignore me, and, it would proove one way or antoher whether or not I am facing a sane consensus process, or a pack psychology driven mad house. "Offensive to others" Good, I should be offensive to people who are voting with lies because they either haven't read the article, or are just habitual liars about things which are political. Lying without even realizing it isn't just pathetic, its not rational. And I am right to piont out that people who say that the article is a soap box, or that it comes from "leftists" are only using bogus and fallacious logic which in this case is not only merely propaganda and inertia, but factually untrue in this case with this article.</p>

<p>Thanks for providing the first potentially cogent Vote to Delete. If it is factually true that each of these rationales has individually its own article, and, if those articles can be reasonably linked to the "movement to impeach article" and if THAT was the proposed plan, I wouldn't be able to find serious fault with it. I wouldn't like it, but i wouldn't be able to raise caine about it in good consience either. The question becomes whether or not those other articles actually make the case that these are ratonales to impeach, and whether these articles actually cover well ALL of the assorted Rationales. The further issue is how the assorted Rationales form a network of proofs that the Admin is by far more sinister and evil than any admin we have ever had. How the proofs interelate and modify each other as a whole is an important issue here. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Except that the vote was closed for good reasons, not the least of which sould have been that the vote was opened with an ad hominem attack. And, more importantly, the factual process violations of merecat and bluegoose; who opened a vfd for political purposes after failing to shoot it down themselves personally. To call what occured a "vote" is to exagerate unfairly. What actually happened, and to some extent is still happening, is a pack psychology driven mob event, where people who haven't read the article and who have an agenda to simply deny the facts of the impeachment rationales are using vote stacking. Between those two problems, the fact was obvious that the vfd should be closed. Potentially, to be re-opened. But with RULES.

<li><b>Delete</b> Kotepho says above that "Cited sopaboxing by others" is allowed. I disagree. While I assume we have articles on white supremacy, anti-semitism, nazism, and so on, bringing together arguments from these diverse sources into an article Reasons why Jews secretly control the world would be unacceptable on so many grounds I can't list them all. This article is basically the same, starting with a book about impeachment and then piling on with everything that has happened in the last 6 years that is supposedly GWB's fault. The desires of some to see George Bush impeached are not a topic for an encylopedia entry unless they have some foundation in reality (and by this I mean the reality of the impeachment process, not the reality of having been stated in a quotable source). No one in the House of Representatives has even <i>proposed</i> a <i>draft</i> of Articles of Impeachment. Inclusion of particular topics as "rationales" is based on highly POV sources, and constitutes original research, crystal balling and soapboxing by the wikipedia editors involved.

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC) No, the article is a factual report about a noteworthy topic. Some of the references are suitably from reasonably neutral resources. The only reason why we don'thave better resources is that the dominant media is republican owned and controlled. Whether or not the house has drafted articles to impeach or not is in this case irrelevant. WE THE PEOPLE in the numbers of THOUSANDS and probably MILLIONS have indeed begun the process to impeach. And we are pretty determined about it. And the rationales to impeach are so airtight that you folks would rather have a political firestorm of a vfd than try to face making a simple defense. This isn't crytal balling, the movement is a fact and the rationales the movement use are a fact.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The title says it all. Fundamentally, this is essay material, not an encyclopedia entry. Essays may be well written, carefully argued or achieve notability, for instance, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s well-known <i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i>; however, essay material is not and can not ever be an encyclopedia entry. This is not fixable by changing the "real" title from <i>"Why George Bush should be impeached"</i> to <i>"Rationales for impeachment"</i> to <i>"Rationales provided by advocates for impeachment"</i> or any further levels of obfuscating indirection.</li>

<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC) Don't blame me, i thought the name change was silly. I let them do it to compromise. Fundamentally, this is a factual article written in neutral language which conforms to all of the rules, with the only possible exception being that it lacks a MPOV defense echo. Your attacks against the article are only attacks, and they are not grounded in anything more solid than your biases.</p>
<hr />
<p>Nor is it fixable by any amount of editing to couch everything in third-person phrasing. Nor is it fixable by providing more references</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC) Yes, it is fixable, and, more importantly, it really isn't even broken. It is an article written in WP format and by WP rules, it fits. If Millions of people start a movement to not elect Hillary, then that may become an equally noteworthy movmement. Until then, you logic is based on fallacious set theory. There is no solid link between your example and this article.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some editors are letting partisanship get the better of them and trying to tortuously construe some "Rationale for a 'Rationales for impeachment' article". The murky circumstances of the abrupt shutdown of the previous AfD and blocking of several editors were also very unhelpful. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:48, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some editors are letting partisanship get the better of them. However, those users are the ones who are voting to delete a perfectly good article generated in good faith on a noteworthy topic. Partisanship is certainly an issue here, but the partisan mob of republcians created by votestacking probably isn't what you had in mind. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b>. The inherent POV of this article is revealed both in its content and in the remarks of its advocates. Wikipedia is not a soapbox for people fishing for excuses to buttress their political point of view. Calling <b>any</b> article <b>Rationales for ...</b> brands it as not encyclopedic material. The various "rationales" are an appalling and often ignorant compendium of grievances against Bush which the articles' authors obvious <b>believe</b> (or wish) are impeachable offenses</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Thats three ad hominems. The article is in fact a factual article written in neutral language about a factual movement. It isn ot pov. What is pov are the votes around here. "Ignorant" is an ad hominem. And it isn't true. All of these rationales are well thought out and well researched by hundreds of persons. "Apalling" is an ad hominem. "Believe" is a third ad hominem, by way of attacking as if to invalidate the mental grounds of anybody who agrees with the rationales. In FACT all of these rationales are high crimes and misdemeanors. So who is ignorant? Projections. You project your ignorance against us. You project your beleif against us. And you project appalling against us. But all of those things are not true of us, and are factually true of you. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>without citing any legal justifications for the assertions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Are you an ignorant liar or an intentional liar? Several different legal resources have been cited, and, I will be happy to cite more legal references should that become important. Make up your mind whether this is to be more or less actual references. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheuspan_2707.html" title="User:Prometheuspan">Prometheuspan</a> 21:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can someone please point me to the rationalisation for the "delete and merge" determination for the third AfD? As I counted it, there were well over 40 "keeps", and around 100 "deletes". I don't see any indication of consensus (they're not even close to a supermajority) in those figures. — <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 04:58, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. If by "consensus" what is meant "no significant disagreement", then there is no consensus of any kind in this AfD. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosph</a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_Esperanza_2f72.html" title="User:Noosphere/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">re</a> 22:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are incorrect in your definition of "consensus". That is not the required threshold for deletion discussions. Please read (or reread) the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Guide to deletion</a> which discusses what we really mean by "rough consensus". On a technical note, JEREMY is also incorrect in his definition of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermajority.html" title="Supermajority">supermajority</a>. A supermajority is any pre-defined threshold greater than 50%. It can in theory be defined as low as 51% and is not uncommonly set at 55%, 60% or 66%. 66% is the threshold most commonly used in the US Senate, for example. 100 of 140 would be 71.4% <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 06:15, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, all <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a> does is point to the "Rough consensus" section of <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">WP:DGFA</a>, which says administrators must use their best judgement regarding when rough consensus has been reached, but doesn't actually say what rough consensus means.</dd>
