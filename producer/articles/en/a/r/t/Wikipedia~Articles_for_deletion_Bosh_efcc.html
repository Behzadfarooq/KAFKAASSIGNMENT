<li><b>Comment</b> Why oh why would you rather have the definition of a surname (this is an Encyclopedia, not a list of surnames) over the perfectly valid definition of <b>Bosh</b>, which is a widely used term and an integral part of modern British youth culture. I fear our identity is being repressed by people who would rather see the surname of an American basketball player over something they do not understand.Andy
<ul>
<li>It's not the definition of a surname. <i>That</i> is happily sitting in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bosh" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Bosh">Wiktionary:Bosh</a>. This form of article is a <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">name disambiguation</a></i>. It is a navigational aid, not a definition. People with the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">family name</a> Bosh can be commonly referred to by that family name alone. (e.g. "<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/pow_050110.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nba.com/news/pow_050110.html" rel="nofollow">Bosh, Bowen named players of the week</a>.") Name disambiguation articles list all of the encyclopaedia articles that would otherwise, because of that common form of reference, have a redirect from the family name. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:11, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The actual article as written, The rewrite is fine, but it completely ignores the original definition of BOSH (yes, definition, because a definition was clearly given), If is only as a supplementary aid,ok, but emphasis should be given to the word first defined and which created all this commotion in the first place, Isnt the main purpose of this Wikipedia to introduce readers to words and definitions they are not familiar with or have heard in passing and would like more information on?? I have personally seen the word in its original context and i live thousands of miles away from its birth place, I actually came to this Wikipedia to find out more about it and was satisfied with its definition, What are future readers going to do when the word goes global and a suitable and original definition is needed? Many words have started their careers this way, deleting it now would be the equivalent of deleting "cool" in the 1940 or "phat" in the 1990's, Sure there are other definitions for it and they may seem non-sensical to first readers, but they mean something to many and eventually will be vindicated. Not knowing the word is not a valid excuse to delete it, Now you know it, use it, live it and leave it alone, <b>MIMI13</b> (and no, im not a sockpuppet and yes, it is my first edit)

<li><b>keep</b>I fail to see how Chris Bosh has a greater right in an entry under bosh than "bosh" does. Sure he can have his own page and the two can co-exist. Its like saying 'bush' cannont deserve a definition because George Bush exists. Also you cannont label something a nonsence just because it is not used by your friends/community/town/nation, bosh exists FACT, it has a right to an explaination of its meaning, an explaination of its place in society and an explaination of its use FACT. Sure the definition is thin on the ground in places, but it will improve if we allow it to mature, by no removing it!!!

<li>In the rewritten version of the article, "bosh" <i>is</i> covered. It is covered by the link to <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonsense.html" title="Nonsense">nonsense</a>, because that is what bosh actually is. Yes, bosh exists. Indeed, as has been pointed out, it has existed for far longer than your article claimed. Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> policy.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. so basically, what Splash is saying is that since the word BOSH already existed before 2000 and is already someone's name, it cannot be possible that a new definition and/or another usage can emerge? maybe the article is nonsense to some people, it seems to me that is simply stating how and why and by whom did this new way of using the word first came to be. New words appear every day, some out of the blue with crazy spellings (D'oh!) , some are simply new twists on existent words (the word "brilliant" actually means reflector of light, and im sure those who refered as something good or amazing as "brilliant" in the early days were laughed at.). Both the surname and the original definition are valid of course, but as you said, this is not a dictionary, so the new usage of the word should be given a proper stage and see what happens. No one person has the right to delete the word because it seems "nonsense " to them and deprive the general public from seeing it. that is bordering censorship. <b>Mimi13</b>

<li><b>well said</b>, it belongs in a ancyclopedia, which is more adept at trying to explain the universal truth the word implies, is more than just a word, is an attitude, and to understand it one needs to see its origins and its developement.

<li>There is no "universal truth" to be explained here. Bosh is just a surname, some writings by Edward Lear, and nonsense — the items listed and linked to in the disambiguation. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:37, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>nonsense</b>. Bosh is a word used in the UK to mean "nonsense". It is regarded as excessively polite and upper-class, and so has dropped out of fashion quite a bit, but is still widely used, particularly in mocking upper-class accents and so forth. Bosch is a surname. Bosh should be <b>transwikied</b> to wiktionary, and the article should only <b>redirect</b> to Bosh the book by Lear. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 18:16, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
