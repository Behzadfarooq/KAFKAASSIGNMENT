<li><b>delete</b> and <b>comment</b> - I have read the article's history page. It was created today, nominated for speedy delete a couple hours later, the speedy delete was contested by the author who promised he would add references, and then brought here to Afd yet a few hours later. I find 0 ghits for the graphic novel "Donnie's Adventures" and 0 ghits for "octo-sloth", so I vote for delete. However, this has all been a bit rapid, hasn't it? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 22:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Okay, so this article was <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>. But this trend of nominating articles for deletion the same day of creation (in one instance that I have noted, a mere two minutes after creation) should be nipped in the bud. Another user (I can't remember who, now) commented that when articles are new is the time that users are able to catch them, before they get lost in the shuffle. I say, if you think an article isn't going to amount to much based on its first save, make a note of it on a list somewhere, and come back in a month. Don't nominate it for deletion because you're too lazy to come back later. . . . I mean no disrespect to the nominator in this particular discussion. I'm just feeling irritable about the trend. ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈♦тос♦ 04:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>As "fascist" is a pejorative term that no one uses to identify themselves, this list violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. In addition, some of the people listed here are still living, which violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, especially given that the entire list is unsourced. Perhaps this could be replaced by a List of historical fascists, as there were political parties and people 60+ years ago who did call themselves fascist. As it is, this list merely invites the constant adding of right wing politicians and others who various editors don't like. <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 00:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The word "fascist", applied strictly, can only be applied to members of the Italian party founded by Benito Mussolini.

<li>If there are a sizable number of people who honestly self-identify as an idiot or a bastard, and they are notable in relation to those things, then we <i>should</i> have those lists.

<li><b>Merge and Redirect</b> to list of historical (self-proclaimed) fascists per nom. This could be a useful page, but it has problems. As can be seen from the edit history, it's controversial. Fascism is pejorative in many cases and could be used for a sneaky Wiki-attack. Also, the definition of "fascist" on this page is too loose - if the subjects were self-proclaimed fascists, that would be fine, but some of those on the list could equally well be said to be far right-wing or Neo-Nazi; that's not the same as fascism.

<li><b>Keep</b> since the reasons for deletion are flawed in a few respects.
<ul>
<li>"As "fascist" is a pejorative term..." is an incorrect statement because the term is used simply as a descriptive term to describe a political ideology. There is an article on fascism used the way you consider it at <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascist (epithet)">Fascist (epithet)</a> but the list explicitly does not use that definition. Certainly, the original PNF were called, and called themselves, fascist but no one would say it is being used perjoratively. Any one adding someone who is not obviously a "fascist" ideologically (with references) is immediately reverted as the article's history shows.</li>
<li>"...that no one uses to identify themselves, this list violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>." this statement is incorrect since some people do refer to themselves as fascist or a related ideology (falange, national socialist, etc.). In fact, there was a recent Deletion review to allow the Category of Fascist Wikipedians to be re-created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_5" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_5" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for those who do self-identify sa a fascist.</li>
<li>"In addition, some of the people listed here are still living, which violates <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>". How so? If someone added George W. Bush to the list (and it stayed on it for more than a minute before being reverted) it would violate it but what about Pino Rauti? Some of the neo-Nazi's on the list could be argued I suppose but that is a separate issue that does not warrant deletion of the entire list especially since most people on the list are dead.</li>
<li>"...especially given that the entire list is unsourced." Actually, everyone of those figures does (well, should) have sources for them being a fascist in their own articles. To have the sources for everyone on the list page would clutter it up and is completely unnecessary. Do we have references for everything added to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Atari_7800_games_8b6f.html" title="List of Atari 7800 games">List of Atari 7800 games</a> on the page with the list? No, and, therefore, we do the same with this list. - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a> 01:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The introduction to the article claims not to use the term as an epithet, but the actual items on the list shows that it is being used that way. The problem stems from the way the word "fascist" is used in multiple ways, which could include anyone from WWII Italian fascists to modern Neo-Nazis and white supremacists to simply conservative right wing politicians. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_%28nationalist%29_1204.html" title="Don Black (nationalist)">Don Black (nationalist)</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>, for example. White supremacists and nationalists would generally claim not to be fascist, and being a white supremacist or nationalist does not imply one believes in dictatorship or totalitarianism. A few hundred years ago, most of the white population of the US held beliefs such that we would now consider them to be white supremacists; were they all fascists? The term "fascist" is too broad and too pejorative to make a List of fascists keepable. (And, not that this is reason to delete or keep, but your claims that any items on the list which aren't sourced are immediately removed is clearly not true, there are about 50 redlinks in the list, where are our sources on these? And most of the people on the list which we do have articles on, which I checked, I didn't see justification for calling them fascist) --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 03:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not due to the nom's reasoning, but because the subject of the list is a bit broad.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I can see the ideal usefulness of this list, I'm concerned that out of eight people who I picked off the list (most at random), <b>none</b> had the work "fascist" in their Wikipedia entries. In other words, if they were so self-identified, why isn't this mentioned in their articles? (And some articles were quite long with extensive sources.) Yes, they all shared <i>some</i> characteristics of fascist philosophy but, as far as I could see, fascist was being applied to them <i>externally</i> and as an epithet for their Neo-Nazi/authoritarian/anti-Semitic/racist/etc. beliefs. I'm not one to defend such people but if I got a 0 for 8 result, I have little trust in this list. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Pigman_7e6d.html" title="User:Paul Pigman"><b><font color="green">Pig</font></b><sup><font color="red">man</font></sup></a><sub><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Pigman_813e.html" title="User talk:Paul Pigman">dialogue</a></sub> 02:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> With a term that could be used pejoratively in the name of the article, we should be insisting on attribution with footnotes because the potential for libeling someone in an ugly way is enormous here, yet there is not one single footnote or reference of any kind in the article. Also, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> is a Hitler-loving racist according to the Wikipedia article on him, but I think it's inaccurate to call him a fascist in the terms of the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> article that was mentioned earlier in this discussion, because I don't think he adheres to all of the "integral" tenets mentioned in that definition (I don't think he's in "opposition to laissez-faire capitalism"). It does nobody any good to be inaccurate in identifying extremists. What we need are separate lists, with each item footnoted, and with a definition of the label at the top, including what criteria put people on the list or leave others off of it. Delete <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fascists_1eb2.html" title="List of Fascists">List of Fascists</a>, then let someone, if they want, start the whole thing over along the lines I described, because I think the current list is useless and unsalvageable. We should have a List of racial supremicists, List of Nazis, and List of Ku Klux Klan members to cover the extremists who don't fit in the Fascists list. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although many of the entries on the list should probably be taken away.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As creator of the article, I should point out the murder was hardly obscure as Dean Roberts, an underworld figure and a key associate of the Yardies, was one several killed in a particularly violent gang war. One could equally make the same comparison to any gangland killing in North America or elsewhere (see <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schuster_a7a4.html" title="Arnold Schuster">Arnold Schuster</a>). I've since added several additional sources in regards to his relationship to the Yardies as well as coverage of his unsoved murder. Also it was his death which would eventualy bring down Rickey Sweeny and the Yardie-affiliated Lock Street Crew during Operation Trident, which is certainly a notable event. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMax_566e.html" title="User:MadMax">MadMax</a> 02:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The gang war might be notable, but the gangland killing is certaintly not. Also, being a victim of a notable conflict does not always make the victim notable as well. While it does seem to be true that his death would later lead to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Trident_886e.html" title="Operation Trident">Operation Trident</a>, that—at most—merits a <b>redirect</b> or a <b>merge</b>, not a seperate article. --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 05:22, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have no opposition to merging the article to an article on the gangland killings themselves, however the article has yet to be created. While the notability of his criminal career is is question, it is specifically his unsolved murder which not only occurred during a major underworld gang war but would eventually be used to convicted several major Yardie gang leaders during Operation Tridant most notably the life imprisonment of Rickey Sweeney. This is supported by several news reports and articles which have been provided. As many murder victims and minor criminals are similarly covered on Wikipedia I don't see how this would be any different from North American organized crime and street gang related killings. His murder was highly publicized in Great Britain and was the subject of an extensive investigation by Scotland Yard. Should articles such as <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Boccia_7820.html" title="Ferdinand Boccia">Ferdinand Boccia</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cummiskey_565a.html" title="Eddie Cummiskey">Eddie Cummiskey</a> be deleted as well, simply because they criminal careers are deemed not notable enough despite the obvious effects of their murders&#160;?</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I did not know who the guy was before I stumbled on this discussion, but even the currently sloppy and poorly-sourced article, when combined with a basic Google search, is enough to convince me that Shannon is notable. Consider also that there is no direct relation between quantity of media coverage and notability. If much of this guy's career required him to operate out of the limelight, it is entirely plausible that he would generate far less media coverage than, say, a minor league baseball player, while his role in shaping the world we live in may have been far greater. I agree that irrelevant issues such as sock puppetry appear to be clouding the nominating editor's judgment. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 09:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Let me talk about this as someone who has been working fairly heavily on sourcing over the last couple of weeks. Much of Terry's work was done offline, in the pre-Google days. Sourcing that stuff requires research beyond 'Google it'. I have been to libraries and have been requesting paper copies of Terry's work, but as you may know if you have ever used a library, this stuff takes time to pull up and research, especially given that it is older stuff. Right now I have magazines and books en route to me to source more of this article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think anyone is debating notability any more - Terry's notability within the VAX/VMS community has been well established (fulfilling WP:BIO on the contribution to field criterion). If the debate is over the sourcing, it should be noticed that this, like every Wikipedia article, is a work in progress - if the problem is with sources, don't delete the article, contribute and help find the sources.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the article has been screwed up by the Wikipedia editing community. One cranky editor went through and added citation needed's to every sentence in the article. I went through and removed most of what couldn't physically be cited and added in sources for the rest. Now the editing community says that it lacks meat and has irrelevant sources. Unfortunately, this is what happens when you get over-enthusiastic (misguided?) editors with personal quests.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.Pinkboy 10:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Thanks, Pinkboy. Lack of notability seems like the only potential reason for deletion; I can't imagine that anybody would argue with your argument about poor sourcing <i>not</i> being a cause to delete the entire article. Put a {{unreferenced}} tag on it, and be done with it - is there still anyone around who would disagree with that resolution? -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 10:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, While I do not have the time at the moment to find all of the citations, there are many citations to Terry's work. Terry was a regular presenter on the US and international speaking circuit in Digital/Compaq/HP community. I believe that the back issues of his newsletter are available online. The copies of his presentations may have fallen offline due to the re-organization of DECUS as Encompass, and the dissolution of Interex.

<li><b>Keep</b>, basically, agreeing with Pinkboy. The additions to this article are excellent; there is no lack-of-references argument anymore. Most of Shannon's work was done pre-Web, with magazines that never got digitized, so it's understandable that 22-year-old gamers don't know who he was (which is all the more reason for keeping the article). To those of us with a lot of experience in the technology industry, T. Shannon was one of the movers and shakers, back in the day. That's all the "notable" we need.

<li><b>Keep</b> The "not notable" criticism is ludicrous and appears to be a dead issue. It appears that a consensus is building that more references (or "sources") should be added. Many references to document Shannon's contributions are available in print media only, and many of them are difficult to obtain, except from those who saved them from several years ago. Thus, they take more time to post here on Wikipedia. A request has gone out for old issues of Digital Review and other sources of articles written about Shannon. Harvard-style references to those will be added in due time. The Cape 23:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an important point. It is not easy to obtain a lot of Shannon's writing -- and articles in other tech journals from the same period that discuss Shannon and his work. So it's not that us oldsters are slacking off in our efforts to find more references; it's that many of them are difficult to obtain.<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfo%40kafalas.com_52e2.html" title="User:Info@kafalas.com">User:info@kafalas.com</a> 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- the article has improved since I previously nominated it for AfD in February, and one source has been put forth for the biographical info: "Graham, Lamar B. (1992) The Nerd Who Came In from the Cold, Boston Magazine, February 1992, 52-55, 90-91." If that citation can be confirmed as being <i>about</i> Shannon, and not merely mentioning him in passing, then he does fulfill WP:BIO. Finally, I would again caution those who take an antagonistically protectionist stance in regards to material that doesn't follow our policy, that Wikipedians tend to look disfavourably upon <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assumption of bad faith</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> says that the central criterion is that the band "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." The references sem to indicate that the band meets the criterion. Having only one full-length album is not a reason to exclude a band if it passes on other criteria, such as the multiple independent reliable non-trivial published works and the national tour. I would encourage people who consider that the band fails <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> to carefully re-read <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> which states, as do most other Wikipedia notability guidelines, that passing a single criterion is enough to establish notability, even if other criteria are not met. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 02:41, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Unencyclopedic and trivial, a list of film theme songs that happen to include the title of the film in them. No more notable than having a list of films that includes the main character in the title, or dozens of other potential film/song title lists. The article introduction makes little sense as well; <i>Musical film score is often employed in the production of a film, but there have been occasions where a song was written in reference to itself.</i> I don't believe any of the songs listed here were "written in reference to itself", they were written for the film they were included in, but that's quite different to a song that was genuinely written in reference to itself, for example "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_So_Vain_65d7.html" title="You're So Vain">You're So Vain</a>".

<dd>Original comment - There's something I don't understand here. If you do a Google on "Gita Saar" you will get a bunch of hits back that mix "Bhagavad Gita" with "Gita Saar". It appears that the "Gita Saar" is much akin to the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> or the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>. (Actually, it reads more like the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desiderata.html" title="Desiderata">Desiderata</a> to me but that's a digression.) So, contrary to what User:Anthony.Bradbury says, I think this article should be kept provided that it is agreed that the Gita Saar Gita is genuine and of the same notability as the Judeo-Christian texts that I provided for comparison. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 00:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

You certainly wouldn't want a list of "Actors who have played people named Bob" or "Actors who played government employees," but President of the U.S. is obviously more remarkable than that.

It's also discriminate, verifiable. Not a lot of movies actually have the president as a character, so it's not impossible to keep on top of. Frankly, this list would be a sound candidate for a featured list. And, although it's not a criteria for deletion, I'd propose that in the absence of sound criteria, editors should take into mind whether or not they're destroying the hard, well-intentioned work of other editors.

<p><b>Delete</b> - there is no possible objective definition of what makes for a "fat" actor. Especially in body-conscious Hollywood, what's "fat" there is healthy weight for height and age somewhere else. Being "fat" is not a permanent condition and actors frequently gain or lose weight to play parts. See for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_actors_who_gained_or_lost_weight_for_a_role.html" title="List of actors who gained or lost weight for a role">List of actors who gained or lost weight for a role</a>, none of whose gainers are listed as "fat actors," as an illustration of the subjective inclusion criteria of this list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well-referenced. And let's stop making pointless euphemisms here; the older actors would not have flinched at the word "fat", and modern ones tend to be playing the humorous part of "the fat guy" (or gal) - calling them "obese" is just confusing.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. I'm surprised someone has put this much effort into digging up sources for one of these lists. Anyway it really needs a new title as the current one implies something that the article is not. I disagree with Obesity in film as it's just a list of "fat man" character actors and not obesity in general. Obese actors in Hollywood suffers the same issues as the current title. The title needs to convey the fact that this is a list of character actors whose role is a fat person, but in a more succinct way. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please take a look at the article, its talk page, its numerous references, and its history before "voting" to keep or delete or rename. The primary reference is to "Warner Brothers' Fat men"<a href="http://www.danagioia.net/essays/efatmen.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.danagioia.net/essays/efatmen.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> by Dana Gioia from the book "O.K. You Mugs: Writers on Movie Actors." All names are referenced to sources such as that book about the character actor genre of the fat man. None are just someone's personal opinion that an actor needs to go on a diet, and there has not really been a problem with keeping such original research out of the article. The list has been stable for months. It does not include present day comedians who put on a fat suit to play a role, or who happen to put on a few pounds, but only those whose girth was their fortune. The men listed made their livelihood by working as a character actor in that genre. Most of the individuals are from the golden age of Hollywood, such as Sydney Greenstreet, who played "The Fat Man" in "The Maltese Falcon". He certainly did not play "The Obese Man." Likewise on the list is silent movie comic "Fatty Arbuckle" who we should not try to rename "Obese Arbuckle." I searched each name which I found on the original list in such databases as the New York Times to confirm in their obituaries that they were there referred to as "roly-poly character actor" or "rotund character actor" to conform to the definition made in "Warner Brothers Fat men." Disagreements should be dealt with by the normal editing process, not be eliminating a valid type of character actor from the golden age of movies. The nominator should also have notified me on my talk page since I am the principle contributor to the article with 49 edits, per [[WP:AFD}}. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:12, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> please note that the "essay" was a chapter in a published book, which should satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. The term used for the genre varied over the years. In the obituaries of many of these men or in reviews from the 40's they were often referred to as "rotund character actor" or "roly poly charactor actor" which seem more objectionable than "fat" but if the collective wisdom is to term the genre "obese" I could live with that. It was and is clearly treated as a genre like "leading man" in reviews and casting calls. At present it is still a genre. The IMDB bio of John Banner refers to him as "roly poly character actor" <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0052308/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0052308/bio" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Ditto for Buck Taylor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852076/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852076/bio" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Please check the references for documentation of references to all the names listed as "roly poly " or "rotund" character actors. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">Genre</a> means what you think it means. That a number of actors shared a physical <i>type</i> and as a result may have played similar <i>roles</i> in a number of films does not mean that a <i>genre</i> exists. There is no "fat man" film genre any more than there is a "scared Negro servant" genre or a "sultry French maid" genre or "stock character of your choice" genre. The actors on the played a wide variety of roles across a wide variety of genres, everything from menacing murderer to comedic foil to romantic lead, and they cannot be classified as "fat actors" on the basis of a genre that simply doesn't exist. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Grouping actors by physical type could serve a useful purpose to anyone studying acting, including actors and comedians themselves (but others, too). The footnotes show that some actors were known for being fat and the proper use of sourcing provides an adequate way to regulate the list. Whether or not you want to use the word "genre" it's clear that some actors have used their fatness in at least some of their roles. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think your point is a classicly bad <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdam.html" title="Reductio ad absurdam">Reductio ad absurdam</a> argument. If such an article were nominated, it wouldn't be nominated for improper sourcing but as a hoax (if it treated the claim seriously). If it didn't treat the claim as true, or more precisely treated the "Clinton is the first black president" meme as an encyclopedic subject, it could potentially make an interesting article (if a bit trivial). If, say, you were to find a more serious example, where a bad article had sourcing that was seriously deficient, then you'd have something to discuss. But you haven't argued that the sourcing is deficient, and if you did, the first step would be to tag it as poorly sourced and explain yourself on the talk page, not to go first to an AfD discussion. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:50, 13 March 2007 (UTC) (edited my first sentence <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li>As I said in different ways twice above, "proper" sourcing from "responsible" parties. What you're looking for Otto (correct me if I'm wrong) is a Wikipedia standard where we can't list anything unless some outside authority certifies all of its items as being on the list. Cultural lists can't work that way, so it seems you want them all out. Well there's a value to lists that aren't quite like the Periodic Table of the Elements or some genus of fauna or family of flora. You make some of the same points at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Christmas_dishes_ee21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Christmas dishes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Christmas dishes</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>But I'm not saying that there are not sources in which these guys are called "fat." The problem with this list is not sourcing. The problem with this list, as I've said repeatedly, is that <i>there is no possible objective standard for "fat"</i>. There is, infamously, a published source that calls Karen Carpenter "fat" (or "chunky" or "chubby", I don't recall the exact word, doesn't matter for purposes of this discussion). 95% or more of the population would not have considered her "fat" at the time the source was published or thereafter while she was starving herself to death, yet because it exists she would by your standard be eligible for List of fat musicians. It's not unreasonable to expect that lists like this be restricted to things that are objectively defineable. Compare this to the aforementioned list of actors who put on or lost weight for a role. I have no problem with that article because it restricts itself to factual, defineable entries that don't rely on the opinion of either Wikipedia editors or external people. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Objective" is not the proper standard. "Fair" is the proper standard and it is necessarily going to have some gray areas on the edges. If that results in some debates on the article's talk page in the future, why not let the editors who are interested in the subject deal with that — they certainly are willing to take the risk of that. And the risk seems a fair price to pay in order to keep the article. If some editor puts Karen Carpenter on a list and provides the citation, other editors can counter that with other citations or pictures that would convince 95% or more of the population. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Fair" is the standard? I'm not familiar with WP:BEFAIR, but if you say so. So if it's not "fair" that actors are listed as "fat" then I can take them off the list? Fine, then in that case it's not "fair" that any actor is listed as fat so the entire list should be deleted. Or, we could use an actual standard that makes some sort of sense, which would be <i>objectivity</i>. Expecting that a list article have an objective definition for existence and inclusion may or may not be perfect, but it's a damn sight better than sitting around trying to figure out whether it's "fair" to put someone on the list. Encyclopedias are not supposed to be popularity contests or votes and the idea that editors should spend time trying to convince each other that it is or isn't "fair" to call Karen Carpenter "fat" is bizarre. Expecting editors to spend time trying to convince one another that an actor is fat enough to be on a fat actors list is ludicrous. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, here's what you sit around and do: You discuss whether or not the authority being cited is correct. You do that by first trying to find other citations that either help or hurt the assertion made in the questionable citation. And when you've exhausted other resources you only have your common sense to rely on and you use it. That's being fair. When we sit around and do that, we do the actual editing that Wikipedians are here for. What's bizarre is that you don't think Wikipedians can use their heads. There is an area between rote rule following and complete subjectivity and you don't appear to recognize that, but it's in that area of reasoning things out and judging what weight to give the opinions of particular sources where encyclopedia editors make many of their most important decisions. The solution is not to run away from subjects where this kind of work needs to be done. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 04:50, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The list does not arbitrarily claim some actor as fat. Most of the entries are externally sourced. However, if one needs an objective definition of fat, there is <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Mass_Index_%28BMI%29_f1cc.html" title="Body Mass Index (BMI)">Body Mass Index</a> to calculate that. For that, every actor's weight (at a particular arbitrary age) and adult height have to be known! It goes without saying the process would be cumbersome!

<li><b>Very strong Keep</b> Notable band, though I did just strip the article of some blatant allmusic.com plagiarism. That said, they've got a full entry on allmusic, they're selling on amazon, they've been singed to two indie mainstays, the frontman is <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Pollard_9aa3.html" title="Russell Pollard">Russell Pollard</a> for pete's sake, and they've had at least one national news story (not to mention they've been on at least one national tour). Needless to say they meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> sans problem. That said, the article should be cleaned up a bit and expanded (and have some references too), I'm not arguing against that. But it's definitely Wikipedia-worthy.

<ul>
<li>In response to the the reasonings listed in the talk:
<ul>
<li><i>This is the most comprehensive football|soccer player's article on Wikipedia, and just because Pele's article is not so comprehensive, it shouldn't mean that others are limited to its size. It seems like an unnecessary bottleneck.</i> It doesn't matter how "comprehensive" the derivative article is, if it doesn't pass <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, than it doesn't deserve a seperate article.</li>
<li><i>The goals which Gilberto have scored are encyclopaedic information</i> And why? Please explain.</li>
<li><i>The information which is listed on Gilberto Silva goals was listed on his main article (Gilberto Silva) for a number of months, proving it is indeed fit for Wikipedia, and...</i> Though an article's subject might be notable, by no means does it make every <i>section</i> of said article notable enough to merit an individual article as well.</li>
<li><i>It was only moved to a separate page because it was too chunky for its parent page. If the goals page is deleted, the information will only be pasted back onto the main article; I feel that would be less tidy/organized that it having its own page.</i> At 43.5 kb, this page is defanitly not "chunky", especially compared to articles such as the United States, which is currently at 118.9kB, or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>, who's article is currently at 56kB, even without any of the statistics like those that this article has.</li>
<li><i>The reason Pele doesn't have his own goal page (or table) is due to the sheer number of goals that he has scored. Some of the details of the goals are probably lost to history. Gilberto will only ever score about 50 goals, and they are all fairly recent, so his page can exist quite easily. The information is readily available. This is not to say that just the fact that Gilberto has scored LESS goals than most allows him to have his own goal page. Quite the opposite. There is even more reason that Pele should have his own page; the only reason that he doesn't though, is that nobody is willing (or able?) to compile a list of his many hundreds of career goals. This is a first step to more comprehensive soccer player articles; it shows editors a new added level of useful detail which can be attained.</i> It doesn't matter whether Pele does or doesn't have a goal page. <i>None</i> of these articles should have a seperate goal page, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory of links to the locations and dates of when a soccer player scores a goal</a>.</li>
<li><i>Maybe Gilberto's goal page will lead to Pele (and other notable footballers) having their own statistics/goal pages. Maybe not. But the fact that no other editors have taken the time to compile such lists which require their own pages, surely does not mean that those editors which have, cannot have their pages exist.</i> See my comment below.</li>
<li><i>Some Basketball and American Football players do have their own 'statistics' pages. See <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career_achievements_of_Dwyane_Wade_2a49.html" title="Career achievements of Dwyane Wade">Career achievements of Dwyane Wade</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career_achievements_of_Michael_Jordan_d25f.html" title="Career achievements of Michael Jordan">Career achievements of Michael Jordan</a>. True, this page isn't on the same scale as said career achievements pages, but the fact that Gilberto is so much less famous means his small goals page is correct to scale.</i>I usually dislike citing essays, but note please note that <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_is_not_an_indicator_of_notability_abaa.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion is not an indicator of notability">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The intro states <i>This page lists the details of goals scored by Brazilian football player Gilberto Silva</i> giving the impression that it will be detailing all his career goals but that isn't the case, it details only the goals he has scored for Arsenal and Brazil and overlooks his other clubs, so at the very least (unless those details were added) it would need to be re-titled to something catchy like List of goals scored by Gilberto Silva for Arsenal and Brazil..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 09:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First, one needs to realize a few things about dōjin:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <i>majority</i> of dōjin are H. They are the rule, rather than the exception.</li>
<li>Dōjin means that something was <i>self</i>-published, making it inherently non-notable unless proven otherwise.</li>
<li>There are literally thousands, if not <i>millions</i> of H dōjin out there, so having a list of all of them is futile.</li>
<li>The (incorrectly name) <a href="../../../d/o/j/Category%7EDojin_51ce.html" title="Category:Dojin">Category:Dojin</a> and its subcategories takes care of any dōjin that actually might be notable in some way. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 08:09, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per nom, the term seems notable. A complete list would be pointless, but it doesn't appear to the the point. The article could use a LOT of help (what is a dōjin, what does the H stand for? Where is the term commonly used?) --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobit_eb37.html" title="User:Hobit">Hobit</a> 09:34, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I probably should have pointed out that <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/j/D%C5%8Djin.html" title="Dōjin">dōjin</a> is its own article, which pretty much answers what you're asking. <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecchi.html" title="Ecchi">Ecchi</a> answers your question about the H.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 10:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think the idea of this article is inherently hopeless. I think this could use some attention, probably just a few knowledgeable folks to reduce the list to a reasonable length and perhaps add some text about the history of this specific area of dojinshi. I would like to say "establish notability criteria for the list", but that is hard to do for self-published material. If deleted, this should definitely be merged back to dojinshi, which links to it. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 14:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The idea of producing a useable list of conferences was never a good idea. There are ten of thousands of them so at best it would be highly selective and prone to spam, and in any case almost no-one ever edits this page. The conferences that are there are pretty unimportant - not a single major medical conference for example. There are some excellent commercial sites that produce these lists and also have an alerting service and that's what academics really want - <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_conference.html#Lists_of_conferences" title="Academic conference">Academic conference#Lists of conferences</a> had been deleted as spam but I've restored it because these sites provide a far better resource than this page.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Too vague of a subject for there to be a list; a category would be better suited.

<li><b>Replace by Category</b> to see the possibilities, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer_science_conferences.html" title="List of computer science conferences">List_of_computer_science_conferences</a>. there are more of these than in other subjects but there are reasonable numbers for other subjects; they could form reasonable separate lists, maintained by the subject people, which could then be combined using categories. This would probably be a cleaner way to do it than the present list. There is an existing category, Conferences, which could easily be reorganized for the purpose. I have started the reorganization by making the, and will then make the Category:Academic conferences by subject, and follow up from there. I suggest that when developed this will replace <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_conference.html#Lists_of_conferences" title="Academic conference">Academic conference#Lists of conferences</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> a quick pass through <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer_science_conferences.html" title="List of computer science conferences">List of computer science conferences</a> shows that many of the conference abbreviations are actually incorrectly linked, mostly to the computer term rather than the conference, to disambiguations, and one even links to Damascus International Airport!

<dd>There are many uses for such lists besides that mentioned by andy: for example, the abbreviations for the names of these conferences occur in many articles, and are used in bibliographic references. Admittedly, they should probably all have articles, but this is impractical to do quickly with the present resources. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 09:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not convinced that lists would be adequately maintained. The number of categories is big and that of conferences is even bigger. If you had very narrow specialisations it might just be possible but I doubt it. For example, just on computer science conferences alone check out Google at <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Computer_Science/Conferences/" class="external autonumber" title="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Computer_Science/Conferences/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> and then drill in to one or two of the directories listed there and you'll see what I mean. For example <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/index-a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/index-a.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> - and that's just the letter A! The person who maintained the Wikipedia list would have to duplicate this list at the very least. So why not simply add a link to it from relevant places in Wikipedia? Surely Wikipedia shouldn't be trying to duplicate external resources that are already perfectly adequate? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyjsmith_7b54.html" title="User:Andyjsmith">andy</a> 11:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> but restrict to links that are about a series of conferences, not one-off conferences. I have added two such conferences for chemistry but there are many more. These regular conferences deserve an article and a list can be a valuable link to them.

<dd>I had always assumed that it would be about series--the vast majority of academic conferences are. In fact, all but one of the present list is about annual or biennial conferences. (In contrast to public affairs, where obviously one-off conferences have been of monumental importance), In science, there have been occasional times when a particular one in a series was of special importance, but I can think of no individually held ones that would be worth listing for their academic value.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is therefore the <i>opposite</i> of the commercial lists mentioned by the nom., which are devoted to announcements and dates of particular conferences. We no more need lists of those than we do of lists of individual football games.</dd>
<dd>Suggestion: we <b>Delete</b> this category and let any ed. who wants to do a more specific list go ahead and try, and judge them on their merits. There is no point in a general list where only one or two sections are maintained. (A new <i>Category: Lists of academic conferences</i>) is enough to keep the articles together. I am not aware of any in WP except the one I mentioned, <b>List of computer science conferences</b>, and its related ones, <b>List of cryptology conferences</b>, etc. and those only include series. (There is also a related <b>List of writer's conferences'</b> which also includes only series of conferences. A "List of chemistry conferences" would fill the need BDuke mentions--as he says, there are enough for a list. Ditto in biology. But we do not need a general list.

<dd><b>Comment</b> we are discussing the deletion of a list article here. That decision does not impact the associated creation and maintenance of conference categories, extending those categories that exist, and tagging existing notable conference articles with the appropriate category.

<p><s><b>Keep</b></s> "Non notable. No evidence this form of hip hop is different from normal hip hop. No reliable sources." maybe not notable to you, but many have heard the term. I don't hear normal hip hop talking about anti-religion, unless you know of some? No reliable sources? If I was less half-assed I would find some.</p>
<p>"seems to be a vehicle for promotional links" It is only for people to understand what it is, I only provided links and names for people interested in those people. I am in now way affiliated with them other than knowing of them.</p>
<p>"Lol, who the heck made this up?" Multiple artists when there was no genre for what they were producing.</p>
<p>"just because music can be described using a certain adjective does not make it a genre." But it does when it can't be described by a adjective, it is similar to christian rap, but not christian.</p>
<p>"lacks sources and barely asserts notability." I'm just placing the starting off as a stub for people of knowledge of it to give their 2 cent.</p>
<p>"Delete or maaaaaaybe merge into hip hop" I bet you 1000$ that hip hop would be vandalized more due to the large ammounts of african americans that pretty much hate Atheists.</p>
<p>"seems like part of a promo vehicle for Greydon Square" Not at all, I just wanted to give him a wiki since I know him. I would have made wikis for others if I knew them more.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is an example of an episteme constructed by the crowd. As such, it praises that which is acceptable to the masses, and spurns that which is anathema. The 'knowledge' portrayed on this site is not a set of facts in one-one correspondence with reality, but rather a set of opinions which represent the current <i>status quo</i> in society. There is no need for this article, or those whom it claims to describe, to be on Wikipedia.

<p>Appears to be a scam. NSYE ticker symbol comes up as invalid in the link provided. Company claims to be private while claiming to be traded on the stock exchange (which would make it a publicly traded company). Google searches for "Rush Studios" don't pull up anything relevant, which seems unlikely for a supposed $400million company.

<p>I created merely this page since it is the second nomination. The nomination is by <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELargoplazo_3f48.html" title="User:Largoplazo">Largo Plazo</a> below. I also rolled back the original discussion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Scouting_in_Vatican_City_d132.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scouting in Vatican City">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scouting in Vatican City</a> where the second nomination was appended. No opinion. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 14:02, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I marked this article for deletion and then found the earlier debate at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Scouting_in_Vatican_City_d132.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scouting in Vatican City">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scouting in Vatican City</a>. I don't understand how "the result of the debate was 'keep'" when the "delete" opinions had good reasons and the "keep" opinions mostly gave no reason at all, or superficial reasons that didn't address the main problem. One said something to the effect that "It's good to have articles on scouting—there's a developing interest in them." This person was oblivious to the key issue: this is an article the whole purpose of which is to say that its topic doesn't exist. As someone else pointed out, what's next: An article on "Scouting on the moon"? How about an article on Antarctic wineries?</p>
<p>Someone else pointed out that while, as someone else noted, the scouting articles all began as copies of each other, they were now beginning to diversify. Again, this is beside the point, since the main argument for deletion has nothing to do with diversity of text but with the fact that the article is about something that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Moreover, the final paragraph is about scouting in Italy, not in Vatican City, and the paragraph before that isn't about scouting at all, it's only about an award given to the Pope by a scouting organization.</p>
<p>There's no reason for this article to exist. —<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELargoplazo_3f48.html" title="User:Largoplazo">Largo Plazo</a> 12:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I am a little baffled that this article was kept, as well. The article itself admits that Scouting has <i>no</i> presence in the Vatican and likely never will, so what is the point in having the article? <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, no assertion of <i>existence</i>, never mind notability, and per <a href="../../../b/u/l/WP%7EBULLSHIT_22d3.html" title="WP:BULLSHIT">WP:BULLSHIT</a>. How in the hell could anyone vote to keep an article that basically says "There is no scouting in the Vatican City and it's unlikely there ever will be"???? Was any vestige of common sense applied? The nonsensical argument that we need a Scouting article for every nation-state in the world, whether there is any active Scouting there or not, just, well, um, "because of completeness," is meretricious garbage that does nothing save to provide ample ammunition to Wikipedia's detractors, never mind damage the concept that closing admins pay attention to anything other than the voting tally. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The remainder of the articles that survived the previous AfD are in bad shape. The best that could be done with them was to dig up images of postage stamps that "seem to suggest" (actual wording in the articles!) the existence of scouting in said country, as well as all linking to a <a href="http://www.troop97.net/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.troop97.net/index.htm" rel="nofollow">single website</a> run by a scout troop out of Colorado as a reference to prove the existence of scouting. That source is pretty dubious as a reliable reference. I'd not be opposed to lumping those articles into another AfD, as well as scouting out (pun intended) other speculative, skeletal and unreferenced articles on the topic. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> This player does not appear to come up to the level required to be on Wikipedia. I can find no trace of him on Soccerbase, nor can I find any reference to him playing at Bournemouth.</p>
<p>If he did play at Panathanikos, I guess this meets the required level, but is this verifiable? Are the Welsh and Irish clubs at the required level?</p>

<li>I can find no record of him having played for Panathanaikos or AFC Bournemouth (which is presumably what it's meant to say, rather than Bournemouth FC who are a non-league team) so the debate would hinge on whether having played for Galway would suffice (assuming it's true that he played in their match last Friday - their website has no report on the game) - personally I'd say no therefore <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 15:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, good enough on Galway. The article cited has him as a reserve for AFC Bournemouth, which isn't enough for notability, and there's no evidence of a first-team appearance for Pana. We're down to whether the Galway appearance by itself is enough for notability. I'm not changing my&#160;!vote just yet, but I'm following with interest. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">BPMullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBPmullins_8d1b.html" title="User talk:BPmullins">Talk</a> 19:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

He <a href="http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/squad/brinias-signs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.galwayunitedfc.ie/squad/brinias-signs.html" rel="nofollow">signed with Galway</a> in January this year (the press release says he was "attached" to Pana). The Galway press release does, however, say he played for <a href="../../../a/2E/c/A.C._ChievoVerona_8cfc.html" title="A.C. ChievoVerona">A.C. ChievoVerona</a>, which is a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serie_A_5ded.html" title="Serie A">Serie A</a> Italian team.

<dd>I've rewritten and wikified the article which was a bit of a mess, and added several references, but that doesn't really address the notability issue. For my money, an appearance for Galway United in the Irish Premier League <i>is</i> sufficiently notable. I guess that's the trouble with being a goalie - Brinias seems to have spent much of his career being third or fourth-choice goalkeeper and does not seem to have actually gone on the field for many matches. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 12:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. An article under this title, apparently essentially identical, has been Speedy-Del'd, and it has been recreated. It is now speedy tagged again (i had to resolve an ed-conf to get the AfD tag in), but IMO it is worth finishing the AfD for the edification of this apparently sincere but clueless reader's edification: besides being more definitive for enforcement, it will lay to rest the assumption on the bio's supporter(s') part that a few blockheads are standing in the way.<br />

<p>The aricle tells us that Okpara is a title meaning the oldest man in the village. This village in Nigeria has no article in Wikipedia. So, we only get the name of this person, and I have never been persuaded that the 'oldest man in the village' was sufficient notabilty for an encyclopaedia article. (Incidentally, the link to <a href="../../../o/k/p/Okpara.html" title="Okpara">Okpara</a> is unhelpful but does sho that Okpara is a Nigerioan surname. No hel;p to this article though.) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 17:18, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, At this point, I will agree with Arkyan and say it is trivial. It is not encyclopedic on its own. The article could however be merged with Agbor Alindinma, his location, if it is notable enough to have its own article. If there is any power associated with being "Okpara", then it could be notable if explained and sourced, but I doubt this, therefore delete, under CSD A1. <a href="../../../n/e/n/User%7ENenyedi_8913.html" title="User:Nenyedi"><b>Nenyedi</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/e/n/User_talk%7ENenyedi_2e45.html" title="User talk:Nenyedi">Talk</a></sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nenyedi_8bb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nenyedi">Contribs</a><sub><a href="../../../n/e/n/User%7ENenyedi_8913.html" title="User:Nenyedi">@</a></sub></small> 21:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>completely meaningless article whcih says "valuation is central to the operation of the financial markets" without any meaningful amplification, without any useful links, and without any sources, further reading.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> PSI has relevance to the storyline in each game of the Mother series (and should exist in the article, but does not), relevance which was suggested by another user on my talks page to be added not thirty minutes before this AFD was suggested by <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a>, who already has several open discussions on his talk page pertaining to other articles he has attempted to redirect or delete when a user disagrees with his blanking and/or redirecting. All this, and a bit of meatpuppetry too.

<li>It's already been determined that you're not the best person to make that decision, as demonstrated by your repeated attempts to get rid of the Frank Grimes page and as Kafziel has shown on his own talks page in reference to your other mergers of Zelda locations. Once or twice, I can assume good faith; repeatedly (and over the objections of others several times), it's vandalism. --PeanutCheeseBar 03:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I'm sure that any self-respecting Wikipedian would say that because I remove content from Wikipedia on the basis that it doesn't belong, that I am intentionally trying to damage Wikipedia. I'm not the best person to make the decision? Right, I guess because I do an obviously disliked act - merging articles - what I think should get merged doesn't matter. People don't like that I merge articles that they like? My Gosh, I didn't think people like that existed! Also, nice job reading the Zelda dispute - if you had, you would have figured that Kafziel disputed it because I didn't open discussion, not because it was a controversial move. I'm also wondering who committed meatpuppetry. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think a self-respecting Wikipedian would say that if you blank pages and make them redirect elsewhere and it's drawn complaints in the past, that you need to open a discussion before doing so again. I took up issue with you because you did not open a discussion (which was my bigger complaint) before doing the merge, and it appears that you hardly EVER (if at all) open up a discussion before doing so. Even then, part of the problem is that when you DO merge, you don't do a very good job of it (and I'm apparently not the first person to take notice of this). You've created a list of articles on your user page that you say will "possibly be merged", yet when I randomly click on a few of them, NONE of them have templates suggesting they be merged. You may do it under the guise of "improving" Wikipedia, but in reality all you've done is created a "hit list" of articles that you'll either blank and redirect or merge without further warning; the only way people will know what articles get hit will be if they look at your page, and that's not nearly enough warning, nor does it open the floor for discussion. Wikipedia is not your own personal sandbox. --PeanutCheeseBar 12:13, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No policy suggests that I need to open discussion. The only thing that is said is "don't merge/redirect if it's controversial". And how do you say I don't do a very good job of it? My merge of the Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn locations had me making hundreds of edits to fix links, redirects, and orphaned images. Next time, Cheese, assume that since I've been here for 2+ years, I know what I'm doing.</li>
<li>And I once again ask - who committed meatpuppetry? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 13:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that you've made quite a few merges/redirects in the recent past that have been viewed as controversial (if they weren't, people likely would not object on your talk page), I'd say you're not following that policy very well. Regardless of whether or not it's a policy, it's still good practice to open a discussion first, and it would likely save you some controversy and conflict if you did open a discussion before making a merge or redirect; if nobody objects or participates after a week, you've got some justification to do so.</li>
<li>You said you merged 'everything', although you merged the content for ONE game. I checked the other pages after you said you did, and it was quite obvious that you didn't; I'd hardly say that's a quality merge job. I don't care how long you've been here, that's still no excuse to blank and redirect things as you wish, and given my objections and the objections of others on your talk page, it seems I am not the only person who takes issue with this practice of yours. So, I will ask one last time that you cease this practice until you can either learn to "play nice" and hold a discussion (or at least put a merge template on the page for a while) before you decide to make any drastic changes, and maybe <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mother_locations_f8db.html" title="List of Mother locations">finish what you start</a> before you decide to go and blow away other articles without giving it a second thought; after all, if you've been around for two years, I have no grounds on which to ask why you created an article stub and left it alone for six months (though I'm sure you'll get around to it eventually). --PeanutCheeseBar 14:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, they weren't. Very few articles DON'T have controversy over them. However, I'm not going to say "because someone wrote this article and definitely will be unhappy to see it go, I won't merge without discussion". Good practice, huh? Well, it's POLICY to be bold. I was bold in my actions. I did not merge ANYTHING that had controversy to it. I'm not going to ASSUME that people will react that way - and very few of my merges have been of articles with controversy over them being merged. At no point does Wikipedia say that you should assume that an article's merge is controversial.</li>
<li>Nice job selectively reading there. You read where I said that I merged everything, but not where I said "at the time that I merged it, I HAD merged everything"? And, yes, there is - I repeat, it is policy to be bold. I don't have to ask peoples' permission every time I merge or redirect. And so what of List of Mother locations? I created it because Magicant could not stand alone as its own article. If I had AfD'd it instead, it'd be deleted, redirected, or merged into one of the EarthBound/Mother articles. I have no intention of improving List of Mother locations - not just because I still think that it's not that important, but also because I never got very far in Mother.</li>

<p><b>SAVE THIS ARTICLE</b> The two voters above clearly identify themselves by their religious affiliations. I prefer to keep that part of my life private. If it disturbs them to see such ideas in print, let them refute them, point by point; otherwise keep still and reflect upon them. I have lived nearly all my life in Kentucky and North Carolina and know the Unholy Alliance for what it is, a fixture of American life. It was a common topic of discussion for as long as I can remember. The political abuse of well-intended religious impulses is something that must be reported and brought to light, not hidden. Intellectual cowardice has no place in Wikipedia. Several vague allegations have been made. Be specific or be quiet.

<dd>I am not sure where you are coming up with the "gut reaction" thing
<dl>
<dd>your "piece of ..." comment</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>but ad-hominem attacks against people arguing to delete the article are not going to curry you any favor or do anything to advance your cause.
<dl>
<dd>When people identify themselves as editors, and religious, they are open to question as to their motivation when editing or deleting an article on religion, i.e. are they trying to advance their own?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A collection of facts pointing to a new idea is, in fact, OR - read <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> for clarification.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, of course if the meaning is a "totally new idea," but it isn't. "Unholy Alliance" been around for a long time, as a general, vague epithet, and, as a very specific, and generally regretted, lack of separation, in the South, of politics and religion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Not one of the references listed in the article supports the notion of the "unholy alliance" as a concept.
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I wonder if you read any of it at all. All three articles mentioning Baptists and Bootleggers in the title do offer support. At least one article has the very concept named in the title! Would the writer use it in his title if the concept had no immediately identifiable meaning?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Google results cannot be used as references,
<dl>
<dd>That's a matter of opinion (if you read the discussion).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>and culling references where the term is used does not constitute reference material, either.
<dl>
<dd>I'd agree, but it's a good starting point for documenting something that seems to exist, heretofore, largely in folk-lore, until recently.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Add some verified, reliable sources documenting the subject of the article and the OR concerns may be alleviated.
<dl>
<dd>I'm willing to do that, but Jeez-Louise, if you read the discussion you'll know I'm a strapped single-parent, and on top of everything it's tax time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Spamming an article with Google results and unrelated sources DOES NOT satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.
<dl>
<dd>I'm not trying to spam anything, but provide hooks for myself and others to investigate further.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Furthermore the unsubstantiated allegations of the Catholic Church colluding with the Nazis comes across as rather inflammatory and the article could be interpreted as a thinly veiled <a href="../../../a/t/k/WP%7EATK_b196.html" title="WP:ATK">attack page</a> and qualify for speedy deletion.
<dl>
<dd>Do I have to document that, too? It's been on PBS and the History channel for decades it seems, and it qualifies as an example of an Unholy Alliance. Read up on Pope Pius XII and the operation to spirit Nazis out of Europe at the end of WWII to South America.</dd>

<dd>Willing to keep trying and responding to criticism, so long as it is very specific, not general or vague as is much of what's on this page.

<dd>An editor's religious views do not constitute a conflict of interest as they are citing valid Wikipedia policies that have <i>nothing</i> to do with religion.
<dl>
<dd>You don't seem to understand the analogy of a judge. It doesn't matter that the laws (policies) have nothing to do with religion. If he's hearing a case that involves his religion, he must recuse himself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The motivation of the contributors to a debate is not relevant to the veracity of their observations.
<dl>
<dd>It most certainly is, because of the iceberg theory of mind, only 15% is above water (conscious).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Trying to discredit them due to what you feel to be a conflict of interest is <i>still</i> an ad hominem attack and disruptive to the flow of discussion on the merits of the article.
<dl>
<dd>It is not in the least, rather it is a concern that should be common to us all, and please note this discussion is flowing with civility.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Please refrain from trying to discredit others and focus on telling us why the article should be kept.
<dl>
<dd>It is no discredit to address that which we cannot help (the 85% below water) but to ignore it is stupid. The article has merit, and I'm willing to work getting it up to standards. 'Nuff said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As far as your sources in the article are concerned, yes I have looked at them insofar as I am able to. Whether the writer of an article would use the term <i>unholy alliance</i> or not has no bearing on the discussion of the concept.
<dl>
<dd>...a simply amazing statement, in light of questions as to whether the term refers to anything real at all. Given that it does, then your criticism has value, but also if it does (refer to something real), don't delete the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The article establishes an unsourced dictionary definition of what <i>unholy alliance</i> means and then dives in to a lengthy recounting of examples of what one might percieve as such.
<dl>
<dd>Yup, and consider just how many Wikipedia articles do exactly that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Let me reiterate&#160;: it does not matter if you can come up with a million articles where someone uses the term.
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that'd pretty well establish it as a term of use; wouldn't you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Unless the term istelf is the subject of the source, then the source does not help with attribution.
<dl>
<dd>Point taken that assertions about the term need to be documented (if not blatantly obvious).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, yes, you must be prepared to cite sourced for information you put in an article. You cannot expect readers to do your homework for you and simply "figure it out".
<dl>
<dd>Certainly not for the long-run, I agree.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You cannot expect future editors or the AfD participants to sift through Google results and find something to defend your point of view. I am sorry you are a strapped, single parent with little time but that still does not put the burden of proving your point on anyone else. Spin the issue all you like, but unless the article is properly sourced and cleaned up, it fails Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 22:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, good answer; lemme chew on that. Though it does seem to have worked to some degree, attracting other contributors and editors. I'm willing to cut back to what can be established or proven about the concept, and let others add what they will as time goes on and new sources come to light. --<a href="../../../m/b/h/User%7EMbhiii_4194.html" title="User:Mbhiii">Mbhiii</a> 23:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The judge analogy does not apply - we are not judges. We are not a jury. This is not a vote. We are expressing ideas for consideration by the closing administrator. It is an attempt to establish consensus. In any case let me break this down into simple terms - the bulk of your article is <b>not</b> about <i>Unholy Alliance</i> as a topic, but is being used as a medium to exposit what by your definition <i>are</i> unholy alliances.
<dl>
<dd>There are a very great number of articles here, <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalomania.html" title="Megalomania">megalomania</a> for instance, that are exactly in that format. Examples serve to flesh out and make real what would otherwise be pretty dry stuff. Please, add your own examples, if you know of any.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The entire section of the article about the term <i>unholy alliance</i> is unsourced and unreferenced and <b>that</b> is the problem.
<dl>
<dd>I concentrated on trying to answer the original objector (see discussion) who is a Baptist and concerned about the prominence of Baptists in the article. Having done that, I'm ready to address yours, if you don't kill it first.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That your Google searches and links establish the <i>existence</i> of the term is not in question, but establishing that something exists is NOT the point of sourcing.
<dl>
<dd>Now, that you admit Unholy Alliances exist, don't delete the article on it, but edit and enhance it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I am not going to debate this issue with you any further in the interest of not disrupting the debate overall, particularly since it seems you are more concerned with the religious affiliations of the people who have debated here rather than the substance of the article and its fitness in terms of Wikipedia guidelines.
<dl>
<dd>It's not their religious affiliations that bothers me, but that they would advertise them as part of their association with Wikipedia, then dare call for the deletion of an article that addresses an abuse of religion, one that results from a lack of religious oversight.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>There's nothing ridiculous about using Google searches to establish that a term has wide use, but my main intent is to use them as temporary hooks for better citations later, which seems acceptable to others (read discussion).

<dd>The Google Search is a clear-cut example of original research. Advancing the notion that the Google Search proves the term is popular or indeed that the popularity is significant is your original contribution to the topic. It is not something any reliable source has said or supports. If you intend to use these searches as basis for continuing work on the article, you should place them on the talk page and label them as such.

<dd>I don't care how many analogies, theories, metaphors or comparisons anyone throws at the issue. The black and white truth of the matter is that two possibilities exist - either the article passes or fails inclusion criteria.

The motivations, affiliations, beliefs or attitudes of the people <b>do not</b> somehow exempt the article from having to meet the basic guidelines for inclusion! Since this is not a vote the closing admin does not count how many people say delete versus how many say keep. The admin will weigh the evidence presented both in favor of and opposing the deletion, measure the quality of the article against the standards, determine what the consensus of the Wikipedia community is on the issue and then close the discussion appropriately. If as you believe those&#160;!voting delete have no bias in policy then you have nothing to fear because the closing admin will take this into account. If however the concerns brought up by these&#160;!votes are <i>valid policy related issues</i> then it does not matter their motivation - either the article must be fixed to meet standards or it gets deleted. Bottom line&#160;: this is an "Articles for Deletion" debate, not an "Editors for Scrutiny" discussion.

<p><b>Weak delete</b> - Usually I would recommend RfC, as suggested by Armed Blowfish above, because the primary problems are OR and POV, which are usually fixable. (As, indeed, the citation issues have been somewhat addressed, although the effect is that now it's a very well-documented rant, as the sources seem to be cited to support the OR argument, rather than to document how the term is frequently used.) However, I don't see <i>this</i> article ending up as more than a dictionary definition once all the POV and OR are taken out. From the discussion it appears that this term is more of an expression (which doesn't justify having an article to archive its uses) than, say, a political science term of art (which might very well justify an article to explain a poli sci concept). So even if it's fixed, I doubt it will ever be an encyclopedia article. The way to save this article is to find <i>better</i> sources, not <i>more</i> sources—professional or academic sources using it in a political studies context. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 15:30, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A problem with your partial delete idea is that Reed's position as a Christian leader among conservative voters was understandably why he was picked to lobby against the Alabama lottery. He knew the money was coming from Indian casino gambling people who would benefit greatly (more gambling for them) if the lottery was killed, so he tried to deny it all, and was caught. (all documented in the links; that's why they're there) He's a Christian leader, they went to jail, so it's a "special" instance (religious/criminal) of an unholy alliance. Another "special" instance (religious/criminal) is the KY Baptist/Bootlegger thing which incidentally was explicitly called "the Unholy Alliance" in KY since the early 1900s.216.77.231.87 06:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as original prodder. Furrykef, thanks for bringing it here and being open about the article. I have the impression that it is not a notable software tool, and the article, which is over two years old and has been tagged for notability for two months, has no external independent sources (per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>) to indicate such notability. However, it may of course be that amongst the 143 distinct online sources (per Google<a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=%22perforce+jam%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?q=%22perforce+jam%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=nl&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>) or in some offline source, good, verifiable claims to notability are made.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>As for the google hits, I'll note that it's often just called "Jam". Also, a descendant like "KJam" will likely be referred to by that name, without mention of Perforce. Unfortunately, these names don't google very well... - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 21:52, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Okay, I know that you are probably not going to take the vote of an anonymous user into consideration, but when I saw that the article is proposed for deletion, I felt that I need to share my opinion: I often find these kinds of articles very useful, even if the mentioned piece of software is not very widely used (This is not the first deletion proposal that I regret to see). They can spare quite some googling, because many little pieces of information are collected on Wikipedia, that are difficult to gather by searching the web. I looked up Jam on WP because I needed it to build some software on Windows, but I am not a professional programmer, so most of the time I need a little help with these kinds of things. The WP article told me immediately that there are many different versions of Jam and I could download a Windows binary of FP Jam within a minute. Now if the only thing that you know is that you need some software named "Jam" (I didn't even know that it's called <i>Perforce</i> Jam) and google for it, you only find the official perforce page, which doesn't help you much with getting it working. So this WP article saved me a lot of time. Of course I know that WP shouldn't be a collection of download links, but still: at least this page is useful, unlike many others that contain less information and are <i>not</i> proposed for deletion (just a random example that I stumbled upon by accident a day ago: <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Baldwin_f493.html" title="Simon Baldwin">Simon Baldwin</a>). And maybe Jam <i>is</i> notable in some circles (among people who make their living by programming). Otherwise why would it be used in the build system of several projects? ... So if you don't think that this article is harmful in any way, please keep it ... -- a Wikipedia user. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.177.46.38 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.177.46.38_cfe7.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.177.46.38">contribs</a>) 19:40, 14 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Abstain</b>: Jam (and its variants) is one of several build tool trying to fix problems with make and being only moderate successful here (the area of make tools got fragmented and people often preferre to create custom ones). Short overview of Jams could be found at <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0506/000092.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0506/000092.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0509/000100.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0509/000100.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. The original Jam is abandoned and under-documented, Boost.Build (both versions) is very complex, under-documented but under active development. The current article is not much above mere collection of links.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article does not violate any Wikipedia policy (see list of what the article is <i>not</i> above in response to the stated policies that the article supposedly violated) and the usefulness of an article is a subjective decision and not a proper way for determining whether an article should be deleted or not (think of <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> and other such articles which are only useful to the people who care or even know about such things). If you do not find an article useful, it doesn't necessarily mean that the articles isn't useful to other people.

Now if the FIFA World Cup can have main articles about its matches, even though there are numerous other websites on the internet to which persons could be referred to instead <i>a la</i> Cricinfo, then why shouldn't the Cricket World Cup?

<li><b>Keep</b> - For all the reasons stated previously: It does not violate any of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policies (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> are not applicable - check the criteria properly), and in fact is exactly the kind of data that would be found in a traditional encyclopaedia (thus "not encyclopaedic" is not a valid argument against inclusion either). User 72.27.8.49's comment re: the FIFA World Cup entries being allowed to stand is valid - either all must stay or all must go. Proponents of deletion clearly can't even agree on whether producing a scorecard is primary source material, whether it is duplication of a source, or whether it requires attribution to, or validation from, a source! In view of their contradictory comments - obviously based purely on each person's personal interpretation of the WP guidelines - the scorecards pages for sports events should stay until and unless specific clarification is made 'officially' by WP. However I totally agree that this page <i>must</i> be renamed to include the word 'cricket', since there are world cup championships in several sports. I believe <b>2007 Cricket World Cup Matches</b> would be the most sensible title. - 158.143.133.150 19:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, if you read the discussion page for the article, you'll see why the page is not up-to-date. Having had the article listed as being considered for deletion, the author hasn't touched it since, so why complain about the article not being up-to-date when this very process is what basically drove the author away? I agree that the page could be re-done so as to make it more reader-friendly (rather like the FIFA pages), but that doesn't require deletion. As a true cricket fan you could contribute to correcting the page rather than just sitting back and deleting it. I doubt the FIFA fans out there who wrote the various world cup match pages would have even dreamed about letting such articles be deleted simply because they were badly written initially. It probably won't matter anyway as User 158.143.133.150 rightly points out that the proponents of deletion can't agree on what the page is, much less what policy it ever violated, but seeing as how so many people seem set against the page, for some reason or another (usually out of personal consideration) then the article will probably end up being deleted. It's a shame that the info couldn't at least be merged with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Cricket_World_Cup_group_stage_d75f.html" title="2007 Cricket World Cup group stage">2007 Cricket World Cup group stage</a> and the author convinced to contribute to that page since this seems headed for deletion.72.27.85.98 01:52, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Isn't the fact that no-one can agree on what the page is trying to be justification for its deletion? What is the value of keeping this page? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe-Pope_c583.html" title="User:The-Pope">The-Pope</a> 03:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> "No-one can agree on what the page is trying to be.."? Actually all the people, including the author, who voted to keep the page know what the page is supposed to be. It's an article on the individual matches of the 2007 cricket world cup, since the information that would be needed for the article would make the main article on the 2007 tournament very long. If you read through the debate, you'll see, as User 158.143.133.150 says, that the only ones who don't agree on what the page is are the ones voting for deletion. They get bogged down in trying to decide whether or not the page violates any policy or whether it is "primary source material, duplication of a source, or whether it requires attribution to, or validation from, a source". Also is there anything in wikipedia's deletion policy that says that if nobody can agree on a page then it should be deleted? If so then many more pages have an even greater justification for deletion. The value of keeping the page was already outlined in the fact that the FIFA world cup 2006 tournaments have analagous pages i.e. it's a page that gives details that would detract from the main article's readability. If the page can be formatted properly, then do so. If the page can be reformatted, but a suitable alternative exists, then the procedure is to merge and redirect, not delete.72.27.85.98 16:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. It wouldn't be a proper reason to either keep or delete this article on the grounds of either following or resisting Brandt's wishes / demands / rants regarding his wanting it deleted. The decision should be made solely based on the significance and notability of the case itself, and since I lack sufficient information to know this, I'll defer to others who might be better qualified to make this determination. If it's only of significance because Mr. Brandt is involved, then it's best off just being mentioned in his own article and not in a separate article, but if it's actually a significant precedent that affected subsequent cases, it might deserve an article of its own.

<li><b>Delete</b> The content of the article does not seem to be notable. Most of it is just trivia about the show. Just because Stephen Colbert said a made up word once on his TV show, that doesn't make it a notable neologism.

<p>Non-notable child actress. According to her <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2394495/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2394495/" rel="nofollow">IMDB profile</a>, she has had two roles. One was <i>Craft booth worker in festival</i> and the other was <i>Amber birthday party friend &amp; pinata hitter</i>. When the only two roles played don't even have character names, this isn't notability. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 23:20, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
