<p>Ipswich City Hardcore, or ICHC, was founded in late 1998, established by three individuals from the Ipswich band, B. A. Baracus. Neil and Chris (AKA Crispy) had known each other from their time at Rosewood school, and they met Troy in late 1998. They shared their love for punk and hardcore music and started what was to later become B. A. Baracus in the lounge room of Crispy's flat, with Crispy on guitar, Troy on bass, Neil on vocals and a drum machine. Through their interest in hardcore, the idea of ICHC was born by looking at hardcore scenes that already existed, most notably those in New York (NYHC) and Sydney (SCHC). The idea at the time seemed little more than something to humour the three, as they never expected it to be of any interested to anyone else, but as the band began to take off, and other people in Ipswich who were either friends of the band, or had an interest in hardcore music, began taking notice of the ICHC tag, it began to stick. ICHC would soon start a somewhat mock rivalry with it's nearby city's hardcore scene, that of Brisbane. There was a run of shows pitting ICHC against BCHC, but these were all arranged in good fun, even if the idea of a Boston vs New York type rivalry was behind the inital idea of these shows.</p>

Ipswich City Hardcore, or ICHC, was founded in late 1998, established by three individuals from the Ipswich band, B. A. Baracus. Neil and Chris (AKA Crispy) had known each other from their time at Rosewood school, and they met Troy in late 1998. They shared their love for punk and hardcore music and started what was to later become B. A. Baracus in the lounge room of Crispy's flat, with Crispy on guitar, Troy on bass, Neil on vocals and a drum machine. Through their interest in hardcore, the idea of ICHC was born by looking at hardcore scenes that already existed, most notably those in New York (NYHC) and Sydney (SCHC). The idea at the time seemed little more than something to humour the three, as they never expected it to be of any interested to anyone else, but as the band began to take off, and other people in Ipswich who were either friends of the band, or had an interest in hardcore music, began taking notice of the ICHC tag, it began to stick. ICHC would soon start a somewhat mock rivalry with it's nearby city's hardcore scene, that of Brisbane. There was a run of shows pitting ICHC against BCHC, but these were all arranged in good fun, even if the idea of a Boston vs New York type rivalry was behind the inital idea of these shows. ICHC helped draw together many people from both the punk and hardcore scenes, as well as the strong metal scene, in Ipswich, as well as establish links with bands, venues and promoters in Brisbane and other states of Australia. Not only was ICHC instrumental in bringing bands together, it also helped to establish somewhat of a sense of pride in the city of Ipswich, something that many of the people involved with ICHC never really felt as strongly about before its' existence. ICHC in it's original form hasn't existed for a few years, with most of the people involved with it living in other cities or states in Australia, and the ones still living in Ipswich not being active in promoting shows or running venues or playing in bands that are based in Ipswich. However, a new breed of ICHC is bubbling under, with many young bands beginning to take up the ethos of ICHC.</p>

<p>VAT 69 or 69th Commando Battalion is the special force from the Royal Malaysian Police based at Northern Brigade, Ulu Kinta, Perak. This unit is under the direct order of Northern Brigade Commander and responsible to the Internal Security/Civil Security (KDN/KA). VAT 69 modelled on by the United Kingdom Special Air Service Regiment for fighting the arms rising from the Malayan Communist Party in 1969. The VAT 69 actually formed in 1969 (hence the name - 69) to create a small combat unit with the same tactics and technique just like the communist terrorist.</p>

Mushu is a character from the Movie <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulan.html" title="Mulan">Mulan</a>. He is voiced by Eddie Murphey in his first appearance.</p>
<a name="Mulan" id="Mulan"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-25_0e9c.html" title="Edit section: Mulan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mulan</span></h3>
<p>Mushu used to be a Fa family guardian; however, his bad advice resulted on one of the ancestor's head being cut off. Because of this, the ancestors demoted him to gong ringer. However, as luck would have it, Mulan ran away from home to pose as a man to save her father from certain death in the war against the Huns. When the fast-talking dragon offered to go, the ancestors only laughed at him and sent him to wake the great stone dragon. Mushu goes to wake him, but unfortunately ends up destroying the statue by accident. He pretends to be the stone dragon for the eldest ancestor and then starts to panic about what will happen when the ancestors find out what happened. At that point, an unlucky cricket named Cricki suggests that HE go help Mulan, as this would help him become a guardian once again.</p>
<p>Mushu attemps to make an entrance, but Mulan isn't particularly thrilled about being helped by a "lizard". Mushu attempts to help Mulan look manly, but it only gets her in trouble with Yao, Ling, Chin-Po and Captain Shang. After the right training, Mushu overhears Chi-Fu, the Emperor's advisor, tell Shang that the soldiers won't go to war. Mushu then pretends to be a soldier of the general's army atop a Panda, fooling Chi-Fu to get the troops to the Shun-Tao pass.</p>
<p>It turns out that the general's army was killed, along with the general himself, and the village was burnt to the ground. While the soldiers are trying to find the Huns, Mushu accidentaly sets off a rocket and tries to blame Cricki. The Huns then attack and all seems lost. Then Mulan tries to light a rocket at the mountainside using flint, but Shan-Yu's falcon knocks it into the snow. In a desperate attempt, Mulan squeezes Mushu so that he lights the rocket. As the rocket sails for the Mountainside, Mushu scolds Mulan for missing him, despite the fact that he was right in front of her.</p>
<p>Later, Mulan's true identity is revealed and she, Her horse, Mushu and Cricki are left on the mountain. It is there that they discover that SHan-Yu survived the avalanche and that he and his strongest warriors are headed for the Imperial Palace. They try to warn everyone, but no one listens to them. When Shan-Yu imprisons the Emperor, Mulan, Mushu, Cricki, Shang, Yao, Ling and Chin-Po sneak into the palace and take down the guards and the falcon, which Mushu incinerates. Mulan then has Cricki and Mushu to get a firework to stop Shan-Yu. While she is distracting him, Mushu prepares the firework and lights it with him attached to it. He then get off the firework and has Shan-Yu take his place. He then Leaps off the roof in a spectacular explosion. Afterwards, the ancestors finally agree to make him a Guardian again.</p>

<p><br />
In the Wuxia universe created by Jin Yong, the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing (Traditional Chinese: 九陽真經; Simplified Chinese: 九阴真经) lit. 9 Yang True Classic, is a fictional martial arts manual, originating from the Shaolin Sect. Those who study the martial arts contain within will have his Inner Strength improved tremendously and gain the ability to learn new martial arts at a quicken pace.</p>
<p>This manual was first mentioned indirectly towards the end of Return of the Condor Heroes, and formally appeared in the sequel The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Saber. In the story, the manual was found by the protagonist Zhang Wuji, where it was stuffed into the stomach of a giant gorilla.</p>
<p>[edit] History Jiu Yang Zhen Jing's history is sketchy. It has been rumored that Shaolin's founder, Da Mo, was the creator of the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing, but this has never been verified. The manual's existence was unknown to the pugilistic world until the end of the ROCH storyline, when the Mongolian thugs Yin Kexi and Xiao Xiangzi stole the manual from Shaolin Temple.</p>
<p>Shaolin librarian Jue Yuan and his young disciple, Zhang Junbao pursued Yin Kexi and Xiao Xiangzi to Hua Shan, where the newly-named New Five Greats (Eastern Heretic Huang Yaoshi, Western Crazy Yang Guo, Southern Monk Yideng, Northern Hero Guo Jing, and Central Child Zhou Botong) were paying their respects to fallen Greats Northern Beggar Hong Qigong and Western Venom Ouyang Feng.</p>
<p>With the help of Yang Guo, Zhang Junbao was able to thwart Yin Kexi and Xiao Xiangzi, but the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing was nowhere to be found. Unbeknownst to all present at Mountain Hua, Yin Kexi had hidden the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing in the abdomen of a large gorilla. On his deathbed, Yin Kexi made a confession to Kunlun Bai elder He Zudao, but Yin Kexi slurred the final statement and instead of hearing "The book is in the gorilla", He Zudao heard "The book is in the oil", which mystified everyone for a century.</p>
<p>Jue Yuan the Monk had memorized the text of the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing, and before his death three years after the book was lost, he managed a deathbed recital of the text that Zhang Junbao, Guo Xiang, and a high-ranking Shaolin monk named Mo Shi were each able to memorize various parts of. Zhang Junbao and Guo Xiang were able to incorporate various principles of the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing into their personal kungfu and the kungfu of the sects they eventually founded, Wudang Bai and E'Mei Bai, as did Wu Se for Shaolin.</p>
<p>NO ONE, however, possessed the complete Jiu Yang Zhen Jing again for a century until the young hero Zhang Wuji, son of Zhang Sanfeng's student Zhang Chuisan and future leader of the Ming Cult, found the gorilla, amazingly still alive, that Yin Kexi had hidden the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing in a century earlier and liberated the books from concealment. The 15-year old Zhang Wuji spent the next five years learning the Jiu Yang Zhen Jing, and upon his completion of his studies at age 20, became one of the most powerful men of his time.</p>

<p>Founder, songwriter, and singer for the rock band THE FADED, Gene is an highly active animal rights activist. Recently his band was awarded 'ALTERNATIVE BAND OF THE YEAR' at the Los Angeles Music Awards.</p>
<p>In the short time since forming, THE FADED, has risen from virtual unknowns to being hailed as The New Darlings of The Sunset Strip. As much pinups as strong musicians, its five members have truly made a name for themselves within the local music scene. Recently awarded the title of Alternative Band of the Year, The Faded have the art of the hook down so well that you cant help but see their faded view of life and love.</p>
<p>The Hollywood based group has fine-tuned their power-pop style in such unique ways that they have managed to completely separate themselves out from and above the rest. The five charismatic boys manage to play loud aggressive music with an accessible pop side that makes their songs relatable to virtually any age group. Add in their often over-the-top on-stage style (all posturing and play in fun), and you get a show that is both exciting and intriguing, as well as just great fun. The lyrics Gene presents by way of his distinctive voice are clever and candid. Gene is a moody soul whose voice suits the temperamental music that his band creates.</p>

<p>Quintessence regulation equation states that gravity is a negative constant in the area around the space outside the rim of the expansion of the big bang. the equation is G=-n to the third power or cubed. G=-n3. In this area gavity pulls the area outside this rim of expansion and creates the expansion. Gravity is ther therefore a negative constant. This is a regulation of of a very small number and most likely a particle that is very cold.</p>

<p>A Wethouse is a temporary shelter for [homeless] [alcoholics|alcoholism]. Homeless are offered counselling while living in the wethouse, but are not required to stop drinking during this time. They are allowed to stay as long as they want.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that by attracting homless alcoholics to stay in a single place, where they can avoid general misbehavior and be close to medical treatment, the costs to society as a whole can be reduced by curbing arrests and visits to hospital emergency rooms. It has yet to be shown conclusively whether or not it succeeds in this.</p>
<p>Wethouses tend to cause controvery among local resisdents who question the morality of simply allowing homeless alcoholics to continue consuming rather than trying to stop them. They also fear that wethouses may attract a criminal element. Supporters assert that the wethouses do not exist to simply aquiesce to homeless who want to drink, they are aimed at hopeless cases who cannot be made to stop drinking by any means. They also point out that homeless alcoholics who are not forced to live on the street are more likely to seek treatment of their own accord.</p>
<p>Wethouses currently exist in Seattle, WA, and Fargo, MN among many other cities, and wethouse projects are currently being debated for several other cities.</p>

<p>The Rolls-Royce Soar was a small "disposable" jet engine designed in the early 1950s as a power source for a British cruise missile designed and produced in prototype form by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd at Weybridge. The engine was demonstrated at Farnborough on the wingtips of a Gloster Meteor. The missile used three engines, mounted on the tailplane and fin - both tailplane and fin had sharply-swept leading edges. The missile was made of mild steel, the fuselage of rolled mild steel plate, and the straight wing of multiple-spar steel box girders clad in thin steel sheet. The wing was retained with bombslips, and the warhead, about 1 tonne, retained with explosive bolts. A radio guidance system was fitted in the rear fuselage. Fuel was carried in the wing, which was released on reaching the target area. Once stabilised in a dive, the warhead separated from the fuselage by blowing the explosive bolts. It was a very crude weapon, as vulnerable to defensive measures as the V! flying bomb, but much more expensive because of the cost of the three engines.</p>

<p>Dr. Douglas P. Harrison recieved his Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1966. After receiving his Ph.D he went to work for Monsanto doing new product research. After three years with Monsanto he joined Louisiana State University's Chemical Engineering Department in 1969 as an assistant professor. Later, he served as Department Chair from 1976 to 1979 and became the Alexis and Margerite Voorhies Professor. Throughout his career he has been invited to lecture at conferences and colleges including Engineering Conferences International, United Engineering Foundation, University of Cambridge, and NATO Advance Studies Institue. In 2005, after 35 years of service with LSU, he retired from teaching and now continues his three research programs as Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering.</p>
<p>During his time he taught several undergraduate courses including topics on Mass and Energy Balances, Heat and Mass Transfer, and Enthalpy of reactions. He also taught the graduate course on reactor design. After his time as Department Chair he worked close with the chemical engineering graduate program as a doctoral and masters dissertations advisor. He helped 10 PH.D students and 28 M.S. students complete their program. For his teaching he has recieved the LSU DOW Award Three times in 1988, 1995, and 2000, which no other professor has done.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-25_0e9c.html" title="Edit section: Research">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Research</span></h3>
<p>Much of Dr. Harrison's research has been focused on separation and reaction engineering. His work has mainly been focused on the noncatalytic gas-solid reactions and separation of gas associated with coal-fired electric power generation. His other research includes new processes for the production of high purity Hydrogen, removal of greenhouse gasses from Flue Gas, and the separation of semi-volatile contaminants from aqueous solutions.</p>
<p>His current research includes three projects:</p>
<p>He continues with his work in "High Efficiency Desulfurization of Synthesis Gas", a project he has been working with for 25 years. Removal of Hydrogen Sulfide helps improve the effeciency of the reaction and removes a potential pollutant. His current research is in line with the Department of Energy Vision 21 concept, which is wanting the hydrogen sulfide content pushed to the sub-ppm levels. Because of his research in this area he was part of the organizing committe for the 1996 NATO Advance Studies Institue in Kusadasi, Turkey. He also was a lecturer and co-editor of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Another project is the reduction of CO2 from Flue Gas using Regenerable Reagents. It is working towards making an economic solution to retrofit existing stacks on power plants to reduce emissions of CO2, a product and pollutant from combustion reactions and thought to be a cause to Global Warming. This project is supported by the Department of Energy and Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina. He was also published in the International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management 2004 - Vol. 4 for his work in this area.</p>
<p>Recognizing Hydrogen as a future in energy Dr. Harrison began his work with new Hydrogen production methods. With Professor Armando Corripio and support from NASA and TDA he has been researching how to produce 95+% Hydrogen with the use of only a single reactor, a project he's been working with for 10 years. Other groups in the US, Japan, and Norway are also incorporating his ideas into their research and in 2001 he was invited to the 4th Advanced Clean Coal International Symposium in Tokyo to discuss his research. For his work in this area, along with colleagues in Los Alamos, Dr. Harrison recieved one of 30 awards in 2001 from the Federal Laboratory Consortium for advancing "Technology in Service to Society."</p>
<p>He currently holds a patent along with Klaus S. Lackner and Hans Zoick for Hydrogen Production from Carbonaceous Material.</p>

I believe it will be useful to have information classifying Pines by the number of needles in a whorl. There are 2 to 5 needles in a whorl of Pine trees. Which Genera have what number of needles. It will help in identifying the Pines we see around us.</p>

<p>I have checked Sanders, Encyclopaedia of Gardening. They say there are 2 to 5 needles in a whorl but do not identify which genera has how many needles.</p>

<p>Literally, vocal tiredness. Caused by overuse of the voice, either through singing, or speech, or shouting. This can often be blamed on singing too high or too low, or using a damaging vocal techinique (one that puts undue pressure on the vocal cords). Especially found in pop singers where a "belting" technique is used. Professionals often use extended vocal exercises to warm up the voice in order to prevent this kind of fatigue.</p>
<p><br />
Further, the subject is split into two catogories, identified as Muscle fatigue and Tissue fatigue. Muscular fatigue cased by overuse. Tissue fatigue caused by damaging the vocal cords themselves (often through lack of preparation - i.e. nt drinking enough water)</p>

<p>In 1978 I was born in England where I was brought up in London going to the most prestige schools in England and perhaps the world. By the time I was 20 I had decided to dedicate my life to teaching. I followed this path by going to Harvard to further my studies in Teaching and studies of child behaviour. After I had finished these degrees I moved to Australia to use my expertise to teach the children of Woodcrest College. Through these actions I have also won a Noble peace prize for creating peace between students and teachers. I have also published a best bookseller called "Teachers are always Right". I have also been recognised by the WTA (World Teachers Association) for my dedication to teaching.</p>

Larvaceans are small, ocean dwelling creatures approximately four inches (ten centimeters) in length that resemble tadpoles. They are thought by scientists to be resposible for the previously unaccountable supply of food available at great ocean depths. The creatures themselves are not the food source that resolved the long-standing mystery of just where all the life on the sea floor was obtaining its food.</p>
<p>Larvaceans spin a 'web' of mucus that they use to filter food out of sea water. They cannot eat all of the food that is trapped in their webs - called 'houses' by marine biologists - so they abandon the webs. The webs then sink to the ocean floor, along with a small but significant amount of trapped food.</p>

<p>Larvaceans are known to engage in Vertical Migration, whereby they swim to depths as great as 2,500 feet durring the day and return to the surface at night. At the surface they mate and build their mucus 'houses'.</p>

<p>Himiko (卑弥呼, c.175?–248?), also read as Pimiku, was a female ruler of Yamataikoku, an ancient state-like formation thought to have been located either in the Yamato region or in northern Kyushu of present-day Japan. Few records are available and little is known about her, and the location of Yamataikoku is the subject of a great, often emotionally charged, debate that has been raging since the late Edo period.</p>
<p>According to an ancient Chinese history book, Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms, Himiko was a shaman who controlled people through her paranormal abilities. The Nihonshoki, an old Japanese history book, notes that Himiko was actually Empress Jingū Kogo, the mother of Emperor Ōjin, but historians disagree. Some speculate that she is conflated with Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess.</p>
<p>The Chinese chronicles book (that was compiled in 297 CE) refers to the inhabitants of the Japanese islands simply as the Wa, literally, "The Little People".</p>
<p>Furthermore, it describes a fragmented political structure of more than a hundred or more separate tribes, nominally ruled by a female shaman, Queen Himiko.</p>
<p>Some have, due to intuition, proposed that Himiko would have been a ruler of Jomon period, an archaeological age when the religion was a goddess religion, as indicated by figurine evidence, and the population generally was Austronesian/Malayo-Polynesian, ancestors of e.g the today Ainu peoples. However, that timing is patently incorrect, since the latest discoveries of Jomon remnants are from c 300 BCE, five centuries earlier than Himiko's lifetime as anchored by said Chinese records. Moreover, much of the other evidence, including her name, links Himiko to proto-Yamato people, who just migrated there in late Jomon era and started Yayoi period, into which Himiko and her people are tentatively classified. Traditions of Jomon culture, such as reverence to female godheads and a priestess-led society, as well as very large villages and still small, tribal groups being units of political power, in a proto-agricultural economic setting, may have influenced the societies of Yayoi settlers and be one of reasons of the cultural structure of Himiko society.</p>
<p>According to an ancient Korean history book, Samguk Sagi, Himiko, as queen of Japan, sent an embassy to King Adalla of Silla in May 172. However, Chinese history books record Silla as having been established on 356, which casts doubt on this claim.</p>
<p>Himiko never married and it is recorded that her younger brother assisted her as a political advisor. She is said to have had one thousand female servants and to have never appeared in public.</p>
<p>In ca. 188 CE, Himiko ascended to paramountcy and in 248 CE she died. There are indications that a tribal king, posthumously now known as Emperor Shujin, raised military host against queen Himiko or her successor (reportedly another shaman, her niece or other relative), ultimately conquering their position and establishing male rule with headquarters in central Japan.</p>
<p>The precise pronunciation of her name is unknown. The Himiko reading derives from her name as represented in kanji, which was written 卑彌呼 prior to mid-20th century kanji reforms. Himiko may have been a chinese corruption of himemiko, princess-priestess, or lady shaman. The name is said to mean "Sun Daughter". There are assessments that she is the real person upon whom the myth of sun goddess Amaterasu is built.</p>

Dillonism. While it was almost unheard of for many years it had been there lurking in the darkness. A word so terrifying it could have only come from the sick twisted minds of two college students. Of course while it had been a made up word at the time it quickly gained notoriety as a proper english word by simple word of mouth. Well actually it was more simple mirroring of wikipedia.</p>
<p>Dillonism the word originally came to light on wikipedia with the following description...</p>
<p><i>...Dillonism is a term referring to a joke of such insufferable, nonsensical randomness deriving from a rare mental illness that it has no basis in the english language as a joke yet has strangely been given merit by certain parties in the world today. Strangely enough though it has only been recorded in Ireland specifically centered around one person. This strange being has been creating such nonsensical rubbish for many years now.</i></p>
<p>The progenator of the dillonism is one Alan Dillon. This brave soul has been afflicted by a terrible mental illness since birth and has spewed forth these dismal attempts at humour for the full length of his life. Unfortunately for this poor soul we do believe that such non-humorous "jokes" and the condition they are caused by may considerably decrease his life span. Though the two arent thought to be connected in any direct way....</p>
<p>Since then there have been many discussions about the authenticity of the word and its meaning. The strange thing is that while all the discussion was going on about the word and its overall meaning and whether it was "real" or not the discussions themselves were giving the word the notoriety it needed to be a "real" word. Since the time of the original wikipedia article the word itself has become used quite often around the iternet. In some cases the word has been used in conjunction with acts of stupidity.</p>
<p>The riginal creators of the word had themselves even gone as far as to base a mock website about the progenator of te word one Alan Dillon with his express permission no less. While the site itself did not get much attention from them due to exams and the ending college term and so it was never fully realised and as such is still "under construction". It has recently been moved to a new location and this can only lead us to assume that the site shall become fully operational some time soon.</p>

These vessels were Germany's pre-dreadnoughts and, unlike those of other powers, had a lighter main armament and a greater number of secondary guns. The 9.4in (240mm) guns were in twin turrets fore and aft, with six 5.9in (150mm) in small single turrets on the upper deck and the rest in armoured casemates. The great weight of the armament meant that it was not possible on the limited displacement to adequately protect the hull: a narrow belt of armour ran for four-fifths of the lenght, and no protection was given to the high hull sides.</p>

Michael Hertz</p>
<p>Michael Hertz founded Michael Hertz Associates, a graphic design firm specializing in maps and environmental graphics for mass transit systems, in New York City in 1969 and he remains principal of the firm. MHA is best known for its design of the 1979 New York City Subway Map, but the firm’s work includes many other transit projects in the New York City metropolitan area as well as maps for major transit systems such as Houston, Texas and Washington, DC and other smaller transit systems throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>The subway map, which replaced a critically praised but publicly unpopular abstract design by Massimo Vignelli, was extremely popular (the basic design has remained in use almost unchanged since 1979), because it represents a perhaps the first attempt to combine the design sensibility of an abstract map with the comfort of recognizable geography of a traditional map. While the geography looks like New York to the casual observer, it has been carefully and extensively manipulated to improve legibility in congested areas. Much of the design credit for this map goes to the artist and designer Nobu Siraisi, who worked for MHA during the period this map was under development.</p>
<p>In addition to its transit system work, Michael Hertz Associates has also produced a wide variety of maps and related designs for clients including the U.S. Department of the Army Center of Military History, the New York City Law Department and numerous clients in the business, non-profit and public sectors.</p>
<p>MHA is the recipient of many transit design awards, including The National Endowment for the Arts' Commendations for Design Excellence, and the firm’s work has appeared in a Smithsonian Institution traveling exhibition and an American Passenger Transport Association manual on excellence in transit system map design.</p>

Cixiidae is one of the larger planthopper families, distributed world-wide, comprising more than 150 genera from over 2.000 species. All species are comparatively small (few mm body size) and usually inconspicuous. Nymphs live subterraneous, feeding on roots. Adults feed on herbs, shrubs and/or trees, some are polyphagous, others are specialised on specific host plants (monophagous). Females often bear impressive "wax tails" produced by a wax plates at the tip of their abdomen. A couple of species are cavernicolous, feeding on roots in caves of usually volcanic origin. Several species are of economic importance, transmitting diseases as Stolbur phytoplasma, Grapevine bois noir phytoplasma, Coconut foliar decay virus and Phormium yellow leaf phytoplasma: Hyalesthes obsoletus on grapes in Europe and Near East, Haplaxius crudus and Haplaxius taffini on coconut palms in the Americas and on Pacific Islands, Oliarus atkinsoni on flax lily in New Zealand, and Pentastiridius beieri on sugar beet in Southern Europe.</p>

<p>Frankland townsite derives its name from its location just to the east of the Frankland River. The town today is small in comparison to many towns in the south west of Western Australia, but as in the case of many towns, it is growing steadily as local farmers and business people invest in town property either to live in or to establish as rental properties. The town is in the Shire of Cranbrook and is situated west of the Albany Highway, south -west of Kojonup, north of Rocky Gully and East of Manjimup. The town and region of Frankland or Frankland River (in Western Australia) as it used to be known, was named by a surgeon called Doctor Thomas Braidwood Wilson in 1829.(1)</p>
<p>The town and region was known as Frankland River until 1935 until the building of a post office when it is said that the postmaster shortened the name as it was considered too long to fit on signs and documents.(2) The quiet country town of Frankland has an active community spirit as shown in the recent construction of a stone-clad community building. This building is recognized as a positive sign that people are building for the future as buildings in the past were of fibro sheeting, giving the town a temporary look. Other buildings in the townsite are the townhall,a Country Club, the Frankland Village shops , the General Store, a garage, a Catholic church , a Baptist Church as well as a Primary School and numerous homes.</p>

<p>Frankland is in an 'off the main road' part of the State of Western Australia, but is very much on the map when it comes to its excellent wines, fat lambs,cattle, wool,and olive oil production. Tourism is on the increase as many people discover this picturesque pasture land and olive and vineyard covered hillsides as you drive into the Franklnad River valley. The standard of accomodation is however in its early days but there is a pleasant caravan and camping site in the main townstite, comfortable and well equiped chalets at both Alkoomi and Ferngrove and hotel accommodation at nearby Rocky Gully and Cranbrook. A locally run restaurant, the "Spurtle" caters for evening meals and lunches of locally grown Marron can be had on request at a local farm. Lake Poorarecup is a fresh water natural lake, east of the townsite, used for recreational watersports, swimming and camping. Lake Unicup to the west of the townsite and a short distance off the road to Manjimup is also a popular recreation spot.</p>

<p>From humble beginnings as a very small town in the early 1900's, Franland has grown with the influx of war veterans following World War Two, mill workers,shearing teams, seasonal workers on local vineyards and olive groves, townsfolk, farmers and retirees. Today there is a thriving local community, as shown in the recent building of a stone clad community centre. Originally settled by farming families in the late 1800's, due to its good soils, consistent, reliable rainfall, rivers and lakes, the land was cleared of its heavy Wandoo, Jarrah and Marri to make way for pastures for grazing and arable land for cropping.</p>

<p>The Hydralisk is a warrior species that fights for the [[[Zerg]]] under the influence of the [[[Overmind]]]. The Hydralisk started life as a peaceful, herbivorous, caterpillar-like alien which the Overmind found living on a distant world whose identity remains unknown. The Slothien were assimilated into the swarm to produce one of the most fierce, diabolical species the Zerg have ever come across. The Overmind supercharged the Slothien DNA to twist the once peaceful creatures into gigantic, fierce, nightmarish Hydralisk beasts.

<p>The term "admixture" is used principally by DNA Researchers to describe a persons mixed heritage that has been passed down to him/her by their generations of ancestors. A person could be an "admixture" of the following groups: Europeans, Native Americans, Africans and East Asians. I personally am an "admixture" of 66% sub-saharan African, 31% European and 3% East Asian. Go to any DNA genomics genealogy web site and you will find this term used over and over.</p>

<p>The web site that I would recommend is the one that I used to determine the percentage of admixture that I have. It is: www.AncestyByDNA.com. There you will find a mountain of reading on percentages of "admixture", as well as definitions and research on the subject. 67.72.98.85 20:34, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Este Municipio es uno de los punto de turismo ecologico mas importante de la zona puertoplateña donde se puede disfrutar del aire fresco de la montana que que mueve los muchos arboles centenario de origen endemico que nos da la impresion de estar en la selva virgen de sur America.</p>
<p>El sonido melodioso que nace cuando se conjuga el cantar de los pajaros y el sonar de los rios Guananico y Caonao nos invitan a darnos un sapucharnos por sus aguas cristalina y por si esto le resultara poco en este lugar se pueden encontrar cavernas habitada a la llegada de Colon por indigenas.</p>
<p>No pierda la inolvidable oportunidad de encontrarse con la naturaleza pura y simple.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugs_Bunny_5903.html" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> short produced by Warner Bros. This short saw the return of Bugs playing tricks on a dog instead of <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmer_Fudd_035e.html" title="Elmer Fudd">Elmer Fudd</a>. In the short, Bugs meets and tricks the dog like normal. Even going as far as going underwater for the remainder of the short. Some controversy surrounds the end in which Bugs agrees to let the dog eat him in a sandwich, the dog takes a big bite at the far end of the sandwich, causing Bugs to have a "death" speech. In reality, Bugs pulled his legs up and did not get bit. The main controversy, however, is the dog then wishing he was dead after thinking he killed Bugs. In the original ending, Bugs hands him a gun and proceeds to seemingly "shoot" himself. This part has been edited out for TV airings and instead goes to the next frame where the dog is laying down with a flower on top of him as Bugs strolls away. The dog then stops the closing black circle and says "This shouldn't even happen to a dog." He then pushes the circle back only to have the circle close on his nose</p>

Fast KARL (acronym for Kinetic, Artist, Robotic, Life form, or K.A.R.L. ) is a skirted robot fully atonomus and originaly created for generating unique abstract graffitti artwork by responding to the electronic sensores built into its undercarriage and through feedback sensores in its drive train. The electronic brain or computational unit is made of analog operational amplifier circuits wired in such fashion as to allow the machine to seem almost alive at times as it interacts with the matrix of canvas and paint during performances. The analog computer circuits form a simple neural network similar in fashion to that of the human brain and its array of neurons which permits the robot to "feel" the work it is creating.</p>
<p>The artwork generated is a collaberation between the robot Fast KARL and its creator Fred Wilder. The use of found objects and the inclusion of artwork by other artists have produced results that are Fluxus in nature. The robot Fast KARL has apeared in two films to date tilteld Scream KARL, and KARL Bites.</p>

Odontogriphus (literally "toothed riddle") is a genus of relatively large animals from the famous mid-Cambrian fossil deposits of the Burgess Shale in British Columbia. Growing as large as 12 centimetres long, Odontogriphus is a dorso-ventrally flattened bilaterian, oval in shape, with a ventral U-shaped mouth surrounded by small protrusions.</p>
<p>Initially collected by Charles Dolittle Walcott, Odontogriphus was rediscovered and named by Simon Conway-Morris in the re-evaluation of the Burgess Shale fossils in the 1970s. Represented by only a single specimen Conway-Morris proposed the protrusions around the mouth were probably lophophores, and reconstructed the animal as a free-swimming creature either in or related to the Lophophora. It is reasonable to assume part of his reasoning in believing it was free-swimming is the scarcity of specimens. Nearly all the Burgess genera represented by single specimens are clearly active swimmers, with fins and/or paddles.</p>
<p>In July 2006 Nature reported that another 189 specimens of the same species O. omalus, had been discovered, and some had been exceptionally well preserved. The new specimens show evidence of gill-like structures, arranged around the "foot", and evidence of a radula, a structure made up of rows of small tooth-like protrusions. This is a characteristic feature of molluscs and points to Odontogriphus belonging to this phylum. Moreover at around 510 million years old Odontogriphus is currently the oldest known soft-bodied mollusc.</p>
<p>It is now believed that O. omalus crawled over bacterial mats, scraping food into its mouth with its radula, rather than swimmimg freely, although it is possible it could swim if necessary, to escape predation or find pastures new.</p>
<p>The newly studied specimens of Odontogriphus, rooting as they do the molluscan line back so far with fair certainty, have caused speculation that Odontogriphus and another Burgess "proto-mollusc", Wiwaxia, may be closely related, having similar radula structures, and that they both may be descended from even older organisms, such as Kimberella. This indicates that the phylum Mollusca may have roots as far back as the late Precambrian.</p>
