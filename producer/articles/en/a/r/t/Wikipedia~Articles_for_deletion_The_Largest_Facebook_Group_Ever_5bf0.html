<li><b>Comment:</b> I am wondering why this page is being deleted. If this page does not seem to have merit or importance then I strongly disagree. Just because this group has not been in any newspapers does not mean that it has no importance. This group is a vital part of the social networking website known as Facebook and it is imperative that this page remain available to those who are new to the group and would like to find out what this group is all about. Many times people who are new to the group on Facebook wonder what the history of the group is and this Wikipedia entry can inform them rather than having the regulars on the wall explain everything every single time. Also, this Wikipedia entry should be allowed to remain because of it's importance to those who belong to the group. Many members of TLFGE love using Wikipedia and this entry is sure to only increase their love even more. I certainly felt that way when an entry was created for my high school. I'm sure that the existence of the group's Wiki entry will encourage members of TLFGE to continue using Wikipedia and possibly introduce Wikipedia to people who have never used it before thereby securing even more Wikipedia users. Thanks.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I agree that TLFGE is a fad but doesn't the fact that it is a part of Facebook also make TLFGE verifiable? TLFGE is just a subset of Facebook but it is a very large subset. Out of 7.5 million members in Facebook, TLFGE has 780,000. I would say that is a large enough number to verify that this group has the right to a wiki entry. Also, the group is not just a fad in the US. There are many international Facebookers who are also in the group. I myself have made many international friends from the wall and I would never have met them if they group had not existed. Considering my personal experiences (which I know others have had similar experiences) completely relate to the goal of Facebook (social networking), this group certainly has merit and I would like to give credit to this group on wiki.

<li><b>Reply:</b> Being a fad is exactly why this doesn't belong in Wikipedia. The problem is that no one else but people already within the Facebook group would be writing it -- we have to take your word and your word alone. What if you were to stop monitoring this page and someone adds a lie? The rest of the editors on Wikipedia wouldn't be able to tell what was was true and what wasn't because there are simply no 3rd party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiy</a> anything written in the article at all. That's simply unacceptable in an encyclopedia. An article on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> can be verified because we can cite journalists who have investigated Facebook and much more likely to have fact-checked their statements before writing it from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. My philosophy on notability is this: you are only notable when someone else writes about you, not when you decide to write about yourself. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 06:30, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> "Does lack of fame make a vanity article?<br />
An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see Template:IncGuide). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.<br />
Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.<br />
The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.<br />
