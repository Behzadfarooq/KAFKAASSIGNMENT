<li>This isn't systemic bias. A similiar article about any country's blogs would have similiar problems.

<li><b>The article at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> is presently <i>very</i> US-centric, and coverage of Canadian bloggers is <i>required</i> in some manner.</b> Either <b>keep</b> or <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> as a Canadian section; the topic is most certainly not any <i>less</i> encyclopedic than the exclusively American examples currently cited at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then perhaps cleanup of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> is in order. Not saying I should do it, but why exactly are there *examples of blogs* in an article about blogs, you've seen one, you've seen them all, a simple one-paragraph description of what a blog is should suffice. The whole blog thing is blown out of proportion. --Timecop 06:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Do we need something describing what blogs are for every country? What makes Canada so special? All of this information is just repeatative of what blogging in general is. 131.128.142.226 06:44, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a no-brainer in the Canadian media; this is used as part of any good barometer of Canadian public opinion. Deleting this article would be a mistake, and I think significantly demonstrates an offhand US systemic bias on Wikipedia. It *is* tantamount to saying that Canadian political debate (which naturally contains a lot of debate about US policy, for reasons any Canadian would see as obvious (US policy has arguably as much effect on Canada as Canadian policy)) is irrelevant. As a Canadian, I'm inclined to object to that. References to PB or 'Canadian Blogosphere' as 'non-notable' here seem to be offhand and poorly informed. I don't hesitate to say that an American isn't going to be naturally inclined to make an informed choice about this. There are, after all, only 30 million Canadians. . . for US perspective, that's NYC and surrounding areas, and we're a pretty politically splintered group. That said, the Alexa rankings make perfect sense, and actually don't justify deletion based on overall popularity. Overall popularity among whom? Americans interested in Canadian political scandals? "What makes Canada so special?" What makes the US so special that most references in 'blogging' are pulled from the US (and refer to it)? Is there a US or pan-global content requirement for a Wikipedia article to be relevant? I wasn't aware that there was.
<ul>
<li>You're making an argument to fix the U.S. bias in the other articles, not to keep this particular one. There is nothing special about Canadian blogs, and there is also nothing special about U.S. blogs, so no article should be biased towards either. Incidentally, before you go assuming I'm demonstrating bias here myself, let me add that I'm British... and I would vote to delete British Blogosphere, if it existed. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:07, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm actually making the argument that this is a form of political dialogue that is rather important in Canada, and that if, perhaps, the article ought to be about anything other than what it is (which is bewildering, IMO), it ought to be about or include a distinct section about the mechanism by which the Canadian media interacts with this specific set of blogs, and the reason why they have such an effect on the political debate in Canada. That is notable, IMO. These sites are simply not what these delete votes claim. Sigma-6</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, The article is well written, I agree with Simon.Pole, it is bias to non-Amercian articles, if there was a article of Amercian blogospheres it wouldn't of been vfd'd. To 131.128.142.226's comments, what makes Amercians so special? They bomb countries for oil?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't want to speculate on the suitability of this article itself, but I'd be a happy man if we could move this to Canadian blogs or somewhere similar.

<li>I really, really hope people will explain their reasoning for keeping or deleting as it relates to editorial policies and the objections to the content. Assuming sinister anti-left or anti-Canada motives is not helpful. Also, just because there are equally unverifiable articles on other topics does not make <i>this</i> a proper article. This isn't written as an article, it's written as a personal essay. I'm willing to accept that blogs are significant to Canadian politics. But, this is a recent movement, and if no proper sources are available on this topic, there's no way to have an article about it. Making it <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> is impossible without a sufficient number of reliable sources. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:40, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I fail to see how the blogosphere is a "recent movement". The word was coined at the latest in 2002, and one assumes what it describes was going on for some time before that. I also fail to see why a Canadian article somehow needs to be rolled into a larger American article to be valid.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 20:45, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Has absolutely nothing to say other than "hey, there are bloggers in Canada, and they do the same stuff as bloggers everywhere else!" Except when it makes <b>unsupported and unverifiable</b> claims like "weblogs of a political nature have a particularly high visibility in Canada, perhaps more so than other countries". Merge any useful content into other articles like <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">Blogosphere</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a>, to counter the U.S. bias perceived there, but there is no reason to keep this as an article in its own right. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 17:03, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is getting silly. There is systemic bias on Wikipedia <i>in favor of all things internet-related</i>. This article's existance is <i>helped</i> by the bias, not hurt by it. This is not an "American article versus Canadian article" issue- Wikipedia is meant for the whole world, not just two particular countries. There should be no such thing as an American article or Canadian article, they're all just articles. But, the big issue here is the <b>lack of verifiability</b>. This is a broad, new topic. I don't see how it's going to be possible to write a proper article (rather than a personal essay) on this topic unless there are good secondary sources available. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 00:39, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Until there's a consensus that there should be no country specific blogosphere article, this is a reasonable entry.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: As for the country specific blogosphere articles, to me this is a no-brainer. Blogs, by their very nature as websites, are global. You can group them together sensibly only by their subject matter. Should we have an article about the "Pizza blogosphere" (blogs about pizza)? Until reliable sources are talking about the "Canadian blogosphere" as an identifiable thing, I still can't see how this could be verifiable. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 03:50, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b>. One of Wikipedia's recognised strengths is that it is up-to-date, especially on recent phenomena. We have articles on every single imaginable video game, most music albums you care to mention, practically every single piece of software out there, a number of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">usenet</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsgroups.html" title="Newsgroups">newsgroups</a>, Wikipedia did better than the regular news media on recent events such as the London bombings and Hurricane Katrina, and so on. Where else but Wikipedia can people find hopefully neutral information on the recent and increasingly important phenomenon of blogging, especially political blogs, which are not neutral by their very nature. NPOV articles on Blogging groups (not necessarily individual blogs, mind you), perform a vital service to the world at large. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 04:08, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> So what? that is called a <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">personal attack</a>, and has nothing to do with this VFD <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamn_4c83.html" title="User:Adamn">Adamn</a> 11:15, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It doesn't matter one bit if this is organised by GNAA or whoever. They give their reasons and they are following procedure. It's legitimate. - <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandwicked_8ae2.html" title="User:Randwicked">Randwicked</a> 11:23, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>My personal pass-time should be none of your concern. All the VFD's for blog-related stuff that *I* created are valid though. And I didn't 'start' the effort, I simply extended it. --Timecop 11:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Vote stacking is neither legitimate nor "following procedure". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>But the subsequent zany antics of one side or another don't or shoudn't affect the validity of the original nomination, which is what I was calling legitimate. - <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandwicked_8ae2.html" title="User:Randwicked">Randwicked</a> 10:32, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The original nomintator <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrewler_3446.html" title="User:Skrewler">Skrewler</a>, however, is in on the GNAA blog-delete project, working in concert with GNAA President User:Timecop.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 10:55, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry to say that I really don't see the relevance. So Timecop and Skrewler are big bad trolls. Point me to where they have been vandalising blog pages and I'll agree something needs to be done. Rampantly nominating blog-related articles for deletion isn't against any rule I know of, even if they are being provocative about it. - <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandwicked_8ae2.html" title="User:Randwicked">Randwicked</a> 12:28, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

The article in its current state is informative, but sadly, that is only true in the two <i>Political blogs</i> sections; the <i>Blogs and Authority</i> and the <i>External links</i> sections are simply useless.
