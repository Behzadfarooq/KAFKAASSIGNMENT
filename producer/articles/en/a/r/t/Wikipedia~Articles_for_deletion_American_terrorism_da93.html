As I play with this article, I think it is the foundation for an article that has real merit.... Terrorism committed by US citizens or the US government. Maybe we could call it Terrorism in the US. "American Terrorism" is just such a loaded term.</p>

<li>One country attacking another country is not terrorism. One country supporting counter-revolution in another country is not terrorism.

<ul>
<li>On the surface what you are saying is accurate. However, is supporting terrorism terrorism? For example, funding insurgents in foreign countries, as the US has done, or let's say we had concrete proof that a foreign goverment aided the people who carried out the Sept.11 actack. Would the support of the terrorists be terrorism? I don't know! There are a lot of definitions of terrorism, one being: acts of violence against civiliians for the purpose of creating social change. How does funding/training people to do the acts of violence to that create the chang YOU want fit in?

<li><b>Delete</b>. I put up the initial NPOV tag; this is more a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemic.html" title="Polemic">polemic</a> than an article. The factual content is covered by <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html#United_States" title="State terrorism">State terrorism#United States</a>. (Click on the "Israeli terrorism" link above and see where that goes.) With regards to the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>, see that article for an encapsulation of criticism, plus the seven or so other articles it Wikilinks to which are dedicated to criticism in and of themselves. The source of the term itself is spurious--a lone column on CNN. If you bother to read the CNN column, you'll discover that it actually discusses acts of <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism.html" title="Domestic terrorism">Domestic terrorism</a>. As for <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassinations</a>, those generally are not considered to be terrorist acts. (See the UN definition of terrorism, for instance.) <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a> does not fall under the auspices of terrorism. The author seems to have unilaterally decided that there is no difference between <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> and terrorism. (The UN sees a difference!) The use of weapons of mass destruction is not automatically a terrorist action. (And as for the U.S. being the only country to use WMDs: not by a long shot. The author doesn't seem to understand what constitutes a weapon of mass destruction; the definition changes every time the guns get bigger, so to speak.)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though it certainly needs cleanup. Not yet NPOV, but that's not the issue. Whether an idea offends us or seems (in some subjective way) inherently contradictory is not the point. People are using this term, including [<a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com/american_terrorism.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.robert-fisk.com/american_terrorism.htm" rel="nofollow">prominent journalists</a>].

<ul>
<li>Could a NPOV article be written on American terrorism? Sure. The issue here is that this article needs so much work that it's just easier to start over. If someone wants to write <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism_in_the_United_States_461d.html" title="Terrorism in the United States">Terrorism in the United States</a> or Terrorism by Americans, no one is stopping them. Keeping this specific article doesn't make any sense because it needs a complete overhaul. Deleting this article doesn't mean that a substantially different and much better article can't exist. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:16, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm afraid I have to disagree. We're talking about the term, and this locution wouldn't be covered by Terrorism by Americans. It looks like some people with ideological motives wish to whitewash the term, despite the fact that this phrase is manifestly notable in usage. That's not the way we do things here. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 17:20, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>In addition, it appears that this article was made in bad faith. The author (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a>) created the article with the edit summary "<i>So, now im just waiting for the VFD, POV tag and such...)</i>". He removed a NPOV tag placed by another user and stopped editing completely after it was put up for deletion. There's no sign at all that he's interested in making this a good article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:21, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>OK, so delete the article and rewrite it, starting fresh. How can anything in the current article be of help to other editors? Remember, another article created with the same title can <i>not</i> be speedily deleted if the content is substantially different (which any good article on the subject would be). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, we disagree. The principle here is important. If the article needs revision to get to basic NPOV standards, other editors, including me, can help to do that. The fact that you believe nothing on the current article is salvageable is subjective and (if I may) only tangentially relevant to the question of whether this <b>title</b> for an article should be rejected here. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 17:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The Google test is a wee bit skewed here. A search for "American terrorism" yields 77,000 results, sure. Remove "Latin," "South American," and "Anti-American" from the search, and it drops to 14,000. If you cut "expert" (as in "American terrorism expert"), it gets even lower. At that point, an astonishing number of the results are, in fact, copies of that article by Robert Fisk and many more are articles directly relating to the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attacks_of_September_11%2C_2001_7060.html" title="Attacks of September 11, 2001">Attacks of September 11, 2001</a>. The duplication is vast. Google test, therefore, is something of a canard and hard to apply in this case.. (Google for "Presidential blowjob"; I bet that'll meet the standards for a notable term, too.) Additionally, I second the on the article's creation being in bad faith on the grounds previously stated: it might as well be titled "Things the Original Author Does Not Like About the United States, So Come and Argue With Him About It." The argument that this article is validated by the fact that it is Wikilinked to on the State terrorism article and therefore is an expansion on the topic is ridiculous; I think we can all agree on that. The issues, as I see them, are then: 1.) The article is fairly clearly advocating a certain point of view. 2.) The article contains a very large amount of original research. 3.) The factual material present is listed elsewhere without the rampant POV. 4.) Personal opinion: <i>We don't want to promote this article model.</i> If we let this one go for whatever reason (be it belief that the article is suitable or personally held anti-American sentiment), we'll shortly have other articles like it for dozens of other countries. For instance: French Terrorism (They colonized Vietnam and oppress Muslim citizens.) German terrorism. (Battle of Britain, the Holocaust, et cetera.) Japanese terrorism. (The occupation of Korea, perhaps.) These examples are more or less in line with the material presented here. I have no doubt that a.) we don't want this kind of deliberately inflammatory rhetoric on Wikipedia and b.) that if we used the arguments against deletion being put forth here, the existence of these hypothetical articles could be justified.

If this one gets by, a weak <i>de facto</i> policy decision has been made saying that this sort of article is okay, and it opens the door for the retaliatory creation of a mass of other pages in its vein.</dd>

<dd>It does. For the record, I have had my own (amply documented) problems with Striver in the past. Neither those problems nor the points you raise above, however, demonstrate for me that there should <i>never</i> be an article about this term's usage. In this case, we may well have an example of bad faith editing that has resulted in an article title that does not merit deletion, but rather rewrite and/or redirect. For now, I'm leaning toward rewrite, though I certainly respect other opinions on the matter. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 20:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's a poltically loaded neologism and a carefully conducted Google search will, as noted above, reveal a rather low count of usages in the context primarily being advocated here.</dd>

<dd>If, as has been proposed above, the article is about "acts of terrorism committed by the United States government," then we have a legitimate extension of the State terrorism article, which would more properly be termed "Terrorism Sponsored by the United States." To maintain NPOV, however, actions taken by the United States would have to be judged as terroristic or conventional by the standards used to judge other countries discussed in State Sponsored terrorism. Neither the current article's title nor its content serve that purpose or meet those (reasonable) conditions.</dd>

<dd>If the article is to discuss domestic terrorism in the United States (which has also been suggested above), then the article would rightly be named "Domestic Terrorism in the United States." (Incidentally, that would be more in line with the CNN article currently being used as a source for the term "American terrorism.") As it stands, the article almost seems to suggest that the Ku Klux Klan and the Beltway Sniper were inventions of the U.S. Government.</dd>

I suppose they more rightly belong with a list of proven conspiracy theories, but certainly not here.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I guess I don't fully understand. Is the page to be about the term <i>american terrorism</i>, who's using it, et cetra? Or is it to be about domestic terrorism in the U.S.? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 23:35, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I'm confused</b> as per Tom harrison. As an article about <i>the term</i>, it is largely devoid of content, so if that was the intention of the article, then delete. As an article about the thing the term refers to <i>only</i>, it needs to be renamed as per the above suggestions (state terrorism enacted by the united states etc.). Really, it can and should be about both, but then needs to be much more informative about the reference, as a bare minimum for achieving NPOV about the referent. In its present form, whatever the intention, I vote <b>delete</b>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - On second thought, I guess it's not "supposed" to be anything other than what we the editors make it. The article was written to prove a point, and the present content reflects that. But <i>American terrorism</i>, as terrorism by Americans directed at other Americans, is a reasonable title and topic for an encyclopedia article. I'm thinking of Oklahoma City, the Klan, the abolitionists, maybe tar-and-feathering loyalists during the Revolution. Hmm...What about native American raiding parties? That could get interesting. <i>American terrorism</i> as a term is also legitimate. Obviously all the content there now has to go; Whatever appears under the title has to fit the title. It should be an encyclopedia article, not a place to spew anti-American venom. I think the title is legitimate as long as the content matches it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tom_harrison" rel="nofollow">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">(talk)</a></sup> 00:45, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Since all the content there now has to go, isn't that essentially a deletion? Wouldn't it be easier to start from scratch? I fully agree that an article can, and probably should, exist there, but this is a complete tear-down job. Why not delete until such time that someone decides to write a real article? It's not as if anything in the history is going to be helpful to future editors of the article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 00:52, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Could some minimal stub go up, or a redirect to <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_terrorism.html" title="Domestic terrorism">domestic terrorism</a>?

<li>This sounds vaguely like a suggestion that I am an unworldly idiot. Once more, with feeling: as an article on the term in and of itself, I don't feel that the TERM is widespread enough to merit an individual article. (Mr. Toropov and I have gone up and down and left and right on this issue; it's covered quite thorougly elsewhere in the discussion.) <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAPBOX_345c.html" title="WP:SOAPBOX">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. Rehashing facts about American transgressions that are covered in detail elsewhere on Wikipedia then and terming these transgressions as "American terrorism" because classifying actions as terroristic is trendy is merit enough for a new article. I'm not some flag-waving boob <i>who doesn't see what happens in the broader world</i>. When politicians, newsmakers, journalists, and academics begin to trot out this term with enough regularity to make it a concretely-definable neologism and for it to pass a reasonable notability test, I'll start the bloody article myself. But as for now, it is nothing more than a soapbox with which to say "I don't like the United States and this is an eye-catching way to make that known." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 03:49, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>"American terrorism" is more than a trendy term. It's a term that encompases modern American foreign policy, U.S. war policy, U.S. influence on other nations, and increasingly, the relationship between civilians and government officials inside the United States. It's all terrorism. It's all the American government saying, "Be good, or bad things will happen to you," and then backing that up by making all manner of bad things happen. Those inside the box have no idea what I'm talking about, but most of the world lives outside of the U.S./U.K. punishment box and will do anything to keep it that way. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 04:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Sigh</i>. Yes. Domestically, I like to call that "American fascism." The laugh-out-loud absurdity of this whole thing is beginning to drive me batty. You and I would probably end up at the same damned protest parade, I think. The problem is that here on Wikipedia, we have to have our discourse within the consensus-derived policies and guidelines. This article doesn't mesh with those rules because it simply isn't encyclopedic. It's the soapboxy discussion of a term that doesn't meet notability guidelines. Your outrage is noted and appreciated and agreed with; this is just not the place to advocate it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 04:41, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The point (as I think you know by now, Tom) is not that any individual has outrage, but rather that the term itself has become a globally notable one.</li>
<li>As for whether the term has been used widely enough to be encyclopedic, I find it very hard to believe that it is less notable than, say, Unitarian Jihad. See the <b>multiple representative mainstream sources</b> I have referenced below, which are only a very small sampling. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 12:06, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dozens, perhaps. You have to massage Google to get at what you're after. I get 119 references in 58 books looking for mentions where American terrorism isn't prefixed with "anti." I couldn't cut out other limiting factors because of a risk of culling legitimate results in the process. I question the standard of notability you are employing: broadly speaking, I think this is a fairly paltry result. Perhaps some effort should be put into developing a consensus on notability rules? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 21:48, 29 November 2005 (UTC) Wee addendum: I think you're slightly confused about delete policies. The rules do not say "forever." And a discussion about the content of the article in question is valid: determining notability is largely guided by determining definition and intent.</dd>

<dd>That's through Google Books. There are other resources with much bigger universes of references -- academic journals, for instance -- and it was those to which I was referring. I stand by "hundreds," and by the term's notability and mainstream usage. You are correct on the "forever" thing; my bad. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 22:01, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, another prong. Using <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexisNexis_2d15.html" title="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a> (full database access, mind), a search of all news items over the past twelve months reveals 49 results, with AP-repost duplications left intact and without boolean screening for context (removing incidences where it references an American terrorism expert or anti-American terrorism, et cetera). Using JStor and excluding "anti-American terrorism" (retaining mentions of experts, as that would be sort of an idiotic term to exclude in a journal search), I came up with three journal items. (Restricted to the English language.) <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomlillis_dfd4.html" title="User:Tomlillis">Tom Lillis</a> 00:19, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. I don't necessarily dispute the idea of the article (anymore than I'd dispute Soviet Terrorism), but this is lacking in objectivity and scholarly references. Moreover, the term <b>American Terrorism</b> is linguistically broad. "American" can refer to much of the Western Hemisphere, not just the United States of America. Moreover, the term does not distinguish between foreign and domestic terrorism, or the nationality of the perpetrators of domestic terrorism. Finally, the term "terrorist" is inherently POV especially when applied to a sovereign entity. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:16, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
