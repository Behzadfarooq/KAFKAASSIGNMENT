<li>I'm new here so just quick question, is it true that concerns about verification are addressed in the talk page? I'm involved in another request for delete and I keep hearing "verification" as an excuse for delete. I'm just strugging to see if there is any common application of the rules here. I'm guessing there isn't but is that "just the way it operates". I'm also involved in another delete where the nominator (and admin) has come out and said he'll ignore consensus and delete an entry if it isn't cleaned up by the end of the vote. It seems to me the delete process is highly political. true&#160;??? --<a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 20:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>makes sense. I imagine if its a big enough issue there's are other mechanisms (arbitration, etc.). I guess the question becomes how do you decide what's important. ey, yi, yi. It would seem strictly by reference to "the numbers" right? But even that's not enough cause some things are important but only a few people would know (i.e., the esoterica of quantum physics). its enough to make your head spin. anyway, revised my vote to keep. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinar_66e3.html" title="User:Ginar">Ginar</a> 21:16, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Edit, expand, revise, clean-up are all good options. "Delete" is sheer religious bigotry and not a good option. The articles on "Jesus" and "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" are already too long and should not be encumbered more, but maybe merging with "Religious Perspectives on Jesus" sounds like a good idea. - Das Baz, 17 January 2006. P.S. And yes, by all means leave a redirect.
