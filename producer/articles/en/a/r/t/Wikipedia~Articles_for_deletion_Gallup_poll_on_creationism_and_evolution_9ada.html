<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
Some editors said both delete and redirect; ultimately the consensus was that the content already existed in the relevant article (<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>), and that the poll did not warrant its own article. Thus no merge or redirect was performed, and these comments tended to be counted as deletes.<br />

<li>Zero. It's an article spin-off, as described in the guidelines of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a>.

<li>What gives you that idea? How do you describe yourself as -- what was it, "Wikipedia's foremost expert on NPOV"? -- and not realize that proportion plays a role? What you are quoting states that spinout articles are <i>not necessarily</i> POV forks. It was never meant to grant anyone <i>carte blanche</i> to hand-pick the factoids they prefer out of an overview and spin entire articles around them. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:19, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Deletion is best</b>. A redirect is OK by me also, if it helps build consensus. At any rate, <b>this should not have its own article</b>, as I've been saying on various talk pages for a while now.

This is a perfectly good example of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> not a "POV fork" (if by that FM means a page created to promote a particular point of view). <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:39, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You've been saying you're going to merge it for a while now. I've tolerated it so far, but how long with this go on? Please use your User space, not article space, for works-in-progress.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Not sure why we need a running tally, but it sure seems misleading to me to count the redirect voters as a keep. By saying redirect, some editors are saying that this article should not exist on its own. Interpreting that as "keep" is extremely questionable in my opinion. I'm clarifying my comments for the benefit of whoever closes this Afd. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:04, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. There is still no consensus but the "score" is 1 keep, 2 redirect, 2 delete. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 19:15, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If policy has changed from "redirects count as keep", then I owe someone an apology. Last time I read the deletion guidelines, the only choices were Keep or Delete. (When did it change?) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:20, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lately, those who are good at closing Afds have been using actual human judgement and common sense, not simple vote counting, to interpret the results. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ed, saying "redirect" cannot be read as "keep" although it is clearly not "delete". Make sense? Otherwise, you would read my "neutral" as "keep" merely because it isn't "delete", right? Of course not. The result as of now is no consensus to delete (this is "for deletion", after all and not "AfK"). You could always rework it as: "Delete: 2, Not for Deletion: 3" or some such to be accurate but I don't think adding a tally is appropriate to any AfD. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 19:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hope the people who do close this take into consideration the nature of my vote. Gallup is a respected polling organization and its findings are usually meaningful. I don't think this is worthy of an article on its own, but I do agree the material is encyclopedic within the context of a larger piece. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, the title and subject matter are too ambiguous and specific. (meaning, why is a 2001 poll notable/large enough to get an article?) It could stand on its own if moved, rewritten (expanded big time) and notable as a historical analysis of polls (not just gallup) on this subject. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 22:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The poll itself is not noteworthy outside of the article <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>. Polls are inately superfulous because they only gauge sentiment at one particular time.

<li><b>Delete</b> as sub-trivial, better handled in the main article and the reason for its creation is unclear (we don't have articles for most of the other polls Gallup conduct - there are thousands every year and many of them have an outcome designed in from the outset by the questions used).

<li><b>Delete</b>. A data dump. (Wikipedia is not a collection of raw data.) Worse, a POV-selective data dump. Cherry-picked data is actively misleading.

<li><b>Keep</b> only if majorly rewritten: this is actual a fairly famous poll, in that it has been given over the course of many years (starting in 1982 I think). I'm not sure why this article only focuses on the 2001 version, because there was a more recent one given (with the same questions) in August of 2005. I even updated one of the articles here on WP (that Uncle Ed was involved in) that was using these 2001 numbers with the more recent version. It might be nice to have a page that shows this poll in historical context as well, which is much more valuable than a single snapshot point in time. A page discussing creationism polls in general might be even more useful. for example, <a href="http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=118" class="external text" title="http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=118" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is nicely done, and adds some nice context to the Gallup poll. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 15:28, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What is this? A censorship campaign against any Wikipedia article which sheds doubt on the POV that "around half of Americans support evolution"? All I'm asking is that Wikipedia report EXACTLY what polls say on this subject. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:51, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to say that such-and-such a proportion of Americans supports such-and-such a view on evolution, the data to support this should go into the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> article. I really don't know what you hope to achieve by continuously creating articles that do nothing but report the fact that some poll has been conducted. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 20:14, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you want the EXACT poll numbers, please use the 2005 poll, not the 2001 one. Better yet, write an article as suggested above that mentions all the years and why this poll is important. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
