<li><b>Strong keep</b> - I am the one who created this list. Originally, some states had lists of colleges and universities and others did not. I created lists for each state based on what was on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_81cf.html" title="List of colleges and universities in the United States">list of colleges and universities in the United States</a>, which I turned into a directory page for the state lists. Right now, every state has a list. Keep in mind that lists have some advantages over categories, mainly in that they can be organized differently, include institutions that do not yet have an article, and provide additional information (such as the city in which the institution is located). My plan was to format all the state lists to look similar to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Tennessee_f85e.html" title="List of colleges and universities in Tennessee">list of colleges and universities in Tennessee</a>. I started working on them alphabetically, but I only got as far as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_California_aac4.html" title="List of colleges and universities in California">California</a> before I realized how big a task that was and decided to take a break. I was hoping to get back to it eventually or to at least get some help with the task. If you look at some of the other state lists that I worked on, you should be able to see that these lists have some advantages over categories, and the two should complement each other nicely. I agree that this list in its current state is pointless, but I suggest that we improve this list rather than delete it. In any case, I don't think it makes sense to delete this list unless we deleted most of the other state lists as well, as well as the lists for many other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_colleges_and_universities_by_country.html" title="List of colleges and universities by country">countries</a>. --<a href="../../../c/s/w/User%7ECswrye_d0de.html" title="User:Cswrye">Cswrye</a> 03:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>If you read the CNN and the BBC articles, you will see that they are almost identical, no doubt because they will have been drafted from the same Reuters article. Without having paid to look at the Cape Times article, I would guess it will be the same Reuters article a third time. I would look for more than this before we should have an article on it. Wait a month or two and see what happens. You should have no problem getting more than this (effectively) <b>one</b> news report of a new website by then. Or it will have sunk without a trace, as a lot of these things do. It is so easy to set up a web site, we need to be especially careful in applying our guidelines to our articles on them.</p>
<p>I also, as I said, get the queasy feeling that Wikipedia is being used here, to garner respectability for this scare site. Transwiki to Wikinews perhaps? --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 22:11, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't describe the BBC and CNN articles as "nearly identical", and it's worth pointing out that the BBC article does not credit Reuters. Incidentally, I was wrong about the Cape Times article and the article (which does credit Reuters) is avaliable <a href="http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=271&amp;fArticleId=3327822" class="external text" title="http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=271&amp;fArticleId=3327822" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In any case, whether or not the original source was the same is irrelevant, what's important is that 2 major news organisations and assorted newspapers and lesser news organisations saw fit to report on the subject. As for the issue of garnering respectibility, I'd agree that it's a concern with the article as it stands but being the fact that an article may be written in a promotional way isn't grounds to delete it, but can be grounds to extensively rewrite it.--<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 23:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure that "the queasy feeling that Wikipedia is being used here" is a factor we should be considering. Either the subject of an article is notable or it isn't. If it's sufficiently notable, then it should be covered. If we start to say 'Well, yes, it's notable, but it's notable for the wrong reasons', then we set ourselves up for selection bias. Yes, we often delete articles for being advertisements. I've certainly rejected dozens of AfC articles for that reason. But when an article is <i>deleted</i> on that ground (as opposed to being rewritten), it's not just because it's an advertisement; it's because it's an advertisement <i>of a non-notable subject</i> -- in other words, it's an attempt to use Wikipedia to help the subject <i>become</i> notable. If the subject is already notable, then we rewrite, not delete. Otherwise, every article about a company, product or service on Wikipedia would become an instant candidate for deletion, since undoubtedly those articles help bring attention to the subjects of the articles. So in this case, if the website is notable (and it appears to be), then the article shouldn't be deleted just because it may have been written with the intent to draw people to the website. If that intent shows up in the article itself, then edit or delete the offending portions of the article. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 05:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, sure. As I (and several others) have said, I think its current notability is marginal at best, and this Wikipedia article is an attempt to raise its profile and make it notable. If we delete the POV from the article, we are left with a URL, two external links (which read like they were based on the same Reuters article, or maybe the same press release, and so are counted by me as one), and a summary of the one-man site's sensationalistic content. Not a very encyclopedic article!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also count the website's novelty against it; as I said, why not delete for now and see if it attracts any other comment in the coming months, or if it sinks like a stone as many of these yellow press sites do? I agree with you that if the article is allowed to stay on Wikipedia it will have to be <i>very</i> extensively edited to conform to NPOV. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 12:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Why not delete for now and see if it attracts any other comment in the coming months?" Because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a crystal ball. What needs to be established is if there are sufficient verifiable sources to claim notability now, if the website generates no further press then the article can remain a discussion of the one issue that did generate press. And, no, the article would not just be a URL, external links and a summary of content; if that were all that could be written about there'd be no possible claim to notability as no major news organisations would have written about such a topic. The fact that news organisations have written about it, however, means that there is something that can be added to the article. I have to ask, if you have such an issue with the article's current format why not simply <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and write your own, less POV version? --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 13:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, we obviously have different views on the "not a crystal ball" thing. I would interpret it (and this was what I meant above) as meaning we should delete the article for now, until or unless it attracts more coverage and comment, and thus more notability. You have a different view; that's fine, I suppose that's what these AfD discussions are about.</dd>

<dd>As to being bold, I don't think you'll find many editors who will put a lot of work into rewriting an article that they have proposed for deletion. If the proposal was successful, it would be an awful waste of time, wouldn't it? But don't worry, even if this proposal is unsuccessful I will be watching it closely and, yes, my first action would be to completely rewrite it to conform with NPOV, MoS etc. I hope you will join me in this, should my first wish (to expunge what I stil think is a bid for notability from our encyclopedia) be unsuccessful. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 14:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Thoughts</b></p>
<p>First of all, appreciate all you conscientious Wikipedian. Actually, it was first time to post a message here. I am very impressed with such a powerful self-cleansing action by Wikipedian.</p>
<p>As to this matter, I want to tell several things.</p>
<p>With a little bit my experience with Wikipedia, I just think about three keywords for Wikipedia. “Curiosity”, “Explore”, and “Define”</p>
<p>According to the current description of NAC by Wikipedia, “It is still an emerging technology space, and many vendors are taking advantage of this <b>lack of definition</b> to jump on the NAC bandwagon. But if we boil down NAC to its essence,” This means we need to provide more information to define what the NAC is in general somehow.</p>
<p>“If we boil down” who is the “We”? “We” should be individual, school, even company, anyone who got interested in NAC. In order to boil down NAC objectively, I believe we need to gather more information(fact) about NAC from all different channels excluding subjective opinions. But related concept, idea, and even specific solution should be introduced.</p>
<p>Especially, lots of vendors work on the NAC so it would not hurt to introduce NAC-related companies.</p>
<p>I think that “unheard-of and non-notable” does not help defining the definition of NAC at this stage. I guess that it is against “curiosity” and “explore”</p>
<p>Just thought.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your good work, Wikipedian!</p>

<li>Perhaps I misunderstand Wikipedia policy, but from what I have read it is wrong to have an article whose only purpose is to attack an individual. This seems to be what the Barbara Schwarz article is about. People who disagree with her opinions about Scientology, be they Church of Scientology members, Scientology critics, or church members pretending to be critics to make the real critics look stupid and mean spirited, have been running a personal attack on her for years. Perhaps someday history will judge that Barbara was important enough to merit a place in the encyclopedia. However, as of now, the only reason people are writing about her is to try to frighten or intimidate her to silence a person whose opinions don't fit into their own particular worldviews. Although I don't agree with everything Barbara says I admire her courage and I will stand up for her right to express herself.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 03:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is actually the third nomination (see <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</a> for links to the first two). It would be good if an experienced admin could rename it, since the operation seems possibly a little tricky (pagemove the afd, update the afd log, and I would say delete the redirect resulting from the page move, edit the subst'ed afd template in the article, and conceivably I'm still missing something). I'm reluctant to attempt the move myself because of this complexity. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 03:37, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

She has done interviews with newspapers, made lots of legal threats, gone on hate campaigns against people she has never met, contacted peoples employers to complain about them, filed reports of alleged wrongdoing with various police departments of people she does not like, and spammed various news groups with her libel (although she might not call it that.)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I concur with user Brimba. This does not appear to be an "attack article" as the nominator for deletion suggests. It appears that this Wikipedia article is based completely on Ms. Schwarz's own public statements on Usenet and her subsequent spamming and abuse of Usenet as detailed by the links in this article. This article is also sourced with public records including judicial rulings and newspaper articles. In my estimation, the nominator proposes this deletion simply because he seems to feel that the facts regarding Ms Schwarz, and her apparent eccentric behavior, are unflattering if not embarassing when presented for public analysis and consumption. This article, I feel, is an integral piece in a body of research on the unique Church of Scientology and one of it's more outspoken former members. --Vrenault 14:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--81.227.231.218 15:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC) Keep - Alex Jones researches and verifies everything he puts in his documentaries. Research it yourself and you will find that this is true, then research the term COINTELPRO and verify for yourself that there is a huge effort, I'm talking millions of dollars here, to hide the fact that 9/11 was an inside job. Allow freedom of speech and keep or suppress factual information? The choice should be obvious.</p>

<dd>First of all, there are editors that are Israeli--fact. If it is uncivil to say so, then they are guilty of it for making it known from the information they disclose. To then turn that into an excuse to attack me is uncivil and a personal attack, especially marginalizing well-published facts as 'conspiracy theories.' Second, their government is using "hundreds of thousands of Jewish activists" to POV'ize info about Israel.

<dd>It's all very convenient to be able to blame anything not going one's way on a massive Global Jewish Conspiracy (tm). It's also lazy thinking.

<dd>What's more likely, that the Foreign Ministry is using "hundreds of thousands" of people to purposely slant articles on Israel, and Wikipedia has not been touched by the project? Or that perhaps one of the largest websites in the world, that is open to editing by all might be a target of the project? What reality are you living in?

<li>Weak <b>keep</b>. The article's not very good, and could probably be accommodated within <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Israel_6f67.html" title="Human rights in Israel">Human rights in Israel</a>. But it's not a POV fork to discuss a particular discrete issue. The current article title is shitty, and the content probabl doesn't warrant its own article, but at the same time I don't think the topic itself is one where we can never conceivably have an article, which was my understanding of what the basic criteria for deleting something would be. I won't cry too much for this article if it dies, but I find it incredible that everyone views this as a POV fork, and nobody cares about an actual POV fork like <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_and_Samaria_1107.html" title="Judea and Samaria">Judea and Samaria</a>, whose purpose seems to be to describe the West Bank from the Israeli POV. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 02:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to note, I see that the most recent revision of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_and_Samaria_1107.html" title="Judea and Samaria">Judea and Samaria</a> has been drastically shortened, making it rather less of a POV fork. But I still think that's a much clearer instance of a POV fork than this is. A POV fork is when you have two articles on the same subject, but one of them is limited to discussing a single POV on that issue. That's what "Judea and Samaria" basically is. The term means the same thing as <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, but is only used by people with one POV. An article on <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_and_Samaria_1107.html" title="Judea and Samaria">Judea and Samaria</a> can only be about the use of that term, because any further discussion is essentially overlapping with <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> (and the version of that page before July 31 was full of discussion that could just as well have gone at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>). Here, people seem to be saying that this is a POV fork because it discusses an issue which only makes Israel look bad. But that's not what a POV fork is, as I understand it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 02:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was trying not to make that argument, but I fear it did come across that way. As I said, mine was a weak keep vote. I do not think that having an article on this topic is necessary, I just don't think it falls into line with deletion policy. I'd probably prefer a redirect to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Israel_6f67.html" title="Human rights in Israel">Human rights in Israel</a> and a merge of the content there. But I don't think it's a POV fork, and I don't think it (quite) qualifies for outright deletion. The notice of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_and_Samaria_1107.html" title="Judea and Samaria">Judea and Samaria</a> was not meant to indicate that we "must keep" this article, just as a way of explaining why this doesn't qualify as a POV fork. Anyway, I don't especially care about this article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:09, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>, it's a POV fork. I agree with John that it is conceivabl for this not to be a POV fork, but then it would be a content fork and in this case a content fork is not justified. My point is that we shouln´t have an article on every topic a few editors want to write about. This is not a blog. There should be a series about Israel and the Israeli-Palstinian conflict as well as specific wars including th current one in Lebannon. And these articles should be as comprehensive as an encyclopedia article could be. Any valid material in this article is better suited in another article that will provide more context and NPOV. <s><a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">User:Slrubenstein</a></s> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 157.100.35.28 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_157.100.35.28_a5b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/157.100.35.28">contribs</a>).</small></li>

As you know, the USA is free, democratic, and generally the goodies by default, so if France wants the USA to stop waging unilateral wars against a hazily-defined enemy called "terror" or "evil" and arresting innocent civilians without charging them for anything, and breaking international treaties, then France must be an evil communist dictature.

<dd>"Indeed I would hazard to guess that the French have more military victories to their name than the US." Easily. It's not even a contest, which is partly why this article is so silly.

<li><i>Do Not Delete</i> Telefact is a valuable part of the University of Pittsburgh. If other organizations have articles (see Friday Night Improvs or The Pitt News) this deserves one as well. Telefact is a nationally used service (NOT a campus help line) that attracts hundreds of callers per day and hundreds of thousands per year and is 100% unique in the services it offers. Completely unmatched nationwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, changes have been made and the sources we have have been cited. The article is no longer in violation of any citation policies. I don't see a reason why this article should be deleted.</p>

<li><i>Do Not Delete</i>* This article does not advertise, it is a unique service, and the whole thing is not for profit. To call this a student "help line" is definitely a misnomer. This request for deletion stems from a petty grudge an established wikipedian has against someone or something at the service itself. Sources can be worked on, but deleting something that has logged 1.6 million calls in a 16 year history and is used by thousands in PA, OH, NY, NJ an elsewhere seems a bit unneccesary. -- Jeff Harr, 12:30 EST, 4 August 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.163.202.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.163.202.113_cc00.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.163.202.113">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As I said on my talk page, this certainly is not personal; because I attended the University of Pittsburgh, I have used Telefact for a number of years in both Pittsbugh and New York City. Additionally, I also have been friends with a number of Telefact employees in years past. I do find Telefact useful, but I don't believe Telefact passes Wikipedia's notability standards for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">organizations</a>. If you can demonstrate that Telefact is notable enough to have an article, I think that's great. But that means you need to cite some sources. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 04:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Like I said above, sources are being worked on (two have been added). Telefact has been featured in at least three major Pittsburgh newspaper articles and was featured in a nationally broadcast special on NPR radio in the late 1990's. It has had over 1.6 million callers. I didn't expect it to be such an issue over something seemingly insignificant. However, since the issue has come up, it is being addressed. Notablity, even as addressed in the article that was linked above, is highly subjective. 1.6 million users of a service, national useage, and the fact that it is 100% unique in its scope (no other service nationwide is similar) justifies its notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>- Many more sources have been put up on the Telefact page. I point back to that "notability" page to make a couple more points: <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</i> Telefact is known outside a narrow interest group. 48 callers per hour and 1.6 million callers in 15 years spanning the whole country is proof of this. <i>Many editors also believe that it is fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources</i> NPR and Motley Fool, among newspapers and alumni magazine articles is sufficient external notice. As is 1.6 million callers. Lastly, I bring up the point "Wikipedia is not paper." Just because something is not household knowledge, it is ridiculous to preclude its inclusion in Wikipedia, especially when it is a unique service, passes external source tests, and has a wide base of users that span the country.

<li><b>Comment</b>- NPR not a notable news source? That's a new one. A major tech and business site, a magazine with nationwide readership? I will also be adding sources from major city newspapers. To say it fails any notability tests is laughable. It's not a vanity site either, hence the fact that the service is NOT promoted. The phone number is not even listed, for instance. The article covers only facts about the service and does not deal with excess promotion. According to Wikipedia's own guidelines: <i>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.</i> And even here, a serivce with nationwide useage has every right to have a short article on Wikipedia. I'm just very disappointed because I feel like some more expereinced Wikipedia members are ignoring facts and policy just to remove a harmless article that is covers a unique service, contains verifiable information, and is not in any violation. 24.3.59.222 13:16, 4 August 2006 (UTC) --Chris Szymansky

<li><b>Comment</b>- It was a featured story on NPR. That is non-trivial coverage broadcast nationwide that Telefact was featured on. And how exactly is the article spam? It does not even feature the service's phone number. The service has seen no noticeable increase in calls since its been listed on Wikipedia, nor is that the goal of having an article here. The article is there simply as a contribution to Wikipedia (which seems to enjoy articles about things that are far more obscure than Telefact). Even if there was no press coverage, the 1.6 million calls the service has recieved proves its notability. That should not be overlooked. 24.3.59.222 14:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC) -Chris Szymansky</li>

<dd>The service was mentioned in a tiny blurb on NPR, ten years ago. It's sandwiched between software tech support and wild ponies. That seems pretty trivial to me. I didn't say it was spam, just not notable. By the way, the number of calls a number receives (just like the number of hits a website receives) is not a factor in deciding notability. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I disagree that useage statistics do not prove notability. Surely if a website would recieve millions of hits, it would be notable. The same goes for this service. That said, I've put my points out there. I will add a few more sources (Pittsburgh newspapers) but as a whole, I'm done arguing over something so trivial.24.3.59.222 14:39, 4 August 2006 (UTC) --Chris Szymansky

<p>This Nintendude-esque list is an idiosyncratic non-topic. It can't possibly illustrate any articles (is anyone going to write long album titles?), it invites the addition of non-notable songs/albums/bands, and there's no trend that this article illustrates or could possibly illustrate. It's transient, the length of albums is not a significant subject of study, and the criteria cannot help but be entirely arbitrary.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is <i>entirely</i> unencyclopaedic. It's also very subjective - people have different opinions about what constitutes a long album title. If this article is renamed to List of albums with titles containing more than ten words, we'll doubtless have lists of albums with titles less than ten words long, lists of titles of albums containing a certain number, lists of song titles with more than 10 words, and so on. My point is, do we really <i>need</i> all of that? It's completely unencyclopaedic and subjective in the first place, and the lists it's sure to spawn will become unmaintainable. I also don't think an album becomes notable simply because its title is long.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I discuss WP:NOT in my original comment, but I would encourage you to review the indiscriminate collection of information section. There is no mention of "arbitrary" in WP:Not. The "indiscriminate" section of WP:NOT applies to seven types of articles; this is not one of them. There is also very long-standing interest in song titles (of which this clearly examines an aspect) and it should be eminently possible to write a more developed overview of the topic, perhaps as an introduction to the list. A possible starting point might be Charles Lindsay's 1928 article, <i>The Nomenclature of the Popular song</i> <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(192806)3%3A5%3C369%3ATNOTPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(192806)3%3A5%3C369%3ATNOTPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 14:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> IMO, all of these arbitrarily defined lists violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as well. The idea that a list with "10 words in the title" is originial research on the part of the editor(s) who added this "criteria" as they have essentially used Wikipedia to corrolate or define "particularly long titles" with "10 Words". Unless one can provide some sort of external <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sourcing showing there is ample reason to believe that 10 words is a generally accepted cutoff where a song title becomes long.

<p>Okay, this person's claim to fame is that he's published (electronically, not in any scientific journal) a four-page paper that theorizes on an "antigravity beam". Originally a probable <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, this article has, thanks to some intelligent, thoughtful contributions, become a forum for critically evaluating the good doctor's assertions.

<li><b>Um...</b>Respectfully, I have to point out that these citations are (as discussed in the article) permutations of the same paid press release. This press release is extensively analysed in the article itself, which reveals that the impressive-sounding "Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin" is not an academic institution but a subsidiary of a fringe-science company. In fact, when I stripped the text of the press release (in all languages) out of a Google search, I ended up with only 27 hits for "Franklin Felber"--hardly a hallmark of notoriety. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 07:25, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or Merge.</b> Mostly Keep, due to it's heavy use, and the fact that the other theories listed under <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biped.html#Evolution" title="Biped">Biped#Evolution</a> are significantly less notable, and were used for a shorter period of time. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 06:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, initially I was leaning <i>merge</i> to <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Aquatic ape hypothesis">Aquatic ape hypothesis</a>, but this article is a bit long for that. <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis.html" title="Aquatic ape hypothesis">Aquatic ape hypothesis</a> is, in my opinion, patently ridiculous (and even less supported than the "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_McKenna_dfd3.html" title="Terence McKenna">Stoned Ape</a>" theory), but the argument against traditional evolutionary theory by proponents of AAH appears to be documented, and documented enough under the name "Savanna Theory" (or Savannah Theory) that it isn't a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states <b>verifiability, not truth</b> and this seems to be a very good example of such. The fact that there is a Savanna Theory can be verified... whether it is true or not is irrelevant. Article has POV issues, but those are editorial concerns. We don't wipe out the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> article becuase it is complete bollocks... we edit it to be a balanced, encyclopedic view of the topic.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in some form, be it renamed or perhaps merged. I also tend to think the length renders it a poor choice for merging. People will definitely come across the term and come here searching for it. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 13:56, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've heard "Savanna Theory" used seriously by people who weren't "Aquatic Ape" proponents; admittedly, they were only doing so in order to have something to refer to the current most-popular hypothesis, but it's not just an epithet used by "Aquatic Ape" fans. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 14:39, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Clearly, as referenced above, there are some tagential mentions of "savannah theory", but also the top google hits for it are all aah/aat proponents. So while yes there are mentions of the phrase, the phrase has mainly been co-opted by aquatic ape people. Also, the <i>content</i> of the article doesn't describe terrestrial based theories like <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biped.html#Evolution" title="Biped">Biped#Evolution</a> does, but dedicates most of the space to the description of the idea vis a vis aquatic ape hypothesis and to criticism of the land based theories. I think a better landing for it would be something like Origin of bipedalism in humans with an expanding treatment of <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biped.html#Evolution" title="Biped">Biped#Evolution</a> Thanks, <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Potter_73b9.html" title="User:Jason Potter">JPotter</a> 15:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The savanna theory article needs a lot of work, however, some of the older versions of the article are slightly more coherent. The savanna hypothesis appears to be a term that is actually used by a number of people, mostly proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis, and for that reason I am against deletion. Another possbility is a merge with the aquatic ape page. For more explanation of my position see the discussion section in savanna theory. As to the truth of the claims, I have no idea, but I agree with Isotope23 on <b>verifiability, not truth</b>. Nicolharper 20:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>First of all I've never heard of Slam sportswear, but I guess that doesn't make it particularly unnotable as I don't really follow the fashion biz. However, the source that you cited isn't very reputable, and appears to only details the fashion business. If it was indeed the only <i>actual</i> one you could find, the other you mentioned being nothing more than a blog, it shows that he is only notable in his own industry, and barely notable at that having only a single article. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 20:01, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep!</b> Thank you, Ecophreek, for your support!! I have done everything to re-write this article and to conform to policy standards, with help. Those who frown on self-published or POD books are simply biased and have no reason to be heard here. I thought the purpose of Wiki was to write factual articles in a upfront factual way. And to comment on content and writing as opposed to judging whether someone or their work is 'notable' or not. These books are available in bookstores and online and one has been recognized as entirely notable by your standards, since it has been picked up to be re-published as a special edition by a traditional publisher and has also garnered the interest of a respected film producer. People who downplay the importance of self-published works obviously have no idea where a large percentage of the great literature in the world has come from. Mark Twain and a number of other respected authors have started this way. If you delete this article on the basis that the book was first self-published, then you will have to delete articles on other authors who self-published, such as Mark Twain (Huckleberry Finn), Irma Rombauer (The Joy of Cooking), John Grisham (A Time to Kill), James Redfield (The Celestine Prophecy) Beatrix Potter (Peter Rabbit Classic Series), Whitman (Leaves of Grass), Jack Canfield and Mark Hensen (Chicken Soup for the Soul), Margaret Atwood, Tom Clancy, Deepak Chopra, D.H. Lawrence, Edgar Allan Poe, T.S. Elliot, George Bernard Shaw, Virginia Woolf and more. Regardless, I can't educate the biased uneducated on the subject of literature because honestly you really have no idea what you are talking about, but I will defend that the Whale Song (novel) article has been edited now and is no different from other author pages listed on Wikipedia. And that is all that should matter.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 22:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: My vote to keep was accompanied by a request for a citation concerning the statement that <i>Whale Song</i>, when published in 2003, "captured the interest of a leading Canadian film producer". The first citation provided, from the publisher's website, speaks of a "much-talked-about screenplay"; no producer is mentioned. The second citation, also from the publisher's site, is a word for word repetition of the claim ("captured the interest of a leading Canadian film producer") and provides no further information. In all fairness, the citations provided give no indication that "the book is to be turned into a movie". Furthermore, ghits for this "much-talked-about screenplay" (again, to be fair, the words of the publisher) appears to be limited to blogs and sites associated with the author. I suggest that this issue might be remedied by including citations to at least one trade journal (<i>Quill &amp; Quire</i> or, perhaps, a film publication). The name of the "leading Canadian film producer" should also be included.--<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately none of you understand how the movie industry works. When you submit a screenplay (and mine is in their hands now), most screenwriters will sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. This protects the producer from having their projects stolen until they have committed to it financially and are ready to release that info. So I am simply not authorized to release the name of said producer. My publisher on the other hand is fully aware of the arrangements between me and this Canadian producer as Kunati initially wanted movie rights and I could not give it to them. It has been documented all over the internet that a screenplay was in the works and that a producer requested it. I won't jeopardize my chances at a movie over a request for a citation that you deem viable. There already is a web link that backs up my claim. If this producer releases me from the agreement, their company name will go up immediately.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 15:41, 8 August 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Assertion aside, I do happen know something of what I speak when it comes to the film industry. A great many novels come under consideration by producers - sadly, few are accepted and the public is never the wiser. Were it not for the claims of a young, as yet untested publishing company, and those of the article's subject, we would know nothing of this possible project. Ms Tardif is justifiably proud that her book has attracted attention from the world of film, but her claim is unverifiable. I expect that in the happy event the novel is optioned, there will be a major press release. These things are always more than trumpeted on company websites and in <i>Quill &amp; Quire</i>, the Canadian journal of the publishing trade. Until the time the claims can be verified, I respectfully recommend that references to the unidentified "leading Canadian film producer" and his request that Ms Tardif produce a screenplay be deleted.--<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 23:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>; Googling for the title "Clothed female, naked male" or "CFNM" demonstrates that this is already a notable, and rather specific, pornographic genre. The counterpart, CMNF, is also common in fetish pornography,, but I have not seen the specific name used before: perhaps the two should be merged into a single article: perhaps Naked/clothed fetishism?

<li>The yahoo category is not a source. Ottawa xpress, though... It's the most marginal of sources that might be useable, website with an alexa ranking of 300,000+, and the web version of a free local newspaper, and I'm not sure if this column is contained in the print version or not, but it is some sort of source.

<li>I think is. Take a glance at the hits and see that they almost entirely refer to sexual content, meaning this topic.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since such rankings are rather meaningless and trivial, yes. Presumably those webcomics which have articles that are coincidentlly ranked lower than this one on arbitrary lists of small fractions of webcomics either have articles based on verifiable information from reliable sources or they ought to be deleted as well.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. There's a unanimous consensus that this article shouldn't exist on its own, which leaves the question whether we should preserve this page as it is or as a redirect for the merge. Normally merges result in redirects, but as these are quotes, if any were inserted into <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Delhi_bombings_37ba.html" title="New Delhi bombings">New Delhi bombings</a> a redirect from here wouldn't be necessary as no-one's original GFDL-licensed work is being copied. Consequently I'm closing as <b>delete</b> on the basis that all of this can be found elsewhere, and if it can't, they're not verifiable quotes and can't be merged anyway, as Stephen says. Will restore into userspace on request if anyone was thinking of copying some of the quotes to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Delhi_bombings_37ba.html" title="New Delhi bombings">New Delhi bombings</a> but can't remember what they were. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:07, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">user:Litclass</a> tried to list this article for deletion, with the explanation: "this is peoples opinion and lacks citations and not really encylopedia like". I repaired the AfD listing and happen to agree. The article was tagged for copying to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a> for the better part of a year. It is a collection of quotes, with no sources or even context. I assume some of the quotes could be merged to the main article about the bombings, but right now there are no links in either direction. The title is an unlikely search term, so turning it into a redirect is unnecessary. Even the proposed copying to Wikiquote looks unnecessary to me, as the quotes are not exceptional, but the standard quotes every major act of terrorism produces.

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> - Perhaps a complete re-write of this page with more detail and properly sectioned off areas with headings would be excellent. A merge though, would that make it so that it is linked, like the others are, on the Notable_YouTube_Users page? It should have a page of its own, as there is so much that can be written about this girl, whether you like her or not - but hopefully not from a biased point of view as to whether it is staged or not.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.143.78.79 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.143.78.79_dfc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.143.78.79">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, you can rewrite it if this article survives AfD, but it doesn't matter.

<p>Another comment - the article has now been substantially cleaned up, and has had a whole bunch of productive editors contribute (though not to this vote... hmmmm....) I think the clear concensus here to delete is pretty self-evidently wrong, and would invite all voters to take another look at the article and the story now and I reckon you'll probably agree.... maybe! - cheers, <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetesmiles_8c9b.html" title="User:Petesmiles">Petesmiles</a> 00:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ah, the <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> argument. Nicely done. Are you an attorney as well or do you just debate like one? My fully articulated position, your mischaracterization aside, is that while the subject of this article does not appear to be sufficiently notable to have her own article, it would be appropriate under the circumstances to <b>Redirect</b> to an article <i>that already exists!</i> I refuse to be baited into making predictions on issues not before us now, specifically, the likely notability of "every Youtube uploader" and whether they deserve their own article, a redirect page, or neither. As far as where "to draw the line", those issues should be decided on a case by case basis using the criteria set forth in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The intrinsic value of any precedence that may or may not be established here is another matter entirely. --<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_Son_533a.html" title="User:Satori Son">Satori Son</a> 20:50, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No I'm not an attorney. And I'm overwhelmed by some of those words, please try and descibe it in layman's terms. And care to determine what makes it agree with wp:bio. Just because this person has appeared on a notable website, isn't really very high. For instance my cousin who I have descibed at the top has appeared on the front page of a nn website as well. <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J.Sagnella_6796.html" title="User:J.J.Sagnella">J.J.Sagnella</a> 21:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fair enough. I suppose since I did admit that the article subject was not notable enough for its own article, it does seem a little silly to Redirect to an article entitled <i>Notable</i> YouTube Users.

<p>Is YouTube a notable website - concensus over the wiki says Yes, my opinion, Yes - others above seem to be saying No.</p>
<p>Is Lonelygirl15 'famous' on YouTube - pretty obviously yes - we all agree on this one!</p>
<p><br />
Is this article a fun, informative, appropriate article for wikipedia, or another annoying geeky disctraction from the serious task of collecting knowledge? - I guess that's up to you Mr. Closing Admin......

<p>This is one of countless articles spawned from the current Israel-Lebanon conflict.

<p>The result was- well, I'll take a bold move and say that in this borderline case (62.5%), I can't really see anything promising forthcoming from the IMDB profile, as the recent two movies that he was in (7 years ago) he was the 25th and 16th ranked cast member in a film which didn't seem big (I didn't recognise the names of any of his co-actors) judging by the links to the films. Personally, I didn't think that getting an IMDB profile was an automatic grounds for retention, as you could get one by appearing in some film for 2 minutes? As for the home and away stuff, there seems little info on him or his character, aside from the fact he had a half-year stint on the program.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:22, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with massacre article, as per BigHaz's comments. Subject seems notable, but this article doesn't do anything to establish that notability.

Fort Parker was a unique and interesting settlement on the fringe of the Comancheria, and an article on the man that settled his clan in such a remote and hostile area, rather than with the other early settlers is merited. His motivations were distinctly different from the other Anglo immigrants and will be expounded on.

<li><b>Comment</b> DAS - an admin will come through in a few days, review the arguments and decide which side has the stronger case, and make the decision from there (either keep, delete, or no consensus, which defaults to keep). As far as content and style goes, your article is ok for a starting point, and that's not really the issue here. The real difference beteen DAS Games and <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoosh.html" title="Smoosh">Smoosh</a> is the significant media coverage Smoosh has received, as evidenced on that page.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Although I'm usually skeptical of website owners creating wikipedia articles about their own products, it really doesn't <i>look</i> like a vanity article. Could use quite a bit of cleanup, but it talks about the site from a NPOV and the creator is obviously working in good faith. Still, notability is a concern, and wikipedia is admittedly not a web directory. On the fence, I guess, but why not? Note to Daylon - as ColourBurst mentioned, if all you want is the wiki software and you can host the site yourself, it is freely available. It would probably be a better option for you anyways, since you've stated that you intended the article to primarily be for your users. JoshWook 20:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

"Crystal balling" is allowed when multiple major news sources have covered the speculated product and when such a product would be notable <i>even if its release was cancelled</i>. Simply being speculation about a future product is not grounds for deletion; for example, there is an article on the Playstation 3, which isn't out yet either. There is a cutoff of notability where encyclopedic information from secondary sources ends and pure speculation begins, and this article is not past that cutoff due to the sources.

<li><b>Delete,</b> as no sources are given for the inclusion of any of the people on this list, and therefore removing the unsourced entries is tantamount to blanking the article. To those who say "the linked articles are sources," I'd point out that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">the reliable source guidelines</a> say Wikipedia is not considered a reliable source. Second, when sources are not actually shown visibly in a list, there is no way to tell quickly which of the entries really have sources and which do not. It is <b>frequently</b> the case in lists of this kind that the linked Wikipedia article will <i>not even say</i> that the person [has ADHD] [is bisexual] [is a Brandeis alumnus] [whatever]; far more frequently it will make the assertion but cite no source for it. Lists of this kind simply invite passersby to type in the name of someone they're pretty sure they've heard was really inattentive, then type a pair of square brackets around it, and, voila! it's a blue link. There's no way for anyone to tell whether the person who added the name even looked at the linked article, let alone found and verified a reference in it. List articles where the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> verifiability policy is not enforced and sources are not required <b>when items are inserted</b> rapidly become muddled mixtures of perfectly legitimate entries and casual hearsay, that cannot be disentangled without hours of work. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've now moved the unsourced entries (i.e. all of them) to the article's talk page and rewritten the opening sentences. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Famous_peoples_with_ADHD&amp;oldid=67626475" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Famous_peoples_with_ADHD&amp;oldid=67626475" rel="nofollow">This old version</a> is the version discussed above. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unless people start finding sources for any of this.

<li>Such a game is a well-known football-variation often played in england, as well as other european countries, when there are too few players to create a viable competitive game. Other such games could include "headers and volleys" or "Wembley doubles". This game is refered to in many ways (most commonly, "one bounce, one touch") and has a variety of permutations. The origin is likely to be very difficult to determine, although it is doubtful that it was Eton, an inclusion in this article designed to suggest credibility. The game depicted in this article is merely a variation played by members of University College AFC since 2006, and thus the article refers to members of University who wish to immortalise themselves in wikipedia.

<li>I'm not familiar with the deletion policy on Wikipedia, but this game is not made up. It's a bit of harmless fun, commonly played by public school type boys in the UK. The mention of Durham University does not surprise me as it is notoriously associated with these people. While you might argue that it's moronic (I couldn't possibly comment), the article is definitely not a fabrication, and not an attempt to immortalise a very small band of friends. It would therefore be unreasonable to delete it, methinks. One might even say that retaining it may strike an egalitarian, horizon-widening blow against eliism by helping normal people cut the the dense and confusing games, language and traditions of private schools and prestigious universities.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.93.21.129 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.93.21.129.html" title="User talk:195.93.21.129">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.93.21.129_f817.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.93.21.129">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>i went to eton and played bums, good spot of character building. you people take life too seriously, frankly i nearly popped out of my plus fours when i read that some chaps dont beleive the game to have originated in the college of our lady. Did they go to the school? If not then how would they know that it was an inclusion to give the game "credibility"? Absolute tosh, bloody good game though. I have spread the "joga bonito" to UCL of Gower Street in London. So that proles can be put in their place. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.6.110.20 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.6.110.20_f402.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.6.110.20">contribs</a>) 2006-08-06 22:32:06 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>As a member of University College I can confirm Bums has been ongoing for AT THE VERY LEAST the three years I have been a member of the JCR there. Furthermore, when I joined the College I was made aware of the game and what I understood to be a strong tradition very early on in my residence - the game must have been around for some considerable time before I started.
<p>I have also played the game with various public school boys - at least one from Eton - who have confirmed the existance of the game within their schools before commencing University. To suggest this is a gimmick to "create a tradition and credibility" is both shallow and naive.</p>
<p>Each year Bums is played nightly (games usually start around 5-6pm) in Easter term on Palace Green - the central geen by Durham Castle and the Cathedral. Participants include a wide variety of University scholars - not just a group of friends. Indeed there have often been occaisons when three seperate games of Bums between three seperate groups with no relation have been playing at the same time and even emalgamated to create one big game.</p>
<p>Over the three years there have been various calls for a "bums constitution" outlining and consolidating the rules. This article does this well and thus should not be subject to any deletion. Those who beleive deletion should be appropriated are the few who refuse to accept the emergance of new traditions, clinging desperately to that of the past and refusing to embrace change. Bums embraces this change brilliantly, not only allowing new tradition to be created but also reflects the climate of the age we live in when receiving a good "bumming" can be talked about in open and laughed at in jovial spirit in and around a diverse cross section of society.</p>
<p>Please hold deletion as I am currently searching for viable sources. I have travelled in South America and China teaching English as a Foreign Language and have come across many variations of this game (including "keepy-ups", "one touch, one bounce" and "fondo-crudo"), which seems to be a popular alternative to football worldwide. I think a page should be created on Wikipedia in order to cover these types of games in which bums could be included (although a page exists for "keepie-uppie" I feel it is not as comprehensive and well written as the Bums article (or as it could be, with some editing) and perhaps the articles could be merged in some way.)--195.97.248.74 09:04, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It should also be noted that the current article on the universally popular game of keepie-uppies is badly referenced to a subjective personal website which holds no academic sway. However it is widely acknowledged that this game is played world wide by millions of people (in a similar manner to Bums). It seems to be true that with such 'word to mouth' inherited games there have been no authorities which have suitably documented participation in such sports and as such it is difficult for authors to provide viable sources. Any suggestions on how this can best be achieved would be useful --195.97.248.74 09:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the contrary, there are plenty of books and journal articles on childrens games, this having been the subject of research for centuries. If the claim that this is a real game that has become a part of the general corpus of human knowledge is true, it should be easy to cite sources.
<p>Yes, <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keepie_uppie.html" title="Keepie uppie">keepie uppie</a> is currently a bad article that cites no reliable sources. But that's irrelevant to the discussion of <i>this</i> article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:51, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Uncle G, my point was that this is a page on a similar, universally well known game for which no suitable sources have been able to be discovered and which, as a sport played at some point by almost anybody who has owned a football, has as much right to be represented on wikipedia as bums. I simply made reference to the said artice in the manner of a case lawyer providing approved examples in order to help decide matters concerning a current case. For example if I were to produce a low quality line darwing of someone getting bummed and place it on a geocities website, would the article on Bums become 'academically sound'?
<p>Could this article not be reclassified as a stub until a reference can be found?--Brittle bones 13:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The argument that "the existence of article A justifies the existence of article B" does not hold water.

<p>I too was at Eton College, where 'Bums' was widespread and played in the evenings every summer. It dates back at the very least 12 years, but I imagine was an institution much earlier than that. I am likewise a current member of University College JCR at Durham, and can confidently say that this (albeit low-key) sporting tradition continues each summer on Palace Green. Being as yet an obscure activity, online references may well be hard to find (but please note the reference on the above link) - I urge whomever it may concern to have patience in this matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vigilant deleters, please note that heads and volleys mentions the bums out rule, but doesn't have any references. I doubt this rule does or ever has existed. I would also like to know how to flag articles lacking citation as I have spotted a number myself, mainly being related to the minutae of various Online Role Playing Games created or contributed to by the critics of our illustrious folk-ledgend/sport.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - We're not talking about a personal homepage, though. We're talking about a game that obviously exists, has been around for years, has a substantial playerbase, and is quite firmly on the level of "extremely large" so far as muds go. You may or may not realize that most muds consider themselves glad to have 10-20 players. And yes, notability isn't a criteria for whether a subject should have an article, verifiability, however, is. Or would you argue that we should not have articles on, say, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Storm_Lee_%282005%29_47d6.html" title="Tropical Storm Lee (2005)">Tropical Storm Lee (2005)</a>, which existed for 3 days and did nothing of import?

<li>Tropical Storm Lee existence was discussed ad nauseam, so that isn't particularily the best example you can give.

<li><b>Comment</b> Read the articles for deletion log for any given day, and you'll find dozens of articles removed for non-notability. As said above, it's an interpretation of what Wikipedia is not, and is a very ingrained part of the policy here, to the point where standards of notability exist for a number of different media and topics. For more information, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_criteria_219a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability criteria">Wikipedia:Notability_criteria</a>. There are a number of categories into which Dark and Shattered Lands might fall, including web sites, fiction, and software, and it fails in all three. Even as MUDs go, it's not especially notable. Large MUDs sport user populations in the a thousand or more simultaneous logins. DSL never, at the height of its popularity, close. That DSL is successful goes without saying. But being successful doesn't make something notable. It's not even especially notable within the mudding community. Aardwolf is a notable MUD.

Also, Sojourn does not exist anymore. No mud has over 1000 simutanious unique logins at one time.

<li><b>Keep</b>, In a day and age that most are playing visual games, the fact that even 50 people KNOW about this Mud, is an accomplishment in itself. To have upwards of more then 50 individual logins a day, is more proof that the world and game of Dark and Shattered Lands is by the very least notable. I am unsure of the real purpose of wanting to remove the article, those who do not find it notable need not acknowledge its exsistence by looking at it, and those who find it useful have the ability to come and look. I myself have used it, I know others who have used it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Pretty much everything is <i>not</i> found on this site, because Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate source of information. The purpose of this discussion is to demonstrate that the DSL article either does or does not belong. Statements like, "it belongs because basically anything belongs here" are the exact opposite of a <i>keep</i> reason. Perhaps this discussion can eventually spur something more concrete, such as a "notability" standard for muds and video games. DSL may very well belong here but under current guidelines, that's less than apparant. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 19:33, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am sorry you mistook my general statement as being more then what it was, other then a general statement. I suppose what I would love to know then is, how often does the material on this site go through a keep or toss state. Further more to what is there to gain from having it removed? I am not sure I am entirely witnessing the point of having something that could easily be "not looked at" if it offends or does not fit a portion of people's definition of belonging here. Notability or not. Understand that for a very large community of players, it is notable. While it may not be for the entire world or for the entire community of mudding individuals for those that do play this game, it is notable. And by even recommending this article to be removed you are telling a very real number of people that their game is not notable enough to have an article of this fashion. Its sort of silly isn't it?--Treeguardee 01:04, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> All material is constantly in a state of consideration as to whether or not it should be kept or removed, because anybody can nominate any regular article for deletion at any time. A lot of things are very notable to the right community. My webcomic was incredibly notable to me. But it was not notable enough to the public at large to justify having its own article here, or even to be LISTED here with other web comics. Yes, we would be telling a real number of people that their game is not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. That's not silly, it's called having the standard. The guy who invented MUDs doesn't even get his own article. It's not because he wasn't an important or worthwhile human being, it's because notability, in the sense of an on-line encyclopedia, has to involve more than the emotional attachment of a few hundred people. Dark and Shattered Lands may meet that criteria. I've seen no evidence so far that it does, and the arguments present so far have consisted almost entirely of personal attacks on me, the nominator, emotional pleas, challenges to Wikipedia policy, and challenges to the definition of notability. Only the latter stands any chance of keeping the article, and the challenges presented are pretty unconvincing. The game's long tenure is perhaps the most compelling argument that could be made, but LOTS of MUDs lasted ten years and almost certainly do not merit their own article. Our challenge is to determine what merits notability for a MUD. Tenure is certainly one of those things, but it is not, in my opinion, sufficient. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 05:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Oh, and FYI, Tropical Storm Lee <i>did nothing</i>, it was never a threat to land, it was barely even a tropical storm, out in the middle of the ocean.&#160;:P --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 06:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do agree that this article does need improvements. If one looks at the discussion held during the construction of this article, one can see that there was debate upon which facts should be cosidered for inclusion. This article could be developed with more body and substance if it is given time to do such.Cufece 18:09, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, firstly I'm not attacking you, nor have I.But I do find it silly that out of all things you could of possible decided to lend your strong opinion on was an article about a game. It does no real harm to allow it to remain, for those that really have no invested interest in its stay or go. Right? I mean do you sleep worse at night knowing its here? But I digress, what proof are you looking for? Numbers of players? Number of hits? Number of responses here? A petition, girls with wet t-shirts that say "I love DSL"? I would like to know what exactly you are looking for.--Treeguardee 05:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, "it doesn't hurt to keep it" is not sufficient grounds to keep it. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Everybody with a web page or a MUD doesn't get to have a page here. People begin to treat Wikipedia as an advertising opportunity and that's not what it is. This discussion is about grounds for keeping or removing the article, you need to stop making the discussion about me personally. What exactly are we looking for? Some evidence that this game is notable enough to merit mention in an encyclopedia. A half dozen astroturfing users who have been directed to this article by the MUD's administration aren't it. Neither are emotional appeals ("but I met my wife on DSL!"), personal attacks ("the nominator is just a bitter jerk!"), speculation about the nominator's sleep habits, insistance that nobody is harmed by the article's presence, or almost anything else that's been presented by the "keep" crowd. We have good evidence using Wikipedia standards that the game is not notable enough to warrant its own article. Nobody has presented <i>anything</i> to the contrary yet. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 13:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> My husband, and its not an emotional attachment that keeps me coming back and responding to you. Its an article in a web encyclopedia I will not cry if its removed, because eventually it will be posted somewhere else, and in short all anyone did was remove it from one web source. Hence my, what's the differece attitude. And again, at no point have I made any personal attacks to you, I thought we were being quite civilalized. However, do not for one moment believe that either side here is solely working on a unbiased opinion, that itself is just plain silly. But dispite that, I could give a rat's backside as to what, why or whatever your reasons are for doing this, or how many friends you may have called in or how many friends this person told to post here, or how tall joe the construction guy is, as you say its not relevant to the point we are discussing. However, what you have still failed to produce for me is, exactly what is needed. You claim it has not been provided and yet you cannot claim what that proof is. Below you state some sort of published work to give it credit or notablility. How many muds that others claim are notable, have these? What lends one mud notability and not this one? --68.45.253.107 14:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't say <i>you</i> were attacking me personally. I said that one of the arguments for not deleting the article has been personal attacks and speculation about me. I have provided evidence for this article's subject not meeting notability criteria on Wikipedia, and the community of editors has overwhelmingly agreed. The onus is on you you disagree to demonstrate that the article does belong on Wikipedia. One method would be to demonstrate that the game is notable enough to <i>warrant a Wikipedia article.</i> A game can be plenty notable but still not notable enough to belong here. We have guidelines in place, look them up. You have not provided evidence that DSL is notable enough to warrant its own article on Wikipedia. That evidence could be: a reference to DSL in national media, a reference to DSL in academic research, sufficient Google hits, sufficient Alexa ranking. Look at the requirements for notability in software, web sites, or even organizations. See if you can meet it. We don't have a specific MUD notability standard, I proposed working towards one, nobody expressed any interest. The onus is not on me to provide you with the key to preserving this article. I proposed its deletion and cited evidence. If you want it kept, you need a reason. What is your reason? That hundreds of people play it? That's not good enough. That you met your husband through it? Not good enough. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 15:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, now we are were I want to be. So I can ask this, every mud listed here then has met things like, being printed in a newspaper or other such media, or has enough hits, sufficient Alexa ranking and so forth, yes? And as for the personal attacks, did you expect it to look any other way that if it were true you had been a jaded ex-whatever of the game, it would be seen as anything else then a jaded player having a tantrum? You might look at this way then, everyone who has an emotional attachment in even the slightest, not post? As I said before, no one can pretend to be unbiased here. There is emotional attachment all around. Hate, love, so forth and so on the circle will go. But thank you for pointing some things that those who choose to keep this open or not, will be looking for. --68.45.253.107 16:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sure that there are other MUD articles that don't meet the notability standards, either. But that's not an argument for keeping this article - it just means that someone who likes contributing in that way ought to go through the MUD articles and list the other nonnotables on AFD. <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 16:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, An online game could be considered notable if it has an impact beyond the game play itself. In that aspect, this article is about something notable. This game has been used as a teaching aid for a psychology class, several users have found positions of employment through playing this mud, and 30 or more couples have met and married while playing this game producing over 15 children. --Cufece 21:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That stuff all sounds like good arguments for notability, if they can be referenced. It would be a good idea to get some third party sources for that information, and put it into the article. <a href="../../../e/h/h/User%7EEhheh_6717.html" title="User:Ehheh">Ehheh</a> 22:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The psychology class in particular lends notability. The rest of that is stuff that happens every day in chat rooms, and it certainly is not sufficient to qualify notability. If it were, every IRC channel and chat room every conceived deserves an article. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 05:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> That psychology class was strange enough, but isn't the first class or use of DSL in a school. My question is, do you need a signed document from the school to believe it? And while that stuff may happen everyday in chat rooms, try explaining it to real people that it happened on a game, its far less common to hear. Trust me, it wasn't easy telling my family, oh this guy I'm going to marry? Where did I meet him? Yeah..you see...there's this thing called a mud...--Treeguardee 05:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, that's an emotional appeal and not grounds for notability. If DSL has been referenced in a published work somewhere, it would lend tremendously to its notability. An on-line reference is preferred to a signed document but yes, the claim alone is insufficient. Anybody can claim that their MUD, BBS, comic, web page, etc, was referenced by an academic setting. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 13:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>The Obvious Problem Here</b> IF THIS ARTICLE WAS SO "NOT-NOTABLE", then WHY did BSiders spend so much time contributing to it? He only nominated it for deletion after he had been called out for trying to smear this game and its owners. If this is not a bad faith nomination, then there is no such thing.69.6.167.240 15:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This discussion is about whether the article should be kept or removed. Attempts to make it about me are not going to advance the discussion. I originally got involved in the DSL article because Wikipedia policy required my sign-off on some material reposted there on which I own the copyright. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 15:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do not own ANY copyright to anything DSL related. I was an immortal from day one and to be one, you have to understand that any content developed for this game is owned by the game, not you. This was discussed publically with every one. Just like when game developers write code for a game, the game company owns the code, not the content developer.69.6.167.240 19:42, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I suppose Kender, Ogres, and Minotaurs are the intellectual property of Tony Allen and DSL, then? Run that by the legal staff at Wizards of the Coast. You don't own a copyright on something that you didn't create unless a contract of some form (for example, employment) has been entered into by both parties. I never agreed to any contract of any sort. The entire DSL project was originally a an offspring of DragonLance that, in many cases, didn't even bother to change names. Kender. Conclave. Moon magic, etc. Be careful which slings you launch about who owns what intellectual property, you're sitting on a pile of intellectual piracy as it is. So are most MUDs, I'm not uniquely indicting DSL, but it's a bit vexing to have anybody insist that a MUD owns a copyright to somebody else's work, when said game is a collection of copyright violations itself. You produce a signed contract with my name on it, I'll agree that I have no intellectual property involved in DSL. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 03:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By your logic, Blizzard entertainment doesn't own the copyright to their own game because they used Elves and Dwarves. You own NO part of DSL. None. Zilch. And if you were such a expert on copyrights, you wouldn't have helped used the stolen DSL code 8 years ago to set up a new mud using original DSL races like the Shalonesti elves. You own no copyright for DSL, period. Quit pretending that you do.
<ul>
<li>They own the copyright to the code because they paid people to write it. A contract. I'm not pretending, that's how the copyright system works, I'm sorry if you find it inconvenient. I didn't help anybody set up a MUD using stolen code, and even if I did, I don't see how that bears on my knowledge of copyright law. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 13:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am in the game development business. You are not. We do not sign contracts. It is understood as a practice of general law that when you work on someones else's project, they own it. The companies, not the employees. Again, you own nothing. Is that what started this attack on the game? Or was it the fact that DSL stood tall when ALL of your projects failed?69.6.167.240 14:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am in the legal business. You are not. You do not sign contracts, but you do hire people, and employment is an implied contract. I was never employed, and in the absence of an implied contract, you need a real one. What company did DSL belong to during my tenure there? None. DSL wasn't moved under the umbrella of any kind of private business ownership until after I had departed. In fact, some of the code I contributed was written for another project of my own first, and then copied to DSL. Again, it's not a big deal, I'm not demanding it be removed or anything else, but please don't accuse me of making claims to what's not mine. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 16:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are a student, not exactly in the legal business. Also, Allen Games was established in 1995 which is verifable by myself and the other imms who were there from the beginning as well as the State of Alabama in which he registered the business. This was all common knowledge even before you became a part of the project. Also, per Tony Allen, he has taken the appropriate legal measures to legally copyright his game. Its obvious that being historically accurate isn't exactly something you are concerned with, but I'm afraid you are just going to have to accept that fact that you own no part of this game that you consider to be so "non-notable".69.6.167.240 19:04, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then Allen Games failed to inform me of any conditions of my employment, and also failed to compensate me. For a contract to be valid, those beholden to it must at least be aware of it. What legal measures where taken to copyright code that Mr. Allen did not write? <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 19:11, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point, 68.45.253.107. However, as this is a computer-based item, it should have a LOT of google search results if it is notable. The "Google Hit Test" is used in almost all AfDs that involve web or computer based products or groups, although it is not Wikipedia policy. However, it is still a notability test.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Muds do not have hundreds of thousands of players on at any given time, ever. Not even some of the most popular MMORPGs have been around as long, either. So far as muds go, it's extremely "notable". I know perfectly well that the average mud is lucky to have 10 players and only lasts a couple years if that. I know that because I ran my own mud for three years, and regardless of how great and innovative I think it is, you don't see me putting up articles about it. Regardless, <a href="../../../n/n/o/WP%7ENNOT_83a0.html" title="WP:NNOT">WP:NNOT</a>. While "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", I don't think all the "notability" that gets flying around all the time is quite warranted, even when, in context, something is very notable. Also, think of this, if there's over 100 people online at a given time, how many people must have played it at some point or another? Tens of thousand? Hundreds? Check out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shartak_8b38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shartak">this</a> recent AfD for a game I'd call considerably less "notable" (has been around a lot less time and far fewer players) that nonetheless was kept. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 18:39, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still feel that this article violates <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, no matter what category of website it is. I seriously doubt that "tens of thousand[s]" of people have played this game if it has an Alexa ranking in the millions.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Alexa doesn't reply, as it isn't actually a website. Muds run off telnet protocol, not http, and telnet activity is not taken into account with such things as Google and Alexa.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If nothing else comes of this, I think we need to start drafting a policy for MUDs.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would agree that there should be established guidelines on what makes a mud notable enough to warrant entry. This article does have the potential to develop into an example of what content should be included in an article about a notable mud. Several have given various reasons as to why this article is about a notable mud and as it has been pointed out, this article does need improvement to highlight what has been mentioned as reasons for its notability.Cufece 03:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I agree, and I mentioned this a few days ago. It could be as simple as saying, "a MUD with a tenure exceeding 6 years is notable by definition," or "a mud whose lifespan was at least 60 months" is notable. DSL (and hundreds of others) qualify by default. Or perhaps minimum traffic. I dislike this one, however, because it means that MUD admins who want their game listed can simply inflate traffic figures since they can code the game to report however many logins they want. Page hits on the web site isn't completely fair because not every player is going to view the web site, but considering that DSL doesn't have in-game notes anymore and 100% of non realtime player communication takes place on their web site, an Alexa ranking is probably a pretty assessment of the game's popularity and notability. This won't be the case for all games, however. DSL may even be a rare exception and it doesn't deserve to be penalized because of that. So what standards DO make sense? Tenure strikes me as a critical one, but hell I ran a game that was up for almost five years and never had more than 2 or 3 people on it. Does it deserve an article? God forbid. Perhaps a proper comparison is web comics -- it's a medium with a tiny handful of big hitters, and a legion thousands-strong of wannabes. What's the standard for a webcomic having its own article? What qualifies as notability for a webcomic as compared to other webcomics? What percentage of comics qualify? We may then be able to abstract those standards to come up with a way to distinguish a qualifying from an unqualifying MUD. I would respectfully suggest that the various astroturfing accounts be discouraged from getting involved in any such debate, because I think it's pretty clear that they'll advocate for any standard that's loose enough to allow DSL to qualify. For my part, I don't care whether DSL qualifies or not. Going by the tenure standard, I'm strongly inclined to say it would. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 03:54, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Which brings me to ask once again, why nominate it for deletion then? Although we all know the answer to that.69.6.167.240 13:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Respectfully I take offense to your judgement of other accounts being made here to discuss this debate. Is it true that I made an account here for just such a thing. Yes quite frankly I did. I'm also a working professional that has been on discussion boards for setting standards up in the industry I work in. I will also state that there are probably more just like me that have done just such a thing as well and our comments have been nothing more than countering any statements that have not been true. I don't know you personally, you don't know me and I really don't care if I know you or not. You have also contradicted yourself a few times during this whole entire debate. First you say that the DSL article should be removed because it's not notable. Further down you state that on your proposed list of requirements it would meet 2 of them and that you say it should. So which is it? Even in this statement you are saying that it should. So yes, why is this being nominated for deletion? In most of your discussions you keep referring to WebComics not being recognized as notable enough to warrant its own article. What do WebComics have to do with an article about a MUD? They are two completely different genres that should not fall under the same standards of notability. If you have issue with how WebComics are handled in regards to articles, would it not be better to discuss them elsewhere rather than taking it to a discussion on whether or not THIS particular article should remain? WebComics and its subsequent guidelines for notability have nothing to do with this particular discussion. I will state this quite plainly here, I will agree with any set standard that is in place that removes the chances of bias, regardless if I have played on that site or not.Cdabc 18:40, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're offended that your account was tagged as being exactly what you admit it is? The statements made here have consisted of much more than "countering statements that [are not] true." Some of it has been personal attacks. Some of it has been blatant astroturfing. And some of it has indeed been fact correction. I nominated DSL's article for deletion because I don't think it merits its own article. As the discussion has unfolded, it appears that having an objective standard to measure MUDs by would be helpful. I proposed one. DSL would happen to qualify under it. So be it. I'll take an objective standard over an arbitrary discussion, even if it means that subjects that I don't think merit an article end up getting one. I mentioned webcomics because it's a somewhat analogous situation. Webcomics consist of a tiny handful of big names in a sea of anonymous and unotable entries. There are thousands of web comics that nobody has ever heard of, and a few dozen that anybody has. MUDs are similar. However, the media are different (telnet vs http) and so our metrics and standards would have to be different. I've been trying to hammer some out, nobody has really been helping, only criticizing. I don't have any issues with how web comic notability is defined. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 21:06, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No I'm taking offense to the fact that just because we had made accounts we should be discouraged from speaking or contributing to the subject, when even as you had stated some of these people have made factual corrections for you. You still have not stated though as to why exactly you want it deleted. You said to you it doesn't merit it, on what judgement are you drawing that conclusion? If someone wrote an article about some other obscure MUD would you still be of the same opinion? That is not a personal attack on you, just a mere question. The problem with a great many things on the web, all numbers can be skewed to reflect how people want. So you have to take a great many things at faith. There are only certain things you can ever claim to be exact and verifiable. The day the game started and the day the game closes. # of users on at a time, again as was stated previously, MUDS that permit multiple logins skew that #. Do all of the MUDS report that they allow this? Chances are some do and a lot don't. I don't claim to know every single MUD out there. You can certainly use the # of average players a day on the game as one of the criteria, odds are it will reflect near an actual, but it can't be one of the deciding factors. Again longevity of the game, as another person pointed out, why you chose 80 mths over something more rounded I don't know, but in my opinion in this day and age, if a game lasts over 5 yrs and is still in regular use, it is a game of note. Sure having a write up in a paper, newspaper, magazine.. but what sort of write up are you suggesting here. Because there was actually a write up on two of the players on the game that I know of in their wedding announcement that DID mention DSL as being the place where they had met (including a brief outlying of the type of game it was. Which if you agree that that is an acceptable write-up, as lots of people do read the wedding announcement pages of their local paper, I'll try to track them down in order to obtain a copy of that for you.

<li>Ah, I see the source of the misunderstanding. The point of the "single purpose account" flag is not to "discourage" anybody from speaking or contributing, but to distinguish experienced members of the Wikipedia community from possible cheerleaders or astroturfers. Your opinion is as valid as everybody else's, but if there are 10 seasoned Wikipedia editors who say one thing, and 50 SPAs that say the opposite, it smells like astroturfing. Nobody doubts your sincerity or wishes for you to not talk at all. The reason I think the DSL article ought to be removed is that the game is not especially notable, even for a MUD. It's major notability stems from the various controversies surrounding it, especially in its first few years (note: well after I was not involved in the project). I could document them, but I'd simply be accused of lying and making things up to "bash" to "slander" the game. If the DSL article is going to be so sanitized and diluted as to only contain a summary of the in-game history a few lists of features, very few of which are especially interesting or unique to DSL, then it's not really all that notable as compared to any other MUD. You asked, <i>If someone wrote an article about some other obscure MUD would you still be of the same opinion?</i> Absolutely. I've worked on dozens on MUDs, several of which are still around, one of which is just as tenured as DSL and has nearly as large a player base. I'm not making an article about it, and I'd discourage anybody from doing so. It's not a notable game. You asked, <i>why [would] you chose 80 mths over something more rounded.</i> I just pulled a number out of a hat. Five years seemed too short, ten seemed too long. The idea was not to suggest THE number we have to follow, but to get the idea out there and let the community debate how long the tenure actually should be. Regretfully, this hasn't really happened yet. You said, <i>if a game lasts over 5 yrs and is still in regular use, it is a game of note.</i> For a game starting <i>now,</i> I'd agree. If another game started when DSL did and died out after 5 years, I'd say no. You asked, <i>what sort of write up are you suggesting here.</i> There was a MUD that got mentioned once in an issue of <i>PC Gamer</i> in the mid-nights. Imperial City or City of Dreams or something. That alone makes it notable, in my opinion. Anything that might elevate the game to the level of being exposed to either national media (e.g., published in a magazine that enjoys national circulation), or a work of academic repute. What kind of write-up? In this case it was just a mention by an author, that he'd played Ultima On-Line and EverQuest and found a text-MUD to be a more immersive roleplaying experience. A wedding announcement is not a matter of the game making news. Anybody can put almost anything in a wedding announcement. I'm talking about the game being featured in a story, where it has earned the attention of people who are not involved in it. There's the key distinction. The genesis of the mention is critical. If I'm a MUD player who happens to be on the faculty at the University of Dayton and I wrote my graduate thesis about the MUD, that's not notable. I play it. If a professor who is not involved in it decides to study it and write about it, that <i>is</i> notable. Clearly, there's something unique or notable about the community/game that warranted an academic taking a professional interest in it. A couple of players mentioning DSL in their wedding announcement is <i>not</i> notable. <a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 23:49, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>I will preface this vote by saying that I actually came to this website to see what Wikipedia had on Dark and Shattered Lands, because it popped up on my google search when I was looking for a different page. I'm apparently coming in to this at the end, and made an account specifically to place my vote. Take that as you will. Now, on to my voting reason. Once cannot assume in any way shape or form that the number of players at any given time confers notability. If one were to look at the MudConnector stats (<a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mudconnect.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mudconnect.com/index.html</a>) one would see that 6 of the top 10 muds listed have less than DSL does at any given time, yet enough people enjoy the mud to vote repetitively to get it to that top 10. (The 6 being: SlothMUDIII (25-49), Federation II (25-49), Duris:Land of BloodLust (25-49), Shadows of Isildur (10-24), Mozart MUD (10-24) and Armageddon (25-49)) I will be the first to acknowledge, now that I've seen what is on the Wikipedia DSL page, that it should be updated to be more informative, rather than just an in-game timeline. Given the chance to edit it, I will do so. As for notability, I can assure you that any of the numerous couples who have met and gotten married due to this game, or facilitated by this game, would take offense that this game is being considered non-notable. Add in the college psychology course where the professor and several of his students played (some of which remain playing, a year and a half after the fact), and its notability grows. Is it World of Warcraft, breaking records for subscriptions and money earned? No, but having just come back from the annual DSL Convention, which 55-60 other players attended, I can assure you, it's far from non-notable.Lillathrin 17:24, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The trimmed average of all these, not counting Mozart, is in the range of 700,000. It's notable that MozartMUD doesn't even registration. This puts DSL firmly out of the running based on Alexa rank, but Armageddon, for example, has an atrocious Alexa rank but few serious MUD'ers would argue that it's not a notable MUD. It also has a small player base. Further, should a new game with a big player base not qualify because it's new? I would suggest the following criteria for MUD notability.</dd>

<dd>If a MUD meets two of the four following criteria, it merits its own Wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>1. Active user base numbering in the hundreds (that is, 100+)</dd>
<dd>2. Alexa ranking of 750,000 or lower</dd>
<dd>3. Meets notability standards of existing Wikipedia guidelines, such as WEB</dd>
<dd>4. Game has or had a tenure of at least 80 months.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This way, if a game existed forever but nobody ever played it, it doesn't qualify. If a game is short-lived but very popular, it might qualify, and if it lives long enough, it may qualify even if its player base declines. Now, we can fudge all these numbers, too. The Alexa one in particular I think could use some adjustment.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I can honestly say before reading all this dialogue, I had never heard of Alexa, and thus it took me a few minutes to figure out exactly what everyone was talking about!&#160;:) The most accurate way I've found to average numbers such as those (the Alexa rankings) is to throw out the high and the low, since they're so very much higher and lower, and add up and divide the ones that are left. (This is what we did in my Statistics for Psychology class.)That leaves you with an average of 958,654 which I think is a more representative Alexa figure. I would put an Alexa ranking of 1,000,000 as your cut off in that case, since that number seems more representative for MUDs these days. I do realize it would still cut off DSL in this case, but so be it, I'm talking about for future notability issues. I'm not sure why you went halfway through a year and went for 80 months, I'd even it out and go for 84 months. It's also kind of rough determining what meets those notability standards, since it at least partially appears to be a matter of opinion (hence this discussion!) I do think it's a very good idea to determine a set guideline for notability overall for MUD pages in Wikipedia.Lillathrin 03:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apparantly it is reliable, just not for so small a data set. I'd suggest then that replace the "Alexa" requirement with something else. Or, we can simply evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

<dd>How is Alexa relevant? Doesn't it rank traffic statistics for users who have downloaded their toolbar? And how does web traffic dictate the over all use a telnet based game? The same goes for Google. DSL was live more than two full years before google even became a search engine.69.6.167.240 21:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is the point and purpose of now saying that it should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis?? IF you are going to be doing that, then there is no reason to even try to set a standard and a guideline. The point of having a guideline is to avoid judging things on a case-by-case evaluation, it either is or it isn't. If there is extenuating circumstances, then it can come up for review. Simply saying now to evaluate on a case-by-case basis only allows for bias and regardless of what you do and do not say, no one is completely 100% unbiased about things unless they have never had any interaction with or knowledge of the particular topic at hand. People judge things based on their own personal opinion, thoughts and beliefs. If you are going to set a guideline, then these personal opinions can not come in to play at all. You need a solid guideline that does not allow for this. Cdabc 00:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FYI, Alexa was rejected as a basis for any evaluation for web content previously, not the least of which because it is not an unbiased, accurate, or reliable source, nevermind the fact that a mud isn't even a website in the first place. Alexa is a piece of spyware that quite a large number of people do not use, and you really end up only measuring how many people visit a particular website who happen to be using Alexa's toolbar. Don't even bring Alexa rankings into any discussion on "notability". --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 02:40, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's worth noting here that at least one other genre of media on Wikipedia use Alexa ranking as one of several standards for notability, so it's already been established as appropriate for part of Wikipedia by the community of editors. There is (at least) one key distinction, however, and that is that the other genre (webcomics) is by definition measurable by web traffic. There is no reliable measure of MUD activity unless one wishes to trust the MUD to self-report its players accurately. I don't know of any games offhand that don't have accurate player reporting, but as somebody pointed out above, games that allow multiplaying can appear to have more players than they do. Further, if people know that to merit a Wikipedia article, one need only have X number of players, it's trivial for an unscrupulous MUD admin to conjure up enough logins to qualify. Hence, my contention that something beyond simple player count is necessary to establish notability on Wikipedia. Tenure is, I think, a strong measure as well, but there are long-tenured MUDs with small player bases (Armageddon comes to mind) that are notable. And there are long-tenured muds with small player bases that most certainly are not. Moosehead SLED was the development playform for a major release of the ROM code base, which is still in widespread use today, and it existed for well over ten years. Player base was in the 50's-60's at its height, and at one point it had over 100 logins. It eventually died off. Notable? As in, Wikipedia-notable? I really don't think so. Others might. So how do we determine which games merit an article? I think having a list of 4-5 criteria, and requiring that a game meet at least 2-3 of them to be considered worthy of its own article is a good idea. That kind of method allows for a variety of factors to constitute notability in a MUD/MUSH/MOO/whatever. So, back to ideas. I think tenure is clearly one, and so is population. Verifiable mention in a published work (newspaper, magazine, academic paper by a professor or as part of a dissertation, not some undergraduate student thesis in Psych 101) could go on the list.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm torn on this one. She hasn't done anything of note yet, and I can't find any English-language articles from reliable sources that focus on her. But I suppose that's normal, as she's 11. However, with royalty I tend to agree with Fan-1967; she's born into notability, however scant. Prince Harry has been notable since birth, and the biggest news he ever made was dressing up like a Nazi for Halloween. In my opinion, royal children are notable simply for their close association with truly notable adults. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 15:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I don't believe in the automatic notability of <i>anyone</i> from Belgium.

I'm not really sure how to explain something that seems so obvious to me ... there are a number of things where <i>being X</i> makes one inherently notable, so that all Prime Ministers of Canada are inherently worthy of an article, for example, even if they're John Turner bland. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I may, its a kind of name recognition. For example, you're standing around with a bunch of other people at a party. Someone says "Oh look its Clint Eastwood", and likely many people will turn to look at Clint Eastwood. Someone says "Oh look its John Jones" and unless there's some reasonably famous person named John Jones, maybe one or two people will look. In this case, if someone says "Oh look its Princess Luisa Maria of the Royal House of Belgium" I believe (being a dumb american with no royal house myself) that there would be a similar, if smaller, reaction to Clint Eastwood.<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 20:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Royalty are intrinsically noteworthy, not because of personal deeds, but because their kinship to monarchs confers upon them national (and sometimes international) position (usually, though not invariably, reflected by title), fame, and constitutional relevance.</li>
<li>Excluding them would be a reversal of encyclopaedic practice, usually defended on relatively recent, egalitarian principles that are inadmissably POV: believing that royalty <i>shouldn't</i> be intrinsically notable seems to be a growing trend, but it does not <i>make</i> them non-notable. Whereas treating royalty as non-notable is ahistorical (not to mention Western-centric): The burden of proof that historical encyclopaedic practice has been overturned due to a sufficiently great change in current standards of notability (rather than due to, e.g. space considerations -- a limitation from which Wiki does not suffer) rests upon the advocate for change.</li>
<li>Thus far no argument has been put forth here that royalty have <i>lost</i> notability -- rather, the chief argument presented here is, implicitly, that they did not deserve it previously, and that Wiki should pro-actively strip them of it. <i>Not</i> Wiki's job.</li>
<li>In this particular case, I also agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> that the question of notability would not get serious consideration if the princess in question were a granddaughter of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a> (e.g. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Beatrice_of_York_88f0.html" title="Princess Beatrice of York">Princess Beatrice of York</a>) rather than of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_II_of_Belgium_db02.html" title="Albert II of Belgium">Albert II of Belgium</a>, although both are current monarchs. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 04:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The difference is that few would dare to slap a non-notability claim on a grandchild of Queen Elizabeth, since there are far more Britons here than Belgians.

It's even self-referenced on the show occasionally. <b>Delete</b> list of vehicles - these aren't generally the source of running gags on the show, except for the Simpson family's two regular cars being destroyed frequently and then magically fixing themselves. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 20:28, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Homer's job is clearly an important plot element that merits analysis within the Simpsons oeuvre. It is frequently discussed in Simpsons literature and critical studies. The vehicle page is less vital, but certainly deserves inclusion if we want encyclopedic coverage of this pathbreaking show. Both fully adhere to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> guideline on how to treat this type of subject, although more refs would be welcome. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:41, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the list of vehicles; <b>neutral</b> for the list of jobs. At least Homer's jobs are an important element in the show. But vehicles? Honestly, they rarely play a role, and nobody needs an encyclopedia article to learn that Otto the School Bus Driver drives a school bus and Mr. Burns has a limo. Important one-shot vehicles are already covered in the episodes featuring them. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaestlin_04d4.html" title="User:Maestlin">Maestlin</a> 18:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This would not set a precedent for other articles like this to be made, as hardly any TV shows have characters that could possibly have an article like this. This is the sort of information that would normally be on the character's main page, as a brief note, but this is an exceptional case: the number of jobs is so huge that it can constitute it's own article. This is basically a part of his main article, but it is too unwieldy to not have seperate. --Rayshaw 22:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> These plane crashes are utterly non-notable from an encyclopedic point of view. The reasoning that these subjects should have their own article "because it reminded people of 9/11" means that 9/11 is encyclopedically notable and not these incidents. Wikipedia is not a news report database, and as I keep saying, there are many stories (even ones which receive worldwide coverage which people in Scotland hear about) in the news media that are <b>not</b> encyclopedically notable. Widespread media coverage is <b>not</b> guarantee of notability. This is not the the myth of <a href="../../../i/c/a/Icarus.html" title="Icarus">Icarus</a>. These incidents were of substantially less consequence than, for instance, the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalese_cable-car_disaster.html" title="Cavalese cable-car disaster">1998 USMC/Italian cable car disaster</a> or the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinook_Helicopter_Crash_%281994%29_4ac5.html" title="Chinook Helicopter Crash (1994)">1994 RAF Chinook crash on the Mull of Kintyre</a>. These were not large scale air disasters, but they both had serious long-lasting effects on much broader and vital contexts (US-Italian relations in the first instance, and the British counter-terrorism in Northern Ireland in the second). The two crashes in this afd did not. Will the general public care much about the two afd incidents in 100 yrs time or even 10 yrs time? Some people seem to want to put everything that's reported in the news media in wikipedia, but that's not what an encyclopedia is for.

<li>As <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> has stated, nothing much happened so their importance as news was transient, and they have been forgotten by most of us. The articles seem to overemphasize the importance of the events.</li>

My personal opinion is all that is required on this page - <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> applies only on article-space. You are welcome to disagree with me, and clearly do. To answer your challenge: I have read some of one online version of Dr Bruno's books at <a href="http://www.mcqsonline.com/exams/aipg/2004/" class="external text" title="http://www.mcqsonline.com/exams/aipg/2004/" rel="nofollow">this site</a>. I think it is reasonable to assume all six books are of a similar kind, given the titles. I completely stand by everything I said, including the nominator's comment that the article/subject fails all three notability guidelines.:</dd>

<li><b>Doctors</b> need to be significant experts in a <i>medical</i> discipline, not in examination/training. Otherwise every teacher and lecturer would have a Wikipedia page.

<li><b>Books</b> - See <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html#Criteria_.28academic_books.29" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)#Criteria (academic books)</a>.</li>

<dd>The "junior doctor" statement is not given to indicate that age should prevent the subject having an article.

<p><b>I have to disagree</b> with the following words - <i>Dr Bruno's books are not "textbooks" according to my definition</i> I repeat that I satisfy the criteria given by Wikipedia. Each one of you will have one definition for textbook and a book cannot satisfy all your whims and fancies</p>
<p>Coming to your comments</p>
<p>With reference to the academic books, the guidelines are <i>Academic books are often highly specialized, have small printing runs, are not sold in most bookstores, and may only be available in specialized libraries. For these reasons, the bulk of standards delineated previously for mainstream books are incompatible in the academic bailiwick.</i></p>
<p>COming to the individual criteria</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the book printed by a reputable or well known academic press? <b>Jaypee Brothers is the biggest publisher of Medical Books in India</b></li>
<li>How widely cited is the book by other publications/media? For this inquiry, be especially mindful of <b>how specialized the book's subject</b> is and, thus, how circumscribed both the book's audience and the body of literature in the area may be.</li>
<li>How well known is the author in general, and how well know is the author in the field of interest covered by the book? <b>You can search in google regarding AIIMS, All India PG, TNPSC, TNPG, etc</b> or you can visit the sites www.rxpgonline.com www.aippg.com www.netmedicos.com</li>
<li>How influential is the book considered in its specialty area? Unless you are in India, I don't think you can answer this question. My books along with Other authors like Mudhit Khanna, Sumer Sethi, Amit, Aashish are the current books followed in India</li>
<li>Is the book known to be taught or required reading in a number of reputable educational institutions? <b>No</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Hence the book satisfies 4 criteria followed by Wikipedia. Please note the the published work means both papers as well as text books</p>
<p><br />
<b>I have to disagree</b> with the following words <i>I think it is reasonable to assume all six books are of a similar kind, given the titles</i> <big><big>This is highly insulting. If you don't have the patience or time to go through the entire material evidence, then you should refrain from voting. Please note that YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT <b>TO ASSUME</b> ABOUT MY BOOKS</big></big> Of the six books, two (PrePG Medicine Handbook and TNPSC Interview Buster are textbooks)</p>
<p><br />
With reference to the words <i>Merely to show that in terms of the medical world, this person has not (yet) risen to the level where one might expect to be notable (professor, consultant, etc)</i> I would like to tell that I am a consultant at www.rxpgonline.com www.aippg.com and www.netmedicos.com Hence this statement again is baseless and totally imaginatory.</p>
<p>Hence I guess that the user will look into the matter as a whole and decide.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 14:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I apologise for my assumption that all the books are similar. Dr Bruno has kindly pointed out that he considers two of them as "textbooks", though admits that neither are actually "known to be taught or required reading in a number of reputable educational institutions".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first is "PrePG Medicine Handbook". This is a book, originally authored by two PG students called Zulfi and Raj. Hence the full name is <a href="http://www.jaypeebrothers.com/pgDetails.asp?cat=s&amp;book_id=81-8061-811-0" class="external text" title="http://www.jaypeebrothers.com/pgDetails.asp?cat=s&amp;book_id=81-8061-811-0" rel="nofollow">Zulfi Raj's Pre-PG Medicine Handbook</a>. According to the cover photo, this was revised (for the 3rd edition) by Dr Bruno. From what I have been able to gather, it is a supplemental handbook to be used alongside <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison%27s_Principles_of_Internal_Medicine_ff76.html" title="Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine">Harrison</a>. According to Dr Bruno<a href="http://www.aippg.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5284" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aippg.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5284" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> it contains 2% of Harrison but "that 2 % of Harrison you get from Zulfi Raj will help you answer 20 % of Question from Harrison". The only recommendations to buy this book (indeed, the only information on this book) comes from one of Dr Bruno's own web sites, the sites of his affiliates and from Dr Bruno's own postings on forums. The following <a href="http://www.aippg.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17351" class="external text" title="http://www.aippg.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17351" rel="nofollow">forum discussion</a> regarding the book has Dr Bruno explaining the copyright situation regarding condensing Harrison.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second is "TNPSC Interview Buster". Details of this book can be found <a href="http://www.targetpg.in/exams/tnpsc/books/orals/" class="external text" title="http://www.targetpg.in/exams/tnpsc/books/orals/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It is published by TargetPG, who appear to be affiliates of Dr Bruno. This is effectively self-published. It may be a comprehensive guide to passing your medical interview, but that doesn't count as a "textbook" to me. This book fails on all counts of notability.</dd>

<li>One of the six books is not an exam-cram book. It is a self-published guide to passing medical entrance interviews.</li>
<li>Not all five exam cram books are the same. One of them is not based on the past-questions-with-answers format but is a condesed supplement to real textbooks (such as Harrison). In addition, Dr Bruno is not the original author.</li>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me also make it clear that I still do not regard any of the books as textbooks (i.e. a book worthy of being the set-text in an education establishment). The Notability (Book) criteria are for an article on the book. Very few published authors are notable. If one of Dr Bruno's books was notable in itself, then that might help establish that the author might be notable. IMO they are not and he is not.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I request your kind attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Using_the_subject_as_a_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Using_the_subject_as_a_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Using_the_subject_as_a_source</a> <i>check that the article in question does not contain any unsourced or poorly sourced criticism. If it does, delete it.</i> Hence, I guess, as per policies, I have every right to delete an article about me. I don't want guys who have NO (I repeat <b>NO</b>) knowledge about Indian Books pass judgement about my merit unnecessarily. The article was proposed for deletion first on notability. When I proved notability, it has changed to Vanity. I guess it is some one who does not like me trying to tarnish my name. This is a phenomenon that has been emerging in Wikipedia. Since they cannot write rubbish in the main article, they nominate the article for deletion and vent all the frustations (non-notable, limited shelf-life etc). One guy has written that the author is non-notable since he has "never read the book". I have never read any plays of Shakespeare. Can I tell that Shakespeare is non-notable just because I have not read the books. If there is any doubt regarding the books, one can always email or phone the publisher. Instead, nominating biographies for deletion and then slandering the individual has been the recent (sorry) phenomenon in Wikipedia.</dd>

<li>There are no Vanity photos.</li>
<li>There are no Vanity text edits.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, I invite your attention to the following guidelines</p>
<ul>
<li>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what <b>degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article</b> being created in Wikipedia</li>
<li>Lack of fame is <b>not the same</b> as vanity.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 05:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><s>Unhesitatingly</s> Strong and speedy Delete</b> I am a graduate (MBBS) &amp; post-graduate (MD) from Delhi, India, and am myself a doctor with extensive education and major contributions to two international textbooks. I have no hesitation in recommending a <b>delete</b> for this article written for self-propogation. The use of Wikipedia is to spread information, not project one's own self. The very fact that one has written an article about one's own self on a public website is suggestive of vanity. Otherwise all doctors would write and have a page dedicated to them, since at least some of them and their patients may think that they are famous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, books written should have a purpose other than 'made for cramming' exams like the Post-Graduate (PG) medical entrance in India - indeed a short half-life. Compare that with widely read books like Harrison's Principles &amp; Practice of Internal Medicine, or Bailey &amp; Love's Short Practice of Surgery, which are authoritative texts with multiple editions and enduring reference value. Frankly, I never read this particular author's "books" to prepare for my PG entrance exams in Delhi, nor heard about him from my extended group of doctor/medical student/PG friends all over North India. Otherwise also, doctors like Salgunan, Bhatia et al could claim to be much more widely read authors of such "best-sellers", with an evidently much wider circulation.</p>
<p>However, a new article about Post-Graduate entrance exams in India may be written with a "neutral point of view" (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), which can include a listing of the main authors of PG entrance exam books rankwise (probably based on concrete evidence of copies sold, not necessarily "Out of print") and mention his name in the appropriate place - that should be acceptable. <a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyeMD_e9c0.html" title="User:EyeMD">EyeMD</a> 11:14, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DO you see in all those articles the peculiar phenonemon of same person voting three times for the same article to be deleted. When you are going to this extent (that too inspite of me giving all the proof for notifiability and verifiability) and citing new reasons such as unpleasant behaviour in the debate page (remember that my replies were posted AFTER your messages - In such a context, what is your justification for your initial message asking this article to be deleted) as the reason for deletion (since you have no valid reason) how can you I assume Good Faith.

<dd>Even if you take your "vote to get legit" how can you deny that you had voted more than once. And what is the reason for this strange phenomenon.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. This is a borderline notability case if you ask me, but the apparent vanity pushes me toward deletion as the proper rationale.

<dd>Not necessarily true, when I finished my high schooling, I wrote my own solutions to exams for the Australian Chemistry Olympiad and Australian Physics Olympiad (totalling more than 200 hand-written pages) and photocopied them and gave them to my high school so that future students could use them if they found them helpful. Five years later, I still haven't done any original research that could result in a 2 page publication in a proper physics research journal. I know that my notes haven't been published in any particular way, but it is similar to a lot of high school teachers who make their own exam solutions manuals and sell them to students. Personally, I'd rather not have some high school Chemistry teachers have their own bio seeing as a lot of them (in Australia anyway) seem to think that 1M of H2SO4 gives 2M H+ for instance, or don't know what NMR spectroscopy is or then think that the alpha-hydrogen of 2-propanol gives rise to a septuplet splitting due to the bogus rule "methyl makes four" rather than realise that there are 6 adjacent hydrogens for the n+1 rule. Also you see most high school physics teachers say stuff like "mass increases as speed increases", so to be honest (imho), I don't personally trust academic publications by people with bachelor's degrees unless they have got scientific publications. As for the WP:BIO, it is a guideline, which is not a rock-solid rule, and this is my personal opinion. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And please <b>don't compare Xeroxed (photo copied) versions of "notes" with a text book published by the biggest publisher of medical books of a country with 1000 million population.</b> It is very clear that the own handwritten notes which are photocopied are non notable (and non verifiable also) and a book with ISBN Number published by a publisher and available in online medical stores is notable. These are not to be compared. Even I had compiled a question and answer quide to be used by students of Devendra College of Physiotherapy in 2003. My notes have been used by a lot of juniors.

<dd>I don't feel that I am changing tack since my original argument on Monday as to why I feel this article should be deleted. As I said before <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline - there is no magic formula. I never presumed that I was of similar notability to you because of my comment about the solutions to the Olympiad papers which I wrote for students at my old high school - I simply used this to explain your comment that writing solution manuals and exam guides are not at the same level of academic achievement as doing original research and formulating new theories and experiments. My comment about high school teachers selling lots of Yr 12 solutions manuals and study guides still holds - most of them cannot remember what they learnt in first year university which is why I'm saying that I don't automatically trust the academic worthiness of material published by a person with a bachelor's degree outside of scientific journal publications. My comment about my home-made volunteer notes were only to reply to your suggestion that a solutions manual takes more skill than to do original research. Personally I disagree with this. I am not being stubborn and refusing to switch because I have been "proven wrong" - I am still unconvinced. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 04:40, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I guess I could meet that criteria by joining a dodgy club with a few other guys from high school who write exam guides and get myself on WP as a physicist?

<dd>Vanity means that he suspects that you, your family, your organisation/associates were responsible for the creation of this page. Vanity isn't really a deletion criteria, but simply doesn't look good - when quoted in deletion debates, it normally implies that the commenter feels that it is nn and vanity, but I don't want to put words into WilyD's mouth.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>This is exactly what I am saying.</dd>
<dd>The initial claim was Verifiability - They said that there were no books even without caring to check for it. I proved that I have written those books. After I had successfully countered the claim, the criteria for deletion changed</dd>
<dd>After <b>they found that the article was verifiable and that they could not argue on that point, they changed the criteria to notability</b>. When it was proved that the subject has <b>written 6 medical books with ISBN Numbers and published by the biggest medical publisher in India</b> and the current concept and the established guidelines of Wikipedia does not differentiate between Text Books / Fiction / Exam Oriented Book, there were insulting remarks like junior doctor / academic qualifications etc. I have proved that All those claims were inappropriate</dd>
<dd>The present claim is Vanity. Now even <b>BInguyen agrees that "Vanity isn't really a deletion criteria"</b></dd>
<dd><big><big>The only reason for including this criteria is to discredit and defame me.</big></big> If you want proof, I can give you examples as to how few users are going around all talk pages and trying to gather opinion against me</dd>
<dd>There are two reasons for this debate
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Few Users do not like me in real world and want to tarnish my name. If you want proof, I can give examples. I have already shown that to few users personally and don't want to dilute the main discussion. They have not responded to my question here (where as the genuine wikipedians have responded here and also at my talk page) but drag my name into controversy at various talk pages and discussions</li>
<li>Few Users (Genuine Wikipedians) have given a hasty vote and just want to justify their initial mistake. <b>Their ego prevents them from going back and rectifying their own mistakes. SO to defend their initial hasty vote, they invent new criteria</b></li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>One user's initial comment was "junior doctor" "exam-cram books" of "limited shelf-life". He was not able to substantiate any of the reasons. It was well decided that age is not a criteria. The user has <b>no right to label "limited Shelf life"</b> even without seeing the books. And there is no criteria that differentiates Exam Oriented books from Text Books <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28people%29#Exam_Books" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Notability_%28people%29#Exam_Books" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> The user did not stop with this. He went to the extent of saying that one of my books was self published and hence not notable. But he intentionally avoided mentioning that <big><big>5 of the books have been published by reputed firms and hence they are notable</big></big>. THis is a clear cut case of <b>personal bias</b> and <b>not staying neutral</b></li>
<li>One user's comment was Vanity. When it has been proved that I am not the creator of the article, he has not responded. Also I have proved using the existing guidelines as to why this is not vanity. What pains me is the fact that there are users who do not have the patience of reading my well quoted points, but just give their hasty opinion</li>
<li>After that It was pointed out that I don't have an post graduation. There is no criteria as to say that only doctors with post graduation has to write books or that only those with post graduation are notable. This criteria was later withdrawn</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In short I have clearly proved that this article satisfies all the established and current criteria and guidelines of Wikipedia. If you have any doubt regarding any particular point, discuss that and I am ready to respond</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And please don't compare Xeroxed (photo copied) versions of "notes" with a text book published by the biggest publisher of medical books of a country with 1000 million population. It is very clear that the own handwritten notes which are photocopied are non notable (and non verifiable also) and a book with ISBN Number published by a publisher and available in online medical stores is notable. These are not to be compared. Even I had compiled a question and answer quide to be used by students of Devendra College of Physiotherapy in 2003. My notes have been used by a lot of juniors. They are non notable. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 02:56, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The core problem has been brought out by one user. It is a simple case of not differentiating between a published book and photocopied notes. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 03:08, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To summarise</p>
<p><b>1. Notability of Books.</b> THe books have an ISBN Number. 5 books are published by reputed firms. 4 of those are published by the biggest medical publisher in India. In such a case, one user who gave a knee jerk comment in the first place has choosen the 6th (1 out of 6 minority) and say that it is self publishable. He has ignored 5 because his ego prevents him from going back on his earlier words <b>2. Notability (people)</b> 1. Published authors - 6 books is more than enough to satisfy this criteria <b>3. Notability (doctor)</b> You can search at www.rxpgonline.com <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.rxpgonline.com+bruno+help&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.rxpgonline.com+bruno+help&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> www.aippg.net/forum<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.aippg.net+bruno+help&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.aippg.net+bruno+help&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[54]</a> and www.netmedicos.com <a href="http://www.netmedicos.com/contributors/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.netmedicos.com/contributors/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> and unless some one is regarded as an expert in that area (PG Preparation), you will not see students from the length and breath of a country with 1000 million population to ask for my help.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>Regarding the counter points 1. The article was not written by me. When this controversy erupted, I read the guidelines regarding autobiography and has followed what is given in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you</a> Even without going through the debate, when users accuse of vanity (as if I have created the article) it hurts a lot 2. WP:BIO clearly says that you can have articles on published authors. There is no talk about Junior/Senior, Undergraduation/Post Graduation, Fiction/Nonfiction etc.</p>
<p>My main concern is that all these points come out only after I put a counter question. They are not the real facts, but are made up as the users ego prevent them from stepping back. In order to substantiate the hasty vote, they invent new guideline. Wounded by these new "self invented" guidelines, I even deleted the article my self, but that has been restored<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 03:19, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Delete</b>. I have read this page carefully and the arguments put by both sides. This page makes me deeply uncomfortable. While Doctor Bruno may be satisfying the letter of the rules and while he may be very adept at quoting them I feel he is violating their spirit. As far as I can see, that appears to be the core underpinning of many of the delete arguments here.</dd>
<dd>Writing/ not writing a minimum number of books or having/ not having a PhD is not the issue -- it is the subject's notability. For all the scraping over the minimum level of the "notability bar" that Doctor Bruno is claiming to have achieved, in practice there appears to be no evidence that he has <i>actually</i> achieved it. He is not actually notable in people's minds.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps, with his level of audacity he will be in the future. But right now, this article is simply not in the spirit of Wikipedia. 193.129.65.37 03:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This proves my earlier claims that there are forces working against me with the sole <b>intention of deleting this article irrespective of wikipedian guidelines</b>. They keep giving various criteria for deleting and after it has been successfully argued that the guidelines are very clear regarding keeping the article as per the opinion of one user who says that <b>satisfying the letter of the rules</b><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 03:57, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This article is clearly a <b>Strong Delete</b>. There is an element of paranoia concerning Doctor Bruno's responses that I find disturbing. I am unaffiliated with the people who initially chose to nominate this page for deletion. However, I find myself in strong agreement with them. I am NOT part of some international ring committed to persecuting Doctor Bruno. Frankly, I have better people to persecute.</dd>
<dd>My feelings are very similar to those of user 193.129.65.37. Whether he remains anonymous or not is irrelevent to the validity of his comments. This is about the spirit of Wikipedia rules - not about their wording per se. We are not lawyers bound to argue over the triviality of individual words. We are looking at which articles contribute to the essence of what Wikipedia is. This article does not.</dd>
<dd>It is hard precisly to define why it doesn't. This may infuriate Dr. Bruno but is merely part of the underlying difficulties of the English language. It is very inadequate at explaining certain concepts. For instance it's harder to explain what a table is than to know one when you see it. Similarly, it's hard to explain what is notable but it's easy to know it when you see it. Doctor Bruno might like to read the book <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink_%28book%29.html" title="Blink (book)">Blink</a> before saying that people can't make judgements without wading through lots and lots of his verbose arguments.</dd>
<dd>This is my best attempt at explaining why this article doesn't work:</dd>
<dd>1. The focus group Doctor Bruno says his name is notable within (a particular set of people chosing to take a particular set of exams within a particular field in a particular country) is already very limited. And yet, I find myself wondering, were I to take a blind sampling of such people and show them a photo of Doctor Bruno or ask them if they recognised his name - would they say they recognised him as a leading light?</dd>
<dd>2. The web sites Doctor Bruno provides do not, I think, provide proof of notability in and of themselves. They have the appearance of vanity publications themselves - like Who's Who in Engineering or Journalism... as opposed to the original Who's Who. A quick search for Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas in MyWay.com (which uses Ask, Google, Yahoo and Look Smart) shows most of the links to Doctor Bruno are to his own web site - not external pieces on him. The few that aren't again appear to be meta lists of vanity web pages. While not proof, this is an indication that reporters, external peer reviewed journals and other academics just aren't talking about this gentleman.</dd>
<dd>3. For a doctor and a gentleman I find Bruno's language to be not far off brow-beating in its intensity. I would recommend Doctor Bruno, if he is as notable as claimed, asks some of his more detached supporters (who have less self-invested emotional interest in the article) to outline positive reasons for its inclusion.</dd>
<dd>These arguments don't do my position full justice (as outlined above). But I feel they give an adequate indication of my unease. There is, quite clearly, little notability here as far as I can see. I'm sure that will change in time and I wish Doctor Bruno luck in the future. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:16, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As an after thought on "the word of the rules versus their intention", I'd like to refer Doctor Bruno to the comments at the top of Wikipedia's page on People and Notability. It says: "Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included, meeting one or more does not mean that a subject must be included." - in other words: follow the rules unless Wikipedians tend to feel they shouldn't be followed in a particular case. That would appear to be the instance here. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Sigh) Again, you attempt to use specifics to counter a generality. It is a very tiresome form of deconstructionist argument that loses its fascination quickly for people who don't like debate simply for the sake of it. If I give you an answer you will merely retort "well, if not 20 people then how about 21, or 22?".</dd>
<dd>Such pedantry on your part does not alter my opinion. 3 books, 6 books, 156 books make little difference. Notability is not the same as how much you've been published - or every journalist in the world would appear in Wikipedia. It is about the essence of notability. Quite simply -- how many people would say "I know him" if I stood in a particular place at a particular time and said "Who knows this guy?". I think you fail that test. I have outlined my reasons and I feel your retorts are motivated by ego. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May be my retorts are motivated by ego, but my simple question is how can you think that the test will fail even without doing that and that is not verifiability. Every one can <i>think</i> anything, but wikipedia is based on <b>verifiability</b> and not on imaginary researches like <i>if i ask</i>. If any one of the editors here had infact tried this test and then said not notable, I would not have <i>retorted</i> But that is not the case.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 08:07, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doctor Bruno posted the following comments to my personal page. I feel they indicate a willful, almost troll-like, desire towards pedantry. My opinion remains that this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 07:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your explanation. I respect your words that reporters, external peer reviewed journals and other academics just aren't talking about this gentleman and hence the subject is not notable. You should also understand that I never disagreed with people who gave such decent explanations. On the other hand, you should also understand that it may be insulting when some one invents criteria like exam books/ junior doctor etc It was against those words that I choose to argue.</p>
<p>But I disagree with your words that I ask some of his more detached supporters to outline positive reasons for its inclusion That, I feel is a wrong way to do this. The case should be argued on the basis of merits and not based on the number of people supporting it (as it has been done now). Again this sentence make me doubt that you have misunderstood my intentions. I was arguing not to "keep" the article, but to protest against the hasty decisions and invention of new criteria in justifying facts.</p>
<p>And your words a particular set of people chosing to take a particular set of exams within a particular field in a particular country is again a misinterpretation. It is about EVERY ONE in a particular field in a particular country taking the COMMON Exam after Undergraduation. The exam is taken by some 60,000 doctors every year. Hence I feel that you have not understood the reality correctly and is of the wrong opinion regarding the limited scope. The scope is of course limited, but not as limited as you could think of.</p>
<p>And you have not given any reason as to why an author of 6 books is non-notableDoctor Bruno 07:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Bit premature to afd this stub, any US Serviceman charged with espionage is notable. The fact he has been held in secret for four months against established legal precedent makes it especially so.

<li><b>Comment</b>: My first reaction is to say, keep. It certainly looks like a notable case to me. Any concerns of soapboxing/<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> could be addressed through editing. However my worry is that there's not much information on this yet. I couldn't google anything on the subject other than the one source already cited. I'd feel a lot more comfortable in asserting notability if multiple <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a> could be cited.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If there is, it isn't to be found online. Google returns exactly two hits on the name, both referring to a seventh-grader, and other search engines produce similar. Very strange, I'd think a blog or two would have picked up the story at least. Not necessarily indicative of anything, though.

<li>As the original tag placer, it seems clear that as of today, enough notability has been established -- facts that did not exist when the tag was originally applied (no results appears in google, no sources were listed in the article, etc. -- all very good reasons to list as afd). Now that creditibility has been established, the afd tag can probably be removed -- now that verifiable sources have been added to the article (a critical gap in the original writing IMHO). --<a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 14:19, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An as-yet-unreleased film (supposedly set to be released in late 2006 or in early 2007, depending on which of the author's pages you're reading; Mullet Apocalypse and Awesomely Awesome Productions are the other pages) by a non-noteworthy production company established by a group of recent film school graduates. At best crystal-ballism. Probably also a vanity article, as the author's user ID bears a strong resemblance to the name of a co-director and star. The prod was contested, so I'm listing it here. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 18:09, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article needs to be expanded and made more meaty. If something is mentioned and discussed in an academic journal, we cannot classify it a neologism. The article in question goes into more detail about the relationships and their impact. We should not use google as a tool for deciding whether or not knowledge is encyclopaedic, and those who would delete this page should at least go through the trouble of reading the issue of the journal in question. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a><sup><a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">Talk</a></sup> 19:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What academic journal is it mentioned and discussed in? Neither you nor the article have cited one. Are you being confused by the fact that I found a mere occurrence of the phrase "closed loop" in a journal article? That doesn't mean that the article is even about this subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Forgive me, but I felt I had seen the citation from the <i>Journal of Bisexuality</i> in the article itself. However, its in your comments. It's rather interesting, because the paragraph that consists of the article here is actually directly lifted from the article. We should insert the citation note accordingly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECaveatLector_0bc2.html" title="User:CaveatLector">CaveatLector</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/v/User_talk%7ECaveatLector_5e43.html" title="User talk:CaveatLector">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CaveatLector_caee.html" title="Special:Contributions/CaveatLector">contribs</a>) 2006-08-05 21:21:46 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li>Actually, the text is directly lifted from the description of the Yahoo!

<li><b>Keep</b> So that means that a person searching for a compilation of stereotypes has to go through all those pages? I believe the main page is still useful.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm concerned about the verifiability of the content and conclusions in this article. For example, it's not difficult to verify that a particular character is Asian, but it is very difficult to verify objectively that they are portraying a stereotype.

If this article is permitted to stay, then <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> should be cited for <u>every</u> claim that a character is portrayed stereotypically. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 23:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Because of the creations of those various articles, this particular article should change direction and talk about ethnic stereotypes in American media in general, without going in depth into the stereotypes for each ethnic group, and linking to those other articles that were split off. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 15:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - We should keep this article to discuss the phenomenon of ethnic stereotyping in American media in general. That intro paragraph doesn't really belong in any of the off-shoot articles, so it needs to stay here. I created the other articles to deal with article length and focus, not to eliminate this main article. At the very very least it'd serve as a useful page to consolidate all the off-shoot links for convenient navigation (also because the off-shoot articles don't come up in search for some reason). Furthermore, as others have pointed out, stereotypes of Jews was deleted (people took it the wrong way out of context), and there is no page for "Mixed" ethnicity stereotypes; this page would be a good umbrella page to give a good overview and cover any and all groups that don't have enough content to warrant their own pages yet. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 03:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's mostly that the artcle is based on loose impressions of stereotypes, and lends itself to bias. There have been THOUSANDS of destinct representations of African Americans. Who can decide which of them are stereotypes? There is no authority on this matter. It's purely subjective. Yes, there has been plenty of scholarly work on the subject, but that doesn't mean it's not subjective. This article will never be definitive enough for wikipedia. A stereotype is an oversimplified representation, this article is filled with contributors that claim to know the difference between a representation thats "overly simple" and one thats "realistic". I'm saying its impossible to distinguish those two objectively. Its a matter of taste. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a> 23:46, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. NPOV by itself is not a reason to delete. There is a lot of material on stereotyping in the media out there. Unfortunately for such a large (and probably neglected as people keep adding in their own opinions of stereotypes) article it'll take quite a bit of time to fix (Drenched's splitting of the articles is just a start). If you believe the articles are NPOV, tag them with NPOV and steps should be taken to start fixing. (For example, the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotypes_of_Asians_417e.html" title="Stereotypes of Asians">Stereotypes of Asians</a> section above is very well-sourced.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Even though this article does contain original research and unverified claims that need to be addressed, it also contains a lot of published legitimate research too. Even if you choose to disregard arguments that this article is "needed", "useful" and "not obsolete," it still stands that it contains published, statistical, factual information regarding media trends in America in addition to academically acknowledged ideas and theories regarding ethnic stereotyping. Therefore, weeding is needed, not indescriminate deletion of all contents. --<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 05:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I respectfully disagree. There are numerous sources, including his biography from various sources and numerous media reports which cite him as a prominent surgeon. His name is well known and reputed among the otolaryngology community certainly in India, and globally. His passing was reported for days and carried on the cover of every Indian Newspaper published in every language, and made the top headline on all TV and Radio news reports in Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and other Indian metropolis'.--Johngalt1234 20:07, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> His murder was covered in the Indian media. He was not a famous doctor but after his murder was well known. Also he is related to the Hirannadani Family which is involved in Real estate.

<li><b>Keep</b> I beleve that the media reported it as a suicide, not a murder, but in any case, the rest of the above two comments make sense. He does seem to have prominence in Mumbai social circles, seems to be well known in academic medical circles prior to this incident, but the prominence comes from being part of a well known construction family, being the son of another prominent surgeon and politically connected individual, and from the circumstances of his death. I agree, the article should be reorganized and cleaned up a bit.--72.225.10.219 03:04, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Shattered World is ranked #1 and #2 when searched for on google. With regards to notability, perhaps I am unclear on what rises to the level of notability to warrant an article.

Shattered World is certainly not "mainstream" in any sense but it does have an active community of 100+ fans and the website does exist and it does show up as #1 and #2 on a google search for 'shattered world'. I thought the point of this whole thing is that even obscure topics can be documented, though I am new to this and admit that my understanding may simply be flawed. In regards to the issue of the usenet posts, I see your point that there is no independent way to verify the direct relationship between them and the website. I will remove that sentence from the article.--CypherLH 22:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> and Shattered World does not appear to meet the criteria described in there. I believe the criteria are a bit too stringent and kill some of the spirit of Wiki in my opinion but I assume they were arrived at only after a consensus was reached so I'm certainly in no position to argue the point.--CypherLH 22:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I am writing an article on Internet generational differences and found the references in this article very useful. I would not have thought to search under 'generation Y' for my purposes, but this article exactly fit the bill. Generation Y does not have the same connotations of Internet use. My general view is that if there is a cultural concept that some people (media, others) refer to as the 'Internet Generation', there should be definitions of it available. The term exists; it is used. If it shouldn't be defined on Wikipedia, where should it be defined? A Google search on 'Internet generation' turns up many business sites--there needs to be a broader perspective on the concept than this, and Wikipedia seems like the place for it. I'm glad I found this entry, and I hope it is not deleted. -- Susan Herring, 1:21, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If it isn't going to be deleted could we at least remove the information about the "MySpace" generation and other "alternative" generations? They seem pretty unnecessary and sterotypical of children from "the Internet generation" (thus not NPOV). If we were to remove all of that I would be fine with keeping it I guess. -<span style="color:rgb(153, 0, 0);"><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexjohnc3_9f63.html" title="User:Alexjohnc3">AlexJohnc3</a></span> <span style="text-transform:capitalize; font-size: 7pt; color: rgb(0, 51, 204);"><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexjohnc3_8468.html" title="User talk:Alexjohnc3">My Talk Page</a></span> 00:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Oh my.

<dd>While the cleaned up version is indeed part of an effort to make the page more usable and less cluttered with external links, it does still appear to be a respository of links while <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> states that is exactly what Wikipedia is not. It should probably be noted that this page is also a fork from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_prank.html" title="Computer prank">Computer prank</a> as the list there was cluttering the page too much (possibly a reason for inclusion). This could be a borderline case, though, as by its very nature a page such as this would end up being a repository of links. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 16:44, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My biggest problem here is the lack of any cited sources explicitly describing these as computer pranks. I think we should have a few of the most prominent and well-defined examples in the article on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_prank.html" title="Computer prank">computer prank</a> and leave it at that. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would probably be best, assuming that the information about the pranks was published by an external source somewhere to confirm its <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notability</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 06:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What external source? Who would go to the trouble of publishing anything on computer pranks, except for an encyclopedia like us? The only decent guideline for notablility is <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/prank/" class="external text" title="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/prank/" rel="nofollow">the ABS collection</a>. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font></a><font color="lime">α</font><a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudacity_d3f0.html" title="User talk:Audacity"><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b> 04:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well that's just it - there would need to be some sort of way to determine which pranks were notable and which werent. If there isn't one, then perhaps many of these are not well known and are simply non notable, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not for something made up in school one day</a>.

<li><b>weak keep</b>: as glad as I am to have this complete list all in one place (and I was wondering whose face that was in the "Say it" prank, so it's Linda Blair), I must admit that it does appear to be a repository of links, and as has been said before, that's not what Wikipedia is for. However, there are many other such lists on Wikipedia of examples pertaining to a specific article, and I'm not sure how different from those this can be considered, even given that it's a bunch of links. This was first put on a separate page from the main article on "computer pranks" because the complete list was cluttering up the page too much, and by its very nature, a page such as this is fundamentally supposed to be a repository of links anyway. Oh, and I'm not sure how much good it would do to have a section describing why these are classified as pranks, given that the original parent article on computer pranks explains that already. Are we supposed to copy even more material from the parent article and paste it into here, just to keep this page from being classified as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? I'm not sure what the point of that would be. Of course, on the other side, what else would citations be for on this page? What exactly are we supposed to cite? I don't know if it should be deleted or if it just needs work, but I can't deny that it is a list of examples of something with it's own page, and that has been done before. For instance, if this page is deleted, then why not go back further delete the entire page on Internet Memes, and all the articles that it is parent too? Maybe I'm just not savvy enough to understand the difference, but I don't see how that page is much further away from <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> than this is. --Sylocat 06:17, 8 August 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylocat_248c.html" title="User:Sylocat">Sylocat</a>

<dd>The issue appears to be that people at any time can simply add a simple prank that was made up someday, so the list inevitably grows larger and larger. Wikipedia shouldn't be used as a repository of links, however, and if anything, perhaps only a few examples of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">notable</a> pranks could be mentioned on the parent article. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 17:06, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>: Interesting to read, and useful as a counterpart to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_prank.html" title="Computer prank">Computer prank</a>. Whereas some readers may want to get a general overview from the main article, others are interested in delving deeper into these pranks, and will find a table-formatted list an excellent way to do so. I plead <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>: this article serves a good purpose, and <i>cannot possibly be created according to policy</i> (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) since to my knowledge <i>there are no secondary sources related to computer pranks</i>. In this case, the policies hinder us from developing an encyclopedia, so from a utilitarian point of view the maximally productive option is to ignore them. Here's a quote from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules&amp;oldid=33578029" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules&amp;oldid=33578029" rel="nofollow">earlier version</a> of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> which I found helpful: "Ignoring all rules is about cutting through red tape to construct an encyclopedia.

<li>Two separate arguments are going on here. First, does the need for an article on this subject trump the lack of secondary sources? If not, <i>both</i> articles must go - neither has any real secondary sources, and the main article suffers from the same verifiability problems as this fork. The second argument, and the one that I think should be addressed by this AfD is whether this article is useful as a fork of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_prank.html" title="Computer prank">Computer prank</a>. I'm arguing that if <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_prank.html" title="Computer prank">Computer prank</a> stays, this should too. <b><a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudacity_0bdd.html" title="User:Audacity"><font color="black">Λυδ</font></a><font color="lime">α</font><a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudacity_d3f0.html" title="User talk:Audacity"><font color="black">cιτγ</font></a></b></li>

Yet there's nothing in this article that indicates that he's actually <i>notable</i> by wikipedia biographical standards. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 22:09, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Farrar's blog is extremely popular in New Zealand, and he is frequently interviewed in the media for his NZ Internet-related activities. There are a LOT of entries that should be removed before this one, and I suspect those calling for his removal are more politically motivated than anything else. Maybe the entry should be expanded to include more of his Internet management activities, but either way, there's absolutely no way it should be removed. --203.109.242.148 07:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Google has 81,600 results for "David Farrar" + kiwiblog, surely enough to justify notability. Farrar is frequently quoted or interviewed in the media and he runs a very successful and popular blog - there are many less notable people with Wikipedia articles about them. <a href="../../../a/m/y/User%7EAmygdala_f70f.html" title="User:Amygdala">Amygdala</a> 11:03, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> or <b>Name Change</b> One of the most notable bloggers in New Zealand, has been nominated for various blogging awards, has one of the largest local readerships in New Zealand. To reiterate comments above, if Farrar isn't notable, neither are many other NZ based bio entries. As per Simon Lyall's suggestion perhaps a change to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Farrar_%28New_Zealand%29_9181.html" title="David Farrar (New Zealand)">David Farrar (New Zealand)</a> might be in order, so some of his other activities might be included --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoizyboy_f3cb.html" title="User:Noizyboy">noizyboy</a> 02:01, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>But it would be good if someone could establish criteria for notability as a blog host - like number of hits maybe, or TTLB ranking as was suggested on NZ Blogosphere talk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_blogosphere#Minimum_Ranking.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Zealand_blogosphere#Minimum_Ranking.3F" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.Chesswas_db9b.html" title="User:A.J.Chesswas">User:A.J.Chesswas</a></li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: I've twice changed my opinion as to whether there should be an article on Ms Tardif. Those who care to visit my talk page will see that I was initially in favour, but then changed my mind. The good work of a variety of people has led me to believe that an article on Ms Tardif is indeed warranted. That said, my vote to delete still stands as I find this particular article continues to include elements of self-promotion. For example, her 2004 nomination for the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award sounds impressive, but a visit to the website tells us that "Any Albertan or Alberta-based organization may nominate a person for a Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award". <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> I very much doubt an impartial observer would have thought such a nomination worthy of mention. Had she made the short-list, as had <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Cardinal_ac67.html" title="Douglas Cardinal">Douglas Cardinal</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Murrell_%28playwright%29_775a.html" title="John Murrell (playwright)">John Murrell</a>, among others, I would think differently. Furthermore, several claims made in the article, as it stands, are unverifiable. That Ms Tardif "graduated with Highest Honors" from a correspondence school is just one example. I must add that I assume good faith, and see these two examples as nothing more than typical problems associated with autobiographical entries as discussed in <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. Again, I recognize that a great effort has been made to bring the article into line with Wikipedia policies, but I can't in good conscience say that it is there (yet). <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:32, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any award or nomination for award is worthy of mentioning. That's why authors mention shortlisted titles and nominations. There are many that are open to nominations from their province. How do you think people GET nominated? Also, shortlisted and nominated is the basically the same thing in the writing field and holds the same status--every professional writer knows that. And in both cases, someone (other than the writer) has to believe that person is worthy of being nominated. I was nominated by a fan of my first novel. She emailed me AFTER she nominated me. This nomination is for excellence in the arts in my province and is highly respected; it is better than being shortlisted for almost any contest, which only judges 1 work. Victoriagirl, you cannot possibly expect every statement to be backed up by a citation. That is impossible, for any writer. And it would mean that a large % of the content here on Wikipedia is unverified. I DID graduate with Highest Honors. Call ICS. That is how it can be verified. They do not release that information in a book or on the internet. Victoriagirl's requests for changes have gone from warranted (which I've addressed) to picky and on to ridiculous. And initially VG was not in favor of my article because it was far different than it is now and she flagged it as advertising.(<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECherylktardif_fdb6.html" title="User:Cherylktardif">Cherylktardif</a> 23:55, 9 August 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Risking further accusations that I am being picky or ridiculous, I offer following. A nomination is not the same as being short-listed, though the two terms are often used interchangeably (and I will admit my own guilt in this matter). To use one example, nominating a book for the Giller requires nothing more than submitting the book along with a cheque to the organization - a process covered in Stephen Henighan's <i>When Words Deny the World</i> (Erin, Ont.: Porcupine's Quill, 2002). Thus, it is the short-list that receives attention, not the rather long list of nominees. So, I must disagree that each and every award nomination is worthy of mention. In the specific case of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Arts Award, the bar is so low as to make the mere nomination not worthy of note. As I stated previously, a nomination may be placed by any Albertan or Alberta-based organization. <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/nomination.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> The criteria the nominee must meet is also quite loose in that he or she must be “a Canadian citizen; a person whose achievement or contribution has benefited the arts in Alberta; A resident of Alberta or, if not now a resident, someone who has had a significant connection to the province over time; be willing to accept the award.” <a href="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/criteria.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albertaartsawards.shawbiz.ca/criteria.html" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> While I won’t speculate as to the number of nominees generated by such a process, I can’t help but note that the awards website doesn’t provide a list.</dd>
<dd>Concerning verifiability, while I don’t expect every statement to be backed up by a citation, I do believe that “Information on Wikipedia must be reliable and verifiable. Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible. Any unsourced material may be challenged and removed.” These are not my words – these are Wikipedia’s policies as laid out in <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>. Assuming good will, I don’t doubt for a moment that Ms Tardif graduated with Highest Honors from the correspondence school. I was using this claim as typical of the problems associated with autobiographical entries. It is an assertion that simply cannot be verified.</dd>
<dd>One final point, it is stated above that I was initially not in favour of an entry dealing with Ms Tardif. Anyone who cares to investigate will see that this isn’t true. My first - and only - edit to the article was the placement of an advert tag; quite obviously I was asking tat the article be cleaned up, rather than deleted. A visitor to my talk page will see that in my first discussion on the issue I was in favour of a Wikipedia article on Ms Tardif. In fact, I am <i>still</i> in favour, but cannot vote for this particular article.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 04:16, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Delete: rather ho-hum - not quite encyclopaedia-worthy. Please note that claiming 'highest honors' (whatever they may be) from a correspondence school is only liable to render you subject to discreet sniggering from readers.</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Note that CKT seems to be making a serious effort in tidying up her bio. Sorry to learn about her brother, but that fact does not increase notability one jot (unless she was somehow involved- I jest). The existence of her books can be verified easily enough, and I'm on the cusp of reconsidering my vote based on the rewrites. However, those quotes from reviewers and the planned future events still bug me. They remind me of one-line quotes you see on back covers to entice would-be readers, so not entirely NPOV yet. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The quote from <i>The Edmonton Examiner</i> irritates in that it does nothing to inform the work - unlike, say, that from Robert Thacker in the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Munro_a00c.html" title="Alice Munro">Alice Munro</a> entry. What's more the sentence it is found in ("Whale Song is "A wise, enchanting story..." said The Edmonton Examiner, and it explores topics such as amnesia and suicide.") is badly coonstructed and confusing. Is it <i>The Edmonton Examiner</i> that says the novel explores topics such as amnesia and suicide, or is this a description provided by the entry writer? That said, I'm not so convinced that it goes against NPOV. I must disagree on the issue of future events. A visit to the Kunati website indicates that the book is indeed plannned for publication. Though this event is roughly half a year away, it is not that different than mentioning the forthcoming September publication of Alice Munro's new book.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 14:52, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

So until they publish her book this is crystal ball. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm ashamed to realize that Kunati have yet to publish their first book - I'd thought that their Spring catalogue dealt with last season. No wonder I'd never heard of them! Until they are on their feet and have proven themselves it would probably be best to delete references to the 2007 edition of <i>Whale Song</i>. At this point, they are untested and their reliability is unknown - stark contrast with Munro's publisher, which celebrates its centennary this year.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 18:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page should be deleted as everything on it is nonsense. <b>The first part reads:</b> "Since Mike owns a bar you can bet the man is drinking heavily every night as his 15 minutes have come and gone. Mike was not well liked in the house and as a part of Chill town couldn't get the HOH to save his eviction. But don't fret little Mike grabbed seconds of air time to say goodbye to Krista. Why we don't know as I am sure Krista is back home with child far away from the Boogie man." <b>The second part says:</b> "Boogie got his nick-name from picking his nose all the time and what happened in the house, he picked and picked and picked that Boogie was once again revived. So if you live in the L.A. area you can always stop by the Belly Tapas Lounge and you may see the man in action. Mike Malin and Lonnie Moore are Co-owners of the bar and are ready for you to visit him. Mike has a long career as a misfit, making his way onto the Warner Brother lot to get pictures of Arnold as Mr. Freeze was his last such act. He ended up getting caught on private property, camera in sock, holding fake ID, and in possession of WB property. In the end he greed on a settlement and is never to near any WB property again. In otherwords he got off easy, and is glad those days are over.
