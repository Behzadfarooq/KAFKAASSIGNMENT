<p><b>del</b>. the article is 100% false. There is no such English word. There is even no such Old Slavic word, contrary to the article. This is a Romanian ignorant mutation (quite possibly, quite recent) of the Old Slavic word: "<a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlach.html" title="Vlach">Vlach</a>" in Old Slavonic is "Voloch". "Volochove" is plural from "voloch". "Volohoveni" is a brainless Romanian coinage similar to "Moldoveni" (<a href="../../../m/o/l/Moldovans.html" title="Moldovans">Moldovans</a>), seen only in Romanian websites. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 00:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It it is interesting to mention that a similar confusion happened with <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrians.html" title="Ingrians">Ingrians</a>, and quite very recently, too. There was land of <b><a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingria.html" title="Ingria">Ingria</a></b>. A person from Ingria was called by Teutons "Ingerman", and their land is "Ingermanland". The latter was borroved into Russian during the times of Russian Empire and Russified into "Ingermanlandia" And finally, some English-speaking smartass coined "Ingermanlandians"&#160;!

It's certainly an obscure topic, but that still does seem a suspiciously low amount. Also, I don't think it really matters if this word is a "mutation" -- many words start out that way, including, I'd hazard, the majority of the English language. What matters is if the word, in this form, was the primary name for the topic described in the article, which I'm not sure of. I'm very much on the fence on this one, but I'd prefer to err on the side of caution here. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep and rename</b> - Since the article deals with a kind of Vlachs (ie: living in a certain area, as per use of the term in Romanian historiography), and the article on Vlachs tends to lists generalities, the best solution is to keep the current Bolohoveni as a main article linked in a section of the Vlachs article, and the name in use be <i>the original used in the chronicle</i> (transliterated using present-day rules), <i>and not the creole term that has come to be used in Romanian</i> (the final "i" is especially intriguing, and does indeed display the provincial interests and superficial knowledge of the article's creator). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Cna you read my lips: it is <b>not</b> hoax. It is confusion. <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> in various latin and greek and slavic manuscribts were named by many names. There was no internet in these times, you know. Everything was by the word of mouth mostly. I may list you "Vlachs (also called Vláhoi, Βλάχοι, Wallachians, Wlachs, Wallachs, Olahs or Ulahs" (fom wikipedia), also волохи/волохове/волоховцы/болохове/влахи/власи, moreover Blazi (Latin), Blokumenn/Blakumen/Blakumenn (norse),... you want more? I am sure Arabic authors had more names. In summary, again, "bolohoveni" is mutation in <b>Romanian</b> language of what was written in slavic chronicles: <b>"volohove"</b>, i.e., <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>, and not some new mysterious ethnos at the roots of Romanians. Does someonne want to write the "blokumenn/Blakumen" articles as well? they collect quite a few google hits as well... I'd say even more than "bolohoveni" (if kill wikipedia mirrors) `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:17, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There already exists the page, <b><a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a></b>. And there is absolutely nothing to move there from the discussed article, because it is false: "bolohoveni" are <b>not</b> mentioned in old slavic chronicles. Moreover, it is highly disputable whether "volohove" (<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volochs.html" title="Volochs">Volochs</a>) were used specifically to refer to population of moldavian/transylvania/etc. lands and not simply <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">vlachs</a> from anywhere.</dd>
<dd>On the second thought, it occurs to me now now that it would make sense to turn this article into a redirect to the article I've just noticed, "<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_term_Vlach_bacd.html" title="History of the term Vlach">History of the term Vlach</a>", which may be expanded with what I wrote in this discussion. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikkanarxi</a> 01:50, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

Let me put it in a yet another way: is is a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone_game.html" title="Telephone game">telephone game</a>: <b>(1)</b> in slavic chronicles there were "volochove" mentioned. Romanian books qouting the chronicles "romanized the word into "bolohoveni", a valid Romanian word. <b>(2)</b>And now someone tries to enter into wikipedia an <b>English</b> word "bolohoveni" , which, <b>(3)</b> if translated directly from slavic chronicles according to English grammar, would be "<a href="../../../v/o/l/Volochs.html" title="Volochs">volochs</a>". How can I give you qoutations to prove that item (2) moronic?

<dd>Regarding the existance of these "Bolohoveni" in chronicles, they definetively appear. For example, I could give <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tale_of_Igor%27s_Campaign_0f18.html" title="The Tale of Igor's Campaign">The Tale of Igor's Campaign</a> where it says: <i>"Thou didst shatter the Galicians on the Vistula, Yarosláv; thou sittest high on thy gold-forged throne, supporting the Hungarian mountains with thy iron-clad regiments, barring the road against the [Magyar] King, closing the gates of the Danube, hurling thongs amid the Vlakhs, judging and ordaining as far as the Danube!"</i> <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/tai/tai40.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/tai/tai40.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This is just one of their mentionings. There are more, but most of them have yet to be translated into English or to be published on the internet. If this population didn`t exist, then how come there is even an article on the Eencyclopedia of Ukraine <a href="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\B\O\Bolokhovians.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\B\O\Bolokhovians.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>??? What reasons would they have to make such an article, if the bolohoveni didn`t exist??? The article says that they were actually slavs, and took their name from the city of <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolekhiv.html" title="Bolekhiv">Bolekhiv</a>. However, a polish document from <a href="../../../l/v/o/Lvov.html" title="Lvov">Lvov</a> from 1472, still adreses that city with the name of "villa valachorum dicta". At the same time, the geographic position of the area where they were mentioned, in the <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivano-Frankivsk_Oblast_aae2.html" title="Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast">Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernivtsi_Oblast_656e.html" title="Chernivtsi Oblast">Chernivtsi Oblast</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinnytsia_Oblast_f70c.html" title="Vinnytsia Oblast">Vinnytsia Oblast</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmelnytskyi_Oblast_c02a.html" title="Khmelnytskyi Oblast">Khmelnytskyi Oblast</a>, coincided more or less with <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Bukovina_2b19.html" title="Northern Bukovina">Northern Bukovina</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herta_region.html" title="Herta region">Herta region</a>, to this day with significant vlach populations (see also <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutsuls.html" title="Hutsuls">Hutsuls</a>). But what if they were afterall slavs: another reason to keep the article. It`s still a stub, and certainly need attention from an expert. But it would be a mistake to delete it, because the very existance of it, albeit a stub, can`t do absolutelly no damage, and more than that, it stimulates further research on this matter... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">Greier</a> 10:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

This supports the reasons why this article should be deleted. Also, the Encyclopedia of Ukraine gives <i>Bolokhovians</i> as entry, which is the current name. As such, the contents of the article <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolohoveni.html" title="Bolohoveni">Bolohoveni</a> are very much in error, as they claim in the defining sentence that <i>Bolohoveni ("Volohove") is the name used in the early Kievan chronicles</i>, which definitely is not true, as you've proven yourself. And even if it were reason enough to keep the article, it should be moved to <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolokhovians.html" title="Bolokhovians">Bolokhovians</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErrabee_3545.html" title="User:Errabee">Errabee</a> 11:07, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why rename it? Only to be re-renamed when another source calls them <i>Bolochovians</i> instead of <i>Bolokhovians</i>??? As for arguing the deletion of the article because the Bolohoveni are identical to Vlachs, then that is not what the point is about. The article <b>already</b> admits the the Bolohoveni are Vlachs: <i>"Bolohoveni ("Volohove") is the name used ... to designate the Vlachs... "</i>. The arguments in keeping this article are 1.the article is used as toC in that time period, situated in very different geographical positions. 2. The term "bolohoveni" is already present in Romanian historic works, separate from the term "vlach" (and as you can see, even in Ukrainian histography) 3. What if the Bolohoveni/Bolokhovians/Bolochovyans/Volohovinians/etc. are not Vlachs afterall, as the EncyclopediaofUkraine article claims? Like I already sayd, the article needs an expert... For point 1, I could also argue that sources give much more info, which distinguish this population (both from the rest of the Vlachs or the rest of the Slavs, depending on their origin). For example, the <i>Ipatievskaia lietopis</i> mentiones a couple of rulers of this populations (e.g. a certain Stefan), as well as their relation with the Mongols (they were subdued and forced by the Mongols to cultiuvate the land, as to assure provisions for the Mongol army). Now if we would to make an article about that ruler, and say that he was a "ruler of the Vlachs", then question arise: Of which vlachs? Had he powers over all of the vlachs? Why of vlachs and not of slavs (as the Enc.ofUkraine claims)? etc... <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">Greier</a> 12:17, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

User:Greier only proved that indeed <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlachs.html" title="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> were mentioned in Latin texts as "valachorum". In order "to disambiguate between the various mentions of the vlachs" you don't have to have a separate articles.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The issues of possible original research and unsourced statements are serious. The article says this appears in several books of Cabbala, but fails to mention even one source. Nonetheless, the material appears to be notable in the context of Cabbala and should be kept.

<li><b>DELETE.</b> Since December 4, 2005 there has been no new information added to the article, only some formatting and re-arranging of text, but not enough to bring it into proper wiki format. In June 2006 it was proposed for deletion and the proponents of keeping it all gave the reason that they believed that more information and further development of the article would make into a worthwhile article. It appears that after four months no one is available to bring us the requested further information, and without that further information there is no justification for keeping the article. Perhaps someone can offer a good article on the topic at a later date, but this doesn't belong in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 06:07, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> – This concept appears to have validity. I have found the following sites which mention the "Seven Worlds":</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Hebrew Wikipedia, at <a href="../../../../he/%D7%A9/%D7%9C/%D7%9E/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94.html" class="extiw" title="he:שלמה">he:שלמה</a> (Solomon), where it claims (unsourced) that these worlds are mentioned in a book he wrote (The "Book of Worlds"), and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kabbalah.co.il/kabbalah/ufo.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.kabbalah.co.il/kabbalah/ufo.asp" rel="nofollow">this Kabbalah Centre site</a> (also Hebrew). The Kabbalah Centre site gives these sources:</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>ספר הזוהר, כרך י"א פרשת ויקרא, סעיף קל"ז-קמ"א, קמ"ד</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Also, there are some few details mentioned in English at the following sites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/zohar/the_book_of_zohar/heavens_and_earth.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/zohar/the_book_of_zohar/heavens_and_earth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/zohar/the_book_of_zohar/heavens_and_earth.htm</a></li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, the Kaballah Centre site makes it seem that these worlds are physical planets, which I assume is not the only interpretation.</dd>
<dd>So the question is: Is this a notable concept that deserves mention? I have found very little actual information aside from the Hebrew Kabbalah Centre site, which is very similar to the information in the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Religion is an impoertant phenomenon. Of course this list is less interesting for an average internet kid than List of sexual slurs, which survived I don't know how many votes for deletion. But this list is useful and has encyclopedic potential. Colleague Dmcevit acted hypocritically. First he moved the article under the name "list of..." and then suggested for deletion. THe article is not a simple alphabetial list; it classifies terms in certain categories. Potentially elements may be commented, i.e., made in a kind of glossary. It is confusing to understand these words in different cultures, and the topic has rights to exist. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 00:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You haven't addressed the reson for deletion. Is it not a list of words, with no potential to become more than that? "Useful" does not "equal" (That is quite an insult to all of our other non-encyclopedia sister-projects, Wiktionary included.) <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 00:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only reason for deletion I see is the opinion "has nio encyclopedic pootential" I addressed it by equalliy strong opinion "does have potential". As for insult, funny. I am not saying to delete them from wiktionary. Wiktionary may benefir for some structuring/classification as well. (Although I must note that unlike wikipedia, wiktionary is doomed to be dubious, because (a) it does not provide sources for word defitinions and (b) it seeems has way less eyes. But this is a separate story.) <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 00:34, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Again, <i>why</i>? The contention is that this is not encyclopedic because it is only a list of words and/or definitions (and not about a class of words), and is thus only appropriate for a dictionary.

<p><b>Comment</b> It is very strange for me to point people from chrictian culture (or even possibly christians) to sources that clearly see the encyclopedic nature of this terminology/glossary. For starters I suggest you to look into the<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05037b.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05037b.htm" rel="nofollow">"Disparity of Worship"</a> article from <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>.</i> I started this article execting it attracts some attention and be expanded. Therefor I myslef did not call it "list of..." But evidently in wikipedia the major interest is sexual slang and barioous bilateral political bickering.</p>
<p>For example, an average person does not really see much difference between terms "heretic/schismatic/infidel/apostate". This article could have been a comparison of attitudes.</p>
<p>It would also be interesting to read why some dictionaries put the words "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarian.html" title="Sectarian">sectarian</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/r/u/True_believer.html" title="True believer">true believer</a>" as synonyms. In summary, this nomination clearly shows misunderstanding and neglect of the topic, but I am unfortunately not an expert in theological linguistics, and I canot say more. If no one else steps in to defend the topic, I will not loose my sleep. Thank you for attention. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 00:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was figuring on moving it back to my user space if the consensus is for delete (which I assume it will be). But some day, we will look back on the couple of days in October 2006 when Elephant (wikipedia article) was on Wikipedia as a golden age. So, not enough keep votes? I say not one keep vote more. If it is marked to be deleted, we are enough to do our cause loss, and if to survive, the fewer keep votes, the greater share of honour. He that shill live this day, and see old age, will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors, and say "Tomorrow is Elephant Day". Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember, with advantages, what feats he did that day. And Elephant day shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for the to-day that votes to keep with me shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition; And gentleman on wikipedia now a-bed, shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Elephant (wikipedia article) day! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would just like to note that, as others have said, the potential problem with this article is <i>not</i> that it violates <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. Mentioning this material in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> article would of course be a self reference problem. But a separate article is not. A wikipedia article <i>about wikipedia</i> is allowed to talk about wikipedia. The question, then, is whether the wikipedia article on elephants is a notable topic for an encyclopedia article. It seems to me that, what with the Colbert reference and its easy verifiability, it is at least as notable as, say, the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Atlantium_31bd.html" title="Empire of Atlantium">Empire of Atlantium</a>, which constantly survives deletion votes, or, say, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victreebel.html" title="Victreebel">Victreebel</a>.

<li>Has this article attained sufficient notability to be the subject of a wikipedia article? That would be exciting, as it might suggest that I have attained sufficient notability for a wikipedia article to be written about me, as the author of said notable article. I think, however, that it would be confusing to have a wikipedia article about another wikipedia article that no longer exists. If Elephant (wikipedia article) (wikipedia article) is to be created, I think it can only be in a context where this article is kept, or I fear its notability would be questionable, and it might itself be subject to deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 22:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is perfectly verified, and I've never heard the use of the term "non-trivial source." The term we use is "reliable source," and surely the wikipedia history of the article <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> qualifies as a reliable source <i>on the wikipedia article about elephants</i>.

<li>The article exists because, back in August, people were trying to get the stuff about Colbert into the article <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a>. I determined that while this material was inappropriate for the article on elephants, it would be perfectly appropriate for an article on the wikipedia article "Elephant," and created such a page in my user space to do that very thing. Then, a few days ago, I moved it into main name space, judging that the time was right for a wikipedia article about a wikipedia article. Sadly, I seem to have been mistaken. Also, the article, while self-referential, does not violate <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, in that it is an article about wikipedia, which is allowed to talk about wikipedia. It is not unverifiable, either, in that the Colbert material is referenced to news sources, and the material about the article itself can be checked against the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">Elephant</a> article history, which is surely a reliable source for the history of the Elephant article, I think. The only potential problem, as far as I can tell, is notability, or the question of whether the Colbert incident (which is apparently considered to be notable) should be described in an article about the wikipedia article on elephants.

<li>It seems to me that such a claim would be untrue, and simply a sneaky way of trying to get Mr. Colbert's evil, wikipedia-hating falsitude into wikipedia through the back door. Only verifiable, well-sourced information about elephant articles on wikipedia should be included in this article, not "hilarious" jokes inspired by known wikipedia-hater Stephen Colbert. A true piece of information, I believe, is that the number of elephants editing wikipedia has tripled in the last 6 months, but I'm not sure that comes under the purview of this article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 10:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think most people are voting this be deleted because of the precedant it sets. All other instances of articles about articles are about the incident, not the article itself. As I humourously attempted to point out above, allowing articles of the format Pagename (Wikipedia article) is essentially opening the door to a system of endless self-reference, as <i>Pagename (Wikipedia article)</i> is itself a Wikipedia article, and hence a suitable subject for another article, which could then be the subject of a 4th article... This idea might make an excellent joke on uncyclopedia, but on Wikipedia it is probably not the best plan. Though if someone wanted to write an "<i>Editors of <b>"Elephant" (Wikipedia article)</b> (Wikipedia article)</i> in the news" (Wikipedia article), I'd love to see it. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_tjstrf_12ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/tjstrf">Now on editor review!</a></small> 10:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many people are voting on dubious bases like verifiability. And I don't think that avoid self reference actually deals with this issue - articles that are explicitly about wikipedia subjects are allowed to mention wikipedia. As I've said several times, I think the only clear issue here is notability. It seems to me that, having been discussed in various mainstream media outlets, the wikipedia article on elephants is <i>arguably</i> notable enough to have its own article. Certainly the information about Colbert has been judged to be notable for discussion in <i>other</i> wikipedia articles. This article, then, provides more context on the elephant article which was Mr. Colbert's target, thus allowing people to more fully understand its history before the Colbert incident, for instance. Now, this is arguably ridiculous (clearly everyone else seems to think so, and if I am honest with myself, I suspect that I think so as well), and if we want to have a policy banning wikipedia articles on wikipedia articles, that might be a prudent idea, and this deletion discussion might provide a good precedent for enacting one, but there is, so far as I am aware, no specific rule of that nature at the moment, just the normal notability requirement. As to Uncyclopedia, it sucks. A few days of this article being on actual wikipedia is far more amusing than just about anything on Uncyclopedia, which is almost universally prevented from being funny by the "too many cooks spoil the broth" problem. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 12:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not questioning whether this article is verifiable or not (it probably is), or if the topic is notable (based on news visibility, it probably is). All I'm contesting is <i>whether we need an article of its own on this topic,</i> and I'm not citing any other criteria in this debate but <i>common sense.</i> My view is that this is mergeable material at best. <b>Not every newsworthy incident is worth a new article.</b> I'm definitely <a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_DelEssay_d916.html" title="User:Wwwwolf/DelEssay">against deleting articles by policy-pounding</a>, but I'm also against keeping articles <i>just because</i> they satisfy some criteria. If the article sparks "Who gives darn in 100 years? Isn't this really insignificant?" reaction, we should really consider the need of the article and think that it's probably mergeworthy. Let's compare: Seigenthaler case essentially sparked the big media debate about Wikipedia's reliability and editor responsibility, and contributed to the development of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy. That was a major news event that had <i>implications</i>. Elephant case was a minor segment where some random... TV guy or something... tells folks to vandalise Wikipedia and Wikipedia <i>takes normal precautions</i>. In the end of the day, nothing new has happened, except that now we have an injoke. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 14:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was a member of Stripey Zebras but didn't create the article (so its certainly not vanity on my part). It was some anonymous contributor, I have no idea who, presumably an old fan, so somebody obviously thought us notable or interesting enough for inclusion in wikipedia. I have however edited the article, mainly cleaning it up gramatically and adding a photo from my own collection. I've also had people get in contact with me who remmeber the Stripey Zebras who I hadn't heard from in over 20 years becaiuse of this article who remember us fondly. My personal take is that although we never sold loads of records, we were an important part of the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette_culture.html" title="Cassette culture">cassette culture</a> scene and had quite a cult following at the time. We were part of a pre-internet era (early 80s) that would otherwise be undocumented apart from dusty fanzines in peoples attics, and otherwise forgotten. Isn't (part of, at least) the point of wikipedia to keep such history alive and accessable? Besides one can read about 'notable' bands like U2 or Queen anywhere... <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 21:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thats the sort of thing I like to see on wikipedia (Deep Freeze Mice)! As for Sounds and Smash Hits, we did feature in a minor role in both of these publications (in the latter a 'chart of crap band names' I think...), but we were far more featured in various fanzines of the time. I agree that it would be nice to cite sources, but unfortunately I cleared out my rather vast collection of fanzines when 'decluttering' a few years back... Most of them ended up at <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dial_House_6b13.html" title="Dial House">Dial House</a> so maybe next time I'm there I could have a dig through and find a few references??? <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 00:00, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>further counter-comment: the "above user" has spent considerable time reading and becoming familiar with Wikipedia before joining and contributing, is a published author and an attorney (and there will be no Wikipedia articles proposed with me as the subject). Being a new member is not criteria for excluding someone's participation or suggesting that the person's votes and comments should be disregarded.</i></dd>
<dd><i>As you may note from the history, the Kabbala article entitled "The Seven Worlds" was proposed for deletion in June, 2006 and it was kept for the very reasons that I have suggested here, though from aught that appears there was no hope at all for the article. I think there's good hope for the Les Sectes article. In years past I have worked on cases with a skilled exit counselor. In my exposure to the field I learned the marks of a reputable resource, and this one looks legit. There's a very good possibility that this book is indeed a leading resource in the field, depending on how it is actually being used.</i></dd>
<dd><i>And aside from the two articles "<a href="../../../d/e/p/Deprogramming.html" title="Deprogramming">deprogramming</a>" and "<a href="../../../e/x/i/Exit_counseling.html" title="Exit counseling">exit counseling</a>" which are duplicative and desperately need to be merged, and the article entitled "<a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a>" which is a cesspool of competing definitions and agendas, there isn't enough cogent information about this rich and active field available on Wikipedia. It's a topic which has affected our society and culture, what with the Jim Jones tragedy, Heaven's Gate, and the controversy that surrounds groups like the Unification Church and the Church of Scientology. It's good to have more information like this, and I think the article deserves a chance to be developed. We can always revisit the question of the article again if the requested documentation doesn't turn up soon.</i><a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 19:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> since the book has not been translated (as far as I know) it's clear that there is little chance of finding reliable sources <i>in English</i> that discuss the notability of the book.

It's also worth noting that the author has some notability in France as the guy to interview when you want an anti-sect sound-clip.

I am however puzzled by the purpose of this article: this book does not have an English translation and is very much about the situation of sects in France so its overall value in the English Wikipedia is pretty low.

<p>Appears to be the subject of a vast <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> campaign. It was written in large part by the author, User:Jeff Head, and created by a user whose only contributions deal with it (User:Killa Dilla) -- just take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dragon%27s_Fury&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dragon%27s_Fury&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">the history</a>. It read like an advertisement before it was NPOV'd. I don't think it's notable enough to be here, though it's hard to tell because of all the self-promotion and astroturfing on Google. I don't know what the policy is when it comes to something so vigorously promoted by the author, but something tells me this is not notable, especially considering that neither the author nor his publisher have articles, nor do the so-called bestselling authors that wrote the foreword. If someone can prove that this is notable, fine, but it seems like marketing. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 04:27, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not notable. Although this is a published book (2001), and appears to have a sequel, there is no evidence of notability.

<li>What's wrong with just <b>merging</b> this to the author? I see no reason to get rid of it (or a redirect from the title), but where is the advantage of having an article on a children's book apart from the stubby bio of its author? As it seems to be going to be kept, I suggest that the nominator <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> makes the merge after the AFD has closed (you could have done so without the AFD).

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> - Why should a company have google hits to pass WP CORP?? Transversal has been featured in newspaper and magazine articles about the Cambridge Phenomenon. 'No claim to fame?' How about 'a dot com company that is still going strong?' In my opinion, Wikipedia should be inclusive, full of factually correct content.

(One more was dropped because it has gone under active planning for completion.) --<a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Wednesday_62bb.html" title="User:Mr Wednesday">Mr Wednesday</a> 23:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> since I am working at a computer that rejects cookies and therefore cannot sign in. The terms "ghost ramp" and "stub ramps" are synonymous and have been use long before there was an Internet (the definition can be found <a href="http://www.southeastroads.com/glossary.html" class="external text" title="http://www.southeastroads.com/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example, in addition to several travel books; the State of Washington uses the synonym <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/transit/ptr_newsletter/2006_october.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/transit/ptr_newsletter/2006_october.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>). As far as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is concerned, those ghost ramps/stub ramps mentioned in the page that have external links most definitely do not constitute original research in the Wikipedia definition. This this the most liberal interpretation of WP:NOR I've seen in my time with Wikipedia - if this interpretation is upheld, then 90 percent of the road articles (and 100% of those with current exit lists) violate the policy as well. Furthermore, if we are now defining neologisms as terms being used by only a certain segment of the population, we'd better be very well consistent in that interpretation... and delete about 99% of the technology articles - or anything dealing with a very specialized topic - as well. From this person's viewpoint, this is right on the edge of a bad faith nomination, particularly in light of over 150 external links and references in the article.147.70.242.40 19:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Count of references means nothing if none of them are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> or support what the article is actually claiming. List of YTMND Fads had hundreds of linked YTMNDs but it was still original research to identify things as fads. Unless you have sources documenting that these ramps are in fact abandoned, it's original research to link and satellite photo and claim it as proof that the ramp is abandoned. As for the glossary, all it says is that "some definitions of commonly used words and phrases on AARoads," it doesn't say it's an accepted term beyond that website or with any particular history, or even that it's the best term. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 19:45, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: (Before I even get to my reply, I should point out that its synonym "stub ramp" has been used/cited in legal opinions, including <a href="http://www.landcourt.qld.gov.au/Decisions/PDF/A98-13.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.landcourt.qld.gov.au/Decisions/PDF/A98-13.pdf" rel="nofollow">this one from Australia</a>). Now, are you saying that photographs showing their existence are OR without the documentation of their history? If that is the case, all this article would need would be a more emphatic presentation of the references to their histories. This can be done without having to resort to an extreme measure of an AfD... as quite a few of them are already there, just not presented in a fashion that seems to be preferred by some editors.147.70.242.40 19:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I agree that the article should be moved, but not deleted. The article needs to be pruned and renamed. There is some interesting stuff here, like the I-70/I-95 interchange that got cancelled and the ramps that were partially built. Much of this is not relevant. Now as for claiming there's a stub ramp, IMHO aerial photography to show out-of-use ramps and whatnot is fine, pictures are neat to, but to claim where a half-built ramp would go would need a source. For example "There are ghost ramps on I-65 in Huntsville for both north- and southbound" or something like that, Google map it. To continue "these ramps were to be I-365, but was cancelled" needs to be sourced. There are no ramps there, it's an example I made up. <b>--<a href="../../../m/p/d/User%7EMPD01605_77c2.html" title="User:MPD01605">MPD01605</a> (<a href="../../../m/p/d/User_talk%7EMPD01605_0e7e.html" title="User talk:MPD01605">T</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPD01605_89a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPD01605">C</a>)</b> 22:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The photos are a pretty clear indication of ramps that lead to nowhere. There's obviously a reason that all of these ghost ramps exist and the fact that they do exist (with associated proof in the form of satellite pictures) is not debatable. For someone to say the ramp was built and the project was cancelled is not original research, though it may be unsourced. Unsourced statements are not necessarily original research. Just request sources ({{fact}}) on anything that you think is not properly sourced. Sparingly use the {{OR}} tag for speculation only. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are not original research because an aerial image <i>clearly</i> indicates that the ramp is no longer used and is abandoned. It doesn't take a genius to see that if you see an abandoned ramp, or a graded path, that it was to be for a purpose. That itself is not original research.</dd>

The terms "ghost ramp" and "stub ramp" predate the Internet by decades - and, unless there has been a change of definition in the last few years, neither involved the abandonment issue.

<li>Again, this brings us back to the scope of what this article should be. Is it about ramps that for which the connecting road will be built + ones that may be built + ones that will almost certainly not be built? What Wikipedian is in the position to interpret what "may" or "almost certainly not" mean? If Wikipedians try to determine the difference themselves, without reliable sources, that would constitute original research. Determining the difference with reliable sources is good article writing. Regarding the ramps in Houston, I think a 20+ year period before construction continues on ramps is notable (like Spur 5). <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 00:54, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sure sources exist for many of these ramps. State DOT offices would have information on proposed freeways and local newspaper articles would, in many cases, explain why the project was cancelled. Let's work on sourcing some of the major ones, possibly keeping the unsourced ones on the talk page until sources can be found. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 01:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I added the sources earlier for the Houston area ramps and also a few non-satellite sources for the Saint Louis area ramps. I would think the Embarcadero, Mt. Hood Freeway, and I-70 extension into Baltimore would have reliable sources explaining the reason for the cancellations as these were contentious routes. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 22:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Earlier I stated that the article should be kept, and I still feel that way, but that does not mean that I think the article is fine the way it is now. The article states that a ghost ramp "is an incomplete onramp or offramp which does not connect a freeway or expressway with another road" and on a cursory look it appears there are numerous entries do not meet the definition. Some examples from the region I live in are the 2 entries for Louisville. The first entry is a highway section that is partially complete in anticipation of being completed, has no ramps that do not connect to another road, and has no 'ghost ramps'. The second Louisville entry is on a completed intersection, so it should not included either. A Cincinnati entry has its reference as a page on 'Never-Built Cincinnati Expressways'... if it was never built, there is no 'ghost ramp' there either. In contrast, I've driven through Memphis several times and have seen these ramps to nowhere and, being the curious person that I am, looked it up online and found that the partially constructed highway was stopped mid-construction due to a lawsuit that was won by neighborhood groups. I would be the first to say that the article does have inaccuracies and is in need of cleanup, but that does not mean it needs to be deleted altogether. Ghost ramp is a valid term and this could be a good article if it only included true ghost ramps (which I would guess would be about ⅓ of what is actually listed) and had more references than just links to aerial photographs, but instead of throwing the good out with the bad I find it preferable to make the mediocre better. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris24_12cc.html" title="User:Chris24">Chris24</a> 01:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Besides, I always thought that the purpose of the aerial photo links was not to cite sources, but to illustrate the ramp being described.

<dd>Aye, but there's the rub. Most of these are merely supported by a WP enthusiast's GoogleMap aerial photo of what <i>seems</i> to fit the criterion (with possible added comment "trust me, over here everyone knows it's abandoned"). A little short on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">reliable sourcing</a>, to the say the least, and a little long on <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. To meet the criterion you suggest, we would need definitive information showing the stub in question is truly <i>abandoned</i>, not just a work-in-progress with some possible delay. And I have yet to see a single such reference that clearly shows abandonment for any of the items in the article.

<dd>The issue is the <i>future</i>, not the <i>present</i>. The picture only shows us the present - not the future.

<dd>No, we have not decided on the scope, so it is the <i>present</i> phenomenon that we (many editors) are trying to describe (with, in some cases, information about past construction plans). I brought this up before, asking what the scope should be. Some editors have suggested that it only be about ramps that were built with the intention of connecting to another freeway which were later cancelled. However, there was no consensus. The scope of the article could be to-be-constructed freeways or "abandoned" ramps. Many of the naysayers seem to be using this one case (that the article should only include "abandoned" ramps) so that they can make a half-credible argument of original research. All of the satellite photos show non-completed ramps and that is not debatable. If we eventually decide to limit the scope to only abandoned ramps, and editors add unsourced information claiming that a ramp is abandoned based only on a satellite photo, <i>then</i> you can make the claim of original research. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 17:38, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're stretching here. "Abandoned" is not necessarily perjorative: in the case of the ghost ramps (or whatever you want to call these things) along I-5 in Portland, they were built for projected highways that not only were never built, it took local grassroots mobilization to stop them. Making government officials listen to the people is sometimes a good thing. And saying that these projects could be restarted any time is much like saying that the USA is not definitively independent of the UK: after all, the UK could always raise &amp; send an army to end their "rebellion". -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Or "unused for X years".</li>

<li>Where the satellite picture shows an obvious ramp that is unusable (e.g. because it dead-ends in mid-air) leading to nothing, we could say "currently unused stub ramp". (Again, this depends on the scope of the article that we decide on).</li>

If you have a problem with the wording, change that. But let's not scrap the article. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:34, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, in some cases, building the intial ramps is probably cheaper if there is a high probability that the connecting road will be built. If you're doing a construction project on one freeway, it's likely a lot less expensive to built the connections (the ramps) from road #1 to road #2 while doing construction work on road #1 so that road #1 doesn't have to be partially shut down again when road #2 is eventually built. If the DOT of that state and leaders were under the impression that building road #2 was a virtual certainty, then building the ramps first makes more economic sense. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I thought this was one of those things that are obvious, at least to me it was. Are you saying that to you the <i>abandoned</i> stubs are not ugly, nor a waste of money? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:37, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So it's obvious, but POV? Maybe your POV? Has anyone else used the words ugly or waste of money other than you? I'm suggesting that we describe a ramp as ... (see my bulleted list above)... as it is. If you make the leap that it's ugly and a waste of money, that's your prerogative, but not the result of wording in the article, nor any editor's words on this talk page. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 18:45, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So are you saying that to you the clearly abandoned ones are not ugly nor a waste of money? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:51, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First, no I'm not saying that and did not say that.</li>
<li>Second, regarding ugliness: who cares if I think it's ugly?!? If a reliable source shows significant community opinion that it is ugly, then we can mention it. Otherwise, it's totally irrelevant and should be worded in a way that prevents making a judgment regarding the aesthetic qualities of these structures in a general or on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>Third, regarding "waste of money": It depends on the case. Construction projects in general have contingency plans based on the difficulty of construction or significance of (environmental, social, economic, etc.) impacts based on different alternatives and also on the future political atmosphere (e.g. Who will be in office X years from now when the project will require important permits? Are there any politically powerful people (or "squeaky wheels") in the path of the proposed project, regardless of the significance of impacts to those people)? They make the best decisions possible based on the information they have at they time regarding whether or not a project will proceed (in this case, road #2 (see above)). If there's an 80% chance that road #2 will be built and the costs of building the ramps (from road #1 to road #2) now are less than the costs of building the ramps later once the area has grown in population and traffic (keep in mind that you have to shut down road #1 once again), then I would say it probably makes sense to take the gamble and build the ramps now. Nowadays, schedule analysis in construction projects is much more sophisticated than it was 40 years ago, so there's not as much "gambling" inherent in this scenario. So, to sum up, it depends on each circumstance. If we have reliable sources that analyze the costs in depth or that show that significant community opinion (in the area of the ramps) believes the ramps were a waste of money, let's add it. Otherwise, my opinion and your opinion are irrelevant, as this is an encyclopedia and not a blog. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 19:08, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(outdent)My point is not that we need to say in the article that "ghost ramps are ugly" or waste of money, although I am sure we could get a reputable source to say that if we wanted to. My point is simply that calling a structure or a construction project 'abandoned' is negative, at least to most people, and hence can only be done on WP article space if there is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">proper sourcing</a> for saying so. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:22, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, as I said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ghost_ramp&amp;diff=83246087&amp;oldid=83243754" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ghost_ramp&amp;diff=83246087&amp;oldid=83243754" rel="nofollow">thirteen edits ago</a>, the wording depends on the circumstances. These statements don't need sources because some people might think they are negative. These statements need sources for the simple fact that they are statements in an encyclopedia. Wouldn't you agree? <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 19:49, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The negative aspect of the statements does have some implications in WP. Yes, everything needs good sources, but we tend to be more strict and require <i>better</i> sources when a negative statement, that can be perceived as offensive to someone or some group is made. Also, in the case of non-negative statements some have made the argument of "let's leave the statement in the article, and hope that some future editor will add a source". I personally don't buy that, but in the case of a negative statement it's even more unacceptable. So yes, they all require sources, but negatives require better sources, and they stay out unless well sourced. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:55, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is not a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">Biography of a living person</a>. The ramp will not get offended and it is extremely unlikely that the builder or designer of these ramps or highway projects will get offended either. It's just an abandoned ramp, not an abandoned area, or an abandoned person or group of people, or an abandoned city. So I would be surprised if residents of the areas in question get offended either. In some cases (e.g. Portland or San Francisco), people see these "abandoned ramps" as a source of pride...a neighborhood "saved", sticking it to the man, etc., etc. "Abandoned" ≠ a negative statement. So far, you are the only one making this argument. I have already proposed removing some of the unsourced and least credible statments and putting unsourced statments on <a href="../../../g/h/o/Talk%7EGhost_ramp_4a38.html" title="Talk:Ghost ramp">Talk:Ghost ramp</a>. Those statements can remain there and gradually be readded as we get sources. I would hope that this should satisfy your desires to get "negative" statements out of the article space, not that I think such a thing is necessary because the statement are "negative". Rather, they should be stored on the talk page because they are simply unsourced. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 20:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree the offensiveness and liability to WP are not BLP-like and fairly minor, so I agree that temporary storage of unsourced items in Talk space is fine. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good. We may have to put 90% of the items on the talk page (or perhaps a sub-talk page) to start out, but if that is necessary to save the article, I wouldn't have any major objections. There are a few sources as refs, a few other non-satellite embedded references, and a few articles that have wikilinks to other sourced articles, so the entire article would not likely disappear. Perhaps I will propose this as an alternative to deletion. <a href="../../../u/f/w/User%7EUfwuct_8c8a.html" title="User:Ufwuct">Ufwuct</a> 20:17, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Can you cite a source which establishes that the award in question is a well-known one? I'd never heard of it, but perhaps I don't move in the right circles.

<p><b>I'm 100% convinced these articles are hoaxes.</b> I came across the top article yesterday whilst RC patrolling after an IP blanked it. I immediately saw it needed work and proceeded to remove POV, format it correctly, correct red links, stub, categorize and general fix ups. Ten minutes later when done it occured to me that there were no sources, or external links at all so I started searching, and searching, and searching. In short here's what I found (or didnt)</p>
<ol>
<li>A google search for "Sean Ó Ceasaigh" produces <b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sean+%C3%93+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sean+%C3%93+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">zero results</a></b></li>
<li>As does "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sean+O+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Sean+O+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">Sean O Ceasaigh</a>", or even just (no quotes) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Sean+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Sean+Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">Sean Ceasaigh</a>. Even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Ceasaigh&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">Ceasaigh</a> produces less than ten!</li>
<li>Through the Gap of Dunloe is an irish expression it seems for travelling through a certain provence, however a search for the, ahem; "song [and album of the same name] made famous by Irish musician Sean Ó Ceasaigh" produces <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Through+the+Gap+of+Dunloe%22+album&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Through+the+Gap+of+Dunloe%22+album&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">less than ten results</a> - none of them an actual album or song (I searched both)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22K%C3%A1ny%C3%A9+Of+The+West&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22K%C3%A1ny%C3%A9+Of+The+West&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">Zero relevant results</a> when searching for "Kányé Of The West" - the Irish musician, and a search for his hit song "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bean+as+Dearg&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bean+as+Dearg&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">"Bean as Dearg"</a> produces one result, Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Oh, a search for Sean's and Kayne's joint hit song "Ba Mhaith Liom Bris Amach" produces <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ba+Mhaith+Liom+Bris+Amach+&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ba+Mhaith+Liom+Bris+Amach+&amp;le=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">one result, Wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, as one would expect, I could not find a single trace of their record label Celtic Legacy Records either.</li>

All subsidiary pages on the website are 404s. He's now a DJ in Oxford. I see nothing notable in this.

<p>Looking at a text book for guidance, I find in Bjorken and Drell (1965), chapter 11 (page 2 of the second volume):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Our approach is best illustrated by the electromagnetic field, The potentials A<img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/e/f/eefd5d1da2c8a92c0ce03a0b7993d1ef.png" alt="\mu\" />(x) satisfy the Maxwell wave equations and may be considered as describing a dynamical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. By this we mean that A<img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/e/f/eefd5d1da2c8a92c0ce03a0b7993d1ef.png" alt="\mu\" />(x) at each point of space may be considered an independent generalized coordinate. To make the transition from classical to quantum theory, we must, according to the general principles proclaimed in Chap. 1, elevate coordinates and their conjugate momenta to operators in the Hilbert space of possible physical states and impose quantum conditions upon them. This is the canonical quantization procedure. It is a straightforward extension to field functions, which obey differential wave equations derivable from a lagrangian, of the quantization procedure of non-reLativistic mechanics. When it is done, there emerges a particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field-in the sense of Bohr's principle of complementarity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If photons emerge in such a natural way from the quantization of the Maxwell field, one is led to ask whether other particles whose existence is observed in nature are also related to force fields by the same quantization procedure. On this basis Yukawa predicted the existence of the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/8/5/d85a11dccd888d77343545939bd3db9d.png" alt="\pi\" /> meson from knowledge of the existence of nuclear forces. Conversely, it is natural from this point of view to associate with each kind of observed particle in nature a field <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/2/c/a2c671b2cdd4667d9f5663c5e73018eb.png" alt="\phi\" />(x) which satisfies an assumed wave equation. A particle interpretation of the field <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/2/c/a2c671b2cdd4667d9f5663c5e73018eb.png" alt="\phi\" />(x) is then obtained when we carry through the canonical quantization program.</dd>
</dl>
<p>They find nothing revolutionary about this. It is just proceeding to fields, according to the standard methods of quantum mechanics. The first volume is called <i>Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</i> and the second <i>Relativistic Quantum Fields</i>, but there is no suggestion that these are distinct theories. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<p>Messiah makes the point that if electromagnetic fields were not quantized, they would allow measurements to violate the uncertainty principle, so the underlying physics of field theory was already present in early QM.

<p>Hold on, PLEASE READ THIS!</p>
<p>Nobody is coming here to LEARN Quantum Theory. People just want to learn <u>about</u> it! The history of it, or brief history of it. We just want to read and get a general idea of what it is. When I come to the page, and see all of this nonsense about it being deleted, I can't really learn ANYTHING about physics because I don't know if any of it is real or not, when MOST of it is! The person that made this page, never said that what they wrote down and reported here was the end all be all about this subject. Just RELAX! You are putting seeds of doubt in everyones head. That is wrong. Or maybe you are just upset and jealous that he/she got here first, and YOU wanted to do the physics page. Thats just great, "nerd fights".

<li><b>Comment</b> The term "third quantization" exists -- including its use at the physics e-archives e.g. arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0606021 arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9611057. Making it a pure disambiguation page is a good idea (in fact I raised this suggestion on the talk page shortly after its creation). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<ul>
<li>Have you <i>read</i> those papers? I find both of them quite incomprehensible in detail; neither is peer-reviewed (although that hardly means anything anymore); and they use "third quantization" in two different, equally nonsensical (in my book), ways. Ioannis Raptis has transcended mere manifolds and spends forty pages of verbiage (and precious few equations) quantizing something he calls "Abstract Differential Geometry - Vacuum Einstein Gravity". A. Zhuk, on the other hand, seems to think that solutions of the Wheeler-deWitt equation need quantizing, and writes: "Similar to the quantum scalar field theory in the curved space-time we can expect that the vacuum state in a third quantized theory is unstable and creation of particles (in our case, universes) from the initial vacuum state takes place." If you have some sort of insight into this and can demonstrate that they are one and the same, methinks it would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. If not, you probably don't want to be using the phrase "third quantization". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K. Edwards">Michael K.

<li>No I haven't read those papers&#160;:-), I just picked the first two that came up. There are others on the arxiv, have a look. My point was to demonstrate the term is in use. BTW google yields 11,400 web hits for the search string ("3rd quantized" OR "third quantized" OR "3rd quantization" OR "third quantization"). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am concerned that some of the definitions and used in this article are either entirely non-standard or else do not reflect universally-used physics terminology. It's not clear to me, really, that "quantum theory" has a precise and universally-understood meaning. Likewise I believe that QFT can (and is) described as "quantum mechanical," which would seem to negate the stated division between the two. This article needs to cite sources and clarify whether terms are universally used, if it is to exist at all in its present form. I'm not advocating a particular course of action yet, but this clearly requires discussion. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 06:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The word "quantum mechanics" cannot be used to mean both the set of all theories and one of them. While useage seems inconsistent in various text books, wikipedia must make an editorial choice between the 2 possible meanings. <a href="../../../p/c/a/User%7EPcarbonn_cbe1.html" title="User:Pcarbonn">Pcarbonn</a> 07:05, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Historically speaking (in my unqualified opinion), "quantum mechanics" is the class of rather ad-hoc semi-classical Hamiltonian-based techniques which preceded QED, and QFT as the term is now understood (action-principle-based gauge theories) was only one of many possible successors to quantum mechanics. Many alternatives were explored between about 1927 (when Pauli and Dirac started fitting spin and special relativity together and identifying the proper form of the electron current) and 1960 (when experimental confirmation of the Ahanarov-Bohm effect validated the gauge potential as a physical field). Bohr/Heisenberg/Schroedinger style quantum mechanics is still taught to undergraduates, not least because it provides some insight into atomic physics without the forbidding mathematical machinery of QFT; and a sort of hybrid QM-QFT semi-classical technique still has a lot of value in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_chemistry.html" title="Computational chemistry">computational chemistry</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_physics.html" title="Plasma physics">plasma physics</a>. Trying to cram all that into QFT, or vice versa, wouldn't work very well. Hence the need for a disambiguation page at <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_theory.html" title="Quantum theory">quantum theory</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K.

Not that encyclopedias always get it right, either; but "quantum theory" does not appear to have any value other than as an umbrella term when describing developments later than about 1927 (when the observation of electron diffraction validated de Broglie / Schroedinger / Heisenberg "quantum mechanics" over the original Planck / Bohr / Einstein ansatz in which only radiation was quantized). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_K._Edwards_c2ba.html" title="User:Michael K.

<li>"and evaluate it against the standard of major physics topics in Wikipedia?" - That isn't an issue for AfD.

<p><b>Keep</b> on the basis of this nomination.

The concept of "Metropolitian City" is not a new one. Please read the book which I have referred to and you will see that the authors themselves call it "The Greater Metropolitian Region". The work has been reported by Carla M. Sinopoli and Kathleen D. Morrison. Instead of adding hasty tags, the reader should have been sensible enough to contact me and ask his questions and concerns. Perhaps request a rename of the page. Obviously this user must be novice at wikipedia.

Dineshkannambadi suggested several good names that should be discussed on the talk page (I'm partial to "Ancient City of Vijayanagara").

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, I'm very troubled by the nominator's opinion on the English translation of the Indian designation of "Metropolitan City."

Biblical criticism- which is an important and recognised academic field in both religious studies and theolgoy- is criticism of a literary or historical nature: it is about recovering the original text, understanding the history of the text and its transmission, understanding the background to the text. This is a quite different set of concerns to what is mentioned in the <b>Criticism of the Bible</b> article- as, indeed, the introduction to the 'Cricitism of the Bible article notes: <b>This article is about criticisms which are made against the Bible as a source of information or ethical guidance. This is not the same thing as Biblical Criticism, which is the academic treatment of the bible as a historical document.</b> Enough said, I think! Slackbuie 21:02, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There is relevant discussion at <a href="../../../n/e/c/Necromancer_Games_8d44.html" title="Necromancer Games">Necromancer Games</a>, a publishing company of similar in size and scope to Spellbinder Games.

Spellbinder Games/Apotheosis Publishing has four books published (one recently) and two books coming out with 6 months.

<li>Sorry, but no, your line below this belies that attitude. It is obvious that there is a bit of personal feeling in this debate, and that's a problem that should set off warning bells in your head. Consider this a chance to be a good person.. Plus WP:CORP is not pretty clear. It actually starts off saying it is only a rough guideline. But that doesn't even address my real concern, which was confusion with the UK Spellbinder. That's reason enough on its own to have some information. (In fact, I'd say that the disambig page at <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spellbinder.html" title="Spellbinder">Spellbinder</a> probably needs this information, but I'll leave that to others.<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:04, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

And <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is clear: while it's not prescriptive it does indicate that corporations who fail to meet the criteria are likely to be deletable. Since this particular corporation is well below any of the criteria then <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is in fact very relevant. As for what you perceive as my negative attitude towards this company, again, it is nothing personnal but yes, I do tend to get ticked when an article is being supported by essentially one user and his sockpuppets (well, plus you!) and when the arguments for keeping it involve what seem to be desparate lies.

<li>First, you're not exactly making a good case with me by simply citing policy pages. Sorry, but I find it hard to discuss things with people who just throw those out. Anyway, I've never seen a disambig page that's useless due to size, and frankly, I can't even imagine one. Maybe if it were poorly sorted, but that's a slightly different problem. In any case, two entries isn't that much. More if we move it to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spellbinder.html" title="Spellbinder">Spellbinder</a> (currently at 9). And no matter how annoyed you get, the important thing is to be civil. Annoyance tends to lead to the situation becoming aggravated, not resolved. It certainly distresses me, especially given And no, the entire contents of the article are not unverifiable. Dreadmire at least is listed on Amazon.com and various other sellers. So I'm satisfied with that. Anything else is merely questionable. And they aren't any less notable than many of the minor companies listed in the RPG publisher's category(which is where they should be placed IMHO, so I'm going to do that). Whether or not most of those articles should go through an AfD is something worth considering though. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per Spellbinder at the NG discussion board we get this quote" I am going by memory so don't quote me on this. Keep in mind these were children's fantasy books along the same lines as Harry Potter. I believe there was The Persnackety Dragon, The Dimadon Lantern, and My Magical Maguffin. There was also a coloring book called Fantasmagoria. Sadly all the remaining copies of these long out of print books were lost in the storm."

Also, your comment "is that the best evidence they have" indicates you think this is some sort of game or contest. The 20-year old books existed, and no it may not be proveable online, but not everything is online.

<li><b>Comment</b> FYI for those that don't know, the "EN World" website was originally created as a message board to support a community project to design a campaign world for 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The "ENnies" started in 2002, hardly enough time to become "significant". They are currently the equivalent of a bowling trophy, albeit in the gaming community. I am sure they are very important to some people, just like a bowling or dance trophy is to some people. No offense to the people at the EN World website, who I am sure are good people that work very hard, but the ENnies are indeed a trivial award. A Pulitzer is a non-trivial award.

What we have here is presented as a scientific theory, which it clearly is not. No scientific theory can possibly claim as immutable fact that pi=3.20. Because it is so patently absurd it has not been discussed in any reputable peer-reviewed journals, which makes it pretty close to impossible to balance the absurdity without venturing into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. There is no doubt that the idea has a certain degree of notability, but the theory itself is simply unsupported by any credible peer-reviewed evidence, so is fundamentally unverifiable. What we <i>can</i> verify is that <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a> expounds this twaddle, and we can and should document it at Gene Ray, but not here.</p>
<p>Obviously redirection is an editorial action which requires no Super Powers<sup>TM</sup>, but I don't want to just do that, I want to stimulate a proper debate on the issue and hopefully achieve a consensus view that this <i>subject</i> is one we cannot cover separately, which would ensure that we don't have to have the same debate again in a month form now. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 13:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The article gives the impression that there's a collection of unifying ideas that connect things together, but if there is, it doesn't seem to be on the first page of the website; it seems that the authors of the WP article must have done a bit more synthesis than is really permitted, unless there's another source somewhere.

<li><b>Strong Delete/redirect to Gene Ray (possible very cut down merge)</b> When I was at MIT, some people invited [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ray#Developments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ray#Developments" rel="nofollow">Gene Ray to give a lecture on his "Time Cube" idea</a>]. I hadn't really heard of it before but some people I knew were going and said it would be funny, so I went along out of curiousity. The whole event was basically Gene talking about his ideas and a crowded auditorium of MIT students (and a few profs) laughing at him and asking him smartass obviously mocking questions for 50 mins. Gene just didn't seem to be aware at all that people were laughing at him and treating him as a freakshow event (I mean, he was invited by MIT students who fully intended in advance that he would be an object of derision). This was not a high point in MIT culture. The whole thing event made me uncomfortable. Schizophrenia is a very broad, vague, contested and perhaps not so useful term but Gene clearly had some problems in that general area. (and his "unique" website style is not so unique. There are other sites on the web where people with apparently similar problems post totally incoherent rants/conspiracy theories/crank ideas in a similar strange website format style... it seems to be something of a symptom.). My problem with this article is that I can't see any purpose to laying out Gene Ray's Time Cube ideas in such detail except to mock someone who may well need professional mental health help. Gene Ray / Time Cube may be widely known (okay, so keep the Gene Ray article), but what's the seemly, non-smirking purpose for this kind of detailed exploration? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:55, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Jitse Niesen", Time Cube has been debated on two separate occasions at two separate universities: MIT in 2002, and Georgia Tech in 2005. In 2003, Dr Ray was interviewed on TechTV's "Unscrewed" television programme, hosted by Martin Sargent. He has been interviewed on numerous Internet radio programs, including FreeTalkLive, RantRadio, RadioKOL, EYada (now defunct), and he was interviewed about one day ago, I take it, on a New York "WHRW-FM" radio channel, on a show hosted by one Charles Berman. TimeCube.com has been mentioned on a vast quantity of websites, as a Google-search will reveal. An Academic paper was written on the subject of Time Cube by a Taiwanese university student, Bei Dawei. In short, there has been a huge quantity of publicity. So yeah, that's the publicity.

If you and others argue that Wikipedia is not to be compared to a traditional encyclopedia (i.e. Britannica), then you know what? Wikipedia should stop promoting itself as an encyclopedia and simply refer to itself as a "knowledge base" or "information repository" or something along those lines. Every time Jimbo gets out there and gives a lecture on Wikipedia, he promotes his vision which <i>clearly defines Wikipedia as a potential competitor to traditional print encyclopedias</i>. This promotional campaign, spread by word of mouth and the media, has been so successful that most people come to this site <i>expecting a <b>free alternative</b> to Britannica, Encarta, and Columbia.</i> For heavens sake, Jimbo talks about a print version of Wikipedia that can be given to every single child in Africa and other poor regions. Again, this is the man who started this thing in the first place. Most people here seem to agree with Jimbo, otherwise they wouldn't be contributing. And yet why is it that most people refuse to take a stand when it comes to defending this vision, so that Wikipedia does not degenerate into a useless repository of junk and pop culture? Yes, Time Cube is junk. This article is junk. "Shock site" is junk, and so are many, many, many other articles here that <b>do nothing</b> to add to human knowledge, but like television, have only the effect of numbing the brain and lowering peoples' IQ. It would be better and more informative for people to watch a full 24 hours of Fox News than to spend only a single hour to wade through these crap articles. Again, if anyone cares about the competency and legitimacy of this project, especially it's credibility factor in the light of so many attacks in recent times, then this will require more stringent guidelines and factors for inclusion. It will have to happen at some point, otherwise Wikipedia will no longer be able to gain enough financial support to survive. Remember, Wikipedia <i>relies</i> on donations, and if Wikipedia is no longer fulfilling the aims outlined in it's mission statement, people will cease to support it with their hard-earned cash. metaspheres 15:57, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess I get what you mean; I have a little bit of hard time <i>generalising</i> it. In fact, I have a little bit of hard time generalising my counterargument. Here's my counterargument in its purest, unedited form: "One man's junk is another's treasure!" and "where exactly do you draw line between junk and factoids that are interesting in some contexts?" ... My problem when generalising your argument is this: Yes, trimming stuff no one is ever interested about is important. <i>I just don't see how it applies to "shock site" or "Time Cube", as those are probably within realm of topics that are, marginally, worth discussing.</i> My problem generalising my counterargument is this: I'm not utterly comfortable defending these two articles vigorously, and admit they're on the very boundary between plausible and not plausible. All I'm saying is this: <a href="../../../u/a/_/WP%7EUA_5bfb.html" title="WP:UA">WP:UA</a> is an example of Wikipedia's strengths. Wikipedia's strength is that we can cover a little bit more eccentric topics. "Eccentric" can not only mean "a bit unusual choice for a topic", but it will also mean "information about computer topics that isn't 3-4 years out of date". (If the "real" encyclopaedias ignore the "worthless" net culture topics, <i>exactly how the heck do they cover it at all?</i>) Sometimes the topic is a bit fuzzy one. It's entirely different matter whether or not that stuff is junk or not. In closing: I concur that Time Cube or shock sites could be discussed elsewhere, in some other article, as a section or something; I disagree that they'd be <i>entirely</i> worthless topics to cover. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:04, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or fundamentally restructure with stronger documentation. There are two cases which would justify an article on this topic under the guidelines. First, the "theory" could meet verifiability (and other requirements) in and of itself. There does not seem to be a strong sense that this is the case; the theory is known because of the author. The argument for deletion or merger in that regard is the same that finally prevailed in the CTMU debacle. Alternatively, an article could meet WP standards by being about the <i>website</i> itself, under the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> requirements. This article does not appear to meet those obligations: it is a long article focused on the content of the site (including a substantial list of claims that amounts to little more than contextless quotes). The given references are directed towards the site's content and its creator, not towards the site in and of itself. If there has been appropriate independant coverage of the site, cleanup and document accordingly. If not, follow CTMU precendent and delete (or merge, if determined desirable). <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 04:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that's exactly the point. The theory is unverifiable, but any attempt to remove the theory and discuss only the website is apparently reverted by the time cubers. The website's notability is sufficiewntly borderline that I would merge and redirect to Gene Ray, but delete and redirect is an option as is keep in a <i>wholly different form</i>, with credible references to support the popularity of the website <i>as a website</i> (absent right now). At the moment it's "keep the non-notable website, it's a notable theory" and "keep the unverifiable theory, it's a notable website", but I have yet to see the evidence of this being the primary focus of mutpile non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extremely strong KEEP!!</b> Time Cube is proven to be the absolute truth of the universe beyond the faintest iota of doubt. We now know that humanity is in a dire state due to Cubeless ignorance and nihilistic brainwashing. Dr Gene Ray tells us that 1-corner Academia and singularity-religion are brainwashing the populace with evil-fraught lies: yet, Wikipedians (some of them at least) insist on suppressing Time Cube.<br />
<br />
Now if we examine the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_Delete_5231.html" title="Talk:Time Cube/Delete">Talk:Time Cube/Delete</a> talk-discussion page, we will notice that the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> article has previously withstood the VfD process not once, not even twice, but THREE ENTIRE TIMES. And based on the "Keep" votes on this page that have been made by strong, noble, rational-minded sane sensible people, it appears that Time Cube will again prevail victoriously for the FOURTH time. (Four is the supreme number of the universe.)<br />
<br />
Let us all acknowledge the Cubic truth. Dr Gene Ray is the greatest thinker and wisest human. There are four simultaneous days in one rotation of Earth (<a href="http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/rotation416.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/rotation416.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>) and Time is Cubic, not Linear. Without Time Cube, humanity could be destroyed by a nuclear armageddon, or by volatile nihilistic cannibalism. Do we really want humanity to self-destruct, taking much of nature with it?

What references for this article are being considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>? And, frankly, what <i>is</i> this article about, from a category perspective? If we cannot agree whether we are talking about a pseudoscience theory, a website, a misguided attempt at humor, or simply a meme, then the article probably does not meet the verifiability standards. If this is, as was mentioned, "the canonical example of a crank theory" then surely something verifiable addresses it as such.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, This has come up before and been defeated. The underlying phenomenon, rapid growth in disk storage per dollar, is real, important and distinct from Moore's law, which deals with ICs and CPUs. However tentatively, SciAm coined the term, not us. That we picked it up and added credence does not violate NEO, indeed if we tried to make up a different name on our own, <i>that</i> would be NEO. If the industry settles on a different term, a simple move is all that is required. ASR is an editing issue.

<p>Rules about not pushing points of views apply to the content of articles. Decisions *about* articles, like deleting them for non-notability, are not subject to the NPOV rule. Otherwise, we could never delete any articles, because all deletions imply a point of view that the subject of the article isn't notable.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. The Scientific American article didn't give anything a name. Just because the title reads "Kryder's Law" doesn't mean the article is actually proposing Kryder's Law. It's as if I wrote an article about Wikipedia titled "The National Enquirer of Web Pages" and we later had an article which stated that Wikipedia was also known as "The National Enquirer of Web Pages". The article's title is a form of rhetoric which is phrased as if it's naming something; but it isn't really suggesting a name at all.</li>

If people really want to keep the stuff about Wikipedia inventing the term and criticism of Wikipedia, it should be moved to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> (though I imagine the locally-active editors will delete it pretty quickly for being a trivial/unimportant example).</dd>

If Omegatron insists on deletion of this article, we still have a disagreement. I guess we simply have to let the process run its course and let the moderator decide if deletion is the appropriate course, as opposed to a move or merge, and if there is a consensus for deletion.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 20:41, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Isotope23 and now support <b>Merge and redirect</b>. Let me make one more comment on why deletion is not the way to go. This article has been criticized externally. One of the strengths of Wikipedia in response to criticism is the transparency of its editing process. If someone wants to verify that the term "Kryder's Law" first appeared in Wikipedia only after the Scientific American article, they currently can. If they want to know when criticism of the term first showed up in the article they can look that up too. If they want to follow the debate on the talk page and see who took what postions when, they can. However once the article is deleted all that edit history will no longer be accessible to the public. It will look like we have something to hide.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 11:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> While it may well be true that the term was invented by Wikipedia, and that invention did in fact violate Wikipedia's rules, the fact remains the term does now exist and is used. You can't unring the bell. The topic now warrants inclusion in Wikipedia, even if it is Wikipedia's doing that made it so. This sort of thing happens. The <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a> accidentally invented the word <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllabus.html" title="Syllabus">syllabus</a>, but syllabus is now a sufficiently common word to warrant inclusion in any dictionary. --<a href="../../../l/l/e/User%7ELlewdor_f4c9.html" title="User:Llewdor">Llewdor</a> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I don't object to an eventual merge (which seems to me the most likely outcome of this discussion) I still would like to see hard evidence that the term was coined by Wikipedia. However, I'd strongly object to an actual deletion of the edit history, especially if content is merged into Moore's Law, per GFDL concerns. I may also point out that the term has been indexed by both <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_of_Science_3edd.html" title="Web of Science">Web of Science</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> (giving as only hit the SciAmer article, but still) so I'd seem contrary to logic to nuke the article completely. It would seem that, if this is indeed a neologism we created, that it is beyond our reach to stop its spread (Google "Kryder's law" -wikipedia).

<p>A highly pov and unencylopedic article concerning the Cyprus conflict.

<p>This article is just a blatant POV push by an editor whose bias and nationalism are clearly evident from his past edits. The displaced Greek Cypriots are dealt with in multiple other articles (as noted in the comment from A Garnet) so this information (POV as it is) is redundant. A quick read through of the paragraph '1963 Background' clearly shows the original editors deviation from accepted history. His implication that Turkish Cypriots were living in enclaves in order to gain partition of Cyprus and not, as was the case, becuase they had reason to fear for their lives is just one example of POV. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 14:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article depicts “the ongoing strife of internally displaced Cypriots-refugees and their demand to return to their homes since 1974”and as such there is no other article in wikipedia that covers that topic about the current or fairly recent situation. Demonstrations, rallies, Solomou and Isaak case and Women demonstrations. Almost 32 years after 1974 and refugees are still away from their properties, there are still missing persons whose fate is unknown. There have been protests against this status quo by civilians and not politicians. This fairly recent situation is not hosted in other articles.</li>

The article factual accuracy has been disputed by a tag and I have since requested repeatedly for users to substantiate. I have replied with citations to the majority of the initial issues raised.

<p>As far as the following argument made by user Adam777, I am surprised because this user never raised an argument or stressed a concern in the talk page of the article in question although I have repeatedly requested users to contribute under the POV list that I created as a heading in the talk page: Please read the passage user Adam777 refers to in his own words below: <i>“His implication that Turkish Cypriots were living in enclaves in order to gain partition of Cyprus and not, as was the case, becuase they had reason to fear for their lives is just one example of POV”.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I have NOT in any way stated my personal opinion. The section referred to by Adam777 begins with <i>“The Turkish Community of the Republic of Cyprus holds…”</i> and <i>“The Republic of Cyprus holds …”</i> thus including the two major POV.</dd>
<dd>Evident in the talk page, I have openly asked and explained that we will collectively discuss a list of concerns that would be drafted collectively so that we can collectively reach an agreement. The only user that has done so; but attacked myself in the process (see talk page) was Garnet. I did not encounter but avoided his accusation and verbal harassment. Instead I asked other users to contribute as well. User Garnet instead of providing some time for others to contribute to the list of concerns he took the step of afd just after he assaulted myself stating that <i>“I have no intetion to sort this”</i> although I repeatedly asked for contributions to the list. The user that wants the article deleted has provided no evidence for his arguments has not introduced references instead went for afd.</dd>
<dd>Yes the article needs improvement and there are a lot of information that can be included but please read the article carefully with its references before making your decision. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAristovoul0s_1a5a.html" title="User:Aristovoul0s">Aristovoul0s</a> 21:34, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> <b>Merge</b> NPOV-able material into "Civilian casualties..." article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is historical information that should belong in a separate article. In order to be neutral, there must not be changes to the Greek Cypriot argument. Instead, let there be additions to it about Turkish Cypriots becoming refugees in 1974. Also merging the article with the civilian casualties and displacements article will eliminate the word "refugee" and decrease the emphasis on the refugee plight, which is not the point that this article is trying to convey.

<dd>This article needs a LOT of TLC.

I'm personally hesitant to do any major work on the article at this point until I know how this AFD comes out.

<p><b>Comment</b> by nominator. This article was previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mythical_Chronology_of_Greece_74a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mythical Chronology of Greece">nominated for deletion</a>, and the consensus at that time was keep; but most contributors thought that extensive revision was necessary to fix the article's problems. In my view, revision won't fix what's wrong here.</p>
<p>the article is an original synthesis of ancient chronographic sources like <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome.html" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parian_Marble_0b07.html" title="Parian Marble">Parian Marble</a>. The article often adopts one source's date in preference to another, but gives no citations, and in fact, never indicates that these sources often disagree about the date of a particular event.</p>
<p>Worse, the article gives the impression that this is an authoritative timeline of Greek mythology. Someone could read this article and think that modern scholars believe that Zeus was born in 1703 BC; just recently someone referred to this article to determine <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odysseus.html" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>' "true" age when he reaches Ithaca. However, most experts would say that these events never actually happened, and that trying to determine their true date is silly. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Rather than a summary of chronographic information, how about an article Greek chronography which discusses the methods, assumptions, etc. of the various writers? The article would then link to Jerome, Eusebius, et al.; these articles could contain the chronologies set forth by the individual writers. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How is "says what's in the cocktail" not a recipe? I believe that's the definition of recipe.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You're basing this argument on a false premise. <i>At the moment</i>, all the article has is a list of the ingredients. However, we do not delete articles because they are stubs. I'm not suggesting that every obscure cocktail should have an article, but this one is very well-known (even I've heard of it, and I know nothing about cocktails). As to the definition of a recipe, I would say a recipe includes, as well as ingredients, a list of exact measures of such ingredients and a detailed method for making it.

<p>A Spanish-language magazine which makes a lot of claims I can't seem to verify, the main one being interviews with many directors who I don't think know Spanish.

<li><b>Delete</b> I perused the magazine's website, which is bilingual so all other editors feel free, but just the free parts and could find no verification of the claims made nor any indication what the circulation of this magazine is. Also, even were I able to verify all the name-drops, featuring interviews by a slew of stars doesn't make a magazine notable; many of these interviews could be sourced by freelancers who sell Argentine or Spanish-language rights to the magazine or conducted at press conferences when the star visits Argentina, so the <i>interview</i> is not exclusive by any means. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 02:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>All those interviews were indeed exclusive conducted by staff members - not press conferences or syndicated items are allowed by editorial choice. The importance of the subject is due to be the longest running magazine on the subject of horror and sci fi movies in Spanish. The magazine it´s not unlike Video Watchdog, or Maayan, other magazines film publications with Wikipedia entries. Also, other magazines with entries, like UK´s Empire does´nt have their circulation on it´s own entry and some of it´s exclusive content is not on the internet.

<p>Non-notable. His major claim to fame is a self-published website of subscription numbers for MMOGs of questionable accuracy at best. Beyond that, he's been the profile of a fluff piece in Business Week six years ago that amounted to a "Hey, companies use the Web to defend their reputations" job. Article has been heavily edited by the subject, and its other main contributor, <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">User:Elonka</a>, also works in the games industry. Note also the fluff piece Woodcock wrote about her company and game on his website: <a href="http://www.mmogchart.com/E32006.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mmogchart.com/E32006.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> (Scroll down to the section on Simutronics).

<ul>
<li>Far from it - Mendeleev created something that is astronomically more substantive than MMOGChart, and has been reprinted in so many media and forms that it is difficult to comprehend. Woodstock created a website that has been referenced in a handful of newspaper articles. Comparing the two is not sensible on any level. MMOGChart may meet the absolute minimum requirements for inclusion. Woodstock does not. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 04:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep/Redirect</b>. If obscure football/soccer players can have their own biographical entries, I don't see why there's a particular problem with industry-specific biographies. Bruce is marginally well-known within the games industry, although I'm only giving weak support because of his very limited scope of contribution, as well as concerns about <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. As such, perhaps a redirect to an article on MMOGChart (his main contribution of note) would be more appropriate. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 09:55, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. his accomplishments might not be on par with Mendeleev, but thats not the criteria is it?...I know nothing about the game industry, but he's on the board of playnet, he's been asked by his industry to speak on a number of occations, and he's had articles written about him in regards to his industry...even if they were fluff pieces, joe six-pack doesn't get fluff pieces about him all that often... --<a href="../../../a/b/a/User%7EAbaddon314159_ea91.html" title="User:Abaddon314159">Michael Lynn</a></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I have been a journalist covering video games for eight years now. I've written for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, etc. I feel like I have a grasp on someone's relative weight in the game industry. Sir Bruce, Brice Woodcock changed the way we look at online multiplayer games. Video games don't enjoy much serious research or background or study. But Woodcock has been consistent in providing a steady stream of fantastically useful data that is the standard benchmark for talking about the growth of this social phenomenon. The page may have Vanity problems, so it should be cleaned up. But not deleted. This guy made a major contribution to the study of MMOGs. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinHall_7315.html" title="User:JustinHall">JustinHall</a> 07:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b>. The hospital endorsement is by just one hospital in Indiana, not on the level of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Jude_Children%27s_Research_Hospital_410f.html" title="St. Jude Children's Research Hospital">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a> or the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_Miracle_Network_df45.html" title="Children's Miracle Network">Children's Miracle Network</a>, and the quotations were the kind that are solicited by the publisher for the book cover and publicity. But I'm not so much concerned with the suitability of the topic as I am with the tone and direction of the article. In the article's history it has gone from being (1) a simple and blatant book recommendation written in the first person, to (2) a book review, to (3) a medium for a heartfelt message directly from the author of the book, and (4) back to a book review. In none of these incarnations do I see the makings of an encyclopedic article, and I see no one prepared to make this into an encyclopedic article.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 22:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> On the first page of Google hits, I found two references in college newspapers. There is much debate over whether these are realible sources- I wouldn't necessarily consider <a href="http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/8673" class="external text" title="http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/8673" rel="nofollow">UCalgary's paper</a> a RS, but I certainly would consider <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2003/02/18/sports/7335.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2003/02/18/sports/7335.shtml" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Princetonian_36aa.html" title="The Daily Princetonian">The Daily Princetonian</a> to meet the criteria. Also from the first page (FYI, I use 30 G-hits per page) is a reference in a review in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Portland_Mercury_ff6f.html" title="The Portland Mercury">The Portland Mercury</a>; that publication is certainly well-known, though I doubt it's "reliable." The second hit of the second page is also a college paper, <a href="http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2005-11-17/sports/15627" class="external text" title="http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2005-11-17/sports/15627" rel="nofollow">this one</a> being from Swarthmore.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am also a Bill Simmons fan, but your post kind of proves why this should be merged into the Bill Simmons article.

<li><b>Keep</b> (Disclosure: I'm a die-hard Bill Simmons fan, though when another article about one of his memes was at AfD, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Reggie_Cleveland_All-Stars" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Reggie_Cleveland_All-Stars" rel="nofollow">argued for deletion</a>.) 35,300 Google hits for "Ewing Theory", with 327 uniques out of the first 1,000. Cited in <i>at least</i> one reliable source, as I listed above. I think the phrase has become popular enough among college-aged adults and message board posters to gain status as a notable meme. Though he's been writing for ESPN for five years (and was a well-known blogger before his time at ESPN), the Ewing Theory (with a picture of Ewing) still occupies a place on his ESPN <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index" class="external text" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index" rel="nofollow">home page</a>. I know this isn't the most convincing "keep" argument ever, and perhaps I'm slightly blinded by Simmons love, but I truly believe that this article deserves its place on WP. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:02, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Bill Simmons">Bill Simmons</a>, both for being a non-notable theory and being to closely tied to Simmons. I'm tempted to make this a <b>Delete</b>, if for no other reason than the "Ewing Theory" is a bad one. For every example of a team which succeeds after a star leaves, there are many more of a team which succeeds because of a star staying or arriving. Even the linked article demonstrates that: Simmons gives nine potential "Ewing Theory" candidates. As of 27 October 2006, only one of those examples fit the theory (the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>' success after the departure of <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Bledsoe_4d3b.html" title="Drew Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a>), and another arguably did (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Sampras_c14e.html" title="Pete Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>'s departure from men's tennis).

Why don't you leave these references alone while the decision is being made? I also noticed that you took the time to edit the features section of this article extensively. Have you reviewed the features section of other companies (like <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skype.html" title="Skype">skype</a>) and tried to implement the same editing criteria?

Those programs are clearly in the same class as damaka and I will endorse their deletion without reservation if they are nominated in their current states. One question, though: how did you learn to apply dispute tags so quickly, and what motivated you to apply them exclusively to competitors of the software described in the article discussed on this deletion debate? Don't be surprised if some others question your good faith! <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 00:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not that difficult to put in a dispute tag. Also, the earlier entry on this debate page listed the competitors in the same space. I thought i'd follow the link and see if the complaint that perhaps this request was launched by competition holds true. and I found that some of the vote for deletion come from editors of competing companies. I think this will be a problem that wikipedia will increasingly face in the future. competitors trying to block or sabotage competitors pages. I could care less if this article is deleted. But I do care that the wiki team finds a way to maintain fair rule of play. (Martha.weinberg 01:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)).

</ul>
<p>I am not familiar with Google Scholars but I am assuming it's generally for English authors. If you actually typed in "Lu Zhiwei" in Google Books as mentioned above, you will find many results. Let me just point some obvious out on Mr. Lu according to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">notablity criteria</a>:</p>
<p>1. <i>The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources.</i></p>

<dd>I don't have the sources in my hand, but Mr. Lu was selected, and remained as the president of <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yenching_University_1eed.html" title="Yenching University">Yenching University</a> for <b>25 years</b> because of his expertise in psychology, linguistics and music.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. <i>The person is regarded as an important figure by those in the same field.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>K, for this one I'll just quote it from the English article. "He was one of the original developers of Pinyin. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences." I don't understand how you came up with "fails notablity criteria".</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. <i>The person has published a significant and well-known academic work.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The Chinese Wiki listed five books. Those are just the <b>major ones</b>. He's made various other publishings according to the Chinese Wiki.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. <i>The person's collective body of work is significant and well-known.</i></p>

The page I gave you here included most of Mr. Lu's published book, "古音说略", "汉语构词法", "诗韵谱".</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. <i>The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll requote the sentence in English Wiki. "He was one of the original developers of Pinyin". Also, according to Chinese Wiki, Mr. Lu was also one of the first to introduce Western psychology concept into China. He's made many other Chinese linguistic contributions according to a bio in the <a href="http://www.cass.net.cn/25zhounian/w1-zjsky/4/q04_7.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cass.net.cn/25zhounian/w1-zjsky/4/q04_7.htm" rel="nofollow">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>.</dd>

<p>After listing all of those reasons, I came to a conclusion that the fact that you can't read Chinese is no excuse.

<dd>I'm rather inclined to agree, she's published a novel with her ex-husband but how successful has it actually been? There is very little mention in Google and for all the notable novelists there are hundreds of thousands of aspiring ones many who actually subsidise the production of their work - definition of a novelist amounts to a writer of novels, anyone could write a novel but how many people actually read it is another matter - it might be better to mention her in the article about her rather more notable husband. Most of the references in Google to her other than those about her husband appear to be pages acting as a sort of mirror to the Wikipedia page on her.--<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_of_the_Isles_87b7.html" title="User:Lord of the Isles">Lord of the Isles</a> 19:29, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><font color="#0000FF"><i><b>Comment</b> In that case the article should probably be written to emphasize the history rather than the current status of the website. Any external references pointing to the site's significance years back would be very helpful. Think of it as a historical record rather than an advertisement. Speaking of advertisement, let me ask you a direct question. Are you involved with the current or past operation of the website? If so, then you really should not be editing the article. Wikipedia discourages people from editing articles which they have a direct interest in such as biographies of people you are related to or websites which you operate. If a site is worth writing about then someone else should be doing the writing. Even if the current version of the article is deleted there is nothing to keep it from being created in the future in a way which does not present as spam or a personal interest.

The "ENnies" started in 2002, hardly enough time to become "significant". They are currently the equivalent of a bowling trophy, albeit in the gaming community. I am sure they are very important to some people, just like a bowling trophy.

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia was founded June 20th, 2003, are you saying that because The Ennies started in 2002, merely one year before the site you are fighting to keep something off of, it is somehow insignificant? "A little perspective, please," indeed. The Comic Book industry has the Eisners, Motion Pictures; The Oscars, Journalism; The Pulitzer, the Gaming Industry has The Ennies. It is not the equivilent of a Bowling Trophy, it is the equivilent of winning a championship in the Professional Bowling Association. There is absolutely no more prestigious and recognized award in d20 gaming. (Which itself was established in 1999-2000, at the earliest.)

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Wizards of the Coast, <i><b>THE</b></i> premier producer of d20 products and authors of the Open Gaming Licence itself, lauded, mentioned and used content from Necromancer Games in their official sourcebook "Monster Manual II." On page 220 of that book Necromancer Games is refered to as "One of the very first d20 publishers..." Two original monsters, created by Necromancer Games, "Scorpionfolk" and "Razor boar," are officially indoctrinated into Dungeons and Dragons canon, officially statted up and approved. A sidebar describes the Open Game Licence and Necromancers role within that, praising their work and mentioning some of their early releases, it goes on to say,"As an example of the good work to be found in that collection, we've 'adopted' these two creatures and decided to include them in an official Dungeons &amp; Dragons Product." Wizards of the Coast is very much independant of Necromancer Games, and the sidebar is clearly not a press release or simple statement of the company's existence and how to reach them. This, along with Dragon Magazine's coverage of The Ennie's, both the nominations and the winners over several years, including Necromancer Games on multiple occasions, should easily satisfy Part 1 of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. The Company's founder has also been featured and interviewed in Polyhedron Magazine, which is now part of Dungeon Magazine. In 3.5 Dungeons and Dragons, in the d20 Gaming industry, there are no higher sources than Wizards of The Coast and Dragon Magazine. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to delete a Necromancer Games article. It may also be noted that the article is, as yet, incomplete; The products listed are not the only original products released by the company. Indeed, many are missing, and at least one that is listed is a licenced product, albeit a significant one. (Judge's Guild) This, of course, is an editting problem, not one of legitimacy. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobNoxious_a858.html" title="User:RobNoxious">RobNoxious</a> 01:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Necromancer Games article was created in response to the creation of the Spellbinder Games article, a company that was at odds with Necromancer Games over the hiring of their author, Randy Richards. Necromancer Games has trivial accomplishments in the area of "Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition d20 game books" (can you get more esoteric than that???). Every D&amp;D book publisher that has been publishing such books for 5 years has such accomplishments, and Necromancer Games may have more than most trivial publishers. But to suggest that the company has some "lasting historical value" is absurd in the extreme. It doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, unless its an encyclopedia on the history of games, wherein I am sure they would get a footnote. I suggest you read this: <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 15:17, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Goodman Games has also featured their work in at least one, if not more, of their "Dungeon Crawl Classics" module Series. Further, they have, as I mentioned before, been featured in the trade magazines Dragon and Polyhedron/Dungeon, not simply in press releases or "trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories," but in articles covering, among other things, their nominations for various ENnie Awards, their use of the Open Game Licence, their Licencing and release of Judges Guild Products, their work with Gary Gygax etc., etc.</dd>

<dd>This Encyclopedia has now expanded to include publishers of the 3.0 and 3.5 Edition Dungeons and Dragons Game.

Work is being done to expand the Article itself by fans, as there is much that is missing that may be of interest to people who play this game.

<li>I'm going to go ahead and address this, for transparancy's sake, though normally I would just ignore it: It is true that I registered this account immediately prior to entering this discussion, however, it is the only Wikipedia account I have ever registered. While I use Wikipedia on a regular basis, I have, up 'til now, not found the need to edit anything. You might say I've been "Lurking" to this point. My screenname is the one I use across multiple boards and websites, my identity can, really, be easily established. The Web is a big place, but shyness is not something from which I suffer. I made it a point before posting in this debate to read and examine the protocol surrounding such things, and I have attempted to stay within those boundries. I also made it a point to read the "Opposing Side's" arguments and concerns, and the Rules he wished to invoke. They seemed, in this case, pretty clear, so I felt confident in advancing my argument. (I used quotes above as, though we disagree on this matter, it seems counter-productive to make an "enemy" of anyone. I would like to keep animosity to a minimum. I didn't start posting here to find foes.) I will make it a point to post links to other places I have surfaced on the web in my profile. A quick I.P. check should provide reasonable verification that I am not an Alternate I.D. (If my long-windedness is not enough.) Now, here are some other things that I am <b>Not</b>: I am NOT employed by Necromancer Games, I am NOT a professional writer of any sort and I am NOT using a new I.D. to escape accountability for my words and edits. I think I may have seen The Meat Puppets play live in the 80's, but I'm not in the band, if you can dig that. I AM a fan of Necromancer Games and their products. I AM an active member of their message boards. I HAVE exchanged e-mails with the company's owners, though not regarding anything to do with Wikipedia, in fact I don't think they are even paying attention to this debate. I AM a newbie <i>here,</i> though not to the internet at large. However, as the Wiki ettiquette page itself says, "We were all new once." If my easily verifiable arguments are discounted due to my "Newness," it bodes ill for Wikipedia at large. (Though grains of salt are, of course, expected. Go ahead and verify my claims about the publisher. And myself. Please.) With that, I look forward to a long association with this excellent website.

<blockquote>
<p>I dont really know how to edit that stuff to post my thoughts on Wiki, or if I am even allowed to put in my comments.<br />
<br />
But if I am, could someone post this on my behalf.<br />
<br />
"My name is Clark Peterson. I am the president and founder of Necromancer Games, Inc. I was thrilled to see a Wiki entry for Necro (as we are called). I was equally disheartened to see a disgruntled prior writer who we terminated our relationship with for clear copyright violations and a stated intent to continue such copyright violations nominate the entry for deletion. I, frankly, don't know whether or not Necromancer Games is relevant enough for an entry. That is not up to me. That is up to you. I respect your decision. But there is a good deal of misinformation posted here that I would like to clear up so that the powers that be can make an informed decision.<br />
<br />
First, to understand the relevance of Necro, you have to understand roleplaying and open gaming. Dungeons and Dragons is the leading roleplaying game of all time. It was created years ago by Gary Gygax, among others, and published by TSR hobbies. For years, TSR was incredibly strict with their license of D&amp;D. In fact, TSR very notoriously sued several other companies who tried to make compatible products to D&amp;D. For years, no third parties were allowed to make D&amp;D compatible products. That all changed in 1997 when TSR sold the D&amp;D brand to Wizards of the Coast ("WotC") who then developed the Third Edition of the D&amp;D rules released in 2000. The brand manager of D&amp;D, Ryan Dancey, made a very bold move. He convinced the powers at WotC to open the D&amp;D rules up and to create "open gaming," creating an open game content license similar to the various software open licenses. This was a HUGE move in the RPG industry. Because of the name of the open license (which also included a logo called the "d20 logo") companies created using the open game license came to be known as "d20 companies."<br />
<br />
This is where Necro and I come in. I was one of the early contributors to the creation of the d20 license. I worked with others in the formative stages of the license to get it in a form publishers would work with. In fact, the draft version of the license--which many publishers worked under for some time until the license was finalized--was written by Ryan Dancey directly to me. As a result, I created Necromancer Games. Necromancer Games was one of the first companies to be created to take advantage of this revolutionary idea known as open gaming. In fact, Necromancer Games has the distinction of being the very first company to release any open gaming content under the license--namely, an adventure called the Wizard's Amulet. So, if open gaming is relevant, it cant get any more relevant than Necromancer Games. But there is more.<br />
<br />
Necromancer Games, despite comments above, has released approximately 40 products, many being hardback books. We are not just an imprint. The vast majority of our products are written in house. Even materials that we "update" for the new open gaming rules involve extensive rules creation and additional writing by us. Our products have featured writing by none other than Gary Gygax, the creator of D&amp;D and Rob Kuntz, one of the original founders of D&amp;D. Necromancer Games has the distinction of being probably the biggest supporter of open gaming, releasing the Tome of Horrors, a book that not only is all open content, but includes instruction on how to use the content--a first in open gaming.<br />
<br />
We have also recieved unmatched industry praise. I personally, and Necromancer Games specificially, was selected as an "expert" by Dungeon Magazine--one of two official monthly magazines specifically for Dungeons and Dragons--to judge the best adventures of all time for D&amp;D. Our opinions were published in Dungeon Magazine Issue 116. The bio ascribed to me and Necro reads (written by Dungeon Mag, not by me): "Clark Peterson, an attorney by trade, Clark doubles as the president of Necromancer Games, perhaps the most prolific adventure publisher in the d20 industry. Necromancer's products boast a 'First Edition feel' that hearkens back to the quality of many of the classic adventures listed in the panel's top 30. Peterson's professional credits (all through Necromancer) include Rappan Athuk: The Dungeon of Graves, The Crucible of Freya and The Player's Guide to the Wilderlands."<br />
<br />
In addition, as mentioned by others, we have recieved numerous industry awards. Much comment has been made that the ENNie awards are relatively recent. That is true. The reason, however, is that open gaming is a very new and revolutionary idea. These awards couldnt have existed previously because open gaming and the d20 logo didnt exist previously. Necromancer Games is one of only two companies to be nominated every year the awards have been in existence for consideration as the Best Overall Publisher. We have won numerous industry awards.<br />
<br />
I recognize that d20 publishers are indeed a small niche in the world and perhaps that niche industry is too small for a Wiki entry. If that is the case, then that is the case. I have no quarrel with that. However, in my view, Open Gaming is a significant revolution in roleplaying and if any company in d20 is relevant, it is Necromancer Games. As demonstrated above, the industry clearly agrees.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps clear up any misconceptions about Necromancer Games, our role in d20, the industry and the status of our publications."<br />
<br />

<p>This article is too long, not at all focussed, lacks a clear definition of tower. Within the haphazard definition it provides the listed towers are highly biased both in type as in geographic location (it is mainly about central European television masts and chimneys).<br />
Even worse, any effort to ask editors to clean it up has had no results whatsoever. a clean up tag has been up since december 2005; I myself made many effort on the discussion page to suggest cleaning up. However by biased unsourced additions the article is currently in much worse state than 10 months ago when the clean up tag was first added.<br />
Thus the quality and effort of editors is such, that removing this article is in my opinion better than leaving it up with the current quality (I have done everything I can to try to start a serious effort for imporvement and do not believe that will ever work withing starting with a clean slate). <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoutf_9ee7.html" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> 19:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply re: previous speedy delete</b> - I was the one that reverted the speedy delete, and my reasoning was not "added reference section". On the discussion page of this article I said that a web search for the term Bromance pulled up a couple hundred hits from a wide variety of web sites, indicating that it is in fact a slang term that is receiving some wide spread use. The speedy delete used was under the "patent nonsense" criteria, but as the use of this word actually <i>does</i> occur on a non-trivial number of different websites it does not fall under that speedy criteria category. Therefore I added a quick reference, placed the article as a stub and recommended giving interested editors a chance to investigate the word to see if the article could be expanded with additional references, should be moved to Wiktionary or should be deleted entirely. No matter which way the consensus goes, though, this wasn't a good speedy delete candidate. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Re: references</b> I added an additional reference from a SURF Magazine dictionary of slang from flipping through a web search for "Bromance" on ask.com. One dilemma here is that I found a lot of web pages that use the term, but they are almost all blog sites and forums which normally can't be used as references. It's an interesting catch 22, because the word is a slang term, and therefore not commonly used in formal publications, so even though it appears to be used in informal settings it's hard to find a formal citation source since they would avoid using informal slang. The word is mentioned in a quote from the television show "Big Brother" on a couple of sites, but again not on an official site. There was a musical tour called "True Bromance" by a punk rock group, but it wasn't obvious whether the group was notable or just a local band somewhere. Kind of a frustrating catch 22, trying to find formal sources to verify a term is used informally, but oh well. Worst case, if reasonable references aren't found, the article can ultimately be deleted and maybe recreated later if and when it appears in some better sources.&#160;:/ <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 21:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Contested prod. Advertorial in tone, but not an obvious one. It seems to me that this is probably a reasonably relaible source, but unlikely to be a notable website in itself. The business of rating Olympic bids is, after all, a bit esoteric. Perhaps a small section in <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_bid.html" title="Olympic bid">Olympic bid</a>? I don't know. Anyway, the site itself doesn't appear to even exist on Alexa, and although it scores moderately on Google most of the top hits are blogs or the site itself (and cafepress merchandising, spit, spit). My benchmark is always that the subject has been the prinicpal focus of multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject; I don't see any such evidence here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 20:44, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an article about a band. According to the article, the band was formed in 2003, but has released two albums, and toured both the US and Europe. That is an assertion of notability, so it cannot be speedied under A7, therefore I changed the speedy template to a prod. The prod was deleted, so I'm sending this to AFD. What concerns me personally more than any percieved lack of notability is that no sources are cited at all. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well the site with the review on it seems reputable to me, try reading other reviews of theirs and you'll see it's not just some silly site. and the bbc link is reputable. I do agree with you that this site is not a tool for promoting, it is not my intention to do that.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Female First, Teen First and Male First are obviously one and the same. They aren't three three different review sites with the same review. That's not a fair point. And furthermore, if you aren't UK based, i dont feel you can fairly assess this issue, as there have been gigs and prints in magazines here, he's not an out of the blue artist. Also there is a band called Oswald (UK Band) that has a page up, they dont have a record out or any links apart from their site. comment was added by Rarechords</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> One album, which isn't out yet, and which is on a label of questionable noteworthiness, and radio play that began in October -- in other words, last week, maybe two weeks ago. A playlist is a trivial source, and I'm not convinced the review site linked qualifies as a reliable source. Finally, the article's author seems likely to have a conflict of interest here per <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> No one has bothered to take this kind of action on the Oswald (UK Band) page, which has no links to their claims (and that's just one of the pages i've come across like that). It feels like I'm being picked on here. Regarding the "conflict of interest" please then amend the page to read more neutrally. I disagree that a "playlist is a trivial source". It's been on a few of Seans shows, he has a cult following down here and his taste is well respected, and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> dont just play any old record. And there need not be evidence produced to show this has taken the UK by storm as it is not one of the criteria listed in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. The label is not "of questionable noteworthiness", true that it is at its early stages, but it is being distributed by Polydor (Universal) and they have a reputation to uphold. Please email them to have this confirmed. Also, just found this, Gary Crowley of the BBC Radio London has also played Yoriyos <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/04/gary_crowley_person_profile.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/04/gary_crowley_person_profile.shtml" rel="nofollow">link</a>(see closing track) and BBC <a href="../../../t/o/t/TOTP_eae2.html" title="TOTP">TOTP</a> Top Of The Pops has his album listed for release <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/new_releases/soon_albums.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/new_releases/soon_albums.shtml" rel="nofollow">link</a> (see Nov 13th) comment was added by Rarechords

<li>1. A playlist <i>is</i> trivial; it says nothing about the artist or the music, other than that it has been played. (And that the "debut album" is an EP, which makes it less noteworthy, if anything.)</li>

<dl>
<dd>2. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Rowley_1695.html" title="Sean Rowley">Sean Rowley</a> is itself unsourced, but he does seem to have a regular show, which could make this one noteworthy and reliable media source, if your song's on rotation, or if Mr. Rowley has commented on it, its artist, or its album. The show is called "Guilty Pleasures," and apparently "celebrates music that is slightly shameful to love," so I'm not sure this is a ringing endorsement, but still, a source.</dd>
<dd>3. It's probably not a good idea to use another article as precedent. Especially an article you think doesn't meet the standards. Thank you for pointing it out, though; I'll do some research and possibly nominate that article later tonight.</dd>
<dd>4. You're not being picked on. Wikipedia deletes a lot of articles about non-noteworthy bands. However, nobody's disputing that the album is listed for release; this does not make the artist noteworthy. Nobody's disputing that it's been played on the radio at least once; this does not make the artist noteworthy. This is a brand-new artist with no albums out (yet); this tends to make the artist non-noteworthy. Not necessarily -- if his single has swept the nation and he's debuted high on the charts, he would warrant an article. But so far I've seen no indication that this individual belongs in an encyclopedia. He has no established career, and, based on the article's claims, there's nothing unusual or notable about his music. If there <i>is</i> something that makes this young artist especially noteworthy, then it should be in his article, and it should be sourced. If not, he should wait until his career's more firmly established, such that someone else, <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">not directly associated with him or his label</a>, begins an article about him. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:16, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not in the UK, so I won't vote - but with respect to recording artists, perhaps a determining factor ought to be whether or not their recordings have hit the "charts". It is so easy to have recordings done now, the mere existence of a CD, even some radio play, is not sufficiently noteworthy, IMO.

<p>This articles only contents are a list of incidents in Moneymore which resulted in two or more fatalities, in that list there is only one item (with two fatalities). The article on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Moneymore.html" title="Moneymore">Moneymore</a> has a section on the troubles which is just a link to this page and a description of what is on it "For more information see The Troubles in Moneymore, which includes a list of incidents in Moneymore during the Troubles resulting in two or more fatalities." I see no reason to keep this article, the little information can be easily merged into the Moneymore article. A look at the reference shows there were several incidents in or near Moneymore where one person was killed, so there is scope to expand this article. I think deleting and a couple of sentences on the Moneymore article is the best course of action. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hayes_ff55.html" title="User:Sam Hayes">Sam Hayes</a> 22:52, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As author, <b>Keep</b>, this is one of a series of 97 articles on the Troubles in individual towns in Northern Ireland. It covers incidents of 2 fatalities or more, but the objective is to expand them all to cover all incidents - thus the need to retain the article. You also need to understand that these 97 articles are there because of substantial debate (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/Wikipedia_talk%7ENorthern_Irish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_db4d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board">Wikipedia talk:Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board</a>) on this subject, the conclusion of which was that all troubles incidents articles should remain separate from town/village articles. I trust that now that you know the background you will remove the threat of deletion. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 11:32, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ardfern, I see your point but as it is I don't think that the article is good enough to remain. I'll change my view to keep if this article is significantly expanded. Another problem is this article is that it's a dead end article, the only thing that links to it is the Moneymore article, which is why its seems so stupid. I understand the reasoning behind removing this information from the town pages, but the creation of all these stubby, dead end articles doesn't seem to be a better solution. If these articles just give the information given in CAIN then what is the point of them?</dd>
<dd>A decision needs to be made on these article by article, in this case, I think that a sentence in the Troubles section of Moneymore should be added reading something like "Between <i>year x</i> and <i>year y</i>, <i>z</i> people died in and near Moneymore as a result of the Troubles." with a link to the relevant CAIN page if people want more info.</dd>
<dd>If the Troubles in Moneymore article had all the informamation from all the deaths, plus a bit more, stuff from local newspapers of the time etc, what effect it had on the town, whether those killed were of any importance to the town, anything to stop this article just providing a list, to differentiate it from CAIN then I would support its existence. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hayes_ff55.html" title="User:Sam Hayes">Sam Hayes</a> 21:39, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Given time the article will be expanded by me and by others (as is the Wiki way). I am concerned that the stub concept is being eroded by the endless push to see immediate fully finalised articles - but I see no help from anyone here in adding more information - just criticism that the article isn't full enough (that is not the Wiki way). CAIN does not provide info by town, hence the value of this article in its connection to the village. I am continuing research on the troubles by town subject and will be developing the articles (hopefully with input from others). For heaven's sake give the stub time to grow. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 23:37, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Comment</b> Well a search on CAIN gives all the relevant incidents, even if it doesn't list incidents by town. The extra information you added about the incident is good, makes the article infinitely better. I know stubs should be developed, but the proposal of delete wouldn't stop this, as the information would still be contained in the Moneymore article. If expanding the article just means adding CAIN info, then I can do it but as I said before, better information is needed, or its just a replication and adds no value to Wikipedia. Anyway, you've improved this article, so I will change my view to keep, and endevour to expand this article and help you with other articles in this category. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Hayes_ff55.html" title="User:Sam Hayes">Sam Hayes</a> 22:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> Sam, many thanks for helping to improve the article and for any help with improving others. Adding the CAIN info for all deaths by town/village is a first step, I will then be using other resources to flesh out the incidents and also to give them more local context. Thus thru Wiki co-operation we will have better, fuller articles - excellent job. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 18:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Per <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>, lists of words and definitions are not encyclopedic. Indeed, as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Lists_of_words_9e4e.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Lists of words">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Lists of words</a>, "<i>Article about "Words of &lt;foo&gt;" may be okay. "List of words of &lt;foo&gt;" to Wiktionary.</i>". We have an article about <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slur.html" title="Sexual slur">sexual slurs</a>, but the list is not appropriate here. Common practice is to move these to Wiktionary, link them from the main Wikipedia aticle, and delete the wikipedia lists.

<li><b>Keep</b> per all the arguments for keeping on the list of words page. I see plenty of value in lists of this type.

<ul>
<li>I see lots of value in this list, too. That's why it has been transwikied to Wiktionary where I will myself clean it up. But valuable is not the same thing as encyclopedic. Could you give a reason for why it is encyclopedic? <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:26, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because it's a subject for serious scholarship as demonstrated by some of the references. It is also actively edited here, unlike the wiktionary version, which dates from three months ago and hasn't seen any edits since (and no cleaning from you). This is an encyclopedia article that has steadily improved over the last 8 months, not a dictionary entry. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 18:05, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>As above, could I ask you to provide a rational for why this is encyclopedic? It was transwikied a few days ago. I realize there wasn't found to have been consensus a last time around, but one of the principles of AfD and deletion in general is that it is inconsistent. It's inevitable.

<li><b>Keep</b> useful list, meets all criteria.

<ul>
<li>I'm curious what part of the conclusion leads you to think that. Note that the article has no introductory section that could be merged to an article about the words themselves (as the policy suggests) and that we already have an extesive article at <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slur.html" title="Sexual slur">sexual slur</a>. The necessary specifications for deletion seem satisfied. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:07, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Entirely in keeping with the purpose of an encyclopaedia, and no reason at all to transwiki. If there was a separate wiki for sexual slang terms, then there might be a reason to move it there, but the whole concept of Wikipedia (behind its central purpose of gathering knowledge to make it available to the world) is to enable access to related information, and a dictionary does not provide that cross-reference facility. Ordinarily wikilinks would provide a mechanism to move from one related term to another. However, in the case where there are a set of terms related through a central theme, but there is not enough to say about each one individually in its own article, then it seems to be a perfectly valid and useful thing to do to gather the information in a glossary which can be referenced from articles that <i>do</i> have enough to justify their existence, but which would be cluttered by a list. It also means that those articles can all point to a single place, rather than having the information dispersed or duplicated.</li>
