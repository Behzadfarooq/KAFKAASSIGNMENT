<p>I am questioning the usefulness of this article/gallery. Galleries should not be welcome on wikipedia and should exist on commons instead.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of weather or not ethnicities can have flags. Flags are symbols of countries. Unless the country claims to exist the verifiability of the Flag is compromised which prompts "original research".</p>

<dd>I think the notion of "Flags of ethnic groups" falls under Original Research. The <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" title="Image:Gay flag.svg">LGB flag</a> is widely used but it is not universal. Flags of countries represent large groups of ethnic peoples. The german flag represents the majority of the German ethnicity but not some Germans (such as the ones that live in the US with US-only citizenship) -- <small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">chi?</a></sup> 12:19, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. First, notification is not a requirement, it is a courtesy, and is not a reason to halt an AFD. Second, flags most certainly predate the modern notion of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a> extant since the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Westphalia_adc8.html" title="Peace of Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a>, and many entities that are not countries have flags, ranging from the UN to subnational groups including states and cities, and private entities as well. It would probably be better to use this article to <b>list</b> the articles on ethnic group flags that are in Wikipedia. Galleries are indeed now deprecated to commons. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 14:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True re: courtesy notifications, but I think they help the AfD process in terms of making a good decision for Wikipedia's purposes. They also help morale and improve the perception of fairness and openness; they're something I always do when nominating an article for AfD. Finally, multiple editors have cited the need for references and concerns about original research; the existing contributors probably are the ones that would do the work and know where some of the sources are if the article is kept. As for the galleries question, that would extend beyond this page to a number of similar articles -- see <a href="../../../e/t/h/Category%7EEthnic_flags_1b3d.html" title="Category:Ethnic flags">Category:Ethnic flags</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_flags_8030.html" title="Category:Lists of flags">Category:Lists of flags</a>.

I note that dozens of different editors have made over 150 edits to the article and over 30 to the talk page with no mention anywhere of a need to delete this article.

<li><b>Delete</b> ethnic groups are usually not legal entities which is the prerequisite for the use of a flag. In some cases the flags in this category might be used generally recognized entities, but those would then belong in a different article.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 15:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in some form. As a gallery, it does not belong here and should be transwiki'd to Commons. As a list, it should indeed be kept, with sources included. Flags are <i>not</i> only symbols of countries, and it is nonsense to say they only exist for legal entities. When there is not a legal entity, there might be more ambiguity about whether it is fair to say a particular flag is the flag of a group, but this does not make the questions of OR and NPOV any harder than many topics on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 16:06, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure organizations can also have flags. Red Cross has a flag. I am not saying ethnicities cant have flags. Ethnicities cant have official flags.

<dd>Yes, and if only you use the flag you design, it wouldn't be notable enough to be included. However, if it is more notable, then lack of official status (and some of these do have official status in one sense or another), is a reason not to describe the flag as an official flag, not a reason not to document the flag at all. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 09:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - This, like the other flag galleries on Wikipedia, is a useful vexillological resource — <i>much</i> more useful than a list of text entries would be. In terms of adding sources, I question the usefulness or need of adding them to this article -- essentially an illustrated list. Instead, should they not be included on the article for the flag, or if it has no article, with on the flag image page itself? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottMainwaring_c3a6.html" title="User:ScottMainwaring">ScottMainwaring</a> 16:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your concern, while a reasonable concern on the subject of individual entries, doesn't mean there is a problem with the page. Several of the entries could be sourced to recognition by official governments (such as is the case of the Acadians I already mentioned), others might qualify by common recognition (if a bunch of sources say "This is what People X consider their ethnic flag" who are we to argue?). So, I think you might want to revise your delete statement. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:01, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I thought about this last night, and just re-read this "article". It is not an article at all. It is a gallery, as noted in the original RfD. It might be fine as a category. If someone were to actually write something, I would suggest it is an article, but it currently has zero content. I maintain my opinion of <b>Delete</b> given that there really is no article here at all that discusses "Flags of ethnic groups". It's a list or a gallery, and fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimMillerJr_6ea5.html" title="User:JimMillerJr">Jim Miller</a> 18:21, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I see the distinction between gallery/article here as needless, presenting this information in visual form is quite reasonable, but if you for some reason think it needs more information on the page, that's a trivial addition already done on a couple of pages.

<li><b>Keep</b> Make sure the flag is well referenced and is notable (either by having gotten publicity, or by being the official symbol of a group (whether recognised as a government is not relevant) that clearly has notability). ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 10:56, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldn't that be a symbol of an organization rather than ethnicity?

<li><b>Keep</b>- Certainly! This is useful and interesting. I made a Coptic keyboard and used the Coptic flag as an icon. I corroborated it with an external source.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Is a list of flags of the member states of the UN encyclopedic? Yes, I've never seen an encyclopedia that didn't have a list of such flags. This list has a different scope but the idea is the same. It just needs many more references.
