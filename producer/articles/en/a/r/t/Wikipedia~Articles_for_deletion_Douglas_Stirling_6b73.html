<li><b>Weak <s>Delete</s> Keep</b> at least this article, as it's pure crap not worth keeping, however, no determinant of his notability. Number of articles is not a determinant of the importance of the author, and 11 in the life sciences (what other area should he be publishing in? Einstein published almost exclusively in theoretical physics) could be astounding if they were all major articles, or if he were a young scientist, or if only 2 of them were among the top 10 cited articles in his field. It's not the number, but how well cited the articles are that matters. Even just one, if it's well-cited in the scientist's field, could lead to notability. And, you searched for his wrong in the google, it's not his Dundee Dental Hospital work that is being asserted as notable anyhow. If you search for Einstein's angiosperm research you're not going to find anything. And scientific articles about organisms are keyworded by the <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_name.html" title="Scientific name">scientific name</a></i> of the organism, not the common name, even though in the case of yeasts, the common name may be used. So, only 11 of his articles are in his area is no reason to say he's not notable, scientific articles are keyworded by their organisms, and he's not noted for his recent move to Dendee Dental Hospital, but for the organism he researched and the discoveries he made about it. His article "Mutations which block the binding of calmodulin to Spc110p cause multiple mitotic defects" alone is cited by 20 others, plus, I didn't even look, these are articles on the mitotic spindle, an extraordinarily complex organelle, and one of the last great discoveries, how it works, in the life sciences. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Good point. But this is basically a POV delete, "I don't <i>believe</i> this person passes," "not heavily cited" but cited just fine in its complex area, limited publications outside of his area (huh?), and failure to search properly for the organism he studied (called by scientists by its scientific name, for gosh sake), rather than his current recent job placement (scientists known by what they study AND by their institutes, but only by the former is fine, too). It's basically a small piece of an incredibly important and complex major puzzle in the life sciences--remove his piece, maybe the puzzle falls apart, which makes his research, even if only for the one article, important enough to qualify him. Nice to know, though, its a copyright infringement since it is so crappy. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Uhh - POV? What happened to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? You've misunderstood what I mean by "not well cited", too. I mean that only 8 papers cite his work, not that <i>he</i> doesn't cite his sources. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a><sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChovain_b912.html" title="User talk:Chovain">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chovain_178c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chovain">c</a>)</sup> 03:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I haven't precisely assumed bad faith, but I do question your methods for deciding this needs deleted when you've used the words, "appears" and "don't believe," searched for the common name of the organism, rather than its scientific name (for a scientist), and searched for the scientist attached to a newly acquired institutional appointment, rather than for his research on the organism or the important area of his research <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitotic_spindle.html" title="Mitotic spindle">Mitotic spindle</a> and you got the number of works citing his work as wrong, in particular for the one major paper in a major peer-reviewed scientific journal in which he is the lead author.<a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/109/6/1297" class="external autonumber" title="http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/109/6/1297" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
<li><b>Questions</b> Okay, assuming good faith on my part, please just explain your reasoning to me so I understand why this article should be deleted? I would really like to understand what is going on with AfD, and I do think that the criteria for notability for scientists are much higher than for video game minor characters. How did you come up with only 8 citations by others, when Journal of Cell Science links to 20 for a major article? Did you decide his research area was not important, if so how? Why search for the organism by common name for a scientific subject? However, one my bad for me--you at least DID look for this stuff. I'm not wholey sold on the article because it's so crummy and it would be so damn much research for me to get up to speed to rewrite it myself, so that's my POV. But, help me to understand yours. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not saying the article <i>should</i> be deleted. I'm <i>asking</i> the community if it should, and providing a start to the discussion. The criteria for video game characters is irrelevant. <i>Especially</i> when dealing with the sciences, let's not stoop to lowest common denominator. <s>The "8" figure came from the search at [4], which is the search "not heavily cited" referred to</s>. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a><sup>(<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChovain_b912.html" title="User talk:Chovain">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chovain_178c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chovain">c</a>)</sup> 18:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> and source properly. I couldn't agree with you more, KP, about the possible merit of the article and the proper way of looking for it, but the information as originally presented here didn't justify N and didn't necessarily look as if it would. The only thing that caught my eye was the "senior scientist", which usually implies faculty-equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, many articles about scientists and other academics are poorly written, and do not clearly present the necessary information for N, so we have to get it together here at AfD and add it. Worse, some people Speedy such articles when they are, as now, clearly worth at least a debate so sources can be found. The arguments presented here are all too common. I have been collecting examples from Speedy and Prod, and putting some of them in the talk page at Notability(academics) and at CSD. For the current collection, see User:DGG:sandbox4speedy1. Some of it is <i>much</i> worse than this.</dd>
<dd>When the proposer gives the search used and the results found, we have a basis for discussion. I congratulate Chovain on doing so. Let's encourage people to do so, and then explain how to do it better. In this case, for example, it might have been clearer to start with PubMed, which is free from many of the ambiguous GScholar counts. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Does not pass <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. With all due respect, I'm afraid people who say that a 20-year old paper cited 50 times is indicative of notability in the field don't really know what they're talking about. I've already argued this many times before on similar AfDs but this is simply due to misunderstanding of how citation works in academic fields. For one thing, you will cite yourself throughout your career. It is likely that any co-author of the paper has continued to work in related areas and has often cited that paper in introducing his own new discoveries. Unless someone can find a credible reference identifying Mr. Stirling as an authority and as someone who has had a considerable impact in his field, we could reconsider. However, Google searches strongly indicate that no such references exist. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:45, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
