<li><b>Keep</b> Claims "Elfwood is the largest science fiction and fantasy art site in the world" which would make for a notability argument. This is not OR, but autobiographical statement. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">WP:Auto</a> for inclusion criteria.

I'd say any site that makes it into a top list of sites on the internet is a keeper. And frankly see for yourself is NOT original research. It's called examining the subject and seeing what is known about it. And hey, if you think that facts such as the type of PC being used, or the software distro, maybe we should delete <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_platform.html" title="Google platform">Google platform</a> or the software and hardware section of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>.

<dd>I disagree with "see for yourself" not being OR. It requires a user to make a subjective interpretation about the significance of a site. The claim that it is "the largest science fiction and fantasy art site in the world" is also a claim that needs to be sourced (that's not a trivial assertion). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 05:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, it is sourced. To them. Was what I said not clear to you? That's what I meant by autobiographical statement. Besides, looking at a subject is important in making a determination about an article. That's not OR, that's called being informed. If you reject the idea of doing your own examination to see what there is to know about a given subject because it's original research, then I'd say we've got an entirely different concept as to what things mean. Now certainly, a simple google search won't reveal the good sources from the bad, that requires some real effort, but as the link above shows, they can be found. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The site's size, user-base, community and vast collection of user-created content means it is very well known and it's an excellent example of what the online fantasy community get up to. I would say it's similar in many ways to deviantART, which we certainly don't seem to have an issue with writing an article about. I would be confused if Wikipedia represented deviantART but not Elfwood, even if the latter is obviously not as large or as all-encompassing as the former.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoneColdCrazy_f1f7.html" title="User:StoneColdCrazy">StoneColdCrazy</a> 18:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It has. However, if the site is popular enough, it's the duty of people who know anything about the site to research sources and write about it. If people say "This site is more popular than that famous religious figure, why don't you have an article about it?" and we say "We don't have an article about it because we don't trust anyone but honest people, plain and simple", we're on dangerous waters. When people think of "No information is preferred over unsourced information", they regrettably think of the Nuke instead of Getting Rid of the Dubious Stuff. Verifiability is <i>not</i> a deletion reason in case of deviantART; at worst, it'd be time to trim away anything that's completely unattributable. Stub about a famous website is better than no article at all. Likewise here. Why is it that people really don't seem to want unsourced material to live in the article history? In closing, AfD is not Cleanup and in 90% of cases, lack of sources is a cleanup issue, not a deletion reason. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AfD is not the way to get people to re-write an article. Articles don't get deleted because there are no sources present in it. Articles get deleted when there are no sources <b>at all</b>, which is obviously not the case here. Please keep that in mind in the future and search for sources yourself before you nominate something for deletion. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">âœ‰</a> 16:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: A very old and well established site- it has many many artists, many people may want to read about it on Wikipedia, there are third party sources available as was displayed by Conti... Also, I came across this deletion debate because I was checking some info on the Elfwood article, and I had heard of it before I came to Wikipedia. Ok, a lot of what I said isn't Wiki Policy, but it is certainly reasoning for this article to be kept. Frankly, I think it is ridiculous that this has been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_Milburn_19f9.html" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> 02:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
