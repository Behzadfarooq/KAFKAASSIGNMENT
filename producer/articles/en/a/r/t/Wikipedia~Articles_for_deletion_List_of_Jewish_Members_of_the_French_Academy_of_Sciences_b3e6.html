<p><b>Strong delete</b> Another addition to the listmania craze. All of the people presented in the first section of this list are accounted for in the list on the main page (under scientists and social scientists), and the second section are just repeats from other lists. Finally, there isn't even a list for Members of the French Academy of Sciences &lt;-----even that would be pointless though. 72.144.114.22 10:47, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. In last time there were deletions in Lists of Jews of engineers, scientists,women and so on. An attempt has be done to delete List of Fellows of Royal Society and historians. There are plenty of similiar lists in Lists of all other people. Why the Users, that don't like Jews are so active in Lists of Jews? I recommend them to Delete similiar Lists in Lists of their own nationality. Of course, Gentles who want to contribute (not to hinder!) to development of Lists of Jews are welcomed.</li>

<li>So, what, you're implying that anyone who votes against this list is anti-semitic are you? I've got news for you - Jewish is not a nationality. These people's ethnic/religious origin is irrelevant to both their nationality and their contribution to life in their country. Implying that there is any similarity between this list and lists of people of a particular nationality is ridiculous. Why should people be singled out for a separate list because of their ethnicity and/or religion? Should we have List of Protestant Members of the French Academy of Sciences too? It's irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 11:07, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that anyone who votes against lists of engineers, scientists, historians of some nationalty, ethnic group or both don't do that occationally. What would you say, if I and group of Jews from varios countries would try to delete List of engineers or scientists of Scottish people on grounds that they are only one of nationalities in the Great Britain&#160;? Do you think that ethic group is not intiled to do what is permitted to nationality (scottish people)&#160;?</li>

<li>Scotland is a component <i>country</i> of the United Kingdom. A different case entirely. Most people from Scotland identify themselves as Scots first and foremost. I don't believe this is the case with Jewish people (most Jewish people from Scotland, for instance, probably also identify themselves as Scots first and foremost) and I don't think you have any grounds for believing otherwise. But as a closer analogy, I would certainly vote for deletion of a List of Scottish Fellows of the Royal Society as being a pointless ethnic breakdown of an all-Britain institution. A List of Fellows of the Royal Society, if one existed, would be perfectly sufficient, and this is also the case with any other organisation. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 19:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We have differences of opinions.I think that if Scottish people want a List of Scotish Fellows of the Royal Society, it is not of other national/ethnic groups business to dictate them what they have to do. By the way, do you want to initiate deletion of alredy existig Lists of Scotttish engineers and scientists&#160;? If you don't, what is your position to deletion of Lists of engineers scientists and historians in the Lists of Jews&#160;?</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not dictated by what individual ethnic groups wish to do. We all have a say here and we can all edit. And you are not representative of a particular group just because you happen to be a member of it - others may have different opinions and it is somewhat arrogant of you to assume that yours should prevail - please cite your support from other editors (you don't seem to have a great deal here). I have already said I do not support deletion lists of Scottish whatever and also given my reasons (it is all but a nationality), as I have given my reasons for my support of deletion of lists by ethnicity/religion, which simply serve to encourage divisiveness. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:33, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
