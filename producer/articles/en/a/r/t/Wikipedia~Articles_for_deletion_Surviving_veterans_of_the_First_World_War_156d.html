<li><b>Keep</b>, and boot User Zoe for disrespect. Why don't you tell that to the face of a WWI vet. This isn't just about "known for being alive," it's about part of history. That's why they have to be a WWI veteran to be on the list. The number of surviving WWI veterans worldwide is less than 80, while Japan has 1,540 people aged 105+.

<li>comment - And what do you think a comment such as "notable only for being alive" is, when in fact they are notable for being WWI veterans (the second-worst war in history)?

<li>No, but they are notable because of still being alive more than 90 years afterwards, meaning after the beginning of World War I in 1914, hence. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Bart Versieck</a> 11:53, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. A useful link list containing more than a fair number of notable people. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">Sjc</a> 07:55, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. They are notable for being alive despite serving in a war ninety years ago. I also do not think it is abusive to point out when someone is being disrespectful. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszlo_Panaflex_8819.html" title="User:Laszlo Panaflex">Laszlo Panaflex</a> 08:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I don't get it: they are of a generation soon to dye out, so it's very important to honour them from a historical point of view at least by not deleting this very important page. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Bart Versieck</a> 09:48, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Informative list, but it's going to be quite a job trying to keep it updated... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 09:49, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm extremely ambivalent about the value of this page. In my opinion, a list should contain intrinsically useful information on its own, or serve as a useful navigation resource for Wikipedia. The information inherant in this list seems to be a negligable value (it's just a group of people who found in a war and survived to this day), and indeed it is dated (and thus transient) information, which, in my view, makes it less encyclopedic.<br />
On the other hand, there do happen to be a number of people on this list who are indeed notable for other things (and thus have WP articles), so this article does have some (albeit somewhat idiosyncratic) value as a navigation aid. If this were rewritten to be a list of people who have or need their own articles, with brief summaries of who they are, then I think I'd find myself abstaining from voting, on the grounds that this would be a useful but somewhat idiosyncratic list. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:59, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Information for a world's record or trivia book, not an encyclopedia. It would be very difficult to maintain, as they are dying rapidly. Also, it isn't Wikipedia's place to honor anyone. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:24, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry you feel that way. However, AfD is a place for brutal honesty, and I don't think anyone who voted delete is trying to be disrespectful. They're just trying to explain their reasoning, however offensive some may find it. We have to decide what is and isn't encyclopedic, regardless of whether the subject deserves recognition or honor.

<li>Okay then, but I have to say we are maintaining and updating it regularly though. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_Versieck_4669.html" title="User:Bart Versieck">Bart Versieck</a> 12:31, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Surviving WW1 is not notable. Living to beyond 100 is not notable. Combining many non-notables does not make one notable. 130.159.254.2 13:02, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, sometimes it can. Take, for example, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Abbott_e807.html" title="Jim Abbott">Jim Abbott</a>, who (as his article admits) is primarily known for being a baseball player <i>and</i> being one-handed. His notability would be much reduced if he was only one of the above. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">&amp;mdash; Matt &lt;small&gt;Crypto&lt;/small&gt;</a> 13:41, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Notability is rarely something achieved simply by being oneself. For example, World's Tallest Midget is not our game, although Dwarfism and Acromegaly are. WW1 gets ample coverage. Surviving the war and then the years that follow is always something to be rejoiced in, but it is not encyclopedic. (And my grandfather was a WW1 vet.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:25, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The list <i>is</i> maintained. It <i>is</i> kept up to date. If the list was for all WW1 veterans then it would be unmaintainable. It is not. It is for those veterans who are still with us. Contrary to being unwieldy, it is a small and dwindling list. In fact it will delete itself in the not too distant future! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, ok, my mistake. But then again it will delete itself. And honestly, I don't quite see a purpose of it. It's a list of some unknown names. Maybe just a number would be useful, but not the whole list of names. And how about other countries involved in WWI? Like Russia for example. So it's POV, incomplete and will delete itself. I agree it's all very sad, but... <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata3</a> 14:54, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How is it POV? Incomplete because it lacks Turks maybe. But how so is it POV? These people are alive and they are surviving veterans. Those are NPOV facts. As to the missing info. - by all means try to find out the names of those Turks and Russians. Then add them to the list. It would be better for their inclusion. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 17:08, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The article is NOT POV. If Iran or Russia have living WWI veterans and put them in the news, then we'd surely add them to the list. Clearly, the English-language Wikipedia has 800,000+ articles, some languages have less than 100,000. Is that POV because the other languages aren't adding material? It would only be POV if we "refused" to accept, for example, German WWI veterans...clearly, that is not happening. Also, when the last survivor dies, the article could be renamed "last WWI veterans," so it doesn't necessarily have to be deleted. Civil War histories of the last Civil War veteran claimants (Walter Williams, John Salling, Albert Woolson, etc) are still read, and included in newspaper and encyclopedia alike.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 21:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It is not exactly exhaustive though is it? Surely there are some surviving Iranians, Russians, Turks or Japanese? A very westernised list, the only non-westerners are an Algerian and a Serb who both happened to have fought for the French and 3 Poles, 1 of whom fought for the Germans. I vote to keep based only what David (below) says about their "notability as a class". <small>(This anonymous vote is by 82.13.187.66 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.13.187.66_94a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.13.187.66">contribs</a>)) - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 23:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>It's not entirely that surprising. For a start, war rolled over European Russia and the Balkans repeatedly since WWI, whereas France had two comparatively short periods of combat and an occupation, and the UK was essentially untouched bar some bombing, after WWI. In addition to these higher mortality rates through warfare - a lot of those young enough to fight in WWI and still live today would have been called up in WWII, especially in the German or Russian militias in 1941/5, or gone into various resistance organsiations - there's the massive death rate of the early USSR to consider, or the high Japanese civilian deaths of 1944/5, the occupation of Poland... and after all that, there's the simple matters of bureaucracy (if no-one in the country knows you fought in WWI bar your family, it won't be known to the world), which is understandably worse in countries where documentation has been damaged or lost by war or political upheaval, and of medicine - medical care in the West is substantially better than in most other countries, suggesting that a higher proportion would survive to an advanced age (100-110 without good medical care is pretty unusual). I'm not saying they're all listed, but I do think that it's fair to expect some skewing... come to think of it, Japanese participation in WWI was low numerically, pretty much only the navy, so you'd not expect many veterans there, and I suspect Western Europe had higher conscription rates than most other participants generally. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> | <a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShimgray_87de.html" title="User talk:Shimgray">talk</a> | 16:34, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The last surviving veterans of an old war become notable as the only remaining people who can give a firsthand account of events.

<li>I suppose I should add that I do have a degree in history. I am also a war veteran. I had relatives who fought on both sides of World War I. Their oral history brought immediacy to accounts of the war. To offer one example, a popular German slogan was "Gott mit uns" (God is with us). My grandfather used to grin and hold up his hands, describing how the soldiers in his company taunted: "Yeah? We got mittens too!" There are still a few people who can bring such moments to life for the rest of us.

<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, let me try THIS discourse instead. It's something called "commemoration." IF you were a history major, you'd know what that is. Some people become notable as witnesses to history (oral history). As commoners, they may not have been important individually in 1925 (instead as a group). However, by 1998 (80 years later) the French government decided that it was time to commemorate and honor the surviving veterans of WWI. And don't tell me about Vietnam. We all know about Vietnam. Do you realize that more than 10 million died in WWI, far more, but for many young people today, they know nothing of the "Great War." Even among US soldiers, the war dead (118,000 in less than 2 years) far exceeded the less intense Vietnam conflict, which saw 58,000 deaths over the course of 11 years. Hence, from a historical perspective, this becomes important as "living history." With the current number of worldwide surviving veterans less than 100, and with the major news outlets deciding that their deaths warrant inclusion in obituaries, this becomes encyclopaedic. In fact, the article helps because although not everyone in the list is important enough to get their own article, together a little can be said about each one. This also helps to balance out the media tendency to "pick one person and run with it." I'm not saying that Lloyd Brown deserves his own encyclopaedia entry, but clearly a list of 80-odd surviving veterans is not too much to ask.<br />
Also, this is an educational tool: it teaches younger people about cohorts, generations, and demography.<br />
As for maintenance, that is a non-issue: many people have maintained it. And for ephemerality, you're missing the point: when the person dies, their death is recorded and moved to a separate list. I note that during the 1950's, "surviving Civil War" veterans was a popular topic. Several were featured in news publications such as the NY Times. Beginning in 1949, the NY Times included dozens of obits for "surviving Civil War veterans." If you want to re-name the article, "last veterans of the First World War," then one could divide the list into those who are still living, and those who died in the last 5 years or whatever criterion is used.<br />
Considering that everyone on the list from the US has been featured in a newspaper, I question what is wrong with keeping track, rather than blindly keeping people in the dark.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 21:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are overlooking the fact that these people ARE notable. For example, as they die, their deaths are reported in the national press. If you or I die, our deaths will probably not be reported in the press. Why the difference? We are not notable and these people are. Similarly, many of them are also reported in the press whilst still alive; if they attend a service it might be reported. If they fall ill and go to hospital; it might be reported. And so on.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some thoughts on what is being said in here. There are claims that someone is notable because his or her death is reported nationally. My first wife's death went out on the national wire services, and was printed in newspapers all over the country. Does that make her notable enough for a Wikipedia article? I don't think so, as her chief claim to fame was that she was the first woman "of color" to be elected a national officer of <a href="../../../n/o/w/NOW_3dce.html" title="NOW">NOW</a>. Her death was "momentarily newsworthy". What is notable is that only a few veterans of World War I are still alive. Their individual names are not notable for the purposes of Wikipedia. It has been claimed that these people are notable because of the conjunction that they are veterans of WWI and still alive. By that reasoning, can I start a List of veterans of both World War I and World War II? My grandfather would qualify for that. An encyclopedia is not supposed to include everything imaginable.

<li>There just seems something wrong or disrespectful with this article. Its sort of like the comment above "ensure this valuable resource is updated regularly" which pretty much means crossing people off as they die. So its like you hear over the news that a wwI vet passes away - ok better go cross him off the wikipedia list. There is some policy I believe here that you should use the date rather than terms like "now" and "surviving" - I read it somewhere, cant find it now. It sets a bad precedent too, lets start: Surviving 1920s jazz musicians, Surviving athletes from the 1904 Olympics and be sure to keep an eye out for the news so you can cross them off as they die, and eventually delete the article completely.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have suggested that this article could be re-named "Last Surviving Veterans of WWI". That word construction is ambiguous enough that it could include living and recently deceased WWI vets (since if they died in 2004, for example, they'd be "one of the last surviving veterans of WWI). In that case, the question becomes, what is the cutoff point? Someone has suggested Jan 1, 2001 (start of the 21st century). The alternate plan is to leave it as it is, and th deaths are being migrated to lists such as "WWI veterans who died in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005...)<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 09:51, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good Morning, all, I have made a some changes in line with my suggestions (see some things we need to decide?) I have moved Orin Peterson to the WW1 era category, as this seems to be the direction the evidence points. I have moved the Romanian and the anonymous French Vet to the Unvalidated category - with a note on whats "missing" as it where. My understanding of the Unvalidated category, is that unvalidated does not mean false (though some of them, noticeably the 13 year old veteran almost certainly are)rather they do not have full verification, by a sanctioned body, and none of these cases would appear to have such a verification. One final note is that I would suggest we create some sort of "pending" category for new cases, and I received a bit of support for this: thoughts anyone? SRwiki 10:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am just wondering why 3 of the French vets, have suddenly moved into the unverified category? After much discussion, in December I thought we had come to a reasonable consensus, about who was listed where, and my understanding was that all 3 were recognised as vets in our definition rather than the stricter (and western front orientated) French definition. The moving of the Italian vet who is living in France suggests that who-ever has taken it upon themselves to do this, doesn't understand how the page is laid out. If this vet has been moved because he has not been verified by the French Government, then there is no reason why he would be, he is a veteran of the Italian army - people do move around. Can whoever has done this moving please explain their reasoning? thanks SRwiki 18:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for replying, but I think you are using a different definition of a vet to the rest of us. As far as I can tell the official French definition accepts only those with more than 3 months service, on the Western Front. The definition we are using here, is service anywhere, for any length of time up to 11/11/1918. I suspect the official French definition, is for the purposes of who gets a war pension, rather than who is a veteran.</dd>

<dd>In the case of two of these Vets 1 served in Syria, and one for less than three months, so although not on the official list, are still veterans. The Third vet you moved is an ITALIAN, who just happens to now be living in France, he is never going to be classed as a French Veteran, because he was never in the French Army. But he is an undisputed Veteran of the Italian Army.SRwiki 07:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally I notice that Charles Brunier, was awarded service medals for World War 1, but was stripped of them when he was convicted of murder, so another reason he may not be on the official list is that it would be very embarassing for the French Government, if they ended up giving a full state funeral to a convicted murderer.

<p>Shouldn't Tuveri be included as a veteran of Italian army?</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>There are several issues here. First, Tuveri moved to France and is a French citizen even though an Italian vet. There is also the issue of a Canadian living in the U.S., Brits living in Australia, etc.</p>
<p>That is a separate issue from the 'official' French government list. For one, I don't give much credit at all the the 'official' list. As someone mentioned, it seems designed to exclude (and thus to possibly save money by denying a pension). Second, the 'official' listmakers didn't do any research (but claimed credit for 'discovering' Rene Riffaud and Francois Jaffre, who appeared on the Wiki article months earlier). Third, the Italian list also doesn't include 'official' vets, either. I think the issue of 'verification' is one of existence and service, not government sanction. Fourth, the official lists changed the rules to include Rene Riffaud (and thus the rules don't seem so important as their marketing efforts). As noted, there is at least one anonymous French veteran not yet releaved. So, the French gov't may be embarrassed if the anonymous vet outlives the three 'official' veterans.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 20:46, 18 January 2007 (UTC) _____________________________________________________ Why is it that when we get the list in pretty good shape, someone comes along and does something totally off the wall.

However, to remove a vet because he has not met the french requirements of so many months service is confusing and does not make sense. Please put them back in the list. As a person stated above, if you will read the comments of the other members you should understand why this is not the correct thing to do.

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Media reports have Charles Brunier joining in 1918, aged 17, and wounded in combat in Syria. However, I'm certain he will NOT get a state funeral. His military honors were stripped in 1923 (after being convicted of murder), why would they be restored now? Further, the French gov't only recognizes "Western front" veterans (a sort of Euro-centric bias, yes). Third, because he was wounded, Brunier served only two months (less than the three-month requirement). Let's not forget that the information on Brunier came from independent sources that were not aware of this Wiki article.</p>
<p>The bigger question is: if the French gov't gives a funeral for the 'last' veteran and then another one emerges, what then? As stated, there is at least one remaining anonymous veteran (alive this month). However my contact dropped contact Jan 16 so I can no longer vouch for the continued existence of this person. My contact did report, for example, Rene Riffaud months before the French gov't noticed, as well as Louis Jaffre.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 19:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting Character Charles Brunier, as far as I can tell, he enlisted with the French Navy, towards the end of WWI, the war in Syria, was I believe actually fought in 1919, and was more of a land grab, in which France carved the nascent states of Syria and Lebanon, out of the defeated Ottoman Empire, jailed for murder on Devils Island, and more relevantly for the purposes of this discussion - stripped of his military honours. Claims to be the basis of Papillon, escapes from Devils Island, fights in WW2, is arrested, and sent back to Devils Island, but is finally pardoned for his role in WW2. It's quite a story, and I imagine there is a reasonable amount of paperwork to back this up.</dd>
<dd>But whether ever makes it onto the list, depends on whether the pardon, trumps the honors being stripped. My guess would be no. I really can't see a coffin carrying the body of a murderer, being paraded down the Champs d' Elysee.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One other thing that has occured to me, is that the French Navy was one of the biggest in the world at the time. I just wonder if in the focus on the Western front, some of these sailors may have been overlooked. SRwiki 08:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while back, a poster here (I forget the name) attacked me for the "vandalism" of removing Stephen Butcher's name, from the living veterans list, even though he was deceased (and I had seen a local newspaper's obituarys section) and demanded proof.</p>

<p>I have been told by a German colleague that calls to a nursing home were made, but they wouldn't release the date. This is not confirmed but it seems likely that Mr. Seim must have died recently. Notably, he would have been named the oldest man in Germany on Jan 29 2007 if still living. → <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 00:40, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>That was I. I phoned the nursing home in the case of Mr. Velten, not Seim - sorry, I didn't say that clear. There was a little Note in a newspaper that he died a few days ago, We hope we can find the exact date out. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStatistician_e2e8.html" title="User:Statistician">Statistician</a> 01.02.2007 10:59 (CET)</p>

<p>We now have a source and a date for Rudolph Seim. Please stop deleting it.</p>
<p>For you people who think it is equivalent to Solinski: comparing apples and oranges simply won't do. We had someone tell us that Seim had died and a phone call was made. Now, someone found the obit in the newspaper. Far more than we saw people do with the Polish cases.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 05:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Robert, I must respectfully disagree on this point <b>"Far more than we saw people do with the Polish cases" .</b> I have made continued written enquiries about Solinski (previously, and recently again) to his local town asking for more information about him. I'm not sitting on my arse deleting Solinski &amp; saying "I think he went in 2005", I'm trying to do something about it. I accept, and have done so from the start, Seim is dead, but please don't belittle other people's efforts simply because you don't like them.</p>
<p>I AM working on it &amp; hope to produce the evidence one day to confirm it. Please give it time and please have some patience, and less of these little "asides", hmmmm?</p>

<p>Afternoon All During an idle moment whilst pretending to work I Googled Gheorghe C. Panculescu and the following came up as a Wikipedia link:</p>

<p>But the link doesn't seem to go anywhere Unfortunately my knowledge of Romanian is non-existent, so I couldn't plough through the Roimanian branch of Wikipedia to track it any further. but it does rather look as though he may have died on the 9th Jan. Has any-one else come across anything to corroborate this? Thanks SRwiki 15:38, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who added this case in the first place? I would assume he died Jan 9 2007 unless someone else says otherwise. Also, with the claimed date of enlistment (May 1918) I think we should add him to the WWI vets who died in Jan 2007.

<p>Hmmm... not certain. There's nothing in the Romanian press about this. All there is one (defunct) wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Not saying he's not dead, but I can't see why there's one rule for Panculescu &amp; another for Solinski. Neither have any PROOF they are dead for certain, after all.</p>
<p>No one said that Solinksi was dead, no one offered a death date. They just said "we didn't see a birthday story this year." If you will, we can make a 'limbo' list for cases where deaths are unconfirmed.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 01:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more point: the article was written in Romanian, making it less likely to be a hoax. Also, the writer of the article was apparently unaware or didn't bother to edit the USA version, again making a motive of deception less likely.→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 02:07, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Canadian government recently announced (in reaction to an online petition) that when the last surviving Canadian WWI vet dies, he would be given a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_funeral.html" title="State funeral">state funeral</a>, as a way of honouring the memories and sacrifices of all the Canadians who fought in WWI.

<dd>What if Mr. Babcock ends up being the last? He was born in Canada. Did his training in Canada. However, not only has he spent most of his life in the USA. He is a United States citizen. Will this bother the Canadians? I Imagine he will wish to be buried in the USA. 209.240.206.209 11:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He served in the Canadian military during WWI, so he'd be honoured on behalf of all the members of Canada's WWI military, regardless of where he lives now. Anyway, I didn't bring this here to discuss if it was right or wrong, just whether or not we should mention it on this page. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 13:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is an interesting tidbit, but does not belong on the main page. If so, we could probably add another 50 or 60 more interesting footnotes and so on. By the way, the three Canadian veterans say they are not interested in a state funeral. I guess they can be honored, but it sounds like all three want a private funeral... No it shouldn't be listed in the main section. 209.240.206.209 02:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
