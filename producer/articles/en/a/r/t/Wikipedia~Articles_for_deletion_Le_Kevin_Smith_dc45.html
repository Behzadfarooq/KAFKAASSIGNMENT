<li><b>Comment</b> Also, the numbers given relate to the accomplishments of the Nebraska defense, and not specifically to those of Smith. Were the college achievements sufficient to confer notability, we would then suggest that every player on the Cornhuskers defense--at least every starter--would merit an article, and I don't think that's a road down which we want/ought to go. (FWIW, Smith recorded only 36 TFL and 9.5 sacks over his college career; 50 sacks would not only have more than doubled <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrell_Suggs_3381.html" title="Terrell Suggs">Terrell Suggs</a>'s DI record, but also have bested Suggs' career mark [44].) <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:45, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, he was drafted, but he was drafted in the sixth round. If he were to make the Patriots' (or some other team's) squad, then obiously, this would be a very strong keep. As it is, he (like every other draft pick) hasn't played a minute of NFL ball. But the article clearly shows notability, so it's a worthy addition to WP.

The point is, it's a keeper.) -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 17:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very weak keep</b> I was tempted to nominate many articles for deletion after stubs were created for almost every player taken in the first five rounds of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_NFL_Draft_cb20.html" title="2005 NFL Draft">2005 NFL Draft</a>, inasmuch as many were non-notable for their collegiate achievements and will not necessarily, as CrzRussian well explains, ever play professional football. The proper disposition, I think, is "keep", where one's being drafted typically leads to one's playing the league (though this is surely a bit of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystal ballism</a>), with the proviso that we ought certainly to revisit in September the articles created subsequent to the draft, with a strong tendency toward "delete" where players have not made NFL squads and are non-notable for their collegiate accomplishments. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> could someone please explain what level he plays at compared to an English footballer? Very difficult for English users (some of us at any rate) to make a decision about notability. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 07:26, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The NFL, which is of course the highest level of American football, holds a draft every year during which teams select players who (almost without exception) spent the previous few years playing for a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_I_94db.html" title="Division I">Division I</a> university football team. The person in this article was selected in the draft last week but he is not really part of the team yet, as NFL teams hold training camps prior to their seasons during which they choose which players will be on their roster. So at this point the level he plays at is possibly the highest (NFL), or possibly nothing, depending on how good of an impression he makes during training camp this summer. However, he was drafted in the sixth-round and without looking it up, I would guess that the majority of players drafted that late do not end up making the team. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 10:20, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
