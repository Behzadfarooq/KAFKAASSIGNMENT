<li><b>Keep</b> I am in no way advertising for a fiber thing. I saw it on tv, looked for an article on wikipedia to see what it was, but then there wasn't so I looked on www.benefiber.com to see what it was and wrote a wikipedia article. You guys are so mean. I'm a teenager, why would I advertise for some sort of fiber thing? Did you read the article? It has nothing advertising, and if it does, please just tell me to remove the words. I was just trying to be helpful by making an article on something you don't have, even if it is a stub. Look, it's real, <a href="http://www.ask.com/web?q=benefiber&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" class="external free" title="http://www.ask.com/web?q=benefiber&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/web?q=benefiber&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=0&amp;l=dir</a> thats a web search on it.

<dd><b>Comment</b> allow me to assure everyone I'm not hauking it, I'm merely an astronomer and a game store owner, I ain't sell the stuff. I'm somewhat concerned that we're deleting an foreign product because there are few english references, and it's hard to find references for places where they use very different alphabets.

<dd>Cannot be used in food or drinks? Nonsense. Guar gum is a common ingredient in processed food. Sometimes I believe it's just called "vegetable gum." Just a second.

<li>I'm all for expanding it, but please tell me what I should add. I have reworked the page, re organized it, I've done everything. If it is deleted, I will simply re post the article as it is in it's current form, which is not advertising. <a href="../../../y/s/h/User%7EYshoulduknow_360e.html" title="User:Yshoulduknow">Yshoulduknow</a> 22:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A deleted page shouldn't be recreated without reason. If you really want to fix up the page, Yshoulduknow, I recommend looking at the article for <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayer.html" title="Bayer">Bayer</a> for comparison. You can use that as a basis for expanding the article, if possible. Make sense?

<dd>Would you vote Keep if I did that? I would just need help with pictures, I don't know how to put them there with the source and everything. <a href="../../../y/s/h/User%7EYshoulduknow_360e.html" title="User:Yshoulduknow">Yshoulduknow</a> 22:42, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I already voted for keep, but maybe some of the folks above would vote keep if it was fixed up. As Mattisee says below, though, it's not about the lack of pictures, it's about turning it into a strong article, with good, verifyable links, and information that would be found in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#999FFF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No evidence has been presented that any these products have any particular importance above and beyond being fiber supplements. Metamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber are not cultural icons. They are not famous in this history of advertising. They do not figure in novels. They are not the topic of song lyrics. They have not made mainstream news. They are all particular brands of generic fiber supplements. None of them is signficantly different in health effects from any other. There is nothing much to be said about any of them except to echo dubious marketing claims that one particular kind of fiber has a somewhat different texture, flavor, and spectrum of GI side-effects from another. I.e. one particular person may find that one product gives them more gas than another, or may prefer the slimy texture of one or the gritty texture of another. <i>There is nothing substantial for these articles to be <b>about</b> except to echo commercial promotion.</i> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 09:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> per Coredesat. The only references on the article right now, are advertising sites. If it could be shown that there is literature about Benefiber in other mainstream non-medical publications, that would make it more notable, but otherwise, I think that this is best as a sub-paragraph in some other article. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
