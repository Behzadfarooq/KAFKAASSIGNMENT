<li>The Vanity Fair article is a piece on the Gumball Rally. Alex Roy as an individual is one of the focus of a good bit of the article, but I would say it provides support for an Alex Roy article rather than a Team Polizei article, and considering how the two appear to be inextricably linked, it probably would make sense to create an Alex Roy article with Team Polizei being a section of the article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 16:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - in the case of questionable articles that could go either way, I lean on the side of "does someone care enough to write an article" side.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am happy to discuss my characterization of the speedy delete nomination as "vandalism," but I have deliberately not brought that into the discussion here, partly as conciliatory move, and partly to keep the vote clean.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Judging by searches, appears to be known only in Norway. Also, appointment as Bishop doesn't seem to me to give sufficient notability--she is the Bishop of a town of 27,000. IMO, this can be covered sufficiently in other Wikipedias. The other Wikipedia article doesn't seem to cite much in the way of references either.

<li>The diocese of Hamar is one of 11 dioceses of the Church of Norway and covers one of the most populous areas of the country - far more than the 27,000 who live in the seat of the diocese, namely Hamar.

<li><b>Keep</b> In my opinion people holding highly-placed religious offices are automatically notable, in addition, there appear to be ample sources. The article may not be ideal, but it is acceptable under all wikipedia policy I can think of. As to the greater debate, I'm staying out of it, but I will say that I can see points on both sides. Assuming good faith is vital, but using a speedy tag when an article does not meet speedy criteria is also stepping out of process.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - yet again, this is being used as a substitute for <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a> and there is no valid rationale for deletion. There have already been two AfDs on this article, one very recently, and I'm tired of articles being renominated just because it's to a particular user's fancy to delete a certain type of article this week, or because they can't be bothered doing some research and improving the article themselves, or because they disagree with the previous outcomes, so they just keep nominating the article until it goes their way. That's not the way to do things on Wikipedia. There are plenty of other tags to cover those sorts of situations, so why aren't they being used? As I said in the last AfD, there are some significant articles on a newspaper database that I found about the school, such as it being caught up in an education funding dispute in the early 2000s under Bob Carr's Government, but no one seems to take any notice of that - everyone uses the Google search and that's it. There are plenty of print articles - why doesn't anyone look for them? It's because people can't be bothered doing any work - it takes far longer to write an article than to delete it, but the deletionists get impatient and say that if we can't get a good enough article in three or so weeks, then it should go - too bad for anyone who's done any significant work on the article. And to be honest, although I would have liked to improve the article, I haven't had time, so I'm annoyed that yet again, rather than anyone doing some work on the article, it just gets nominated for deletion because no one understands that people need time to improve articles. And while the nominator claims that he tried a merge tag, in truth he suggested that we merge the article to the local school district, and if he had read my edit summary when I got rid of that suggestion, he would know that I got rid of the merge tag as Australia does NOT have school districts, and so it's impossible to merge the article to such a thing. I have a compromise though - I'm prepared to merge this to the local suburb article (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a>) (which is a sensible and realistic merge proposal, as opposed to the last one). Let's stop this silly and ridiculous debate, and I'll put in the references needed to make the section of the Jannali East article on the school a good one.

<li>As Shimeru stated in the nom, many of the keep&#160;!votes in the AfD seven weeks ago were solely based on the nominator being an spa. Without those&#160;!votes, there was much more of a consensus. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The tag says "school district or locality," but I can see how that might be missed. I'm willing to <b>withdraw</b> the nomination in favor of a merge/redirect (or expansion from reliable sources, if you have the time now to do that). I don't particularly care whether we do or don't have an article on the school -- only that, <i>if</i> we do, it's one that shows why the school is notable, with reference to multiple independent sources, like we'd expect of practically any other article. This one was first written in May 2005 -- that's a bit more than three weeks to wait for sourcing. But a merge is a good compromise until a sourced article can be written, and that approach seems to be building consensus. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:58, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - ok, considering I have a few sources on the school from newspapers and the like, though not enough at present to support an independent article, let's merge this to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a> and keep everyone happy. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 02:28, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The likelihood of this becoming a significant article is pretty small, considering the school has 175 students.

<li>When an article is kept in part because people hoped that it might improve, that presupposes that the article can be renominated if it does not improve.

<p>The page for the UC Merced Library consists of material that was removed from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Merced_a579.html" title="University of California, Merced">original UC Merced Wikipedia page</a>. I doubt that there's really enough information or noteriety to warrant a seperate article on the University's library when sufficient information is already covered on the UC Merced page. Thus, unless there are any good reasons to keep this article as is, or any edits with sources to verify its noteriety, I propose it be <b>deleted.</b> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLetterM_d2c6.html" title="User:TheLetterM">TheLetterM</a> 02:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A few, but mostly not mentioning the library, or doing so trivially. Some routine annoucements about Leo Kolligan's being appointed regent. What appears to be the record of an estate he inherited. A mention on a construction website that he has financed a lot of construction work at UC Merced. I just don't see anything that establishes notability for the library as a separate entity. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and do not merge, as there is no content worth saving. Back in September, various anon IPs and users repeatedly tried to add this text to the main article.

<p>This song is not notable. The only claim to fame is that it's video was the "first 3D animated music video" from India. Even this is not verified. I could find only one link<a href="http://www.the-week.com/23dec14/life5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.the-week.com/23dec14/life5.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> which says that "Anuj Nair's album Simple Truth puts forward a claim to fame. No, it's nothing to do with the music; rather, it claims to be India's first 3-D animated music video." I am from India and I don't think that this song was popular. The only claim to notability is that it was a 3D animated music video -- this doesn't make the song notable enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJyothisingh_3ee3.html" title="User:Jyothisingh">Jyothisingh</a> 02:56, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

But the most important thing on Wikipedia is <b>consistency</b>. If the previous consensus says that a one-sided list is inherently POV, all these lists need to go. If a new consensus is reached, saying these lists are allowed as long as they don't use terms like "massacre", then the deleted list should be revived, and edited to the exact same standards. Consistency above all else.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 08:45, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Consistency is important which is also why there is admin discretion and AfD is not a vote. That said, we should not overinterpret it. X was deleted so Y is deleted too is not an automatic process, it must be dealt with on a case by case basis. Regarding this specific AfD I would say that the previous AfD more than anything established that if these things are already well-covered there is no need for these lists. They (like most lists...) add nothing important to Wikipedia. Timelines in the main article are much etter suited for this kind of thing. The POV naming is easy to deal with but they are still just lists of things we already covered in other articles. The problem of lists being POV because they only contain attacks comitted by one party in the conflict could have been easily dealt with by merging the lists. So the POV argument really isn't reason for deletion, the fact that lists are a horrible way of doing this kind of thing <i>is</i> a valid reason for deletion, POV or not. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 09:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>"X was deleted so Y is deleted too is not an automatic process, it must be dealt with on a case by case basis." Agreed. We need to examine the reason why X was deleted. If it can be shown that Y doesn't have this problem, the original consensus doesn't apply. In this case, the Israeli list was deleted because it was decided that a list of only one side's attacks (whether or not the term "massacre" is used) is inherently POV. Some of these articles use the term "massacre", some don't, but at their core, they are all lists of one side's attacks. Therefore, I believe that, whether or not they're kept or deleted, all these articles need to be treated the same way. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Absolutely true. These lists are an inherently bad idea and same line of reasoning applies as on the other AfD. My only additional point is that even if the one-sided aspect is removed by merging all these lists the fact that it is a list makes it an inferior way of dealing with this since in this case a timeline in the main article would be much better and less prone to POV arguments. Sorry if my arguments got mixed together, I totally agree with you. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 10:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

With the exception of Al-Aqsa which is pretty dodgy, I'm not sure that there is a parallel between this AfD and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of massacres committed by Israeli forces. That article was a pretty clear copy-and-paste from a larger list except that attacks from only one side were copied and then relabeled as massacres even when the article did not identify them as such. In this case, the inclusion criteria is easily verifiable (did the guy blow himself up?). Some of these lists are too long to be part of a timeline (Hamas for example) and they are useful on their own (for example in tracing the history of one of these organizations). I would recommend the following remedies to deal with POV problems: (1) rename all of the articles now called "xxx massacre" to "xxx suicide bombing" unless the incident is more commonly known by another name and (2) clearly identify each list as a subset of a larger list covering both sides of the conflict with a note that attacks from one side do not occur in a vacuum. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 16:09, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If even an admin is unsure about the proper action to take, a fairly new Wikipedia contributor cannot be expected to take the 'right' action either. Regardless of that, my point still stands.

Should this AfD fail I will take the other article to a deletion review, as I in neither way can see me being at fault. These articles are all of the same nature.

<li><b>Comment</b> yeah you should have taken it to deletion review... only the massive consensus on that AfD meant that you wouldn't have achieved anything. As I said above I don't think the problem here is POV at all... whatever POV problems there might be with these lists are easily overcomed. What should happen is that the way the information is presented should be improved, possibly by integrating the information into relevant articles. The problem now, as forseen, is that this AfD has gone from a debate that could have led to an improvement of Wikipedia without loss of valuable information to a heated debate with no apparent possibility of a comprimise. I would have abstained from AfD'ing this at all and worked on getting this integrated into the relevant articles if possible.

I hope cooler heads prevail in this debate. 129.98.212.71 22:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, the problem here is not that we don't have enough people saying keep. The problem is that we still have 4-5 people saying delete so it can't be speedy closed.

<li><b>Comment</b> So, it looks like consensus is saying that as long as a list only contains verifiable incidents, it can remain on Wikipedia, even if it only lists one side's attacks. Fine, I'm happy with that, I'm changing my original comment to a keep. I look forward to seeing the deleted list brought back using the same standards.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Can we at least reach consensus to remove the word "massacre" from all of these lists, and from the individual articles they link to? In many of the listed cases, the only source that refers to an incident as a massacre is the "Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs". If the international media or other neutral sources call something a massacre, fine, we can call it that too. If not, all the articles like "Bus X massacre" should be renamed to "Bus X bombing". <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 23:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that we should rename them so that the rethoric used is the same as the Israeli articles. With all due respect though a guy blowing himself up is not a complicated affair. Yes, it is horrible when he kills people and it is definately a notable event but I would find it very hard to fill an entire article about one attack, except perhaps the larger ones that have prompted serious military responses. Eventhough we keep these articles I still think there is room for consistency as stressed by Quack. I personally like timelines (that extension to the MediaWiki software is way underrated in my opinion), apparently there is no consensus for that which was partly why I abstained so that's off the table but there is still room for improvement. We just don't need to go through this AfD to do that. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:40, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Speedy Keep</b> - No grounds for deletion. Apparently, the nominator was frustrated that a list which was a copy paste of another article and contained only falsehoods was deleted, but in contrast to that one, these are lists of factual suicide attacks that took place and are relevant and there is no reason whatsoever to delete them, nor was there any attempt to articulate such a reason. The comment above by Bsnowaball shows why those who want to delete the article lack a whole lot of knowledge on the issue and shouldn't participate in the AFD probably. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 11:39, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

If there were, I'd have added them myself. It makes no sense to add a source tag to an article when I already know that no sources exist. The "sources" linked below are not reliable third-party sources as required by the policy. The league has not been "the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other" and thus it is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notable</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Oh, are there? Thank you, I appreciate your letting me know of these "books" and "magazines" you speak of. Meanwhile, do you have a source, online or otherwise, that discusses this topic in a non-trivial fashion?

<li>The club sources I mentioned below are backups, just in case you think the Australian Poker League isn't as active in the community as it claims to be. The main sources are the poker news websites, as they should be. In the same way as computer games are considered notable if they're mentioned on several professional, and independent, computer game news sources, poker subjects should be considered notable if they're mentioned on several professional, and independent, poker news sources. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Simply being "mentioned" is not sufficient to establish <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>.

<p>If it really has over 145,000 registered players in a country with a population of 20 million, it's definitely notable. I'd like to see a source for that membership number, though. (Then again, are we allowed to mention any organization's number of members? If we're not allowed to use the organization's own membership count, what figure can we use? Any news source which discusses an organization is unlikely to independently verify if that organization really has 145,000 members, for example.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:28, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

They are provided by a person who claims to work at Nickelodeon (in Belgium) and says that the episode will star <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>.

<li>One Night In Hackney posed a valid question regading the reliablity of Paul Freeman as a source.

<li>You don't see many bus routes for the same reason you don't see many bus routes in a hardbound encyclopedia. WP:NOT very much applies here.

<li>I just went through my entire Encyclopedia Britannica and I cannot find a single Pokemon article, or any Seinfeld episodes or Star Wars planets. Surely you don't believe that any "hardbound encyclopedia" sets anything for Wikipedia. After all, all you've done is stated "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia" without even bothering to dress it in something Wikipolicy-related. The existence of another place to put this information doesn't justify deletion either. After all, I've made specific suggestions about where all that Pokemon stuff can be inserted and no one has followed through on that idea. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:53, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not about to argue whether you've gone through all of EB, but EB seemsto ahve slightly (!) different standards. Besides, Wikipedia does not bend to you; you must bend to Wikipedia.

<li>I went through both the Macropedia and Micropedia, and I still can't find Pikachu anywhere. Have you found any such articles in the print edition? I understand that people have an agenda to create a transit-based wiki, but here on Wikipedia, we use policies and standards that have been established to load traditional encyclopedia content, and thereby include many subjects that my Encyclopedia Britannica doesn't cover. You are one of many people who has incorrectly and misleadingly implied that there is a Wikipedia policy that forbids this article. It simply does not exists and your agenda to push this to another wiki is questionable. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 20:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Everything in the infobox, for a start, is directory-style information (fares? service frequency?), and cumulative listings of all this stuff makes up -- wait for it -- a directory. And what makes the difference between one bus route and another in this pile of bus routes? Pretty indiscriminate, if you ask me. What actual encyclopedia-like content exists is, essentially, for busspotters (dunno if they exist, but this IS the country that gave the world <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trainspotting.html" title="Trainspotting">trainspotting</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planespotting.html" title="Planespotting">planespotting</a>, so it wouldn't surprise me.
<ul>
<li>Many towns have infoboxes. The town infoboxes list population, year established, latitude, longitude, mayor. What content often exists is little more than towncruft. They're all basically the same; just directory information that changes a little bit from one to the next. Yet, for some reason we have tens of thousands of these articles -- all almost entirely the same -- around the world. I would entertain your position if it made reference to an actual flesh-and-blood Wikipedia policy that forbids this article and requires its deletion. Other than that, my analogy for retention is equally as valid as your's for deletion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>I just went through my entire Encyclopedia Britannica...</i> And when was it published? If it was published 10 or more years ago, that might hint at why current events aren't indicated in it.

<li>The tsunami and elections aren't in my Britannica. Are the AFDs for these articles up yet? Wikipedia is not paper, and we can afford to include quality, well-written, thoroughly-researched articles such as these. The fact that some people turn up their noses is a shallow elitism that proposes that "anything I'm interested in is important; anything I don't care about should be deleted."

<li>Surely you understand how easy it is to alter a bus line, and how easy it is not to alter a train route. =^_^= Besides, I figure this, as theory - oftentimes a train is going to have more historical significance due to interregional connection and the inability of said train to be only slightly alterable (due to the issue with altering rails); a bus route is as flexible as the surrounding city streets for the most part, and metropolitan bus routes typically don't leave their metropolitan areas except to connect and transfer with other neighboring systems. That said, as I point out, there's a precedent for a transit wiki - but now you bring up the issue of whether trains belong there, too.

<li><b>Keep</b> - article has a well-written history section which gives it a claim to being far more than directory-style information. And despite what some users are claiming, there is barely any directory-style information there. To delete an article based on that it should resemble a web page for a bus route. It doesn't. This is a good, well-written article on a bus route with historical information, and there's no reason why it should be deleted. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 09:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; the history is useful (but needs citations). Some of the "cruft" like fares and stops should probably be removed though.

<p>I don't feel this article is needed. First of all, for an article ostensibly focused on leaders of Prohibition, it only centers on two.

<li><b>Note</b>. A lot of arguments appear to be based on a dislike of public transit. Highways, get articles, therefore so should bus routes (my opinion, not policy) and more especially train lines (yes, this is policy). If your only reason for voting delete is due to a lack of belief in the importance of public transit, your views are irrelevant to this debate. <a href="../../../n/l/s/User%7ENlsanand_c56d.html" title="User:Nlsanand">Nlsanand</a> 22:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1) Page will have a hard time being exhaustive 2) can't imagine any user ever searching for a general list of characters; more likely to look for individual characters, and infobox on major characters' pages provides easy nav between them 3) List role of this page better served by category page/cat inclusion -- and those already exist. True, doesn't include rank insignia or career highlights but, again, that info's on character pages. Generally, don't see utility of amalgamating all this info. <a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 06:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no proof that Tyra Banks will be releasing an album soon. I have looked up various supposed tracks on google, with no news. I have checked the album title, with no results. As far as I can tell, this is all simply rumour. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this page is not worth keeping until it can be verified somehow.

<li><b>Keep</b> I strongly suggest doing research instead of relying on your gut feelings. I apologize if it sounds harsh. AFD is strong medicine, and Googling is so easy. It only took a few nanoseconds to find the St. Auggie quote in an e-text archive. Also, your not supposed to be deleting based on "value", thats a subjective criterion. You have to see if the information is verifiable and notable enough to be found in multiple reliable sources. I don't think keeping "Wikipedia tidy and clean" (on <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewspaper98_e465.html" title="User:Newspaper98">User:Newspaper98</a> userpage) by deleting articles on best selling children's, books based on their titles and subject matter is useful.

<li><b>Move</b> to flatulist. Most of the history section seems to tell about fart entertainers, but not necessarily about <i>professional</i> fart entertainers. The original AfD is misguided.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. It was a bit close, but discussion (among the non-<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>-commentators) focused on its importance on the stock market, and there remain serious doubts that <i>this</i> company's share price is indeed used to calculate stock market indices (see the second-to-last comment).

<li><b>Comment</b> Look, I mean no offense to you, but I did follow the only link that was provided when I nominated the article: to the company's homepage. I noted that it was the company's homepage, and that combined with the fact that you deleted my unreferenced tag led me to open an AFD here, so that consensus may be reached.

<p>Sure, I am continuing my editing of this page, for this hour. May be you have found only one link sometime back. It is ok. It happens, that is the spirit of wikipedia, it is alive&#160;!!! (I recognize your role as a supervisor of <b>recent changes</b>. But you should allow some time for a recently made article to be tagged for anything:- unreferenced, delete or whatever. Allow the contributer his/her time, atleast, one hour of editing time, and then start your tagging. I don't know what is Wikipedia's policy on tagging a live article, while it is being edited by its contributer/ original auther. ) -<a href="../../../j/i/j/User%7EJijithnr_8d7b.html" title="User:Jijithnr">Jijithnr</a> 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Being listed on an exchange is not sufficient -- the related criterion is being used to compute major market indexes. The BSE allows small companies with almost no trading volume. This company trades under 500 shares most days. Revenue is around $36 million gross revenue, which is hardly industry-leading.

<li><b>Interesting</b>. "Geometric Software Solutions, Ltd." does appear to be a significant part of one of the BSE indexes, while "Geometric Software Solutions Private, Ltd." is not mentioned. There are two orders of magnitude difference in the number of Google hits. Do we have a small company with a confusingly similar name to a notable one? Do we have a confusion here between alternative names for the same company? Is this a common/preferred share distinction, or something similar? Should this article be moved to "Geometric Software Solutions, Ltd?"

<p><b>Delete:</b> Non-notable. Seems to be an effort at promotion. The only contributor to the article was a single person whose only contributions have been editing the article. I trimmed a large quantity of excess verbiage and duplicate sentences and puffery adjectives and an infobox which duplicated his web link. Much of the verbiage was like "Andy Tabar is a young entrepreneur with new visions and high expectations." I removed capitalization and linking that served just as gaudy decoration. What remains is a non-notable 20 year-old business student who has a web page company and got given a speaking engagement and a local business award. Sole proprietor web page companies are not notable. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 10:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I read this article about a year ago, and actually liked it a lot and found it both interesting and informative.

It seems that a number of the characters vary wildly from artist to artist. Without a reliable source, the descriptions of such characters can only be based on generalizations and perceptions of the writer, which is both unverifiable and original research. My hope is that some of the more notable OS-tans can eventually be brought into the main article, if and when a suitable source is found. But, for now, this article should be deleted, as it doesn't seem likely at this point that this article will be fixed otherwise. <a href="../../../n/i/m/User%7ENimrand_99bc.html" title="User:Nimrand">Nimrand</a> 06:26, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Japanese sources are acceptable, although English sources are preferred if available. However, the later link just looks like a repository of fan artwork made for OS-tans, which is a primary source. However, for most of the content of this article, secondary sources are needed, because deriving generalizations from the artwork themselves is original research without secondary sources for verification. The magazine that published artwork of OS-tans could probably be used as a source (because the publication itself is notable and relevant to the topic and it is independent of Futaba), but the content that cites that source should be limited to what can be taken from that source, which probably amounts to reporting on what OS-tans were featured and showing examples of the artwork printed. Because the content that the source would likely allow is so small, it most likely does not justify a seperate article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/i/m/User%7ENimrand_99bc.html" title="User:Nimrand">Nimrand</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/m/User_talk%7ENimrand_ba79.html" title="User talk:Nimrand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nimrand_d0bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nimrand">contribs</a>) 01:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Another electricity pylon from the systematic cleanup. There is certainly a claim of notability here. This unique 75m tower is located in the middle of a lake, and was constructed on a raft of concrete to stop corrosion from the lake water.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although there are at least 10,000 radio and TV masts in the UK, only about 1% of these sites are the subject of WP articles. Generally they are the most important sites. Many of them have been written about in primary and secondary source material, although little of this has found its way into the WP articles so far. (Caradon Hill was the one of the two sites that first brought commercial TV to south-west England. It came on the air on the same day as Stockland Hill.) There's nothing in <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> that suggests these articles ought to go. In particular, Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopaedia where space is limited. The articles may be arcane and of specialised interest, but that is probably true of 90% of WP's 1,500,000 articles. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarumphy_0f61.html" title="User:Harumphy">Harumphy</a> 23:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst I agree that some of these should be deleted, this mast is notable in respect of its place in broadcasting history in the UK. As Harumphy states, it was the first station in SW England to broadcast commercial TV, was the first to broadcast on Band III VHF, the first to broadcast commercial radio in the area, and has now been on the air for over 45 years. It is also one of the 30 tallest structures in the country, with One Canada Square being the only building taller. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChillysnow_a9e1.html" title="User:Chillysnow">Chillysnow</a> 15:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Chillysnow. Not all of these towers are notable, but this one has historic broadcasting signifficance. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 16:53, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The blog has been cited in The Guardian, Private Eye, The Morning Star &amp; Socialist Worker. It broke the story that Innovative Emergency Management had attempted to cover up its involvement in Katrina emergency relief - this story was subsequently covered in Private Eye. Therefore qualifies for notability: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Worth noting that the user 'Meaders', who complains of vandalism, is himself the habitual vandal of this page according to the discussion page. Socialist Worker covered the blog when it leaked documents protected by the Official Secrets Act relating to Craig Murray's allegations that the government had received information from the Uzbek government obtained through torture. Neither story is by any means trival, both sources are independent of the site itself, and both are reliable publications disseminated through UK newsagents and sellers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.141.50.7_279e.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.141.50.7">86.141.50.7</a> (talk) 19:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>The fact that this has no sources, as Sandstein says, is good enough reason to delete, even if it isn't copyvio. However, as that was only brought up two days ago and AfDs run for at least five for a reason, I feel that this discussion should be relisted given the change in focus, so editors have the chance to show <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> if possible. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:36, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are something like 10,000 radio masts and towers in the UK, and I agree that 99% of them aren't notable. However, most of the ones featured on Wikipedia are in the notable 1%, although the articles often don't (yet) state why. Please don't expect contributors to expand all these articles at once. It will take time. Heaton Park is notable because it provided a large portion of the trunk comms capacity into Manchester and there is quite of lot of primary and secondary source written history about the architecture of these 'Chilterns' type concrete towers, which are all significant local landmarks and cultural icons. The article could possibly be merged with similar articles about the other six towers of this type, but it shouldn't just be deleted. Sutton Common is notable because of it was originally conceived as part of the 1950s 'Backbone' chain designed to provide the UK and NATO with survivable comms during nuclear war. Swingate is notable in that it is, AFAIK, the only radar tower from the Battle of Britain in WWII still in use today. Woofferton is notable because it was shared by the BBC and VOA and provided a stronger short-wave broadcast signal into the Eastern Bloc than any other western short-wave broadcast transmitter during the years of Soviet jamming. WP is not a paper encyclopaedia, there is no shortage of space and there is no need to delete an article because it it is arcane. With over 1,500,000 articles, arcaneness is inevitable. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarumphy_0f61.html" title="User:Harumphy">Harumphy</a> 16:24, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Woofferton. It is not a minor 'mobile phone mast' type of site. It is a massive, historic and important transmitting station. This article links to a new web publication that is probably the most extensive history of a short wave station that is presently available. Martinte 18:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. Saw the Pye Green tower from the train today, and came to look it up. Glad it was still here!

<li>I did check for reliable sources. I checked dozens upon dozens of the Google results and they came up as garbage and trivial. If you had better luck on your search results, good for you. Hope you'll take the time to add them to the article so that the next person who sees it will see proper sourcing and that you'll direct some of your ire at the author who couldn't be arsed to source it to begin with. In the meantime, with of course all due respect, you should probably refrain from posting about what I did or didn't do when you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:30, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And actually, now that I have the opportunity to look at the SI and CBS articles, neither of them discusses the topic of the WCOP in a non-trivial fashion. The SI article is about a particular player and the WCOP is mentioned in passing in one sentence. The CBS article is about whether team play in an online tournament can be beneficial and mentions that the author played two WCOP events as part of his experiment in team tourney play. Neither of which satisfies the requirement that third-party coverage be "non-trivial." <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, as I said, The hundred or so sites that I checked off a google search all came up with trivial mentions, much like several of the trivial sources you initially posted. An article about a person who played in the tourney where the tourney itself is mentioned in a single sentence is trivial. Good for you if you finally found something with more substance.

<p>This article has been speedy 4 times, so I'll bring it here to get more eyes on it. The claim of notability is that he placed 4th in a competition for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Malays_National_Organisation_7fe0.html" title="United Malays National Organisation">United Malays National Organisation</a>. He says that is notable because the top 3 were Malaysian and he's Chinese apparently.

If you guys insist on deleting the truth of the article, then by all means do it, but remember that it is not an easy achievement for a Chinese to qualify for the top 10 in an UMNO-organized competition, moreover he is the only Chinese who participated out of more than 250 Malays. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelvincwl_ae4b.html" title="User:Melvincwl">Melvincwl</a> 17:27, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>First of all, welcome to Wikipedia. Second, Wikipedia is not supposed to "report" anything at all. This is an encyclopedia, not a news desk. Third, according to the article, 8 out of the top 10 were Malays; Chin Wee Loon wasn't the only foreigner to win. In fact, that means 20% of the winners were not Malays. Doesn't seem like that big a deal to me. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 17:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dear Kafziel, firstly, thank you for your welcome. Secondly, what I mean by reporting is presenting an article which is true. Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, and as such the public has every right to view certain information pertaining to certain people of interest. And by the way, it comes with a reference with a video clip on an official website which can be accessed anytime. You cannot put in a mathematical way that 20% of the winners were not Malays. Did you know that out of 250 Malays who joined the competition, there is only one Chinese who was in the competition and yet, he made it into the top 10. It is certainly not an easy task for a Chinese to get in what more to win 4th placing. I hope you will get my point. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelvincwl_ae4b.html" title="User:Melvincwl">Melvincwl</a> 18:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear all, I just want to put it this way that if Wikipedia does not present a true article which comes with adequate references, I do not think it is a credible encyclopedia after all. And somebody mentioned that this is a conspiracy theory. What an immature way of discrediting an article. There is no conspiracy theory at all. It is not even an article of opinion nor speculation. Who wants to waste time in making a mockery or puppetry out of somebody who is credible?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Delete</b> as above. I checked <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> - could not find any mention of this young gentleman in the archives of the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Straits_Times_4cbd.html" title="New Straits Times">New Straits Times</a></i> or in the general press archive.

<li>Dear Bwithh, even you'd agree that given <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketuanan_Melayu_a5b0.html" title="Ketuanan Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a>, it is indeed a significant achievement for a non-Malay. Isn't this a crucial point for a free and open encyclopedia such as Wikipedia to allow Chin Wee Loon as a clear-cut example of how hard work and determination can make you successful anywhere you are as long as you have an objective in life. And can somebody please take down the 'this article is for deletion' and 'this article needs a clean-up'. I have already shorten the profile and include in only important things as required by a stub's criteria (which is a short article). Thank you.

<li>Dear Metros232, while I appreciate that you had your name published in newspapers, this is indeed an extraordinary achievement for Chin Wee Loon.

<li>Dear Kafziel, this discussion will not be done unless those scrutinizing this article understands the significance of the article. I believe there is even bias on those who are determining whether an article should be deleted or not deleted. The profile page is now edited to be as concise and precise as possible. While I acknowledge that Wikipedia is not teaching people about hard work and stuff like that, what that has been presented in the article is very true and comes with references. Thank you and I hope this article will be permanent in Wikipedia. Of course, if anybody feels there is any correction or error, the article is open to editing any time. Thank you very much.

<dd>P.S. - apologies for my use of the term "vanity" which was not intended to cause any offence. If you check my edit list you'll see that I've recently returned from a very long wikibreak.

I did not see any comments on this. It is not like writing an article blindly. Besides, how sure are you that other contributors never have a COI with the subject? As Wikipedia is a free and open software, anybody can edit it without even informing the admin about any COI. For one thing, I can be editing about someone else's profile and tell that person later that I was the one editing it. Or alternatively, that someone can be told in advance that I am going to edit his profile and he agrees to it. What have the admin got to say about this issue?

<li>It says in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian_Malaysia_72cf.html" title="Malaysian Malaysia">Malaysian Malaysia</a>"<a href="../../../m/a/l/Malays.html" title="Malays">Malays</a> began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago. Of the 39 percent <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malays.html" title="Malays">Malays</a> in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary-general of UMNO, Dato' Syed Ja'afar Albar, who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour." The "favour" here is to let the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malays.html" title="Malays">Malays</a> win the 1st to 3rd places, and have Chin Wee Loon settle in the 4th place. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonytypoon_ec73.html" title="User:Tonytypoon">Tonytypoon</a> 08:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>- * How can you claimed that this article is not notable enough when even a citizen from Hong Kong sees its significance. There must be something important in this article, that is why he highlighted and posted it in Wikipedia. By the way, I did not in whatever way instruct him to write about me. This is purely his effort in bringing up the page. If the admin thinks this article is not fit to be in the software, so be it. I hope the admin will weigh the pros and cons before deleting this article. But this discussion has changed my perception about how Wikipedia is being handled by its patrollers. I can sense that some of the patrollers are indeed immature and not thoughtful and analytical enough in criticising an article. If you were in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> or have experienced the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysian.html" title="Malaysian">Malaysian</a> way of life, I can certainly guarantee you that you will know what is going on. And please do not just turn a blind eye on it just because one is not notable enough. He or she may not be notable to you but to some of the population in a country, it matters very much. This is my last post and I hope everybody will be liberal enough to see some of the points that I have raised. Thank you all.</p>

<li>I've re-tagged this as a speedy. There's no point at all keeping this AfD open, it's just a waste of time and effort which could be more usefully directed elsewhere. And it unquestionably meets speedy criteria. 86.134.24.74 22:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Second the above motion to speedy, but I've been so involved in this that I'm not going to do it myself. Anyone else? <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 23:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm all for speedying this. I was seconds away from doing it when I first nominated it, but then I noticed all the speedys in the past and figured it's time to actually show the user there is a consensus to delete this. I think there's an overwhelming consensus here for delete and would support a speedy delete (obviously I won't carry it out myself as the nominator). <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 23:05, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have reverted the Speedy Tagging (second time). The speedy tagging by an anon IP was out of process. The reason given - that 4 people in afd had asked for Speedy Delete and therefore the afd is a waste of time - is not sufficient. If a majority of people&#160;!voted in this afd discussion for Delete/Speedy Delete, and there is no significant opposition, than an admin may decided to invoke <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a>. Repeated tagging of the article as speedy delete by an anonymous IP who dismisses this afd discussion as a "waste of time" is improper <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:14, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'd just reinstated the speedy tag before seeing Bwithh's comment above, but I do feel that it should indeed be speedied. With regard to the "waste of time" comment, I don't think that Metros232's nomination in order to get more opinions was a waste of time - I think it was a very sensible move. However, in view of the opinions above, I do fear that keeping the AfD going <b>would</b> be a waste of time. <a href="../../../c/l/w/User%7ECLW_0ab3.html" title="User:CLW">CLW</a> 23:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case, that's what <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is supposed to be used for - CSD tagging is a separate process. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My understanding: Once an AfD has started it is <b>improper</b> to re-instate the speedy delete tag. If there are "speedy delete" votes, here, then only an admin can decide to end the discussion early and delete it. I voted to speedy delete it, so did others, that's enough. Generally when I speedy-tag something, an admin deletes the article within minutes. Notice how no admin pays attention to a speedy tag on an article that's involved in AfD. Leave it off, people. =<a href="../../../a/x/l/User%7EAxlq_af18.html" title="User:Axlq">Axlq</a> 03:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If Chin Wee Loon were notable, there would be independent news sources provided explaining how he is notable. So far, no such sources have been provided at all. The only supporters of this article appear to be the subject and his classmate. How did the classmate find out about the subject coming in 4th place in the UMNO competition? Was it published in the newspapers in Hong Kong (where the classmate is from) or Ireland (where the classmate is a student now), or did the subject tell the classmate about it? This article appears to have significant problems with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Please note that the existence or non-existence of this article is not going to have much effect on ethnic relations in Malaysia, but if the proponents of this article are trying to convince us that the subject was relegated to 4th place in the competition (instead of winning) because of Malay nationalism and discrimination against Chinese, they will have to explain why the subject bothered to enter a contest sponsored by a Malay nationalist political party in the first place and why they gave him 4th place out of 250, placing him ahead of hundreds of Malays. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 15:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>.First of all, I am Malaysian and I agree with the race barrier that do exist in a minor way in Malaysia, but then again, which country don't? Anyway, in accordance to wiki guide, winning the fourth place have no significance what so ever in my opinion. Second of all, knowing Chin Wee Loon a.k.a. melvincwl a.k.a. cwl personally, this article is strongly more of a vanity page than that of a notability article. He likes doing stuff like that with the mentality that it would give him a strong boost of sorts in the local political scene. That is a well known fact among peers. I steongly think this page should be deleted. Sorry Tony, it is the sad fact. I can verify Tonypoon is a seperate entity from Melvin but I should also point out that every defending point for the prevention of deletion of this article are all written by Melvin himself. Why would somebody defend his own autobiography? If there's significancy in the statements, many others would procceed to verify this and prevent it from deleting. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugenekoh306_a6fd.html" title="User:Eugenekoh306">Eugenekoh306</a></li>
<li><b>DELETE</b> - I'm Malaysian Chinese; I've never heard of this guy (not that that matters), he doesn't represent me or my race, and I'm telling him to knock it off with the using of Wikipedia as a vanity page to promote his political/personal aims. Do you realize at 34 kbs and growing, this debate is at least x20 bigger than the article we're discussing? If Chin Wee Loon or his proxies are actually defending this article from deletion, its quite plainly a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>. Delete it for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">non-notability</a>, 4th place is clearly not notable. To suggest notability by claiming that he was shafted by the competition, (implied racism here and in the article) is disingenous and dishonest. Was there an outcry that he was cheated out of 1st, 2nd or 3rd place? Did he return his 4th place award in protest? The answer is no. This is a self-serving vanity page. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 21:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

There have been no other comments made and I have now merged some details from the 3142 page to my BY226A page.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The redirect's history should certainly be kept in some form since it contains a history of content which was used and merged with another article, <i>deleting the history is a violation of the GFDL</i>. Indeed, a consensus to overrule that requirement would be invalid. Therefore, if you want the redirect gone, the page should be <b>history merged</b> first. Regarding the article itself, that should be kept since crash landings of large jetliners are definitely enormously perilous for a large number of people and of significant media and general interest, so I cannot understand a call to delete that thing. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 14:09, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sorry but I don't see anything notable whatsoever in this article. It seems, for the most part, to consist of a series of descriptions of the organisation's key personnel (none of whom seem to have held any sort of political office whatsoever), letters they have written to national newspapers and dinners that they have held over the past few years. I have looked long and hard for more information and have discovered only two actual news stories about them - both from the BBC news website in 2002 noting their split from the Monday Club - hardly headline grabbing stuff.--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 15:47, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - doesn't seem like a notable group at all, despite the fact that the article tries to make them look very notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> If <i>The Independent</i>, <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Searchlight</i> magazine, in which there have all been non-trivial mentions linked in the article, are not reliable sources I'm not sure what are. As they are all linked in the article itself, and Ed Chilvers has previously been a collaborator with the leader of the CDA, <a href="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lvl9.org/article.htm" rel="nofollow">although this has fallen sour</a> I'm not sure why he is unaware of this fact.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The CDA is a prominent Conservative group which has overtaken the old Monday Club in trumpetting traditional Toryism. It is well known, a major irritant to Conservative Party "modernisers", and its Chairman often appears in media interviews. As User:JASpencer highlights, EdChilvers has been active since he arrived on Wiki in attacking the CDA's chairman and just about anyone else involved with them. Bad faith AfD?

<li><b>Comment</b> I am always willing to be proved wrong but from my POV the article in its current form simply does not match the WP criteria for inclusion. This is a political organisation we are talking about here and yet it reads like a Euology. If it is so influential where is the critisism? it strikes me that this article has been written by supporters of the CDA itself as a means of bigging itself up. The point I am basically trying to make here is that local 'Conservative Club' organisations dont get articles on Wiki and yet they seem far more influential on Tory policy than this bunch--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 23:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment</b></s><b>Keep</b> - this article needs to be completely rewritten, and fast. Ed Chilvers is right when he says <i>"the article in its current form simply does not match the WP criteria for inclusion"</i> and <i>"it reads like a euology"</i>. <s>If there is noone who comes forward and does so, I'd definitely vote <b>delete</b>.</s> There are clearly interested editors here willing to get involved - why don't they take a long hard look at the article, look at articles for comparable political organisations, and <b>get editing</b>? --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 23:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have become involved here in a roundabout way because I created a brief biographical entry for Mr Smith as a useful bridge between the significent libel decision of <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith-Smith_v_Williams_c783.html" title="Keith-Smith v Williams">Keith-Smith v Williams</a> and his political activities which, although they are diametrically opposed to my personal views, are of general interest and frequently featured in the leading anti-fascist journal <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight.html" title="Searchlight">Searchlight</a>. Mr Chilvers is actively seeking to have that biog deleted together with this linked article. In common with Mr Spencer I am concerned by the involvement of Mr Chilvers in this AfD. On his own admission he is a former friend and associate of Mr Smith who has since fallen out with him, and that raises the possibility of bad faith. Perhaps he would care to comment? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Loughton_c975.html" title="User:James Loughton">James Loughton</a> 13:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If we have an article on Smith and the CDA then we have to have one on Gregory Lauder-Frost. The reason we dont have one on Gregory Lauder-Frost is because it was deleted by Brad Patrick (head of Wiki legal) after Mr Lauder-Frost threatened legal action against myself and the Wikipedia foundation because he objected to certain aspects of his private life mentioned therein. I'm certainly not going to lose any sleep if the article stays but I do believe that an article on <i>any</i> political movement requires balance which at the moment this article does not have.--<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdchilvers_d93e.html" title="User:Edchilvers">Edchilvers</a> 17:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>As far as I can see, the facts he objected to being stated in the article <i>weren't</i> "aspects of his private life" - they weren't private in the least, and in fact were matters of public record. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 20:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's avoid personal spats, shall we? If EdChilvers and SandyDancer think the article needs editing there's nothing to stop them from editing it. One assumes that the previous editors are more-or-less happy with the content so demanding that they make unspecified alterations isn't really on.

<li>If you don't see a reason why this article would be deleted, how do you respond to the nominator's claims that this is a neologism (which we <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">tend to avoid unless they're proven widespread and well-known</a>)? And think of it this way - you wouldn't want people to learn terms that <i>no one uses</i>. Internet chat is internet chat. I don't know anyone who uses the term "MMOCC". Before you say "but they <i>should</i> be using the term", remember that it's not Wikipedia's mission to push new terms and new concepts either; the material has to be remarkable and widely known <i>before</i> getting here. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This information was very useful to me in finding teenage chat communities across the internet.

<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">Neologism</a>. The concept is interesting and remarkable (yes, graphical chat rooms with avatars exist and are popular); however, I have never ever heard the term "MMOCC" used anywhere to refer to this sort of chat places.

<li><b>Keep</b> - MMOCC shoud be kept as it is very resourcefull. If you go on sites such as;<a href="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/wowbb/" class="external text" title="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/wowbb/" rel="nofollow">WowWeb Designs</a>, or <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pixeljoint.com" rel="nofollow">Pixel joint</a>, and many other online community sites, the term <i>MMOCC' is used many a times. It is not simply trying to put the acronym 'MMOCC' out there, as it is already used, but for those people who do not knnow what an MMOCC is, the artical can be very usefull for finding that right online chat, or just research in general. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.211.163.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.211.163.13_7b37.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.211.163.13">contribs</a>).</small></i>

<li><b>Keep</b> - If this article goes, who's to say that the MMORPG article sholdn't go too? I'd never heard of the term 'MMORPG' until this year. What is your problem? This is a very informative article. I can think of loads of articles that shouldn't be on wikipedia, as they mean absolutely nothing. Why should Habbo Hotel stay on Wikipedia?

<li>We're <b>not</b>, I repeat, <b>not</b> discussing the deletion of <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo Hotel</a>, which is demonstrably a very notable chat/MMOG site. (Go Finland! Yay! =) What we have a beef is the term <b>MMOCC</b>, which <i>no one</i> seems to have used until very very recently. All the while the term "MMORPG" is <i>very</i> established, has been <a href="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?q=MMORPG&amp;hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Hae" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?q=MMORPG&amp;hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Hae" rel="nofollow">discussed in scholarly journals</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;q=Massive+Multiplayer+Online+Role-Playing+Game&amp;btnG=Hae" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;q=Massive+Multiplayer+Online+Role-Playing+Game&amp;btnG=Hae" rel="nofollow">of many sorts</a> (while <a href="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;q=MMOCC&amp;btnG=Hae" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.fi/scholar?hl=fi&amp;lr=&amp;q=MMOCC&amp;btnG=Hae" rel="nofollow">"MMOCC" only turns up completely unrelated hits</a>). Note this, however: "Habbo" is a <i>fictional</i> term. It refers to the <i>content</i> of the games. "MMOCC" is a "<i>real</i>" term used to describe a real-world construct. <i>That</i> makes it inappropriate unless it's actually famous. Wikipedia has a problem with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>; it's all good and appropriate that "<a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo.html" title="Habbo">Habbo</a>" is a redirect to <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo_Hotel_1ebf.html" title="Habbo Hotel">Habbo Hotel</a> because the <i>game itself</i> describes this fictional construct, and as such, we're not publishing new terms, just reporting on an <i>established term</i> that is used in Habbo Hotel. However, "MMOCC" label points to a real-world thing; what's the source for <i>that</i> term? How did it came to be? Who actually uses the term? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:41, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Who actually uses the term? Go check on habbo chat clients who uses it... Which at any given time usually has over 10,000 users logged in. Is this huge in comparison to myspace? No. Is it still in large use? Actually yes it is. Anyone who actually takes the time to play the game knows it as an mmocc. check. mate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.4.82.146_6571.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.4.82.146">24.4.82.146</a> (talk) 23:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li><i>I</i> call it a graphical chat with multiplayer game elements. Habbo.com <a href="http://www.habbo.com/newusers?partner=newus&amp;isp=newuserlnk2" class="external text" title="http://www.habbo.com/newusers?partner=newus&amp;isp=newuserlnk2" rel="nofollow">calls it</a> a "virtual community", and the term "MMOCC" isn't (according to Google) found on the website. I don't know what the <i>users</i> call it, but I'd wager few call it a "MMOCC". Like the nominator says, we're not concerned with what the players think the thing itself '<i>is</i>; we're more concerned with this question alone: <i>who calls it a "MMOCC"?</i><br />
If you want an easier, completely (yes, <i>completely</i>, without any sarcastic undertones - but hopefully strong enough to drive point across) rhetorical example: I could declare Habbo Hotel a WasteOfTime, and write a Wikipedia article about WastesOfTime similar to Habbo. (Remember, again, this is a <i>completely</i> rhetorical example. As an IRCer, I know that the only thing that deserves the name of "waste of time" is IRC. =) I could use a lot of fancy words that would define how WastesOfTime operate. Now, assume you have been a Habbo user - or just an ordinary MMOG user - all through its existence, and have <i>never</i> heard of Habbo referred to it as such. Wouldn't <i>you</i>, in that case, be terribly interested of who came up with this term "WasteOfTime", and who uses it in scholarly context, and is it truly as widespread as the few loud proponents claim? --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 01:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most are the same as Yeouinaru Station: 1 line with no other content (including pictures, while free, I also think do not provide value).

<li><b>Comment</b> I randomly found my way to <a href="../../../5/_/%28/5_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29_e640.html" title="5 (New York City Subway service)">5 (New York City Subway service)</a> which I would equate to an equal level as <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul_Subway_Line_5_13f0.html" title="Seoul Subway Line 5">Seoul Subway Line 5</a>, and looked at the station articles there. Of the random 5 I looked at, they included a link or two and most had more significant text than "This is a station on line X." There were some claims such as "will be rebuilt" and other items that should be sourced/referenced, which may be covered by the external link(s) on the articles. I don't think "racist" is a valuable label to be applied here. Regardless, I believe the most damaging argument for this is that even the Korean Wikipedia articles are small (as reported in the previous AFD mentioned above), which isn't what one would expect if these are of significant more value than an English language version. I listed them as AFDs because they are articles, someone has spent time in creating them with the templates/infoboxes, and I didn't know where else to list them, though perhaps I could have just said they should be deleted as the previous AFD I requested all related articles (ie, these mentioned above) to be included (but didn't list them, so perhaps some people didn't vote with that in mind or for due process matters, it makes sense to give each of these their own representation). --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 20:52, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, got to go with the eventualist position on subway stations. I read something about "reversing bad precedents" - making subway station articles open to a higher level of scrutiny is not a good idea. These particular articles contain templates and infoboxes which add decent context, particularly hangeul translations and surrounding stations (I was involved in that respect). If this is the way things are going, the battle against station articles could get bloody. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 21:30, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Part of the problem here is sourcing information that's mostly in the Korean language, deleting station articles solely based on lack of English and Latin character set references in a country that doesn't speak English natively nor normally uses Latin characters in its language is a symptom of <i>systemic bias</i>. Also, throwing difficult to source articles up for AfD is not a proper way to influence <i>guidelines</i> and de facto policy on subway stations, there's forums for discussing policies and guidelines.

<p>I prodded this, but the creator indicated a desire to remove the prod tag on the article's talk, so I'm switching to AFD. The dance hall is probably not notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> - non notable dance hall, and the article doesn't even assert notability. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayden54_117a.html" title="User:Jayden54">Jayden54</a> 20:09, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Cherry Springs Dance Hall is of cultural and historical significance to both the state of Texas, and to the history of country music and popular music. It has been a reknown Texas gathering spot for almost 120 years, having originated in the cattle drive years, and continuing through to the present day. It served as a 1950's incubator for the birthing of rock and roll, rockabilly, and the transitioning of country music from localized "hillbilly" interest to world-wide popularity. I do not believe my sources to be trivial, even if they are online links. Elvis Day By Day is the online version of a book meticulously researched and produced by Peter Guralnick, a well-respected music historian of the last few decades. Maile66</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - cites provided appear to demonstrate a case. An editor with more experience in local (or country) history could probably come up with even better ones. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 21:32, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Neutral</s></b> Article is in poor shape, but it seems the hall might be noteworthy, if <a href="http://www.honkytonktx.com/dancehalls/" class="external text" title="http://www.honkytonktx.com/dancehalls/" rel="nofollow">the Honky Tonk Texas site's</a> claims are accurate. However, I note Elvis Day By Day only mentions the hall in passing, and the second reference provided doesn't appear to mention it at all. I'm not comfortable&#160;!voting keep based on a single source. Would like to see at least one more significant mention from a reliable independent source. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 21:35, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, the new addition satisfies my concerns. (It'd be good if we could cite the book directly rather than the web excerpt, but that's just a minor detail.) <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 02:29, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Additional Source Added</b> - I'll admit I could use some guidance in as much as this is my first time putting up a page. But I did add a source link from a book Geronimo Trevino III’s <i>Dance Halls and Last Calls A History of Texas Country Music Dance Halls in Texas, 1800’s – Present day</i>. - Maile66 01:42, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's an interesting list with context for each entry, and as the individuals on it appear notable, and their notability has come from being involved in the events, or they are notable people who nearly died, it appears a legitimate topic to create a list from. Frankly it's an interesting sphere of human experience, and therefore likely to get people clicking. I didn't really fancy it when I first came upon it, but did a bit of work on it and feel it was significantly improved.

<dd><b>Comment</b> (general) I honestly don't see these as insurmountable questions, and many of the answers are self-evident. Famous can be changed to notable. Lydon and Slash were presumably famous before the cited events, and Lydon was not actually involved in the event. We can determine the reason someone became notable quite easily, as it will be evident on their article, as established by whatever facts and evidence have been submitted to comply with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The correlation of the event and fame is not an issue, as there are different sections. After means not before, ie not famous 1 second before the near-fatal event. The definition of near fatal is also pretty evident from the pages listed - either people died in the event (9/11, Titanic etc), or it was something a human could be reasonably expected to have died from (falling 33000 feet to the ground, accidentally going over Niagara Falls). I think this page is fairly easy to maintain. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 01:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article lacks any first party sources and the two sources it does have indicate that Guitar Hero <i>II</i> will be going multiplatform and that <s>Guitar Hero III</s> more Harmonix games will be made eventually. The information on the article itself is pure speculation and contains no factual data regarding the potential game itself. There is quite literally no information about the game aside from a VERY vague release date as reported by a third party. While I personally believe there'll probably be a Guitar Hero III, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> demands that we not treat Wikipedia as a Crystal Ball. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 19:30, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is a reliable source citing a release date. If we delete the article now someone will just re-create it. The series is popular enough that the article name should at least be redirected if not preserved. There have been several speculative edits. I would suggest keeping the page, but protecting it until there is more public information available. - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickSentowski_243d.html" title="User:NickSentowski">NickSentowski</a> 19:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps a redirect to Guitar Hero would be sufficient until confirmed, verifiable information has been released? Currently the article is a collection of factoids and common knowledge and while Activision is PLANNING to release more Guitar Hero sequels there's been indications that future Harmonix releases might not be rock-related... I doubt they'd release a Country-themed guitar game as a core-series sequel, for example. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 20:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Lets be realistic about this, and like Nick said, if we simply delete the article it will probably be remade. We really dont need this article though in my opinion, maybe just a short paragraph in the Guitar Hero II article. Cablebfg 21:19, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/03/06/a-whole-range-of-guitar-heroes-to-be-available/" class="external text" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/03/06/a-whole-range-of-guitar-heroes-to-be-available/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article shows, there's a vast difference between another game being made which uses the Gibson SG Controller released by Red Octane and a true sequel to Guitar Hero II. Harmonix could choose to start releasing the game with subtitles instead of numbers (like Guitar Hero: Metal or Guitar Hero: Country) as the GTA series did with Vice City and San Andreas, they could start to release the games under different "Hero" brands (like Country Hero or Metal Hero) or any other number of naming conventions. Right now there's zero indication that ANY of the proposed additions to the Harmonix lineup will actually be Guitar Hero III. It's PROBABLE that one of the games will be Guitar Hero III but it's not VERIFIABLE. Right now the only information the article contains is information that more games from Harmonix will be produced by the end of next year AND that Guitar Hero <b>II</b> will be going multi-platform. There is zero ACTUAL information about GHIII. I could just as easily make an article about Final Fantasy XIV with just as much information as the GHIII article has. It'll probably be made eventually and we can bet there'll be a dude named Cid in it, but that's speculation. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 15:18, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Trivial list; one of hundreds which can possibly be derived from boxofficemojo.com. Nonetheless, this is no more notable than a List of top-grossing films shot with Arri cameras or List of top-grossing films shot with Cooke lenses. Super 35 is not a significant correlative factor to box office gross. While it is interesting that more recent films are using the format, it ultimately is a foregone conclusion of the fact that it is a newer technique, it can allow for cost-savings compared to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anamorphic.html" title="Anamorphic">anamorphic</a> format, it uses smaller, faster, and higher quality lenses, and the development of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_intermediate.html" title="Digital intermediate">digital intermediate</a> as a method to avoid the compromises of an optical intermediate step. While one can form box office lists based on numerous variables, it ultimately comes down to trivia in all but a few more general cases (top opening weekends, top of all time, top by nation or time period). Wikipedia is not boxofficemojo.com - ie a film earnings database. (I must also confess that I find all this slobbering over box office numbers rather silly to begin with. If I'm not seeing any of that money, why should I care?&#160;;) Probably a symptom of the fact that we're more interested in how the films are made now than what they are about.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yahoo and Google's ratings should count for <i>nothing,</i> I've already stated that on the discussion page for this article and explained why. Yahoo's so-called "popularity" rankings are useless, since we don't know how exactly they rate them and it isn't necessarily even based on popularity: "Sites that are most popular with users <i>or the most relevant to the category</i> appear at the top of the site listings" (emphasis added) <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/dir/basics/basics-21.html" class="external free" title="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/dir/basics/basics-21.html" rel="nofollow">http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/dir/basics/basics-21.html</a> See also <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/technology/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/technology/index.html</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 14:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is hardly a fair comparison.A minor figure is not analog to a religious denomination, maybe DC comics would be analogous to Shi'a Islam. Does any of the Harley_Quinn sites have a Google page rank of 8? A google page rank of 8 says a lot, consider that <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Computers/Open_Source/Open_Content/Encyclopedias/Wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/Top/Computers/Open_Source/Open_Content/Encyclopedias/Wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">wikipedia itself has that page rank</a> - so please give a equivalent comparison, a character top-ten list and a world-religion denomination top-ten list are not comparable. The smaller the subject the fewer sites and the more non-notable the site will be, obviously, hence the injustice in the comparison. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 02:12, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

That is the crux of your argument about <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-islam.org.html" title="Al-islam.org">Al-islam.org</a>. And I agree with <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">User:Schizombie</a> that <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageRank_8fe1.html" title="PageRank">PageRank</a> does not satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for claims of "importance", "popularity", or whatever you want to call it. But allowing it for one means allowing it for all, and what one editor called a "floodgate", I would have called a "slippery slope", which my example demonstrates.</dd>

<dd>And the example is a <i>perfectly</i> fair one, because "(a) the notability of the subject of the website (i.e., <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Quinn_f479.html" title="Harley Quinn">Harley Quinn</a>) has already been established by the fact of having a Wikipedia article, (b) it is "notable" enough that all three <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_directories.html" title="Web directories">web directories</a> have a category for the same "minor character", (c) it is either the <i>highest ranked</i> or is among the top three highest ranked on <i>all three</i> of the most respected web directories, ergo, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines should be ignored." ... that is <b>exactly</b> the same as <i>your</i> argument, just substitute "Al-islam.org" and "Shi'a" for "harley-quinn.com" and "Harley Quinn". --72.75.72.174 05:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey I am the creator of Messed Up and I did not make this article I simply edited it. Me and the author of this article have spoken on msn and we don’t understand this whole Notability thing can you be a bit more specific please?? and we will fix the article as soon as we understand. Oh and just because my comic hasn't been going very long doesn't mean you should delete it. Does it?<br />
P.s. This article isn't finished yet there is still alot to do so don’t assume its crap and try to delete it. In future if I make another article I will finish it before I post it so it doesn't get deleted for not having the right stuff. Josifman 00:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Probably the best thing to do is first, read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> to review the actual notability guidelines. Also, I'd suggest reading <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Webcomics</a> and you could also read and ask for advice on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_a69b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Webcomics">the project talk page</a>. I think there is a list of the webcomics in the encyclopedia. I <i>do not</i> suggest picking a random webcomic article and using that as a model, since several of the other articles I looked at didn't seem to be well-sourced, but maybe look at the articles that survived deletion, I think there are links to the previous deletion discussions there, and see how they demonstrated notability. I also didn't know until I read the page that there is another wiki project called Comixpedia, so maybe this article would be acceptable there. - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 00:48, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I think you are right. When I first read the article I had the impression that it was a theory popular in the 60's that now has been rejected by most of the scientific establishment. However, now I see that it is just a neo-ehter theory that has virtually remained unchanged (in theory and popularity) in recent decades. As such, it probably has no notability whatsoever. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 15:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Publication in 1965 which cites and references various notable works of that time seems like ample historical notability to me. Gseletko 03:13, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is one of who cites the theory, not who the theory cites. Any fool can hang onto another's coattails. Notable theories have (or have had) prominent researchers paying attention to them, not the other way around. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article has been revised to suit the wiki guidelines more accurately. The notability of the theory is provided within the references in the form of two separate works on the subject by experts in the field.

<li>Following is the current criteria for fields of science as described at <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCIENCE_b9f8.html" title="WP:SCIENCE">WP:SCIENCE</a>. I've answered each point as it applies to the article for Sorce Theory.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In general, an item in the field of science is probably notable enough to merit an article on Wikipedia if it meets at least <b>one</b> of the following criteria:
<dl>
<dd>1. It is part of the corpus of generally accepted scientific knowledge.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. It is considered a possible explanation by a part of the scientific community independent of its creator.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - At the very least the authors of the publications which are provided in the references. These are all separate individuals. Further members of the scientific community that consider this as a possible explanation can be found at the various forums where this topic is discussed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. It is advocated by at least one researcher who is prominent in the relevant field. <b>(Yes)</b> - The creator of the theory is at least one researcher who is prominent in the relevant field.</dd>
<dd>4. It is represented by a number of peer-reviewed papers, and is the work of several, not just one researcher
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - Again, the publications that can be found in the reference section of the Sorce Theory article, are peer-reviewed papers and as such, they can collectively be seen as evidence of the work of 'several' researchers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>5. It is supported or examined by major scientific institutions, such as by funding, sponsoring seminars, or invited presentations.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Not sure)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>6. It is previously thought of as correct or plausible, or is otherwise of historical interest.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - I can only speak for myself when I say that I certainly find it interesting and am of the opinion that it is valuable information to have on the Wikipedia, as such I don't see why other people would not also find it interesting. As for historical interest: It is a valid scientific theory first published in 1965... I don't know what more need be said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>7. It is advocated by a prominent persons or for political or religious reasons, or is a tenet of a notable religion or political philosophy, or is part of a notable cultural tradition or folklore.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>8. It is well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being found within a notable work of fiction.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>9. It is believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>10. It is notable because there is strong criticism from the scientific community.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - The theory recieves constant criticism whenever it is brought up in the scientific community. This can be witnessed from following the various forums that the topic is discussed in where the individuals discussing the matter are also members of the scientific community. <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html?main=/mindx/show_thread.php?rootID%3D13620" class="external text" title="http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html?main=/mindx/show_thread.php?rootID%3D13620" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is just ONE example.</dd>

<li>Also from <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCIENCE_b9f8.html" title="WP:SCIENCE">WP:SCIENCE</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Theories are causal models that try to explain how the world works. For a scientific theory to be considered notable, it should fulfill at least <b>one</b> of the following criteria:
<dl>
<dd>1. It has been included in general or specialized textbooks.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - Definition of a Textbook: "a book used in teaching, giving the main facts about a subject". All three publications in the reference section meet this definition, and each of those is full of notable citations and references.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. It has been widely cited in its research area relative to other publications in the same area. Self-citations and citations in non-peer-reviewed journals should be excluded. Inclusion in a peer-reviewed publication, especially in a respected journal with a reputation for rigorous inclusion standards and high impact, is an additional factor to be considered but not by itself a necessary or sufficient criterion.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Yes)</b> - It has been widely cited in its research area relative to other publications in the same area.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. The creators have received a major scientific award, such as the Nobel Prize or Fields Medal, for it. "Best paper" or "best conference presentation award" are rarely ever considered major.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Not sure)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>4. The scientific merit of the theory is disputed in, or rejected by, the scientific community, but it has received significant attention in political circles and ongoing coverage in the popular media. In this case the article should make note of this status.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>5. The theory or model historically met any of the above criteria but has since been superseded by an alternative theory, or it has been used as an example in a notable account on the history of science. In this case the article should make note of this status.
<dl>
<dd><b>(No)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>6. The theory has been the primary topic of a conference with notable participants.
<dl>
<dd><b>(Not sure)</b> - But I'm working on this one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From the points above it seems clear to me that Sorce Theory more then meets the minimum requirements for notability of a wiki article and as such should not be deleted.</dd>
<dd>The article has also been revised to fit with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">"Neutral point of view"</a> policy and as such should not be deleted.</dd>
<dd>I believe that the revised article has also resolved the implication of not following the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">"No original research"</a> policy and as such should not be deleted.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> in reposnse to Gseletko: With regards to <a href="../../../s/c/i/WP%7ESCIENCE_b9f8.html" title="WP:SCIENCE">WP:SCIENCE</a>:
<ol>
<li>This is a proposed policy/quideline. As such, it it less than authoritative.</li>
<li>This proposal is curently undergoing masive change. At the time of this writing, the 10 standards for inclusion have been reduced to 7, and the wording in the ones not removed tightenned up so as to make inclusion of theories like this one harder to achieve. (It would not surprise me to find that Gseletko's posting above is in fact responsible for these edits.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It also seems to me that Gseletko is treating sorce theory as its own "relevant field". For exmaple: It has never been considered to be likely true by the overall scientific community at any time since its inception, and yet Gseletko is claiming that is passes muster in regard to this standard (which admitedly as written did not include the "overall scientific community" clause, but that is obviously what is meant). Another example is treating its creator as being prominent in the "relevant field". IMO, the relevant fields are theoretical physics, particle physics, and relativity (or spacetime physics). Sorce theory lack prominence in all of these fields. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:05, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Marsden is notable, and the so-called "attacks" actually concern verifiable information that has been published in several reliable sources. The recent ArbComm ruling on this article does not prevent material critical of Marsden from being included, notwithstanding that certain contributors oppose such inclusion. (For more information, review the Request for clarification <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=91922080" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=91922080" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 20:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. There have been two other AFDs for this article, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rachel_Marsden_55e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Marsden">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rachel_Marsden</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rachel_Marsden_%282nd_nomination%29_e7f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rachel Marsden (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rachel_Marsden_(2nd_nomination)</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no way in which this page is an attack site, and I would seriously question the motivation of the editor who labelled it as such. The previous AfDs have no relevance: we are considering the article as it stands. And I see it as a simple, straightforward biographical article about a marginally notable columnist. I note that the subject of the article objected to a previous version of it: this, as I say, past history and the current version is surely ok.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 22:16, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and investigate initiator</b> This article has been put up for AfD twice before, both by accounts later blocked for being sockpuppets of the same person. Combined with rather inflammatory reason for deletion, "attack page", would lead me to wonder if this account will be proven to be the same as well. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirFozzie_a2f2.html" title="User:SirFozzie">SirFozzie</a> 22:39, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Attack page is the term used by the Arbitration Committee, which also said better no article than an attack article. This article was shaping up into another attack article, and the recently-archived discussion shows this to be the case. If this article is not deleted, it should be stubbed. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStompin%27_Tom_a049.html" title="User:Stompin' Tom">Stompin' Tom</a></li>

<p><b>Delete</b> I say delete the article. I created it because it was hilarious to me. The full record of his deeds exist on www.attrition.org and google anyways. I think it's very fitting that this entry get deleted because it says not only did he ruin his life due to stupidity but that he's unimportant enough to not even spend 30k of disk memory on.

<dd>Yes. While chasing google links shows him as an Essex County cricketer, there is clear evidence of tampering with the Google data and a merging with him of data from Devon Malcolm.

<li>The article does not make a proposal of any kind political or otherwise, nor does it ask for money. This article was meant to share what this educational program does, and who it is for, as it reaches communities far outside Hawaii. The word initiative is part of the name of the organization that the artical is named after. It does not hold any other meaning. This is my first article that I've posted, so I am not sure why it poses a problem, please expand on concerns, thanks.--Mkmendes 22:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, that is quite the <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">walled garden</a>. The articles on individual presenters should be <b>deleted</b> for a start, none of them assert any kind of notability beyond presenting a TV program. The articles on the TV programs themselves are borderline blatant advertising with lines such as <i>"It is a great way for viewers to unwind and get deep sense of peace that comes from the comforting verses of the Scriptures."</i>. So either <b>delete</b> or <b>redirect</b> to Kingdom of Jesus Christ: The Name Above Every Name (although the latter article has been prodded since the 24th). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 23:41, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>non-notable actor. All roles mentioned are trivial at best, and neither google nor IMDB believe he appeared in them - at the very least his appearances are not enough to earn a credit for it. Closest claim to fame is as a minor presenter on a French tv show "Le Set". Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Contested speedy and prod. Creator and I have discussed this a bit at Talk:Raphaël Pathé.

<b><i>It seems the only source of informations the person who's requesting deletion uses is the WEB.</i></b> A lot of information are not on the net yet , I believe that this is the whole point of Wikipedia&#160;: many things do happen out of the web, like at the theatre, in art galeries and museums like video art movies, magazines, Wikipedia was created to use the net in order to provide informations to net users on different subjects.</p>
<p>In the case of</p>
<p>Raphaël W.Pathé&#160;:</p>
<p>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1 This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2</p>
<p>The above is the central criteria for inclusion , according to the Bio Wiki rules.</p>
<p>The person who requests deletion was vandalised 17 times, maybe in this case this person should be a little more flexible, it appears that 17 other people have disagreeing with this person's statements.</p>
<p>Pink TV was the first Gay TV channel in Europe, people have been talking about it even in the US, everyone was talking about it in France, because it helped gay people to find their identity on TV after years of beein laughed at, and after beeing rejected always.</p>
<p>Raphaël W.Pathé helped a lot on the 2 years developping the Channel and then on the promotion of it. Every TV presenter of Pink TV are on WIKI, why removing one of them while keeping others&#160;?</p>
<p>Same rules shoulds apply to everyone shouldn't they&#160;? XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked&#160;!</p>
<p>Regarding the IMDB sources, people should know that submitting a movie takes ages, it could take up to a year&#160;: Hillary Lloyds movies aren't on it yet because they are so busy with the work that they did not even reviewed it yet, but I am sure it will be soon. What really matters is that these movies did feature Raphaël W.Pathé as an actor, and that these movies have been shown to an audiance , movies had international press articles in notable British art magazines, it doesn't matter how long it takes for Google or Imdb to add the movie in the database.</p>
<p>For instance, a very famous actress like Romy Shneider does not even have a picture on IMDB... this proves what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Please be fair and stop the deletion process now.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please do not remove my comments as part of your edits, though the one you did remove I would not consider vandalism. To respond to your arguments, I first suggest that you read <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">No personal attacks</a>. And no, it is not a personal thing. I am not convinced that this individual satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I have yet to encounter any evidence otherwise. Particularly, there is no evidence that he has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works. The notability of PinkTV is irrelevent as I have not nominated it for deletion. The notability of Raphael Pathe is in question, and he needs to be able to stand on his own merit. Also, the "if you delete this article then you must delete all others" is not a strong argument. It merely suggests that there are other articles that require the attention of an AfD debate. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:28, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>More important question is what knowledge in term of famous TV personalities do you have&#160;? Are you personaly involved with the TV world&#160;? Do you work with IMDB&#160;? In what field do you usually work&#160;? have you ever personnaly watched TV channels where Raphaël W.Pathé appeared as a TV presenter&#160;? Did you ever watch the movies mentioned in the article about Raphaäl W.Pathé&#160;?</p>
<p>Also, the "if you delete this article then you must delete all others" is not a strong argument&#160;:</p>
<p>it is a strong argument&#160;: it means that if people whom only notability includes working a TV presenter on PINK TV are judged suitable for featuring on WIKI therefore, Raphaël W.Pathé who did not only worked as a TV presenter on Pink TV but also appeared on many other medias such as press and cinema has to feature on WIKI too.</p>
<p>If Raphaël W.Pathé does not feature on WIkipedia, it means the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> means absolutely nothing and that the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is only used in an arbitrary fashion. This would make WIKI a very unreliable source of information to the people don't you think&#160;?</p>
<p>I am not convinced that this individual satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I have yet to encounter any evidence otherwise&#160;: this person should definately checked the links provided on the article page, but apparently this person has decided not to.. I really wonder why... this is crazy... to be fighting over nothing in the end.</p>
<p>Raphaël W.Pathé is known to the public, this is a fact , accept it or not&#160;! And again&#160;: XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked&#160;!</p>
<p>So if you don't like gay people or something, just say it, and we'll start a discussion on your talk page about homophobia, what do you think&#160;?</p>

<p>I personnaly bought magazines featuring Raphaël W.Pathé in the UK, but I don't know how to publish these pages on my WIKI page since i don't own these pages and these pictures, they come from the press, do I need to send these to the WIKI administrator via email&#160;? Same with the copies of movies Raphaël W.Pathé appears&#160;? This is possible and if it was possible to add video on wiki pages, I could add Raphaël W.Pathé's videos so everyone could see&#160;!</p>
<p>So if anyone tells me how to publish on the page the press articles and pictures that are evidence of his work, please let me know how to do it, then nobody will be able to say anything.</p>
<p>The Youtube section features a video of Raphaël W.Pathé presenting TV shows in French and English and featuring in a music video.</p>
<p>And in the end, Raphaël W.Pathé is on the imdb so he should be on the WIKI, this is a fact.</p>

(<a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_6ec5.html" title="Wikipedia:Please sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a> with four tildes.) I understand that it is possible that someone has been covered in print media that does not have a web presence, but it is very rare for a currently notable person to be notable without having that reflected on the web somewhere. In the end, if they are notable, that proof of notability will appear eventually and then you can always appeal for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> to restore the article. For the time, I don't find evidence of notability. On this basic point, despite your protests, I think relying on web results is sufficient. Do note that IMDB's open submission policies mean that it is not a reliable indicator of notability. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:30, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>But IMDB added Raphaël W.Pathé on the web, he did not ask for it&#160;: they added him because they thought it was needed. He isn't famous like Madonna for instance, but was Madonna so famous at first&#160;? And now, would you consider Wiki without an article about Madonna&#160;?</p>
<p>I am shocked to see that everyone from Pink TV was added and that Raphaël W.Pathé who's on TV on a regular basis and who's family created the cinema and the music industry cannot be added in the Wiki.... this isn't fair, apparently some people decide who's notable and who's not...</p>
<p>At least leave the picture and the Pink TV section, the picture has boon published already in different medias ( i own the rights no it) , be fair&#160;: everyone agrees about this notability.</p>
<p>This would be fair, at least&#160;! And this whole conversation would have a meaning, for you all and for me.</p>
<p>thank you very much indeed for your undertstanding.</p>

<dd>My sister has an IMDb entry and she merely works set deck on movies and television shows. There is a reason why it is not considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Doubly so given you have already protested how unreliable IMDb is. I would also suggest that you are in a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> based on your recent comments. The decision on who is notable is based on established policy and guidelines. Specifically <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. This is why I nominated the article for deletion. It really does not appear that this individual has done much to be notable independent of his family at this point of his career. That, of course, is not to suggest that he wont at some point in the future. If he does, his article should return then.

<p>Please remember that this talk page is not a place to talk about family and sisters....</p>
<p>Anyway, I have checked your profile, you don't seem to know a lot about Television and Cinema anyway, I don't think you are able to decide or not if the Raphaël W.Pathé's is notable or not, you don't even speak French how could you have had access to articles about him in France... According to your fields of knowledge, I see in my crystal ball that you are a TOOSHBIZ totally out of showbiz and that you deal better with so called by you "notable" political figures. Remember XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked&#160;!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Nektaartv, I believe Resolute was using his sister as an example of why IMDb is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, which makes it quite relevant. I also suggest that you avoid stating that other people are not sufficiently qualified to discuss articles on AfD; Wikipedia's policies/guidelines are rather universal and are applied to all sorts of fields. The same biographical guidelines for notability apply to people whether they be actors, political figures, or mathematicians. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 04:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe the relevant source that can determine someone's notability are the audiance who watched the TV shows. And I agree yes, the same biographical guidelines for notability apply to people whether they be actors, political figures, or mathematics....here this doesn't seem to apply unfortunately.</p>
<p>Raphaël W.pathé does have a page on Wiki France, every one is fine about it, why is it such a problem on English Wiki&#160;? Someone has to expalin&#160;? are the notability policies different on Wiki English&#160;?</p>

<p>Raphaël W.pathé does have a page on Wiki France, every one is fine about it, why is it such a problem on English Wiki&#160;? Someone has to expalin&#160;? are the notability policies different on Wiki English&#160;?</p>
<p>Raphaël W.Pathé&#160;:</p>
<p>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.1 This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2</p>
<p>The above is the central criteria for inclusion , according to the Bio Wiki rules.</p>
<p>The person who requests deletion was vandalised 17 times, maybe in this case this person should be a little more flexible, it appears that 17 other people have disagreeing with this person's statements.</p>
<p>Pink TV was the first Gay TV channel in Europe, people have been talking about it even in the US, everyone was talking about it in France, because it helped gay people to find their identity on TV after years of beein laughed at, and after beeing rejected always.</p>
<p>Raphaël W.Pathé helped a lot on the 2 years developping the Channel and then on the promotion of it. Every TV presenter of Pink TV are on WIKI, why removing one of them while keeping others&#160;?</p>
<p>Same rules shoulds apply to everyone shouldn't they&#160;? XfD (deletion) processes are not a way to complain or remove material that is personally disliked&#160;!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In the end to be quite honest, I cannot even believe we are discussing this page&#160;! Why do people spend so much energy just to destroy a page like this&#160;! This is crazy&#160;! Just by jaleousy&#160;! If Charles pathé was still alive, he would be mad with the whole thing&#160;! The Pathé family is notable, including anyone who holds the Pathé name and this is it, like Paris' Hilton is famous because 1 she comes from the Hilton family and 2 , because she too advantage of it by doing TV programs like simple life.</p>
<p>If people are upset because they do not have a name... this is one thing. Raphaël W.Pathé was already know in Paris anyway because of the name, and now he's known because of the movies Felix and Frederic and Slip Disco&#160;: he stared in it, the movies are made by artist Hilary Lloyds who's well known in England in art video and he's the main actor in these movies.</p>
<p>You know in the end, I am just bored of the whole thing, I am just thinking of copying and pasting this discussion and make an article about "how easy it is to make a page about some stupid soccer match in Canada, and how difficult it is to add a TV presenter Biography's of a TV host just because he worked on gay TV&#160;!</p>
<p>I don't even know who will decide in the end, but meanwhile I am copying all this converstion, becaue this is outrageaous really&#160;!</p>

<dd>Please calm down. First, there is no provision in Wikipedia policy for limiting who can express an opinion on an article's deletion. We are a general-interest encyclopedia, so the general readership is entitled to guide what content is appropriate. We're sorry that our policies do not extend to allowing people to have articles on them just because they do good things or the editors worked hard on them. There simply aren't any reliable sources that have been presented that show that M. Pathé/Wolff meets our guidelines for notability. That's all this is about. Please don't go looking for other motives, it is a violation of our <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good-faith assumption</a> rule. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 12:03, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This isn't a merge discussion, this is a deletion discussion. At no point did I propose the article be merged.

<p>Still i believe nobody really showed convincing arguments about Raphaël W.Pathé's article deletion. There is no real reason for the article to be removed. It should stay expecially since the whole world has had proof that Raphaël W.Pathé has been a TV presenter on Pink TV and had press articles making him notable as a TV presenter and expecially since his family brought everything to the movie industry. He's had pictures in the magazine, was featured in videoclips and movies, now maybe you don't wanna see the truth, but this is it&#160;!It's got to stay&#160;!</p>
