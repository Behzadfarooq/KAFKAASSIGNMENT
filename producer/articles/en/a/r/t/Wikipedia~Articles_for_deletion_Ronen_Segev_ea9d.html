<li><b>Delete</b> - other than the silly harassment of this poor guy by Priceline, he seems otherwise not particularly notable.

<li>I think it's a clear <b>keep</b> but a minor incident with some company is not worth noting in a serious biographical article, and doing so by the backdoor by linking to an article that is about that and incidentally mentions him is unacceptable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Jimbo's opinion notwithstanding (incidentally, I agree with him when he removed some items of tabloid interest from the article), this does seem like a notable pianist and performer with performances in several locations. I think the New York Times coverage is not trivial, and the other media mentions mean that the person passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Harassment/legal; This Afd was created by either a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sgroos" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sgroos" rel="nofollow">meat/sock</a> of <i>someone</i>, perhaps the subject or Reputation Defender. There has been no harassment of anything or anyone in here, and this appears to be a nom being supported tied into the fact he yelled at someone at the Foundation. We routinely put in comments about "issues" with people on articles, but we do censor them out if the person happens to yell at someone over the phone at WMF about it? If so are we going to whitewash?

<li><b>Delete</b> After long deliberation, I can only come to this conclusion. The only reason this person is notable is over the PriceLine incident, which isn't all that notable to begin with. On top of that, there are not enough <i>non-trivial published works</i> to convince me that he passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Musicians are a dime a dozen, and they are bound to have at least a handful of <i>non-trivial published works</i> throughout their career.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm leaning towards <i>strong keep</i>, actually. There may in the past have been content added which stepped on the toes of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, but looking at the article at this minute, all that's there is a brief bio which indisputably asserts his <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENote_4dcf.html" title="WP:Note">notability</a> through <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D71339F934A3575AC0A9679C8B63" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D71339F934A3575AC0A9679C8B63" rel="nofollow">this cited source</a>.
