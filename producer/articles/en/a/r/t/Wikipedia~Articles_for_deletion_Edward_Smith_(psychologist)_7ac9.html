<p>Since Novemeber of last year on Talk:Edward Smith (psychologist) we have been trying to figure out if this person actually exists, what his academic credentials really are, etc. Is he a hoax?

<dd>Changing to <b>Delete.</b> Do deletion discussions ever get anywhere? Evidentally. I am changing my opinion.

<li>Even if he is the same guy, what makes him more notable than any other professor?

Ifnord 22:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps we should delay deletion until a consensus emerges? I think it is certainly the case that a claim of notability is made in the article. According to the article, Edward Smith created a new field of psychology (so-called "abstract spatial psychology"). I know nothing of the field, but this is certainly a <i>claim</i> of notability (whether true or not, I can not judge). I think we should avoid the "let's delete it until we know more" approach. This article is about a real person with verifiable contributions to the academic literature. Lacking a criteria of notability for those contributions, it seems premature to delete. To delete until a consensus on deletion emerges is to <i>de facto</i> enforce a policy for which there is no agreement. The article can always be deleted later, but not so easily is it recreated. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 23:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is my view, as I note on the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_Academics_ec11.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Academics">Academic notability talk page</a>, that full professor rank is <i>a priori</i> sufficient notability for inclusion, so I do not agree with that assertion.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychologist_e8af.html" title="American Psychologist">American Psychologist</a> (1998 Apr Vol 53(4) 368-370) has a note about an "Edward Smith" recieving an award "For his outstanding and diverse contributions to the study of cognition, including word perception, semantic memory, concept use, and reasoning." As I noted, I don't think the article is well written. I don't know if this is the same Edward Smith as in the article. I don't even know (and in fact, I suspect not) that he is the same as Edward W.L. Smith, since the citations in the American Psychologist article are to an E.E. Smith. A poorly written article, however, is no reason to delete. I think rewrite is needed, maybe a quality or dispute tag, but not deletion. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 03:44, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> For me, notability and quality aren't issues: it's the complete unreliability of the article as an information source.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have verified the scientific findings of Edward Smith (such as the correlations of abstract spatial psychology) via observation and experimentation. I too am bothered by the fact that Edward Smith's exact identity and educational certificates are uncertain, and that his work has not been published in any major scientific journal, but the fact remains that his contributions are major and scientifically verifiable, not even mentioning the catalog of correctable omnipresent human flaws, which is not even a scientific thesis, but simply a readily-observable large contribution to society. I know, I know, we would all like to believe that all people that make major contributions to society, especially in scientific advancement, must meet those social prerequisites. We would also like to believe that everything that is abstract and/or humbling is b---s---. I too feel the temptation to suppress this article for those reasons, and to word that reasoning as you have -but come on, we're supposed to be responsible adults here, not like children in an unsupervised candy shop. I know it's hard though, despite being comical when viewed from the outside or in retrospect. Besides, wikipedia also has an NPOV policy. We shouldn't be selectively deleting information just because it goes against beliefs that we hold dear. IrreversibleKnowledge 04:02, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We are not deleting the article because it goes against our beliefs. In fact, I don't even remember what Edward Smith is supposed to have said now. Our concern here is notability, not importance. Different things. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 04:29, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Come on, Joao, don't misrepresent what I said. I don't like to admit it either. To reiterate, for the sake of clarity, I am not referring so much to the specific findings of Edward Smith as going against our beliefs, but more so, the way that we want to delete this article because the fact that he has made major contributions is evidence against our belief that 'in order for a person to make large contributions to society, and especially scientific advancement, they must have certain social prerequisites, namely having been published in major scientific journal(s), having gone through the official educational system, and/or having a certain identity'. IrreversibleKnowledge 13:44, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am quite confused. Can you enlighten us as to whom the article refers to? If this is an unpublished Edward Smith, he is clearly not notable. If you know what material the Edward Smith of the article has produced (in a professional publication sense), by all means, please note it. I don't think Wikipedia is the place for a person's work which has never seen the rigors of professional scrutiny. Moreover, I do not think "scientifically verifiable," in the sense that such discoveries could be independenly reproduced by readers, is a good standard for Wikipedia (to say nothing of trying to "verify" the material based on such a short discussion, no lab report, etc.). Such a standard would invite all manner of crackpot. If you have information about who is Edward Smith, please let us know. I maintain my position to keep the article, as I noted above, as long as the aricle refers to someone with academic credentials. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 18:03, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know what Edward Smith's academic credentials are and aren't, so if you intend to delete all articles about people that lack credentials, then you may as well delete this article. However, that is not an honest policy, as we both know. I can see clearly from your sentences that you strongly adhere to the belief that 'in order for a person to make large contributions to society, and especially scientific advancement, they must have certain social prerequisites, namely having been published in major scientific journal(s), having gone through the official educational system, and/or having a certain identity, and anyone that lacks those social prerequisites that claims to have made such contributions is a crackpot'. I too am tempted to believe that. I know the feeling. It is a pleasurable crude forceful feeling of disrupting fine subtlety, in this case, the value of people that lack those social prerequisites, as such people are perceived as having the abstract property of subtlety, just as children and animals are. This is precisely one of the things that Edward Smith has discovered, so you have inadvertantly supported his findings with your very reply. However, I am responsible enough to resist that temptation so as not to make this encyclopedia biased. Anyway, it is clear that we will not resolve this dispute with personal discussion, and this dispute involves more general policy principles, so this is a matter for an RfC. IrreversibleKnowledge 21:40, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, I didn't intend to misrepresent what you said. But I'm affraid you don't understand the situation here. You claimed that you had reproduced and validated Smith's experiments, but this is not the point. His experiments may have arrived at true conclusions, but they are not notable yet. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 20:12, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bring one if you want, but it'll probably go straight in the bin because it's based on a complete misunderstanding of Wikipedia policies.

<li>I have followed your link to the cubicism / time cube page. Cubicism isn't even a real belief; it is a hoax that was created for the sake of creating an extremely ridiculous belief. So basicly you are discreditting Edward Smith's analytical works by comparing them to a belief of pure absurdity, in gross violation of the policy <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, due to your lack of any honest argument against them. I too am tempted by a crude forceful emotion to disrupt the fine subtle truth of abstract concepts by comparing them with pseudoscience. I however, am responsible enough to resist that temptation for the purpose of creating an unbiased encyclopedia. IrreversibleKnowledge 15:17, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I made no claims whatsoever as to the validity of Gene Ray's research, or Edward Smith's research, only noting that they were similar in the way that they read (and note that I said it was a "[f]un read"). I did not denigrate either source, I merely noted similarities. If Edward Smith and Gene Ray were equally sourced, and cited, and discussed, and verifiable, then I would put them on the same level of notability, regardless of whether or not some other people viewed their works as... how did you put it? "[P]ure absurdity", "pseudoscience" or an "extremely ridiculous belief", to use your own words. Lets be civil <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> to both Ray, and Smith. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 16:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So now you are falsely portraying me as being uncivil toward the very person that I am defending, and you have also falsely portrayed me as being uncivil toward some remote person, when you are well aware of the fact that I would not have described time cubism in that way unless I believed that that description was the consensus to begin with (and therefore not meant as uncivil persuassion). About 99.9 percent of people, including yourself I'm sure, would agree with me about time cubism. Besides, Gene Ray wouldn't mind, because his belief is a hoax. Lying, and especially lying about the policy violations of others, is a gross violation of the policy <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> . Don't do it. This is your second violation, Ronabop. I have already warned you not to violate the civility policy. IrreversibleKnowledge 14:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article makes extravagant claims for an author who appears to have only two published articles. "Abstract spatial psychology" is a non-noteworthy field. Basic biographical information is lacking. The page's advocates are unable or unwilling to raise it to encyclopedic standards. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 08:53, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It is interesting to note that this is for the most part a rehash of an old debate: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Justice_maximism_2d07.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Justice maximism">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Justice_maximism</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardSmith_b684.html" title="User talk:EdwardSmith">User_talk:EdwardSmith</a>. All of the 'research' relating to this page is unreferenced and seems fairly non-notable. I also object to the title of the page as "Edward Smith (psychologist)". He may be doing some research <i>in psychology</i>, but I don't think he meets any usual definition of 'psychologist'.</li>

<dd>Some of this stuff really does seem like original (and slightly kooky) original research. For example, there is no reference for the following "As a result, after humans defecate, feces is caught in the hairs unless it is thoroughly washed out, such that it increases the amount of volatile moderately toxic chemicals in the air, and increases the spread</dd>
