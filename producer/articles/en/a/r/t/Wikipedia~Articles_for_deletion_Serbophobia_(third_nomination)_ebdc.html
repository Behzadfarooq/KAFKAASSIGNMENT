<p>"SERBOPHOBIA &amp; BOSNIAKOPHOBIA"</p>
<p><b>In the beginning, Serbophobia returned only 2 matches at Google. When Serbs introduced this word to Wikipedia, thanks to thousands of scrapper pages, Google now returns close to 3,000 matches (all copies of Wikipedia content). Serbophobia was also nominated for deletion in the past etc, but nobody deleted it. Now, people want to delete Bosniakophobia. I contest the deletion of Bosniakophobia and suggest - if you want to delete Bosniakophobia, then you should also delete Serbophobia. Since you haven't deleted Serbophobia, please keep your hands away from Bosniakophobia. Let's play it fair.</b></p>
<p>Either delete both or don't delete any.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of some of discussion about this article dating back to December 2005 (by Asim Led):</p>
<p>This word ( Serbophobia )does not deserve an article of its own, it’s a term devised for explicitly political purposes during the late 80s and early 90s. It can not be compared to "Russophobia" or "Islamophobia" because both of these deal with prevalent general social attitudes against ethnic and religious groups based on their culture and heritage. The term Serbophobia, on the other hand, is used virtually exclusively in a political context, in either an accusatory manner or as a justification. To say that it is "comparatively" as common as the term "Russophobia" is ridiculous, and based on some shady calculation certain users made involving army size and GDP. A simple Google search shows that the term "Russophobia" is far, far more common than "Serbophobia". Of the results that do show up on Google, I think they adequately manifest the nature of this term and exactly why it does not belong on Wikipedia. Of the initial 10 results that come up on the first page: The #1 result is the respective Wikipedia article 2 come from a radical right political site 6 of them come from the same two Serbian political writers and analysts. 1 comes from a book on Serbian propaganda efforts during the late 80s and early 90s If this all wasn't enough, the single legitimate source provided has been completely misinterpreted. The quote reads as follows: "Furthering this incipient nation-fever was the extraordinary memorandum issued to the public in 1986 by the prestigious Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, condemning the perceived presence of "Serbophobia" in the central government of Yugoslavia." The use of this as a reference for some traditional use of the term would be fine and dandy if the word wasn’t placed in quotes; but it is. This is because the author views the term with skepticism and questions its validity, implying (just as Dado mentioned) that the word was used by Serb officials to drum up support amongst the populace for their nationalist policies. I challenge any neutral observer to read the context of the word, notice the tone of the passage, read the preceding paragraphs, and not reach the same conclusion as I did[2].</p>
