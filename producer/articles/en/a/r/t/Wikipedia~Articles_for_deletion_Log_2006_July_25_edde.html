Otherwise, I've been going crazy over this deletion issue. I'm not quite sure what it is that needs improving, otherwise I'd gladly change it in a heartbeat.

<li><b>Comment, maybe possibly a weak keep</b>. In smaller cultures, such as those found in ex-Soviet Eastern Europe, or third-world or war-striken countries, people like this are sometimes all that the culture has to show for itself. Poverty and suppression can knock out almost all creative talent, and the few who manage to achieve anything at all should rightfully be considered to be notable. In the United States, we are awash in (truly, honestly) great talents on every street corner; other parts of the world are not so lucky. As to this particular fellow, I cannot tell. If someone is notable enough to still have someone writing a bio for him at age 61 -- well, maybe they're actually notable. I dunno.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I quite agree that we have to be sensitive, but we also need the article to give us indications so that we can be sensitive with wisdom. By its very nature, an article like this comes from someone with computer access, and some reading of our other articles should give the author a sense of what's customary in an article. We can only judge by what they give us. I agree that we shouldn't be unnecessarily snotty about our votes, but the sheer volume of inappropriate articles a day would try the patience of a saint. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:50, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is completely redundant with the episode lists in the articles for the individual <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sentai_1aff.html" title="Super Sentai">Super Sentai</a> series. For the uninitiated, Super Sentai is a franchise, not a single series. It does not make sense to put the combined episode lists of a franchise that contains 30 series' into a single article, separate from the series articles. Furthermore, the episode title translations here are largely incorrect, with many of them seeming to come from an automatic translator such as Babelfish, while the translations in the individual articles are better-written and were translated manually. <a href="../../../j/g/p/User%7EJgp_2d0c.html" title="User:Jgp">jgp</a> (<a href="../../../j/g/p/User_talk%7EJgp_a553.html" title="User talk:Jgp">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jgp_810b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jgp">C</a>) 01:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I created this page, I got all this info from visiting the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston. These were the players inducted into the International Hockey Hall of Fame located in Kingston during the era when the NHL was a partner in this hall plus the 1966 inductions which were not recognized by the Toronto based NHL Hockey Hall of Fame. After the NHL seized support in 1958 for this Hockey Hall of Fame to establish the NHL Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and were making inductions on there own for there Toronto based hall they decided to recogize all (with one exception stated below) the International Hockey Hall of Fame's inductions as also being inducted into theres, therfore these players are recognized as being inducted into both halls. Officially the actual inductions in the years stated was inducted into this Kingston based hall not the Toronto based hall. With the exception of Bill Goheen (inducted in 1952) who received a life time ban from the NHL in the 1930's as a player due to a conflict with then NHL president <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Calder_2752.html" title="Frank Calder">Frank Calder</a> and the 1966 inductions which were after the NHL seized support for this hall--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 01:50, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The link above from the Canadian encyclopedia states that the IHHOF, "...has inducted, with one exception (Fred J. "Bun" Cook), the same players, builders and referees as the HOCKEY HALL OF FAME in Toronto." So far, that is the best reference I have seen. However, it does not completely match up with the article, since <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busher_Jackson_0aa2.html" title="Busher Jackson">Busher Jackson</a> and Bill Goheen are not covered by that statement. Also, it does not explicitly state that the overlap ended in 1952.

<dd>The very first source <a href="http://www.kingstonishockeyville.ca/funfacts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingstonishockeyville.ca/funfacts.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> does not verify the content of the page in question. It states that Kingston is the home of the IHHOF and is says that Kingston is the place where the induction of the first 40 members of the NHL sponsored HHOF was done. I do not dispute either of those facts. That reference does not explicity say that members were inducted into the IHHOF. I believe that the essence of the dispute is what institution where the first 40 inducted into at the time. It is very clear that the HHOF claims that they were inducted into that institution. It appears that you are claiming that they were inducted into the IHHOF and the HHOF then assumed that history. As of now, you have not provided a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a> that says this. I still believe that the article in question should be deleted. The other sources provided are only about single individuals, and do not represent a full picture. The fact that the IHHOF itself does not appear to make a claim to those inductions, you will have to provide a very solid source for me to be convinced that it is legitimate. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 19:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>DO NOT DELETE. THIS IS INTERESTING INFORMATION. ITS EXISTENCE IS NOT HURTING ANYONE OR ANYTHING AND IS HELPFUL TO THOSE WHO SEEK IT.

<li><b>Delete</b> useless listcruft. To the user above, please lay off the caps and sign your posts with 4 tildes, like this (~~~~). This list is too obscure for more than a few people to use. If someone wanted to find out which malls were in their area, they could use a phonebook. Wikipedia shouldn't be used for this kind of thing. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 16:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is merely your opinion that "this list is too obscure for more than a few people to use." How, exactly, would you be privy to that information? A phonebook would not have direct links to summaries of retail offerings, location, history, etc. of the malls in a particular state; Wikipedia, on the other hand, does. Why not get a life and stop worrying about deleting other people's information? Too little info is a problem; too much isn't hurting anyone except for wiki-trolls who spend their time harassing other people on here as though they own the place. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.33.49.251 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.33.49.251.html" title="User talk:129.33.49.251">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.33.49.251_d524.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.33.49.251">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>There are no links on these articles, nor should there be. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of knowledge. Please stop asking users to "get a life". This is not your information, if you think it is, you don't know what a wiki is. You are the one harassing users here, and you are the closest one here to a wiki-troll. This is a vote and discussion page, stating my opinion is certainly not acting as if I owned the place. I would appreciate it if you would be more civil, and state your opinion in vote form so the closing admin can more easily take it into consideration. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 03:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am concerned that someone like yourself, who seems to have only a passing acquaintance with the English language, thinks he or she is responsible for writing and editing information in the public domain. I would recommend that you be permanently banned so that those who actually know the rules of English grammar could revise and expand Wikipedia without being harassed by those who decide, willy-nilly, that accurate, well-written information should be removed simply because they personally do not find said information to be useful for their own purposes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.33.49.251 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.33.49.251.html" title="User talk:129.33.49.251">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.33.49.251_d524.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.33.49.251">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>As I said before, this is a vote/discussion page. Stating my opinion, which happens to be the same as 15 others, could not be farther from willy-nilly. You must have a limited grasp on the meaning of the words "well-written". This is a list, listing the malls with a hyphen next to the mall stating the city. Being banned is for vandals, impersonators, and users who continually disrupt wikipedia. I would reomment that you read wikipedias policies.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - a reasonable start at organizing information that is locally important.

<li><b>Comment</b> I created the first of these lists back when they didn't have associated categories. (Personally, I think mid-sized or larger malls are more notable than others seem to give credit for.) Although 70-80% of the listings are blue links now and the categories have been created/expanded accordingly, there are still some fairly large ones that are red that someone could eventually turn into articles. If at all possible, I'd like to have the individual state lists userfied. Thanks. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 13:02, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's a lot of userification!! it may best to put notes to that effect on the individual noms...

<p>Contains misguiding content (<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is non-theistic); most part of the article has no valuable points and are of speculations, while some minor useful information should be merged with <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> and is not worthy of an independent page.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I say delete this page. There is no need for an article about a speculation about whether <b>Buddha was God or man.</b> It is widely accepted that Buddha was not a God, he even stated he was NOT a God. So no merit in keeping an article about a speculation, even when the person himself has stated he was NOT.

<li>This article is not about speculation on whether Buddha was a God or man. It is a description of common Buddhist beliefs on the subject. I have suggested a merge of this page myself, but there's no reason to use the AfD process for a page merge. Heck, you could do the merge yourself right now, if you want.—<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENat_Krause_16e5.html" title="User:Nat Krause">Nat Krause</a><sup>(<a href="../../../n/a/t/User_talk%7ENat_Krause_014d.html" title="User talk:Nat Krause">Talk!</a>)</sup> 04:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Buddha - God or Man", seems pretty much like a speculation to me. And as for the merging, I have said, it <b>might</b> be useful to merge. But that's only if others can identify the usefulness of these information. Other then that, I myself am in favor of deletion, but the reason for deletion is simply because the article is a speculation in nature. And speculation itself is not enough for an article. And as I have said, merge only the ones, which if others can identify as useful, to the either Buddhology/Buddha's main article. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeykiss_91cc.html" title="User:Monkeykiss">Monkey Brain</a> 04:21, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Seems to be a potentially interesting review as the to Buddha-nature, but I am inexpert enough to judge solely on the content.

<ul>
<li>Given that <i>this is not a vote</i>, that final statement has no foundation. And the way that we solve these things on Wikipedia is not by having editors assert subject expertise (which is impossible to confirm), but by <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing sources</a>. An expert editor should be in a position to easily locate and cite reliable sources on the subject matter to demonstrate that it is both verifiable and not original research. Expertise is expected to involve knowing where the subject-matter sources are. (See <a href="../../../e/x/p/Wikipedia%7EExpert_editors_976b.html" title="Wikipedia:Expert editors">Wikipedia:Expert editors</a>.)

<li>If sources where this topic has already been the subject of analysis are cited to demonstrate that the article is not original research, yes.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Not notable, not encyclopedic, not worth keeping.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the author of the article, a few notes: It meets the criteria for a notable organization: "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source." The organization hat made multiple appearances on the national and international stage, including multiple appearances at the Tournament of Roses Parade, the Lord Mayor's New Year's Day Parade (London, UK) and the Saint Patrick's Day Parade (Dublin, Ireland). I believe this establishes the notability on a wide scale of which Coredesat speaks. I should also note that there are far less notable high school bands present on Wikipedia. Finally, to address the capitalization issue: Rookie mistake. Upon the article posting, an request for migration was made to correct this.

<li>First of all, the article is misnamed (capitalization error). Second of all, I think the fact that the band has been in parades such as the Tournament of Roses and the Saint Patrick's Day parades merits a mention in the school's article.

<p><strike>*<b>Keep and clean up</b> The article could use some pruning, but is fairly sure to still be too long to merge. This isn't inherrently game guide material, even if parts of the article currently read that way. This isn't game guide material and is critical to explain what F.E.A.R. is to someone who hasn't played it. Not covering the guns in a first-person shooter would be like not covering the characters in a novel. Someone seems to have changed this to speedy deletion after less than 24 hours per a supposed consensus, which is bad form. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 05:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - first off, indeed the AfD shouldn't have changed to speedy deletion, esp with the AfD discussion having barely begun. I've taken the liberty of reverting it. As for the article, in my opinion the material covered here is already mentioned sufficiently in the main article for <a href="../../../f/2E/e/F.E.A.R._%28computer_game%29_4be0.html#Arsenal" title="F.E.A.R. (computer game)">F.E.A.R</a> (thanks to Valoem's work, apparently). The separate article supplements it with detail that, while intriguing, still could be considered crufty. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 06:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I looked at the main F.E.A.R. article and htis is indeed covered pretty well. I guess I underestimated the amount of fluff in this article. So delete as redundant.

<dd>As a side note, I'd simply like to point out that <a href="../../../f/2E/e/F.E.A.R._%28computer_game%29_4be0.html" title="F.E.A.R. (computer game)">F.E.A.R. (computer game)</a> did not contain "redundant" info prior to this AfD nomination: simply I've worked on a "condensed" version of the contents of the weapons article (after its nomination) and added it to the main article, so this may account for the "presumed redundancy". On the other hand, Valoem's previous merge of the full list article resulted in a massive size increase of F.E.A.R. (ironically the weapons article was created because users asked to split the too large main article), compelling me to shorten all the stuff, still trying to make sure the relevant contents were kept. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserker79_0d19.html" title="User:Berserker79">Berserker79</a> 07:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I typed the article and it wasn't meant to be promotional. I simply have a darkstarlings and came here looking for more info, When I didn't find any I typed an article on it. Also, What would be my motive to promote it? I don't own it or are getting any profits, So therefore it'd be pointless for me to promote it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jake12 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jake12_d0fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jake12">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>But really I don't think it should be deleted. I know it kinda seems like an ad but I just thought Darkstarlings needed a Wikipedia, and honestly I couldn't gain from it at all so why would I promote it? Not much motives come to mind.

<dd>The best course of action then is to assess the <i>article</i> on its own merits, and ignore <i>who</i> is involved in the process.

<dd>I was merely making the point that the nomination may have been made in bad faith. To assess the article on it's merits: It would appear that the article refers to the group's website itself for trivial information on the group. It also refers to critics of the group for criticism - this seems reasonable. Once it has been decided that this article should not be deleted, it would probably be a good idea to utilize the wealth of information printed on this group in the media to broaden the scope of the article. This conference paper from the Queensland University of Technology may also be of use. <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00003487/" class="external autonumber" title="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00003487/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>

<dd>No, <i>before</i> it's decided whether or not to delete the article, these kind of references <i>must</i> be added, or the only appropriate conclusion is delete. The citations are all blogs (i.e. valueless) and the group's own website (equally valueless). Essentially, there's no real evidence presented that the group <i>even exists</i>. Whether the nomination is made in good, bad or indifferent faith is entirely irrelevent. Rather than resort to personnal attacks against the nominator, instead argue the merits of the article. <i>If</i> the article merits inclusion, the result of the debate will be keep. Relying on a group's website for information is terrible, best illustrated by all the nominated band websites - for example, if you read my band's website, you would wrongly conclude that a) we exist, and b) we play music. Without a <i>real</i> reference, the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, a non-negiotable policy of Wikipedia - and thus is deserving of deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I had put a prod on this for being NN, but it seemed to actually be a real thing, not as hoaxy as I first believed. While the prod was not removed, the creator made an argument for keeping on the talk page, so I felt I should change it to an AfD myself. I am no longer certain whether this game (or whatever it is) warrants a page, but the current page is totally not an article, and so even if there should be an article, it may be just as well to delete and start over later. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 04:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not going to tell you to keep this article because I have not done research on it's factuality. However, this is the kind of thing that harms Wikipedia. If you are not sure of its factuality don't just recommend it for deletion. Research a little. But, I do agree that it is not article because of zero citations. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem">Creating a harder than deleting</a> 05:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nominating for deletion is rarely a harmful action: where an article should not be deleted, an AfD is often the necessary stimulus for people to research the topic and improve the article. In this case, it is certainly less harmful than letting the prod run its course and having the article deleted on a technicality without any scrutiny from other editors, don't you think? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 11:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I prod'ed this article several weeks ago, but the tag was removed by the author. The author appears to have done research into this fish called a "Barracoda". That's awesome, but it violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a>. Since my prod, the author added two sources, <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/FamilySummary.cfm?Family=Sphyraenidae" class="external text" title="http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/FamilySummary.cfm?Family=Sphyraenidae" rel="nofollow">a fishbase listing</a> of the Sphyraenidae genus of the Barracuda species (just a listing, no real source). And <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2004.00318.x/full/?cookieSet=1" class="external text" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2004.00318.x/full/?cookieSet=1" rel="nofollow">an extremely long veterinary journal entry</a> about shiny eyes in fish.</p>
<p>I have no doubt at all that there is some great research going on here, but it's <i>original research</i>, and Wikipedia is being used as the vehicle for publishing it. The professor (and marine biologist) who wrote it even admits that he <i>just discovered</i> it and is "tickled pink" about his discovery. I'm sure there's some venue for publishing of this caliber, but Wikipedia in its current form just doesn't seem like the right place. Let's add this article <i>after</i> it gets published in a journal. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Alphachimp</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 05:42, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I suppose my rationale wasn't worded in the best possible way. My primary reason to suggest deletion was the basis that it's a non-notable location and fell under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. The latter rationale was simply my trying to take it one step further and explore the more general question of what a cemetery's notability has to be for it to be included. If there's been a discussion about this and all cemeteries <i>are</i> notable, then that point is moot and I'm open to withdrawing my nomination and speedy keeping if such a precedent exists... and please point me to it.

<li><b>Delete</b> because cemetaries are not inherently noteworthy. Some are, some aren't. To be worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, the article needs to contain an assertion of notability. Otherwise it violates the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> rule against being an indiscriminate collection of information. Some cemetaries are huge, long lasting things. Some have only one or two graves, and nobody knows who is buried there. This article contains no assertion that this cemetary is notable for the history of cemetaries, the history of the area, or for anybody buried there. In short, it is yet another cemetary, and thus the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Makemi, You might have waited until you read my response to your posting on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETim_Folzenlogen_9664.html" title="Talk:Tim Folzenlogen">Talk:Tim Folzenlogen</a> - which I wrote immediately after you posted it without getting up from my computer - before sending this to AfD with erroneous information ([addition]: but I see from the edit conflict that you have corrected some of it). I am not the subject of the article. I am a highly educated professional who has taught at the college level for almost a decade, and I would certainly not have taken the time to write an article about Folzenlogen if I did not genuinely believe him to be a notable artist. It is true that I know of Folzenlogen through our both having a past association with the Unification Church, and that almost all of my edits have been on related topics. It is also true that the Manhattan Times is not a big paper; I was surprised myself when I saw that it has no entry in Wikipedia. There may be better sources out there; I put this initial attempt at an article together today based on what I found on the web. Please read below the discussion from talk page of the article in question.</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<p>Before commenting here I would just like to ask editors to read the article carefully. I think there is enough information in the article already to make clear that Folzenlogen is a sufficiently notable artist.</p>
<p>There are a large number of artists (in the broad sense of the word, including painters, writers, musicians, etc.) who have a page on Wikipedia in spite of the fact that, unlike Folzenlogen, they are not sufficiently successful to support themselves full-time. A fair measure of a living artist's abilities and popularity is whether people are willing to pay large sums for his or her work. The fact that even Folzenlogen's small paintings command <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/media/mtimes.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/media/mtimes.html" rel="nofollow">4-figure prices</a> and that he has sold over 1000 paintings is an indication of his significance.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Museum of Art</a>, an "on-line exhibition illustrating major achievements in painting, [etc.]," the page on Contemporary Realism states "After 50 years of being practiced in the wings of the artistic community, Contemporary Realism is making a reappearance," and <a href="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/hallofartmovements/contemporaryrealism.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofart/hallofartmovements/contemporaryrealism.org/" rel="nofollow">Folzenlogen is listed as one of the 11 references of Contemporary Realism painters</a> or web sites which list painters or discuss Contemporary Realism. Folzenlogen is an important figure within this reemerging genre.</p>
<p>Although I am fairly new to Wikipedia, and am not knowledgeable of every aspect of recommended procedures, I have read much of the material on proposed deletions, but little of it seemed to apply in this case. Because the template instructs "You may remove this message...if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason," I am doing so in good faith. I welcome debate on the issue, however, especially any advice on how to improve the article. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 04:40, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

You could remove the notice, go through AfD, and it's <i>possible</i> that it will be kept, as notability is a difficult issue, and many people are far more willing to have more in the encyclopedia than I think wise.

<dd>Alright, now I understand why you nominated this article for deletion. No, this is not an autobiography! I am not Tim Folzenlogen. I do not even know him personally, though I do know of him (and I am genuinely impressed by his work in addition to my knowing of him because of our both being members of the Unification Church). I didn't know a lot of the details, however, so I did have to do some research on the web to get a lot of the references and quotations, most of of which I didn't know before today. In fact, the reason I put the stub section tag on the "Thought behind the art" section is that I wasn't confident I was encapsulating his thought adequately, and if not I hoped someone would give a more representative quotation.</dd>

<dd>As to the issue of his run-in with Hyun Jin Moon, this is already well-known within the church. Members who spent any time on the Internet have been hearing about it since the mid-90s, and there are several Wikipedia pages which mention it and several web sites where Folzenlogen's letter to Rev. Moon is posted (though I don't think he has it on his web site; he seems to be free of resentment over his experience while a member). I also harbor no resentments, and am not interested in making personal attacks; I explained my rationale earlier today on my user page for the minority of edits which are unfavorable toward the church but that I hope will lead to reforms. My purpose in choosing the username "Exucmember" was because my original motivation for editing (and the character of my early edits) was to counter the religious bigotry toward the Unification Church. I thought it would be a plus in defending Unificationists against such bigotry for it to come from a clearly identified ex-member. I realized recently that the username is significantly detrimental in making any edits that seem critical of the church. Before you jump to conclusions about me, you might want to look at the explanation on my user page and some of my edits on pages such as <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonies.html" title="Moonies">Moonies</a> and pages that link to it or used to link to it, favorable comments about my edits from Unificationist <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">User:Steve Dufour</a> on <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESun_Myung_Moon_b61d.html" title="Talk:Sun Myung Moon">Talk:Sun Myung Moon</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolli_Kangron_8635.html" title="Wolli Kangron">Wolli Kangron</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Theological_Seminary_8885.html" title="Unification Theological Seminary">Unification Theological Seminary</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hope_Academy_64b4.html" title="New Hope Academy">New Hope Academy</a> (which originally sparked my editing, and where you can clearly see from the talk page that I live in the Washington, D.C. area, not New York), <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_bombing.html" title="Love bombing">Love bombing</a>, etc. If it were not for bringing some of the problems into the daylight with the (barest) hope of future reforms, I might well have been accused of being a Unificationist posing as an ex-member. So you really needn't worry about my being attacked. And in fact, before I'd read what you wrote above I had already revised that paragraph in a way that toned it down significantly, feeling that it was disproportionate to the level of detail I had about Folzenlogen's personal biography. I would certainly not have taken the time to write this article if I did not genuinely believe Folzenlogen is a notable artist.

<p>Disregarding the Unification Church issue, most of the text in the article is just an argument why the artist should be seen as of any relevance (and thus as worthy of an wikipedia entry).

"popularity is reflected" ... etc. Is he on <a href="http://www.artnet.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.artnet.com/" rel="nofollow">artnet.com</a>?

He is claiming notability based on her popularity as a writer, however almost all of the 116 ghits relate to her connection with the Jewish religion or their treatment by the Nazis, and the article contains a link to the subject's indictment of an officer in the camp (who according to Frank's diaries from an earlier year engaged in repeated surprise beatings of Frank), which I think is going to come back and bite someone on the ass (it is at least unwise).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming Makemi is being honest in the first paragraph above, and it doesn't make sense to me. Of course, her first objection was that the article was an autobiography (which it is not), but this assumption still underlies the rest of her comments (except that the Manhattan Times is not a big enough paper).</p>
<p>She seems to imply that a second area of notability, Folzenlogen's being involved in an important incident with a top leader of the Unification Church and subsequently writing about it, somehow makes the article illegitimate. On the contrary - he is notable in two areas, either of which is sufficient in my opinion - and certainly both areas together are sufficient. For comparison, more than 25 "famous whistleblowers" are listed on the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistleblower.html" title="Whistleblower">Whistleblower</a> page on Wikipedia, most being famous only in relation to the act of exposing of the misdeeds of powerful people and organizations; only 3 of these do not have their own pages. Folzenlogen doesn't fit this category precisely IMO, but the comparison is helpful. Present and former members of the Unification movement are concerned about the leadership of the second generation, and some believe Rev. Moon has had a tolerant attitude toward the violence of his 3 oldest sons (the second by proxy - I'll explain this if anyone's interested). This genuine and important concern should be addressed by both sides by discussing the facts. It is not appropriate for Makemi to suggest that the issue cannot be mentioned because people will respond vengefully. Besides, this part of the article is very low-key.</p>
<p>Without coming out and saying so, Makemi seems to be implying that Folzenlogen's notability as an artist is just a smoke screen for his notable involvement in violent responses from Unification Church leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep - 2 areas of notability.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise without coming out and saying so, [User:Jbirken|Jbirken] implies that there is something nefarious or suspect about naming accomplishments of a professional painter in a biography. Obviously, naming accomplishments is very common in Wikipedia biography articles. It is as though Jbirken is continuing the same argument that Makemi is making, using the same erroneous assumptions. When I saw that Jbirken had only 5 edits before jumping into an AfD with bold and emotionally charged comments, it took all the goodwill I could muster to trust Makemi and assume Jbirken is not a sockpuppet. Perhaps s/he is a friend who thinks alike, who Makemi asked to contribute to an AfD, or maybe some situation I haven't thought of (but fervent contribution to an AfD on the first day must be unusual for someone with 5 minor edits who hasn't even been welcomed to Wikipedia yet!). The 3 facts s/he cites were in the same newspaper article (normal biographical writing for a profile in a paper); was the author of that article in cahoots with me several years ago just to set up this opportunity? And naming a couple web sites where Folzenlogen's name doesn't appear doesn't impress me.</p>
<p>For the lazy, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">guideline for notability</a> (the <i>only</i> reason this article is being considered for deletion) says: "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious)." The guidelines are clearly uneven; the line right above Painters says "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work" - a far more lenient guideline that would include vastly more people. One "alternative test" says: "Verifiability -- Can all information in the article be independently verified now? (some say) 10 years from now?" Yes, but Makemi argues that the newspapers I got the information from are not important enough. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 01:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> So, we're talking about an artist here, which makes both sites I mentioned a lot more notable than any article in a local newspaper. Folzenlogen is neither represented by any major gallery, nor is he part of any mayor collection, nor was he part of any major exhibition (please, correct me if I'm wrong). This makes him an rather irrelevant artist, and this has nothing to do with him being member of one church or the other. OK, I'm not a regular WP user, but as an art historian I thought I could contribute something on a topic while idly browsing the AfDs. --Jbirken 10:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are more than half a million sites that mention the Unification Church, but very few (that have substantial information) are balanced or neutral. <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/" rel="nofollow">ReligiousTolerance.org</a> is a neutral one, but it represents a superficial perspective and contains errors. The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/unificationism/" rel="nofollow">Geocities.com/Unificationism</a> site is balanced rather than neutral, and its quality is apparently appreciated, as it comes up first when "Unificationism" is typed into Google.</p>
<p>The guideline I mentioned is not "the more lenient guideline"; it is the guideline for "authors, editors and photographers," as I said. My point was that the guidelines vary too much across fields, not to apply a guideline to a different field. I know of award-winning writers with <i>many</i> reviews of mutiple books who have never been able to support themselves financially from only their writing. Folzenlogen's paintings are sufficiently valued that he has supported himself entirely through his art for 30 years. I will comment within 24 hours on his shows, gallery affiliation, and prestigeous clients.</p>
<p>I didn't make a "sock/meat puppet assertion"; I said I assumed the reverse (read what I said). I also said "<b>unusual</b> for someone with 5 minor edits" (rather than "irregular" or "suspicious"). And Godwin's law doesn't apply; did you really not understand my point, Makemi? I could just as easily have used the analogy of Moe and Curly, except that Curly didn't put his complaint in writing. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 19:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I don't know a great deal about art, but geniuses (even in fields that are less subjective) are frequently under-appreciated in their own lifetimes. I don't know whether this fellow is a genius, but perhaps he ought to be given a chance considering that some people think very highly of him. I'd like to respond to the Unification Church issue; I'm a psychologist (Ph.D.), and I read widely on New Religious Movements (for a paper I never finished) some years ago, especially the Unification Church, Hare Krishna, and Children of God. There are some criticisms which seem to be groundless, such as the one about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church#Political_activities" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church#Political_activities" rel="nofollow">Unification Church having been founded as a front group for the Korean CIA</a>, and others where there seem to be legitimate grievances. Nansook Hong's writings about Hyo Jin Moon's violence toward her, and Tim Folzenlogen's writings about Hyun Jin Moon's, are an important addition. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>Do</b></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DoctorW_9e6c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorW"><font color="#007040"><b>c</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoctorW_8300.html" title="User talk:DoctorW"><font color="#800040"><b>t</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><b>or</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorW_fcac.html" title="User:DoctorW"><font color="#0000A0"><i><b>W</b></i></font></a> 22:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment (notability as an artist):</b> Folzenlogen was represented by Allan Stone, who personally bought many of his paintings. (For those who don't know, Stone also represented Wayne Thiebaud, whose work at that time commanded the highest price of any living artist.) Folzenlogen became the favorite of Stone's biggest client, the President of Morgan Stanley. Other prestigious clients include Procter &amp; Gamble, Barclays Capitol, Bill &amp; Charlotte Ford, etc. His more than 50 solo shows were mostly in New York; take a look at the <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/bio/bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/bio/bio.html" rel="nofollow">list</a> (fyi, Bunkamura was the premier exhibition space in Tokyo at the time). Folzenlogen dropped out of the gallery world in 2002, and focuses on public art projects now. Take a look at his <a href="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.timfolzenlogen.com/" rel="nofollow">web site</a> - it's pretty impressive. -<a href="../../../e/x/u/User%7EExucmember_e7d2.html" title="User:Exucmember">Exucmember</a> 05:11, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your argument is well intended, but wrong. If an article is not properly sourced, then we should delete it. I see no reason to delete <i>this</i> public access show simply because you have issues imagining how we would deal with articles about <i>other</i> shows. Can we afford to list them? The simple answer is yes, if they are well sourced, verfied, and neutral.

In my eyes, this <i>is</i> one of the "other" shows. Well-sourced? The only source I see used is the group's own website -- the only claim to notability I can find in the article is itself an apparently unsourced statement. There's almost no content in this article, "this is a show, these are the five cast members' names. Trust me, it's notable. Here's some links!" Three sentences and a five-bullet list.

<dd>Speedy is part of the <i>speedy</i> deletion process, but not, actually, AFD. That's quite clear. There are many things that apply in Speedy but not AFD. That's why there are separate policies.

<dd>That's fine. its also not a directory. One thing to differentiate an article between being encyclopedic and being part of a general directory is notability. That is also part of WP:NOT. Almost anything can be neutral and verifiable (and no it wasn't neutral with statements like ...and Riley Swift - the dungeon master! it read exactly like a vanity page or ad. Which is what it is.). Neutral and verifiable are not the only criteria for inclusion. Some people feel that way, some people feel the other way and that is why were here. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 06:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because its not the proper tone for an encyclopedia. It reads like an ad or sounds like someone announcing something flashy. And yes policy IS important. There are more policies than WP:V and WP:NPOV. You just took the time to quote WP:NOT by saying its not paper, read the whole policy. You can't use part of it to justify the existence of the article then turn around and ignore 2 other parts of the same policy that would say it doesn't belong here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's been some changes to this article since I nominated it for deletion, and while I never actually voted, I've starting to think that it was a poor AfD candidate — the OBE has been confirmed, and the addition of her book helps that much more. I originally mistook this as a vanity article by Beere herself, which it isn't. Since AfD's exist to establish whether an article is appropriate for inclusion here, and others have demonstrated that it indeed is, I'm retracting my support of the AfD and changing my vote to <b>keep</b>.

<dd>For a six hour block, the editor <i>wasn't</i> working on it, and lacking any sort of information to indicate otherwise, it suggested that the article had taken the form he intended it to take — hence the prod.

And had you looked at the talk page, you'd see an explanation and offer of assistance from me. Finally, I suggested to userfy the article so the user's work wouldn't be lost (and possibly be available for an article in the future if consensus is for deletion but he can later establish notability). Please don't insinuate that this AfD is about harassing a user — it's not, and the suggestion can only breed bad faith. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/i/j/User_talk%7ETijuana_Brass_8109.html" title="User talk:Tijuana Brass">¡Épa!</a></sup></b>

<dd>I apologize, I was not trying to insinuate that this was an <i>intentional</i> harassment campaign on Gainax. It's just that, from looking at the article's history (which I did do before I posted here), there's a pattern of quick, terse deletion edits while Gainax worked for several hours to improve the article to try to stop them from coming. By the time you prodded, the article already had the OBE claim (unsourced at the time, but certainly a claim of notability).

<li><b>Keep</b> - This article as a whole does not qualify for deletion, if perhaps some instructory sentences should be deleted. The <b>listing</b> of note and button sequences (which has now been deleted by an unregistered IP; check history) is not a "how-to", but a source of relevant information. At least these relevant listings on the page are not "cruft" or useless, as even readers who are not familiar with the game can gain an understanding for how songs are played through the video game and its console by the "Sequence" entries, and what these songs sound like by the "Notes" entries. I especially deem it proper to have a list of notes in an article on <b>songs</b> where the reader cannot hear the songs being played. Also, the statement by <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a> that "It also tells the player where to find the Ocarina in each game" is untrue, in that it does not say this for all the games and the Ocarina isn't always the featured instrument anyway. Nevertheless, any complaints of this nature could be resolved by editing small portions of the page, not deleting it altogether. --<a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETryforceful_b16a.html" title="User:Tryforceful">Tryforceful</a> 17:29, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I deleted the button sequences because there really isn't an encylopedic reason for how to perform songs. As it stands, I don't think much can be done to save the article, unless it is pared down to simply a list of all of the Zelda songs. A few of them (such as the Song of Time) might warrant a sentence or two on their history and importance, but a lot of what is here is a genuine guide on how to play the games. I think a vast simplification could warrant keeping it as a list with an explanation of the historical importance of music and specifically player-created music in the Zelda games, and I encourage people to continue further editing the article to reflect that; however, I know that the newly established precedents and hoards of "gamecruft" calls will end up just deleting it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.61.46.16 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.61.46.16.html" title="User talk:129.61.46.16">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.61.46.16_39a6.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.61.46.16">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> - I've edited it further to remove all game guide material, and now ask editors to weigh in again on this AFD. I think that in its current state, it provides a nice overview of the history of music in the Zelda games. Expandability options would include a more historical treatment of its evolution from a minor feature to a major gameplay element, which could be easily cited, or a more in-depth explanation as to the importance of certain instruments/songs to the history of the Zelda world (while avoiding how they're used in the game): the obvious example here is the Ocarina. 129.61.46.16 20:29, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article documents a legitimate element of Zelda games and should not be deleted. In some games (<i><b>Ocarina</b> of Time</i> and <i>The Wind Waker</i> especially), music plays a pivotal role in the plot and this article is used to talk about it. I agree that some of the article is cruft and needs editting but that's just it. All it needs is a little editting. The keypresses may be unnecessary and they've already been removed besides. It's not a game guide since music is so important to the storyline and should not be deleted. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 19:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would liken this to an article which lists the first sentence in each chapter of some very famous novel; it's crucial to set the tone of what follows, but we don't need this and I would think it unencyclopedic. The problem is that we don't, for the most part, see these analogous articles for none "pop" subjects because lovers of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28novel%29.html" title="1984 (novel)">1984 (novel)</a>, for example, don't have the young's passion and single-minded devotion for their pet projects (and let's face it, a lot less time to devote). So the result is ever more minutia from this type of subject forked into autonomous articles. Aren't the sound effects from the game incredibly important?; the artistry; its smooth scrolling system (I just made that up), etc. Sure, they're all important to the game. What should be included in an encyclopedia though. If someone looks up 1984 they should learn about that novel. We shouldn't have and don't need an article listing each fictional placename made up by Orwell for 1984, or one listing each place Winston visits therein. It's enough to give an example in an article on those subtopics which are important. We apparently do need, however, a separate article about every character mentioned in any manga. That songs are important to the game can be mentioned in the article on the primary topic, along with a precis of the famous songs, but forking that into a separate list of every song is beyond the scope and purpose of an encyclopedia (even one unconstrained by the limits of paper).--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 00:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the point is that Wikipedia is really not constrained by paper. If the topic can be covered in an encyclopedic manner (and not as a how-to), then there's no reason not to cover it. Yes, if it is a minor topic, then it probably shouldn't be given its own page and instead mentioned on the main zelda page. If we look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_series_209c.html" title="The Legend of Zelda series">The_Legend_of_Zelda_series</a>, however (which has been rated as a good article), then it's already obvious that it's a pretty large page. At a certain point, you should branch off onto new pages; dial up readers don't want to load a single zelda page consisting of all of the encyclopedic information on Zelda available, and nobody else wants to read all the way through that either. That's the point of new articles. Also, by the logic of your post above, it would be much appreciated if you changed your vote from, "Delete How-to gamecruft." to at least, "Delete Non-notable." The logic of your post suggests that you don't think of it as a how-to, but rather as not being notable enough. 68.106.198.28 02:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</dd>

<li><b>Weak merge</b> I am a fan of the Zelda series, so hopefully that is not coloring my judgment in any way. But, as a user, I find searching this article difficult, and I can't think of a way to organize it that would be less difficult, unless we were talking paragraphs instead of these disjointed lists-within-lists. If I were looking for information on the songs, this is not the page name I would enter in the search box, either. On the other hand, the music is a large part of gameplay, especially in the games where you actually <i>play</i> the music on your ocarina. But I think the best place for this kind of information would be in the articles about each game. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 20:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After reviewing the rewrite and subsequent comments, I'd like to clarify my position: do I think the songs of the games are not notable? Would I be unhappy with leaving the article where it is? Certainly not. If the article were deleted outright without at least some of this information being put elsewhere, I would be a little upset. But ultimately, I still think the presentation of the information would work better if merged. I also think the OST article ideas would work better if this information were merged, but that's not why I'm voting this way. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 17:38, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As per Ian Moody's request, I reviewed the newer version of the article. I still believe that a listing of these songs doesn't really add anything to an outsider's understanding of the Zelda games that the plot synopses don't. However, articles for the officially released soundtracks of these games would be encyclopedic and notable (if anyone wishes to pursue that), though I don't think any of the content from this article would need to be merged. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 22:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think that could be a good idea for an article, but it seems to serve a different purpose than what I think is being discussed here. The context of this article (as well as the previous version) is to discuss how music is incorporated into the gameplay of the Zelda series as a design element, as opposed to background music. The title, however, should probably be changed to reflect that. 129.61.46.16 20:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

<li><b>Comment on Comment</b> - The original page, before it was massacred so, made a note that this article elaborates(/-ed) on songs played by the characters in the game, and to see a separate page for background music that would be titled "Background music from The Legend of Zelda series."

Just the game theoretic aspects of Chess make it notable, as a good case can be made that the modern field of Game Theory was motivated in part by a desire to understand Chess. Until Warcraft achieves anything remotely comparable in scope, any equivalences drawn between the two games is fallacious. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 19:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Scope of what, you said "a good case can be made" that means its not a fact but possibly can be argued. So until someone starts arguing that Warcraft is responcible for mathematical theories it cant be kept? There is probably more people playing Warcraft then chess at any given moment. Furthermore just because someone writes game guides on chess doesnt mean there " is a large ammount of scholarship devoted to it", There are tons of game guides on Final Fantasy as well. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The "how-to" policy leaves no room for importance of the subject; if it is used as the basis of a nomination and the subsequent deletion, then it absolutely opens the door to deletions of chess and baseball bat articles; that will remain the case unless <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is changed to say that "wikipedia is not a how-to for the new and shiny, but may be a how-to for the time-worn".

<li>That's a very...selective way of quoting..."Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes." Video game guides are given as an example but are certainly not the only one here - it specifically says it should not give instruction or advice of any kind. The rook article and most of the chess articles do precisely that, if we take the precedent being used for video game articles, which is simply stating the existence and function of a game piece. 68.106.198.28 01:29, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

I've given you 10 potential sources above, which were relatively easy to find (and using which this article can be turned into a proper article using the normal method of <i>simply editing it</i> — clearly belying your assertion that this article is not improvable).

<li><b>Comment</b>. My German is a bit rusty, and maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how the one external link or the two links to German wiki articles do anything to support the notability (or even the existence) of Fick deine Mutter. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeli_nk_ed07.html" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> 14:52, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. My Google search turned up nothing. If he were a Munich Academy for Television and Film graduate, he surely would not have graduated under an alias, and in order to source that claim, we would probably need some reference for his real name. The German Wikipedia articles do not mention Fick deine Mutter at all. --<a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 15:03, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No it is not a "hoax". The problem is: Which name should have the article? The best Possibility is "Fick deine Mutter", because the other Name "Andreas Rökker" does nobody know. The links show some important Albums and Songs which has "Fick deine Mutter" made. "Fick mich...und halt dein Maul" is one of these Albums, there are many others too, but the source Links just show some of them. I think, it just takes too much time, when we have a long discussion here - My suggestion: Away with the Delete-Message and everything is clean. --<a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHistory_Chanel_e715.html" title="User:History Chanel">History Chanel</a> 16:27, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm very sorry if I wasn't clear before, History Chanel. We need external links to establish verifiability - links to sites outside of a Wikipedia of any language.

<dd>Yes, the other Account was my sockpuppet: I had 2 Accounts but now I am only using this one, because it is not very good when you have two Accounts. Anyway, I somebody should move the article to "DJ Ilan", because this is his famous name. I thougt that maybe "Fick deine Mutter" is better, because on his newest release, he says in a song that this should be his new name. But if you like it, rename the article to DJ Ilan.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: With regards to the notability issue would adding extra references to where Mhenlo is mentioned (besides the game manual) help in increasing his notability? I ask this since for World of Warcraft there is a list of characters page that has over 100 <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Warcraft_characters_df5f.html" title="List of Warcraft characters">characters</a> and it doesn't even have a list of references for the characters. Secondly, WoW also has a wiki with all the relevant information. Thirdly, some of the characters listed there aren't even major NPCs in terms of their relevance to the plot (see <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Placeholder_29ba.html" title="Captain Placeholder">Captain Placeholder</a> for an example). However, as we can see with the Captain Placeholder example, he is somehow allowed to exist on Wikipedia. The only reason I could fathom why is because of the extra references to his existence on the page which hasn't prompted anyone to mark it for AFD. Deletion of the GW character articles would appear hypocritical taking this information on-board.

<dd>I am now curious. Where outside of the Guild Wars games and their associate manuals, web-sites and fansites has Mhenlo become notable? <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 13:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly my point. If you wish to delete character articles based on their notability outside their fanbase then it confuses me why the GW characters have been singled out for deletion, when there are hundreds of others out there (not only from games, but from more obscure TV shows as well) that have gone under the radar. I've provided WoW as one example but can provide more examples if requested. To answer your question directly though, I don't think Mhenlo is notable outside of Guild Wars - but neither is Captain Placeholder out of WoW&#160;:P --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 00:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: just because other games do it, does mean that it is justification for the Guild Wars pages to exist. I don't think it creates a precedent. I mean when you look at the WoW characters page do you think that it's interesting information for a non-wow player, useful information for someone trying to find out the basics of WoW without actually owning the game? Do you think they should exist? Do you think that a Guild Wars equivalent would be any more useful?<br />
If we add more pages where do we *stop*? I can think of at least 2 characters (from prophecies) not created which I consider more important than those which have been created.<br />
Finally, the factions article remained incomplete and inaccurate for a long time after the release of the game. Only one person did any significant work on the article post release - me. There is not the interest from the guild wars community in this wikipedia site for the content to be significantly expanded. --Aspectacle 06:57, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, "two wrongs don't make a right" but I'm wondering why GW was targeted in particular instead of WoW? I'm trying to get to the root of the problem here. If the style or information is scarce then fine leave it for improvement. Isn't wikipedia meant to be a collaborative and dynamic piece of work that is continually improved by multiple editors? Articles can be made into "perfect articles" but are by no means expected to be one from the start - that basically defeats the purpose of Wikipedia being a collaborative environment. With reference to the characters that weren't mentioned here (I'm assuming you're possibly talking about Vizier Khilbron, Saidra, Evennia, etc.) it is true that they're important too and I would recommend that articles be created on them too. Your final point Aspectacle however is perhaps the only reason I'll probably back down from keeping the article&#160;:P since if informed GW Wikipedia editors are scarce then it is unlikely that the articles as they stand will be improved (I'll try my best to improve them when I have time but I'm usually pretty busy). If this truly is the case, if noone else can be bothered improving the articles, then I agree they should be removed - even though it's pretty disappointing in my view considering the initial effort I put in getting them to slot in nicely in Wikipedia&#160;:P. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 00:51, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This AfD singles out Guild Wars articles in order to remain coherent, but you should be aware that in recent weeks there have been a large number of gaming-related deletion discussions (several of which I have cited as precedent).

<dd>Yes I've read the other game articles that have been cited as a precedent but NONE of them have had their pages with character bios deleted. 1. The WoW article that got deleted was talking about various "instances" in WoW - this isn't an article on "instances" or various arenas that are in GW. 2. The Zergling article from Starcraft is about one of the units in the game not a character with background story 3. The CS article is on maps you can play in the game, again these articles aren't concerned with character bios, 4. The rest of the articles on RA2, Starcraft and AoE are all on units and structures in the RTSes - not character bios. Putting these articles in the same vein as these articles when GW is an RPG and NOT including any other articles with character bios from other RPGs is discrimination IMHO. All the aforementioned articles are concerned with "gameguide" material whereas the character articles which are being AFDed aren't --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 01:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't dispute your characterisation of these articles. In fact, if you read the nomination, I have marked which articles I consider to be in the style of game guides. I nominated the characters for deletion because they are not notable. Incidentally, I am led to understand that these NPCs ("henchmen") can be used like units in an RTS, which would make them quite akin to Starcraft or AoE units, though the articles currently (and wisely) avoid documenting this aspect. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 01:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lol if we keep this up we're going to have very narrow paragraphs&#160;:P. Alright, now that we've made the distinction between the Profession, location, etc, articles and the character articles we can get back to the debate on them being "not-notable". As mentioned earlier, this is a grey area since how do you decide when a character is notable or not? Judging on other material in Wikipedia that has been allowed I would say that just because the character isn't notable in media besides its native one doesn't imply that it's not-notable full stop (I've provided an example previously). If you wish to say I'm wrong in this regard then I accept that but under protest since an injustice is being committed as there are several other examples of "not-notable" characters dwelling in Wikipedia that are somehow, notable, even though they don't exist in any form besides existing in a game. I can see how people may perceive these major NPCs in GW as like units in an RTS, but it's not one view I prescribe to. They aren't exclusively used as tools to aid the player in PvE exploration but add their own contributions to Guild Wars lore (especially now they've been tied-in with both chapters with the release of Factions). In fact, in preview trailers of the original Guild Wars, Devona, Aidan and Cynn were featured with Devona's character narrating the setting of the game giving further evidence that they are not intended as simply units to be ordered about. --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 03:18, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep or Merge</b> - I agree that there are suspected copyright violations for the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rurik_99a6.html" title="Prince Rurik">Prince Rurik</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Adelbern_7e02.html" title="King Adelbern">King Adelbern</a> articles but they can be worked on. Reading the <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a> page, I noticed these points: 1) "This is an essay expressing the opinions and ideas of some Wikipedians. While it can help explain and understand existing Wikipedia policies and guidelines, this is not an actual policy or guideline." - as such this is only a viewpoint and is not Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>2) "While 'fancruft' is often a succinct and frank description of such accumulations, it also implies that the content is unimportant and the contributor's judgement of notability is lacking. Thus, use of this term may be regarded as pejorative." and "Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, but it is not the actual <i>reason</i> for deletion. Rather, the term fancruft is a shorthand for content which one or more editors consider unencyclopaedic, possibly to the extent of violating policies on verifiability, neutrality or original research."</p>
<p>With this in mind the article cannot be deleted on the grounds of it being "gamecruft" although if you do find the information unencyclopaedic or not well written then I suggest that this warning is placed instead and hopefully others will contribute (Note that the articles are already mentioned as stubs on fictional characters and as such are not complete. There is still a great room for improvement as there are several quests and background lore that can build a picture of the characters mentioned).</p>
<p>I would be supportive of merging the character descriptions into the main article or into a Guild Wars Characters page, however I anticipated the articles to become quite large (although this obviously hasn't happened as of yet) hence my justification for creating separate articles.</p>
<p>I think the addition of articles on fictional characters is allowed since I've already seen numerous ones listed here on Wikipedia and considering at least 1 million (perhaps 2 million, although some may be duplicate accounts) have played this game coverage of these characters may be insignificant when compared to lets say characters out of the Bible for example, but still considerable enough to not be completely obscure.</p>
<p>Anyway that's my two cents worth.</p>

As has been repeatedly stated, there is no danger of the reader not having access to this information as there are much more comprehensive wikis on the topic of Guild Wars that WP directs interested readers to. Also, and once again, the notability of Guild Wars is not being disputed here— merely the individual notability of various NPCs within that game world. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 00:41, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: I noticed after reading the article on "cruft" that it usually hints towards those issues but by itself doesn't necessarily indicate an article has those issues. That aside though (since that's not the crux of the argument), I am aware that your issue with the article was that the characters are "not-notable" and that is a fair challenge to make. As I mentioned earlier there is a lot of background lore and information on these characters available through the course of the game (which will be hard to verify for anyone who hasn't played the game) and through the GW Manual and Lore section (which will be easier to verify since this information is publically available from the Guild Wars website). I guess one of the interesting dilemmas about fictional characters in games is "Does anyone actually take notice of them?" This will depend on the game's player demographics and the genre of the game. Characters and storyline tend to be crucial to the success of games in the adventure and RPG genre - although whether a majority of the gamers actually take any notice of the NPCs in Guild Wars, I'm afraid I cannot give a definitive answer, although my view is that they do - hence the inclusion of the articles&#160;:). --<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambutaan_be5a.html" title="User:Rambutaan">Rambutaan</a> 02:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As has been repeatedly pointed out in this AfD, these characters are not notable. Notability of a character does not increase with the quantity or quality of text written about them, so this is not a simple matter of cleanup as you make it out to be. The game manual does not count as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary source</a> for citations of notability (because of a clear conflict of interest) and no one yet has shown where outside the Guild Wars fanbase these characters have become notable. The game certainly is not a reliable source as it cannot be cited. Even ardent Guild Wars players in this AfD have argued that these articles serve no purpose.

<dd>Do you play guild wars to say such a thing? The idea isnt that they are notable to everyone on the planet, as per WP:FICT they are main characters given a spin off article on the basis they no longer fit in the main article. Also WP:V doesnt state that sources have to attest to notability, just that they have to say the item exists, is real etc. Which the manual does state them as main characters in Guild Wars. As for notability if the character is noted in the games manual, then they are obviously a main character. Please again read over WP:FICT, these main characters are given spinoff articles on the basis they do not fit in the main article. THe manual is a WP:V valid source because its a first party source talking about itself. How can the manual by the game company about the game not be a reliable source about the game. Its like saynig a book by an author cannot determine the facts of what happens in itself. There is no more reliable source then the creators themselves. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:11, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also you are arguing that the game is notable but the story is not. Furthermore a book is a valid primary source, you do not need someone saying Drizzt is a main character in the Dark Elf Triology, the book already states him as a main character. So no its not a valid secondary source, its a valid primary source. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:21, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are talking about sources for different things. I want reliable secondary sources that assert the notability of Mhenlo, for example, not that he exists as a main character, which I don't dispute. And no, I don't play the game, but several people who do and are regulars at guildwiki have voted to delete here. In any event, whether I play the game or not is irrelevant to the nomination. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 20:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldnt you be basically admitting your guage of notability is if you know about it then? If the people who created the story assert him as a main character then he is obviously notable to the people who engage in that story. The story itself determines who the main characters are, not reliable third party sources. Unless of course your guage of this is if you yourself without doing research know about that topic.

<dd>You continue to miss my point. I have never disputed that these characters are "major characters" in the Guild Wars plot, but the question continues to be whether detailed exposition on these characters is necessary, i.e., whether these characters are notable. As it currently stands, every single character article is a stub, and, based on the very comprehensive guildwiki, I find it hard to believe that these articles can be expanded significantly without entering game guide territory. You should refresh your memory of what a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> is for Wikipedia; remember that we cite <i>secondary sources</i>, not primary sources, for critical topics such as notability. An assertion of notability in a primary source is not valid. It appears from your comments below that you do not consider this AfD to be in good faith. I am sure the closing admin will take your opinion into account, and there is no reason for us to keep repeating the same two points. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 21:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>(indented)Just because you want something doesnt mean its required. A primary source has been provided.</p>
<p>Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is relevant to the person's or organization's notability;</li>
<li>It is not contentious;</li>
<li>It is not unduly self-serving;</li>

<li>Zer0faults, you have quoted the reason why these characters do not deserve their own pages and why the list page which Kaustuv has created is the best compromise solution for the characters pages. <i>(if there is enough content for the character)</i> - most the characters have no motivation or back story beyond what is given in the manual and their actions in the games add little more. The manual content is all the information there is on the character, hardly more than a paragraph of content when it is distilled down and re-written to be encyclopedic. Kaustuv's page represents the best solution which compromises between our different opinions on notability, quantity of available content and wikipedia standards. --Aspectacle 23:14, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not sure what all the attacks are about - article passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> at least in part (any parts failing can be excised, but the article <i>as a whole</i> does not so <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is not a valid criterion for deletion), article passes or is very close to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - but the article is not <i>hopelessly pov</i> or even <i>strongly pov</i> - point of view is not a criterion for exclusion. The neologism is a little tougher to address, but I'm pretty sure this can get past there too. The content seems perfectly encyclopaedic. The article definitely needs some copy-editing, but that's hardly a cause for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are now some sources. A blog, two columns by Nicholas Kristof and a single comment by Alex Kirby saying that "one unkind individual" had used the phrase. Taking the three <i>reliable</i> sources togaether, it would appear on the surface that this is a term coined by Kristof and not widely used by anyone else (144 unique Googles). I'd say merge to <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_evil.html" title="Axis of evil">axis of evil</a> or <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_weasels.html" title="Axis of weasels">axis of weasels</a>.

<li><b>Merge</b> Rereading the article, along with the addition of the new sources, it appears three, not two of the sources are written by Nicholas Kristof, as the blog is a copy of a news report by him which contains an identical paragraph to his other newsarticle. That being said, the term also gathers rather few google hits, compared to the millions that the term "axis of evil" gathers. It would be most suitable to merge this "Other Use" of the term "Axis of Evil", to the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_Evil_ddb6.html#Other_uses" title="Axis of Evil">Axis of Evil Other Uses</a> section. --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorqin_0917.html" title="User:Porqin">Porqin</a> 13:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or weak merge to AoE. Do not keep. It's a pun and a neologism. A neologism is by definition something that someone has written in some publication or antoher. There was an article posted on <a href="../../../p/n/t/WP%7EPNT_42b9.html" title="WP:PNT">WP:PNT</a> a month or two back. The article was translated from Russian to English. The word itself was not of russian origin, but it was written about several times about several different topics in several different scholarly journals dating back to the 1950 or so. It was still not notable enough to keep. Neither is this. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 05:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi there,</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a new page: a work in progress. We are still working on it, and would like it if you don't delete it, at least until we have completed it.</p>
<p>We are a constantly-growing community, and we think that this page could be used to gain more members. This is my reason for creating this page, as well as offering an insight into our game. We think of ourselves a bit like Runescape, which has its own page on here....</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per what Chelsea fan just said. even if it actually does exist, its non-notable, has no players, and the article was posted here to "gain more members"-----&gt; advertising. get rid of it. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenji64_138b.html" title="User:Benji64">Benji64</a> 14:27, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you're gonna delete it, fine, but I never said we have no members. We want it, yes, for adveritising, partly, but secondly, for information on the rpgs that are out there. There are probably people who want to know about harry potter rpgs, and we want to tell them about our one.</p>

<li>The number of members fluctuates, it would be sky high if like Runescape we didn't remove inactive member accounts. Admittedly we do not have a runescape gathering and this article is not solely advertising. The site is celebrating its 3rd birthdya a month from now and that shows it has stood the test of time and even a complete site move and overhaul. This actual point of such an article is to mark the history of the site itself. The article on the history is currently being written so that it is of an acceptable standard for such a prodigious site such as this. We wouldn't want to submit a sub standard finished article.</li>

<p>Ok, so this is one of the best rp boards i have ever been on and I've been on my share. /We want to gain more members so that people will experience what a message board rpg can be like. i've never had a greater experience in my life, and you can check out <a href="http://s15.invisionfree.com/HogwartsProphecy/index.php?act=idx" class="external free" title="http://s15.invisionfree.com/HogwartsProphecy/index.php?act=idx" rel="nofollow">http://s15.invisionfree.com/HogwartsProphecy/index.php?act=idx</a> and see for yourself, just because we don't have hundreds of thousands of people, there are very few accounts that don't post on a regular basis.</p>
<pre>
But those are not our main reasons for deciding to create this.  Our main reason is just to put information out there to inform those who may be looking for an RPG to join.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to figure out why you people care so much about this article being deleted. It isn't harming anyone and it helps the people of the site. The site might be small, but to the people on the site, it is important.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The site itself is not what you might think, a littel group of people in a tiny village in some unknown state. We have members from all over america, england, lebanon, austrailia, europs, asia. Our member number fluxtuate over teh summer which is approaching now. Remember that this is a site aimed at anyone and everyone and seems very popular with the kids. Teenagers come on to express themselves and do a great job at it. Do you want to deprive other teenagers of the same priviledge.</li>

It is also altogether likely that a user who properly nominates an article for deletion on the day he arrives is somewhat familiar with the project from his having contributed anonymously/under a different account, such that the ascription of the term <i>new user</i> (especially where intended derisively) is inappropriate. In any case, the question of the notability of secondary schools is probably well-settled (notwithstanding that some, as I, disagree with a categorical rule, as evidenced by some users' supporting <i>delete</i>), but it's eminently unlikely that even a longtime user who doesn't frequent AfD would be cognizant of the relevant history, and, so, where a nomination is sincerely essayed (with encyclopedic purpose in mind), it seems better to advise than to upbraid the nominator, especially where an AfD isn't particularly disruptive; our discussing an issue a bit more isn't harmful. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There <i>is</i> an overwhelming predecent established over the past 2 years where not a single, verifiable high school article has been excised from wikipedia. Remember, this is a discussion. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenji64_138b.html" title="User:Benji64">Benji64</a> never said he was stating a "policy", he was giving the rationale behind his vote - which is that there is a clear precedent that high school articles are not deleted through the deletion processes on Wikipedia. Stating that no high schools are deleted is not "proof by repeated assertion", it is a <b>fact</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> clearly shows the results since January of 2005 (as I am sure you are well aware). I would also like to note, since you referred to it another AfD discussion, that <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_High_schools_938a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/High schools">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/High schools</a> includes many nominations from the year 2004 which ARE NOT high schools (despite the title) and that the great majority of high schools which are listed on that page that were indeed deleted have since been re-created and in some cases survived subsequent AfD discussions. With all due respect, the only "proof by repeated assertion" that I see in this context is that you have stated mulitple times that it isn't true that high schools are not deleted, however as the record shows, high school articles are indeed not deleted through deletion processes on wikipedia (obviously hoax, copyvio or non-verifiable schools notwithstanding).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>yer man i agree with the guy who said we arn't encyclopedic because we are not but as for 'bugwit' he just talks crap because we are a legit film prodction compant and our debut film which is nearly finished is professtional and having a professional premiere and as for his comments about my acting career, he didn't read it properly because they are not all uncredited and our film will soon be on there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.152.98.204 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.152.98.204_fafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.152.98.204">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe you should try to create the article again once your film is there. I think the message board posts regarding <i>"One Second Film"</i> on the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448975/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448975/" rel="nofollow">IMDB listing</a> say a lot about notability and legitimacy of the film company at this time. That is not to say that there's no future for the film company, but until that future happens...well, you said it yourself: not encyclopedic. As far as your acting career, I stand corrected. Of the 11 appearances listed on the IMDB listing, there is one credited role.

<p>The article, both the title and the body, is far too POV, original research, and reads like an op-ed piece. It's clear that this was written to prove a specific POV. All the major statements are unsourced (To wit, the entire opening section: "<i>Iran and Syria are the two main powers who support during that conflict the Hizbollah. An intellgence officer said, the true leaders of the operation are in Tehran and Damascus. Iran and Syria had supported the Hizbollah in the past. ... Although Iran has welcomed the fall of two of its historical enemies ... the presence of U.S. troops in two of Iran's immediate neighbors is seen as a threat.</i>"). Some minor points are sourced, but not from particularly well-known news agencies. I have no history editing the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, but this is obviously a POV fork from that article. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_RFC_4482.html" title="User:Asbestos/RFC"><font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font></a> 14:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi am against the deletion. It should be important to point out what's the role of Syria and Iran in the conflict. The reason is many even president bush and the israelian gouverment say Iran and Syria tried to make use the crisis for their own goals. So it should be clear, which reasons could the two countries have to make such a strategy and what is their role in the conflict. U can't put all of that in the main article cause if will be too much of it. I had <font color="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></font>just started the article. And in the german wikipedia is also such an artcile. I think such an article is important so u can point out what US and Israel say why these countries are part of the problem and it is also important because when Israel is going to attack Syria and later we will ask why they had done it, so we have sucn an article and find out why this was happen and so on. There was a fast deletion and it was failed. Now that entry. I think it would be better to work on the article.&#160;:( It's also sad that the person doesn't wrote a reason why the article should be deleted. So please <b>keep</b> it! i know there can be much better.

I'm not expressing an opinion on whether we should have an article about it, but the present article is not it and should be nuked. In any case this is also a terrible name for the article.

<dd>I disagree. The article, begining with the title, is POV, OR, and a bazillion other stuff that ill let wikicounsels get on with, but its main wrong is that it excludes the role of other non-combatant countries in the conflict. For example, it excludes the role the USA in the conflict which, to paraphrase you, anyone who "understand much of the conflict and geo-political issues going on" is aware of.</dd>

<dd>An alternative that the existence of this page raises is that there might be a need for a page on the role of non-combatant nation states in the conflict, not just Iran and Syria in particular.

<li>Because we don't need an entire article to point that out. That could be mentioned in the main article, properly sourced. Creating an entire article with this title gives the appearance of WP having a POV. And sure enough, when I go to read the article, it's full of POV all over as explained above.

<li>No I dont think that helped, however I appreciate the attempt. The question is, what is this POV everyone keeps talking about? The countries who support Hezbollah do it openly and proudly, the countries who do not like this, despise it openly. What is this POV that is being enforced if the article stays with a rewrite? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you see POV and I don't there's a chance there is some there, and vice versa. If you and a LOT of other people see POV and I don't there's a really GOOD chance there is POV there. A LOT of people see POV in how this current article is written. So it's almost certainly (not 100% certain, I guess, but almost certainly) there even if you don't see it. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 11:40, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No it doesnt as you didnt actually say anything. I am sure if there is a POV in the article title, someone can surely say what it is instead of just stating there is POV. Its ok however since Vjam was nice enough to point out a misunderstanding I had. I personally have never seen Syria deny funding Hezbollah, but he was kind enough to actually present a source. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 15:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, unless someone is able to do the subject justice PDQ. It's too much of an eyesore to wait around for that to happen. On the POV question raised by Zer0faults, I think it very likely that Damascus and Iran support and even, to some extent, direct Hezbollah. However that is my POV. I'm pretty sure there is no evidence for this. Iran and Syria certinly deny it (where do you get your information to the contrary?). There are some claims coming out of Washington that its a well known fact, certainly, but that's not evidence.

<li>I take this was in trply to me so I moved it up. Again I am not stating they are fighting there, they support the group diplomatically and financially. The article states <b>"no Iranian Revolutionary Guards fighting alongside Hezbollah in Lebanon."</b> If that is the impression I gave, that I am stating Iran is at war or giving troops that was not what was meant. Again Iran and Syria openly support this group, so what is the POV? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:54, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The Syria article denies sending weapons, not funding or supporting. Furthermore it goes on to state <b>"Syria says it does have influence it could exert on Hezbollah. But it's also telling Washington: Play ball with us and we'll help you; don’t, and we won't. "</b> But anything taken from that would be OR. Again both countries openly support Hezbollah, so where is the POV? --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 20:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There's support as in "side with" and support as in "help". We're concerned with the latter here. The article on Iran says: <i>"Iran claims it gives only moral support to Hezbollah. On Saturday Abbas Ali Kadkhodai, spokesman for Iran's powerful Guardian Council, reiterated Iran's assertion that it has no influence over the group"</i>. The Syria article, you are right, only has them denying shipping weapons, but, since a negative apparently needs proving, here's another which is more explicit: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060719/19syria.htm?s_cid=rss:site1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060719/19syria.htm?s_cid=rss:site1" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> <i>"We do not provide Hezbollah with arms," Moustapha insisted in a conversation at Syria's embassy in Washington. He also denied charges that Syria had provided Hezbollah with financial support or that Syria enjoyed decisive influence with Hezbolla.</i> Now, I don't really believe any of that, but it doesn't seem there is any evidence to say otherwise (although there are statements made in Washington etc which get repeated in the media, and people end up believing that some evidence must exist. But it doesn't seem to).--<a href="../../../v/j/a/User%7EVjam_1a2c.html" title="User:Vjam">Vjam</a> 21:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe this is the wrong place for this. You want to go to Deletion Review if you have any procedural problems with the AfD.

<li>To quote <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:deletion policy</a>: "there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations," and it has been several months since the last nom. There has also been a new precedent set in the mean time, and I feel this article should be considered in light of that. Deletion review is to restore deleted articles or dispute an admin's ruling on an AFD, not delete kept articles months after a proper afd. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 18:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strongest possible delete</b>. These "list of cliches" articles are all opinion, no sources. <i>Someone else</i> has to say that these are cliches, Wikipedia cannot say it. The article's fundamental concept is based on an original research assumption, and encourages other editors to freely add their opinions to the ever-growing list, like a parlor game. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 16:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongest possible delete</b>. I'd point out the bias and unverifiability of the article. I concur that even with examples given, this is still original research and very UNWikipedian IMHO. And I also agree that this article will grow and change like <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listeria_monocytogenes.html" title="Listeria monocytogenes">LISTeria</a> if it is allowed to stay. But I don't feel the need to explain these views, as I expect most actual Wikipedians will share and explain them far more elaborately than I could. <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkred; font-weight:bold">HOWEVER</span>, I WILL point out that the grammar throughout the article is (IMO!) disgusting, or at least.... If it's written in my language and dialect, it is intolerable and should be deleted ASAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do I think it could not be not simply edited? Such editing would only be a viable option if changes to the article could only be made by (for example) a specific administrator. What I'm trying to say here is, the article is virtually unreadable. I believe that it is garbage and will remain garbage if something drastic is not done "NOW".

<li>Notability (or lack thereof) does not appear to be a valid reason for deleting an article; or, at least, a few hours browing the various policies and guidelines make no mention of it, other than it having never been made into a real policy... though it does make mention of many WPers abusing it as if it was so.

<dd>You make a good point about edit-warring but I disagree about the response. Namely, given the proliferation of articles and AfDs, it might be better to put all the different movements in one article and give them each a section. There would be edit-warring (I don't want to be around) but hopefully fewer AfDs, which drain the broader community. I don't know, though; you may be right -- it's a muddle.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 17:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with that is that most of the available material about the orgs will be from their web site. Such autobiographical web references are only allowed in articles about the org itself per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - "Delete" because notability still has not been shown. POV, vanity, etc can always be cleaned up but an article is either notable or not. I'll be happy to change my vote if notability is shown. "Weak" because I think <i>collectively</i> there must be something notable about the various Gnostic Movement groups that keep getting articles about their <i>individually non-notable</i> groups; these articles keep getting deleted amid controversy. It would be good to have one article that combines all these groups in one place (see my response to 999 above). Having said that, my thought that there's something notable about the groups collectively still has to be proven so in the meantime I'm voting to delete. If an acceptable Gnostic Movement article isn't doable, perhaps give them each group one bullet point each in the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samael_Aun_Weor_9455.html" title="Samael Aun Weor">Samael Aun Weor</a> article, assuming it's notable. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<li><b>Keep and tag for cleanup/npov.</b> POV isn't reason enough for a delete, IMHO. Honestly, the notability of the subject matter should matter lot more. As noted above, there's a lot of history to this article and the subject matter seems notable enough for inclusion to Wikipedia. To delete an article because its easier than actually putting in the work to make it a GOOD article is, in my opinion, a less-than-optimal choice. As a matter of full disclosure, this article was prodded a while back and I removed the prod for similiar reasons (POV not sufficient for deletion).

<p>From what I can tell, this article is about whichever open-wheel racing series was most popular at the time in the US (note that there has never been anything called "American Championship Car Racing"). Organizing this information like this is borderline <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It could be split or merged into about a half-dozen different articles, but it would be better to just delete it so people can concentrate on contributing to the articles on the individual series. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 16:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rename</b> to something like History of Open Wheel Racing in the U.S., unless something like that already exists. The strife between the series is very notable, and it would be nice to have the transistions between series in one place. Plus, the article is a very good start and could be improved. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogicaldisaster_a8d3.html" title="User:Logicaldisaster">Logicaldisaster</a> 23:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - but rename and expand per Logicaldisaster. We do need a Wikipedia article about the very convoluted and contentious internecine warfare that has dogged big-time open-wheel racing in America since the 1970s. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:10, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This article is the page for generic information about Championship Car racing and the place to link to when not wanting to link to one specific series. Without this, text in articles would be more unwieldy as multiple links and over-explanation would need to be added to them. Closer reading of the article will show that is not about the "racing series (that) was most popular at the time", but rather the evolution as <a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_e1fa.html" title="AAA">AAA</a> was the sanctioning body from 1909-1955, followed by <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAC_8a8d.html" title="USAC">USAC</a> 1956-1978, battle/evolution to <a href="../../../c/a/r/CART_0ea7.html" title="CART">CART</a> in 1979-1980 and then the famous <a href="../../../i/r/l/IRL_9d17.html" title="IRL">IRL</a> split in 1996. A driver who raced across these transitions would need additional article text. You should note that &gt;100 drivers link to this page through a redirect of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Championship_Car_857f.html" title="Championship Car">Championship Car</a>. If a rename is necessary, I suggest that the redirect be reversed, but I feel that this should not be done here, but rather via a poll on the article talk page. BTW, "Open Wheel" is not appropriate, as that topic is too generic, including F1, sprint car and midget car as well. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 03:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The only source I can find that calls it "Championship Car" is <a href="http://www.rumbledrome.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rumbledrome.com" rel="nofollow">rumbledrome.com</a>, which in fact calls it "American Championship Car Racing" exactly (same author?).

<li><b>Strong Keep and possible Rename</b>. The article spans the gap between the different sanctioning bodies that sanctioned a "breed" of cars called Champ cars or Indy cars. The article name isn't very good. I go with Brian G's suggestion of "Championship Car racing", or with the rename to the redirected "Championship Car". --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 04:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> For over 70 years the series was/were referred to as "Championship Car" and I wouldn't be opposed to a rename to that. Anyone familiar with the subject would agree that no article on an individual series could adequately describe the history of this series and race lineage. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Economaki_644a.html" title="Chris Economaki">Chris Economaki</a> still refers to open wheel racing as "Championship Car". -<a href="../../../d/r/d/User%7EDrdisque_8d32.html" title="User:Drdisque">Drdisque</a> 06:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There needs to be a central article that people who aren't aware of the convoluted history of the top level of American single seater racing can go to - articles on CART, IRL and the rest should be daughter articles from here. I also support the proposal that there should be <i>consideration</i> of a rename, but I don't have sufficient background in US racing to help much in deciding what it should be. Ideally this article should be called whatever it is that Joe or Joanne Public is most likely to type in when searching for 'the top single seater series in the US'. I've got a nasty feeling that would be 'Indycar' however, which takes us right back into the IRL/CART split. Maybe each daughter article could have a brief explanation at the top: "This article covers the history of the Indy Racing League (or whatever). The overall history of top level single seater racing in the US is given at (Insert name here)". <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 30 July</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Looks like a hoax article, and I believe the nominator that no relevant ghits were found. I certainly found none for the supposed forthcoming album once I eliminated Wikipedia and Answers.com from the search. Starts with "This article relates to Charles Mason, the philosopher. For Charles Mason, the astronomer, see <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mason_aa49.html" title="Charles Mason">Charles Mason</a>." but has an intro that says "Charles Mason (born 14 September 1950) is a pro-Western political revolutionary and musician." (note - no mention of being a philosopher in intro). Later it says "Believed to be the illegitimate son of General Carlos Suárez Mason, a hardline general at the heart of Argentina's pre-Falklands dictatorship, he eschewed his grandfather's political beliefs." (There is no antecedent for the pronoun phrase "his grandfather".) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, with a little hesitancy. The absence of sources or verifiaility are sufficient grounds to delete, but if half what is claimed here is rue, it's a an account of a quite remarkable person. But without sources, have to assume it's a hoax. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 08:54, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. The lack of verifiable sources is a clue, but for me the giveaway is: the article states he was born in 1950 and was the son of General Carlos Suárez Mason. However, if you check the history in the original version, he is the grandson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Mason_%28philosopher%29&amp;oldid=34251872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Mason_%28philosopher%29&amp;oldid=34251872" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. Carlos Suárez Mason died in 2005 aged 81, so would have been 26 at the time of the supposed birth: both he <i>and</i> his son would have had to be 12 at the time of the respective conceptions. Fairly unlikely, so it was updated to be more believable. Aside from that, without sources it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> so should be deleted anyway. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 12:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subject is not deserving of a Wikipedia entry - it is nothing more than a vanity entry (something that is borne out of the fact that the Wikipedia account that created this entry - twosheds 316 - is the same account name that he used all over the internet for Instant Messaging programmes, websites and the like). With that in mind, and that it goes against Wikipedia's content policy (don't write entries about yourself), I would urge you to consider this subject for deletion.XstraightX420</p>
<ul>
<li>I absolutely agree with the above claim. It's a complete vanity piece and is completely undeserving of an entry in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamous_Mortimer_c219.html" title="User:Famous Mortimer">Famous Mortimer</a> 18:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just adding my full two cents again. There are plenty of other wrestling and MMA writers who deserve Wikipedia entries - people who are actually known throughout the world, rather than to a small audience. The fact that he feels the need to boost his ego by citing a list of "awards" that he allegedly won by voting multiple times for himself on a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, writing for a web blog on a website that takes just about anyone (see Eurosport) does not make you a credible writer, in my view. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a Wikipedia entry that he/someone has done to put on his resume - something that you can tell by the lack of depth that the writer has given to each section of his "life".XstraightX420</p>

<li><b>Keep:</b> In this article's first nomination for deletion, the sole reason it was nominated was because it was linked to three other entries all of which cited material by a single author and therefore deleted for 'orignial research'. It is no longer linked to any other terms and it now sites material by the U.S. Army War College Library, an extremely reliable source. Jointness is a well known terminology used by many countries; it is definitely not original research or a Non-notable neologism. If you search the phrase on google, you will get thousands of entires. This material meets the relevant content criteria for Wikipedia and I do not think it needs to be deleted.--AvivaS 06:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b>This term appears multiple times in reliable internet sources; it is definetly not a non-notable neologism and should not be deleted on this basis.Ispivak22 07:11, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, "notability" or the lack thereof is not a valid deletion criterion for schools, and attempts to make it so in previous discussions have failed. I understand that the nominator does not believe that <i>schools are inherently notable</i> and that belief is fine as a justification for a vote or even a nomination, but just because you say that schools aren't inherently notable doesn't make it so.

The failure to reach a consenus at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> does not mean that elementary schools or indeed any schools are thusly to be excised from wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I did <b>not</b> say my basis for deletion was lack of notability. If that was the sole reason, I'd have kept my peace. My main basis was that it is not <b>encyclopedic</b> ("<i>this article, based on its own merits, has no encyclopedic value and must go</i>"). I agree, an article cannot be included or excluded on the basis of notability <i>alone</i>, but it would be foolish to say that notabilty cannot be a criterion which is considered in the light of all other factors. To determine whether something is encyclopedic, we have to have some sort of rational criteria to make that determination. One of those means is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. How does this article expand our knowledge and understanding of schools? How is this article not just an indiscriminate directory listing? All in all, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_infinitum.html" title="Argumentum ad infinitum">argumentum ad infinitum</a> has prevailed to make high schools "inherently" encyclopedic (or notable). Now that proposition is being extended to elementary schools (a slippery slope the nay-sayers said wouldn't happen). It strikes me as an odd double-standard that the local elementary school is now somehow worthy of an article, but the church next door to it or the little league playing in its field is not (not that they should be). I need to provide a reason why the article is not encyclopedic (which I believe I did, you're free to disagree). It is not for me to prove lack of notability; however, if someone wants to maintain that something is encyclopedic because, in part, it is notable, they'd better offer more convincing criteria than repetition. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Librarianofages, shouting, like repetition, is not persuasive (and I thought shouting was not allowed in libraries). Neither is a critical review of the so-called <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a> page. It is not a record of consensus, and it is not accurate. I should note it is not entirely wrong for Schoolwatch to be biased (and as a user page it's <i>not</i> subject to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), as its creator is obviously of the opinion that all school articles must be kept and he is entitled to that opinion. However, what is wrong is for it to be misleading, depending on what purpose it is used for. As a record of "keep" and "delete", it's fine. However, if used by anyone for the purpose to "prove" consensus or anything beyond a track record, it is not. I've spent (wasted?) a ton of time actually checking the actual discussions of many, many of the articles. If "Schoolwatch" was really being fair, and if it was required to be of a neutral point of view (which a user page does not), then it would indicate which "keep" results were really because of a lack of consensus. I've counted at least a dozen high schools that in the past few months only survived because of a lack of consensus. It's also not an exhaustive list - there are school articles that had AfD discussions that are not on Schoolwatch (some were keep, some were delete, some were no consensus - to be fair, more were keep than delete). I also don't think it's fair to include in the count articles on what are not individual high schools or elementary schools, but are school-related subjects, like school districts or the odd university (although these do not puff up the numbers in a significant way). To say that the Schoolwatch list is "proof" of consensus (which Schoolwatch does not expressly state, but other users rely on that summary) is not at all correct. Based upon my long review, I suggest that Schoolwatch does not provide a reasonable basis on which one can conclude that there is a consensus, <i>one way or another</i>, keep or delete. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 03:33, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is true that the page being linked is anaemic and incomplete. The user in question was banned long ago and others sporadically maintain that page. Tha being said, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> is an accurate and virtually all-inclusive listing of all school article discussions since January of 2005. There may be the occasional AfD missing, but it would be very rare. A number of editors contibute regularly, who hold mulitple views on the noteworthiness of schools. Universities, colleges and other post secondary schools are included on the page, but AfDs on these sorts of schools are so rare as be inconsequential. It is a <b>fact</b> that not a single, verifiable high school article has been deleted through the wikipedia deletion processes in the past 2 years (substubs, hoaxes, copyvios, etc. notwithstanding). As to whether or not the result is recorded as "keep" or "no consensus" is really irrelevant because <b>policy</b> states that no consensus is keep. In an AfD discussion is <b>not</b> about whether or not there is a lack of consensus to keep an article, it is about whether or not there is a consensus to delete or not. There is no consensus to delete high school articles on the basis of their being "non-notable" or "unencylopedic" or "unimportant". Since no consensus exists to delete such articles, they stay. Also, since Grider's "schoolwatch" page is also called schoolwatch, you are confusing it with the page I have linked in some senses, most editors would consider <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> to be "Schoolwatch", not Grider's old page. You may wish to review that page rather than try to dredge through individual AfDs on your own, it really is unnecessary to do so. It should also be noted that some admins routinely close high schools as "no censensus" irrespective of predominating discussion in an AfD itself. I remember a VfD from last year where there was a solitary delete vote and about 25 keep votes and the closing admin still closed "no consensus" on the basis that school deletions are contentious. For the record, could you please point to the "at least a dozen high schools that in the past few months only survived because of a lack of consensus."??? I would like to see the specific "dozen" you are referring to. I can only find 2 such high schools since January, which were 9-5 and 9-4 in favor of <b>keep</b> - hardly "no consensus" by the traditional intrepretation on Wikipedia. A clear majority to keep is generally considered a consensus by most closing admins.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

This page is not necessary to for people to learn about education, but I still believe that it should have a place in Wikipedia. I propose a solution that should not anger everyone: I suggest creating a page ( perhaps titled "Notable Schools in New Jersey"), and letting anyone write about a school that they want to schowcase. This would allow for schools to express themselves, without compromising the encyclopedic values of Wikipedia.

As much as I try to understand the deletionist mentality, I fail to see why the solution is not to <b>improve</b> the article. Given that the nominator acknowledges this possibility, what on earth is lost by letting it evolve into a more encyclopedic article. I have added information to this article in the past, while others stand idly by.

<dd>See, I'm blind in my left eye. Can't see a thing. Could you help me out and quote where Alansohn said that there are six elementary schools? I just clicked that nice little link he gave me, and, lo and behold, that article said that there are four.</dd>
<dd>That said, that cuts the pool of potentially-interested people even thinner. Wikipedia doesn't have articles on books that only sell 5000 copies, Wikipedia doesn't have articles on people who know 5000 people, Wikipedia doesn't have articles on stores that have 5000 customers, and I don't think it should have an article on a school that, in the entire world, 5000 or less people are going to care about. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm pretty sure anyone with a first grade education can add three and three and get six. Second, where are you getting this number of 5,000? I know that all 29,644 people in Westfield would care about this page.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> While I truly appreciate Aeon Genesis' excellent translation efforts, they often choose cult and virtually unknown games. This game was never officially translated, and (I'm not sure honestly) it seems to have been unpopular as well, never having a sequel nor been made by a notable developer (Hummingbird Soft?). I'm open to hearing new information that could prove otherwise. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 23:59, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not even listed on GameFAQs. As far as I'm concerned any game that got a release on a major console in an English-speaking area is sufficiently notable. However, this didn't and has no apparent ties to anything that is notable in the Anglophone world, so delete. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 04:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a game released commercially on a major system. It doesn't have to be more notable then that. Aren'r wikipedia supposed to be a "complete" encyclopedia? Well, for that to happen we'll need this game too. Also, the game is featured on GameFAQs as "Laplace no Ma", due to the fact that the L doesn't exist in the Japanese language and a few other language rule that can be found on <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_writing_system.html" title="Japanese writing system">here</a>, the exact correct Japanese title is ラプラスの魔 which in romaji is written out Rapurasu No Ma. The reason why it's not listed as that is because it's reference to <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Simon_Laplace_cc1f.html" title="Pierre-Simon Laplace">this man</a>, thus we know that it's supposed to be Laplace, they just can't write it.

<dd>The name issue is, however weird it might sound, up to Gideon Zhi to decide. This is after all the English Wikipedia aimed towards English speakers, thus whatever title that game will have upon release of the patch, that is the name the game will have in it's English version, it's the name that English speakers will be most familiar with and also the name that the game will carry on the site.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree that we need to look beyond the Anglophone world. However, just because a game has been launched on a platform doesn't make it notable. The article, despite this AfD, has not been expanded to assert notability which leads me to suspect that there probably is none. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> - There is only one clear 'delete' vote, in addition to the nomination, which is an implicit 'delete' vote. I take Kenthicken to be in favour of 'keep'.

<li>The title itself is POV, because may of the incidents are only alledged to have been carried out by Syria. The article is original research because it relies primarily on primary sources for its claims. The article is inflammatory (though probably not intended to be) because of the current Middle Eastern tensions. How do you respond to this? Note that I have no particular axe to grind on this issue and do not really care for purposes of this debate whether Syria sponsors terrorism or not, the issue is whether it conforms to wikipedia policy. While the concept of such an article is not a bad one, the current article fails to be neutral and verifiable (verifiable in the sense that many of the acts are only alledged state terrorism without documentary evidence to back up the claim). <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the article desperately needs a good scrubbing, but
<ul>
<li>While it may contain some original research, it also has at least one good reference, <i>thus</i> the whole article cannot be label original research. Sections that are original research should be edited out, but the need here is a need for editing, not deletion.</li>
<li>While there may be some NPOV violations here, the focus of the article is not irredeemably POV, and thus again the solution is editing, not deleting.</li>
<li>Inflammatory is not a criterion for deletion, nor is it really a big deal.</li>

At any rate state-sponsored terrorism is widely-accepted to be the standard policy of several nation states, so an article of this nature is not unreasonable.

<li>You're right -- they came up with the word and use it as a company name, so it is not as widespread as "google". A person coming to wikipedia with the question "what is zenfolio?"

<p>This appears to be a CSD-A1 case: it lacks context to make it understandable. Nevertheless, it is long and detailed, so it has encyclopedicness (it's a word!) on its side. It might need to go, to clean-up, to be renamed, to be merged... and the original nominator didn't know as s/he left it orphaned. I'd like the community - and experts in the subject if possible - to decide on.

<li><b>Keep</b> She passes the google and name recognition tests laid out in the biography guidlines. The recognition is largely limited to a niche audience, but it is a large niche as measured by cable ratings and by wikipedia entries. Many professional wrestling wikipedia entries have a section devoted to current activity, not all of which will be noteworthy in itself, but is important in relation to the character the entry is build around. This is a current event and can be marked as such. Time will tell if a deletion is necessary, but for the time being it fits in with the other professional wrestling articles. -- Honkus <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.14.206.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.14.206.230_6c76.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.14.206.230">contribs</a>).</small></li>

While i'm sure she will do something noteworthy eventually, right now the only thing she's "done" was had her birth announced on TV. She should be treated like all these other celebrity births and have her name be a re-direct page to her parent(s). Also, if she's anything like her cousins(Shane McMahon's kids) we won't hear anything more about her for quite some time. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 00:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> Why should she get her own page when she hasn't done anything at all? There isn't even a picture of her anywhere. At least Shane's kid was on TV before therefore if she gets one then he should too since he at least was on TV once and all she did was have her name mentioned on TV while we actually got to see Shane's kid on Wrestlemania which is a bigger event then RAW is and he got to actuallty be shown on it. Besides even if she is in a storyline, she still shouldn't be on TV unless Rey's son also gets a article dedicated for him.--69.107.90.14 04:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Brandon Vedas is not in of himself notable. This page is not appropriate and the arguments given in the previous nomination for deletion do not give significant justification for a page dedicated to this individual. I argue that while Brandon Vedas might be appropriately mentioned as a case study in a scholarly sense, he is not notable outside of high level research in sociology and is not notable at an encyclopedic level. I use an analogy based on a situation described on the AfD page:</p>
<p>- An article about a band and three articles about its members, none of whom has done anything else notable outside of the band.</p>
<p>The previously given arguments identify the sociological context of Brandon Vedas but no notable individual contributions. mikebutterfield <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mikebutterfield (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikebutterfield_d9ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikebutterfield">contribs</a>) 20:42, December 22, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Basically, the nominator isn't listing a specific <i>good</i> reason why we should delete the article and goes straw-manning. Yeah, the guy didn't do anything remarkable in life. No one's denying <i>that.</i> However, his manner of death was remarkable, and has caused tons of interesting discussion, all of which is notable in itself. Now allow <i>me</i> to go straw-manning: Billy Foghorn, 25, was the first victim of the Great Andromedan Invasion of 2009 as the UFOs blasted him to bits on his field. His last words, captured by the automatic video monitoring system black box of his combine harvester, shocked the world. ("Oh darn it. Not again.") Sure, you could cover that in the GAIO2009 article, <i>but the newspapers happened to talk about the poor guy to death</i> so that's whom they are looking up, even if he was just an ordinary farmer. And we don't have a specific "big picture" article like that in this case; There's no article about the Great Told-You-I-Was-Hardcore Moral Panic of 2003. I'm staying by my previous recommendation. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 10:22, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. You just <i>think</i> it'll be a mess? First, lets establish actual problems with the article first, and not just projected ones. Next, you need to justify why these problems make this an invalid topic for WP. WP should never cower from controversial topics nor should it use controversy as a justification to not cover them. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 20:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Did you try reading the article as it stands now? It is already a mess. And I'm not saying Wikipedia should avoid controversial topics. If people make notable comparisons between these two operating system, that should be indicated (with sources) in the articles for the OSes themselves (for example, see "Criticism" in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>). <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 21:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's a mess, it can be cleaned up. Sources are necessary, but there's plenty of info in the article that should be simple to find sources via Google, and the cruft can be easily removed, after discussion on the talk page. You haven't touched upon why the topic is outside of WP's bounds, and I don't believe your lack of faith of WP editors to create a balanced, sourced NPOV article to be enough. The article is less than 48 hours old already, at the very least give it some time to justify your lack of faith. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 22:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you really think there is something worth salvaging perhaps you would like to demonstrate? And if you seriously think this article will develop into a "balanced, sourced NPOV article" any time soon, would you mind explaining why, after 23 months, the similarly themed <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_Windows_and_Linux_48f9.html" title="Comparison of Windows and Linux">Comparison of Windows and Linux</a> hasn't? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 00:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think I have the burden of proof in this regard, and you demonstrated only non-fatal issues with another article, not this article, nor the genre of articles they are a part of. Besides, <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> clearly states the preferred remedy for bias in articles (heavy or not) is tagging the article with a {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENpov_9149.html" title="Template:Npov">npov</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_check_1bb0.html" title="Template:POV check">POV check</a>}} or listing at <a href="../../../p/n/a/WP%7EPNA_3f49.html" title="WP:PNA">WP:PNA</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 01:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

I'm a bit cynical of the chances of this article developing into something great, because it attempts to cover an <i>extremely</i> broad subject, and the next versions of both Windows and OS X are going to throw the whole thing into further chaos. IMO, the only hope for this kind of article is to focus on specific issues, like differences between the user interfaces of the two operating systems.

<li><b>delete</b> it is close to a copyvio from the book discription at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520231910/104-1958286-8842326?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520231910/104-1958286-8842326?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">amazon</a> which mostly bothers me because it show that the author of the article didn't read the book! There is no context given on how she was accepted by mainstream movements or who she really way. It is clear from the book summary that she was far from accepted, but it is impossible to know to what extent just from a book summary. The article implies that she was well accept but I doubt very much that this is true. This is the type of thing that would remain a stub for years with no one ever bothering to accutally read the book. Unless someone is willing to put in the effort to expand this I think that keeping a stub is harmful and misleading. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 02:37, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think it deserves more discussion. I'm concerned that there is not enough verifiable information about Gore for a fair article on him to exist right now. He has been ticketed by police a few times, which made the news. But that's the only thing beyond his early childhood that's verifiable, because Gore has assiduously maintained his privacy. As far as I know, he has yet to answer a question from a reporter or make a public statement in his life. Keep-voters in the old VfD argued an analogy with the Bush daughters and Chelsea Clinton, but this seems like a false analogy, because these people have given high-profile interviews and speeches, a point that was not raised in the VfD. <a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 20:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I haven't read the whole book yet, but I read that section after you posted this. It's four pages long, and the book doesn't seem to have anything it calls chapters.

Instead, Gore Jr. focuses on the facts of the accident and recovery and their impact on his own thinking about the importance of global climate change.

<li>I respect your opinion; and I can't deny that you have, technically, given an example of Gore being in the press. But I would like to point out that the author of that L.A.

<li>Right, it's not <i>about</i> Gore, but I bring it up as an indication that he's famous enough to be mentioned in an article, even if he's doing nothing more than sitting on a couch. &#160;;) I think the mention in the documentary is more indicative of name recognition. Having said that though, I wouldn't be strongly opposed to a merge, and I do agree that the nomination is thoughtful and well-written.

Were he a biographical subject only in view of his being related to a notable personnage, I'd likely think deletion (or redirection to <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>) appropriate (as I did, for example, at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Suri_Cruise_ba87.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suri Cruise">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suri Cruise</a>), if only because of what we'd expect to be an attendant dearth of biographical information. Sad though I am that the youngest Gore has experienced legal troubles—after all, I volunteered a great deal on his father's 1996 VP and 2000 Pres campaigns, during the latter of which I had occasion to meet Gore—those troubles have made him, à la <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dellums_4840.html" title="Michael Dellums">Michael Dellums</a> (a good analogue, I think), notable. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Arguendo; there's a new word for me. Your assumption is correct in reality as well as arguendo; Gore's attempts to remain a private person are only relevant insofar as they are successful. The Michael Dellums comparison is interesting. My impulse is to argue that murderers make the news even if they aren't politicians' kids, while DUIs don't (not counting the police blotter).

<li><b>Delete</b> In disagreement with <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a>, I believe that the legal troubles have only made the news because of his relationship to his father, and thus that he is a "biographical subject only in view of his being related to a notable personnage".

<li><b>Cautious Keep</b> Seems just about acceptable enough, if more info on the banning can be given. However, does the literature class understand that how Wikipedia works? It's an imaginative class assignment, but perhaps a bit misguided about what Wikipedia is. Will this page be the repository for 10 to 20 (or more?) class homeworks on this book? (And I assume that if this assignment is to be substantive - this is apparently an assignment for a <i>graduate-level</i> class, despite some high school-like writing here - these have to be homeworks of significant length). Will these homeworks be written in an encyclopedic fashion, or will they be typical student essays or will they be POV literary criticism guides or how-to teach this book guides? Those last three will raise alarm bells. Does the class understand that any Wikipedian can come along and change their homeworks freely? How will the class and teacher feel about that? Will they say that that would be disrupting their use of technology? Do they understand that Wikipedia is not a free resource for people to use any way they see fit?

<li>Well... I am the professor and this was not a homework assignment, but rather an in-class endeavor. As a class when we used Wikipedia to look up information about Chris Cruthcer and about his text Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes we were in shock to find that the Crutcher entry was quite short and that there were no entries for his novel. We decided to break into four groups: one to prvide informaiton on why the text is noteable, one to provide the plot information of the text, one to provide information on characters, and one to provide information on internal links. There is not 10 to 20 homework assignments being posted. We have blackboard and web-hosting technology of our to do that. This 'assignment' was a choice to provide the encyclopedia type entry information for a text that as a group we felt was worthy of more mention than Wikipedia had on it. Furthermore, Wikipedia is a space that users, when noticing a lack of informaiton should feel free to add. No one here offered opinion on the text saying it was a 'must read' or trying to sell it, but we want readers, educators, writers, and others to have access to the information about the text that they may seek. When looking at other pieces of fiction, the entires were rather short and provided less information than we did. We are in the process of editing, but felt rushed to get the information up since we were not given even a reasonable amount of time to get information up before the slew of delete tries came through. I think that in 2 hours, which is what we spent on it, we did a fine job of providing a decent entry, which leaves rooms for others to add to. A part of me is happy to know that Wikipedia is a self-policing community because as a professor when I tell students to use Wikipedia I am more assured of the quality of information they are seeing. I am really sad, however, that Wikipedia, or at least the people that have been somewhat brutal on here, have been so impatient. As educators we want to encourage our students to contribute in communities like the Wikipedia community, but how would they ever feel confident when they woudl not be given the space of 24 hours to work on an entry. I want to be CRYSTAL CLEAR that we were not creating a webpage on the Novel or tyring to ge free hosting --- OUR COLLEGE PROVIDES THIS FOR US --- we were and are trying to provide a valuable entry that others can reference when looking at young adult fiction! <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">Litclass</a> 05:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Explanation</b> This entry is not a homework assignment but a tool to inform others about Chris Crutcher's work. It was an in class assignment in which we created a site to support a book that has been challenged in many schools. We believe this book is worthy of recognition and have written a page to provide readers with information on Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes. This is a book that adolescents can relate to and benefit from reading. If one person reads this book due to this posting then the purpose has been achieved.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd suggest giving the class enough time to write the article and learn about Wikipedia as they go.

<li>What is really sad is that we are not even being given in a chance. In 24 hours we have gone through and created a full entry for this novel, a novel which is recognized as a popular piece of young adult fiction from a well known young adult fiction writer. Wikipedia claims to be a space where members create and work on the entries. If we look up MANY pieces of literature, the pages do not have nearly as much information as this page has. Furthermore, 'tone' is a matter of persepctive. The information in this entry, was written by educators who work with young adults, and is written in a format that will be 'reachable' for both adult and young adult. Young adults should be able to make the best of Wikipedia as an ency. resource with which they can access information, for example here, about text. There is plenty of information on this page which now alerts viewers to why the text it self is notable, the plot and characters are provided, along with a multitude of external links to guide viewers of the entry to more information about the text. This entry is quite informative, and is of equal value and style to many entries on pieces of literature. Thus, please stop trying to delte and get rid of this page. It is a good solid stub that others can continue to contribute to. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitclass_fc26.html" title="User:Litclass">Litclass</a> 05:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobody is "trying" to delete anything. You brought this on yourself by creating the article prematurely. Deletion discussions run for a full week. I don't think I've yet seen a case of an article being deleted if the topic was halfway reasonable and if the article creators put a halfway reasonable amount of good-faith effort into it. You just have to endure the ugly AfD tag. Remember that the guideline for administrators is that a two-thirds majority is normally required for deletion, although administrators may use judgement in ignoring things like "sockpuppet" votes. People regularly change their votes as articles improve.</dd>
<dd>In retrospect, it would have been better to concentrate on improving the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crutcher_e49f.html" title="Chris Crutcher">Chris Crutcher</a> article first, put individual book descriptions into that article, put redirects from the individual book titles, and only break out the individual titles when there were several paragraphs about the title.</dd>
<dd>As things are now, yes, you will have to endure seeing the ugly AfD label on the article for a few days. Tough it out. Concentrate on improving the article and resist the temptation to follow this discussion too closely.</dd>
<dd>I'm still not voting yet, but there's very little chance that the article will be deleted now. That's not to say the article is in good shape. The section on why the book is noteworthy is excessive but understandable. The entire article needs sources, sources, sources!

<li>Obvious keep in present state. Close to a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_stub_article_271a.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect stub article">perfect stub</a>. Well, more than a stub. To whomever wrote the previous section on why the book is notable: don't worry about its being chopped down. The bar for notability isn't really all <i>that</i> high, and <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> included all the important points concisely. On the removal of the long sections on characters and plot, it's probably better to start from scratch. My $0.02 is that we don't want a detailed plot summary, and we don't need anything but <b>short</b> descriptions of the <b>major</b> characters... and anything that's said should be backed up by source citations. Don't be afraid to add to or change the present article... see <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">the "be bold" policy</a>... and don't be upset if other people change your changes. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>P. S. Don't worry if you don't understand the reference apparatus, like the &lt;ref&gt; tags and the {{cite web}} template. Just put the reference in in any sensible way, other Wikipedians will be happy to do technical cleanup. For a web reference, just type the url within square brackets like this [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8] and it will come out like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060094893/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/102-8929316-0800935?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>.

<li>Wikipedia is not fun, you all are making this process disgusting. It is meant to be a fun experience where community can build, not tear down others works. just leave the page alone -- you haven't read the book and thus you don't know what it needs. Many people said KEEP our version and by the way Badlydrawnjeff keeps reverting so he too is in violation.

Due to missteps on the part of Litclass the article was created prematurely and nominated for deletion, but under the pressure of AfD notability was shown, and the article is in no danger of deletion. The outcome of interactions with others, particularly BadlyDrawnJeff, have resulted in the cleanup of the article and its transformation into a good short article. The material Litclass assembled has obviously been used and drawn upon by others. Litclass has also raised my own awareness, and probably that of others, that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Crutcher_e49f.html" title="Chris Crutcher">Chris Crutcher</a> is definitely notable and the article could use expansion.

<dd><b>Comment from Nominator</b>. I actually don't think anymore that this article deserves to be deleted. I'm sure it's easy to understand, however, why I nominated it in the first place. If you check the original page, you see that the article is a <i>clear</i> case of db-empty. It's a shame that the author wouldn't allow wiki-process to take place, but I guess it's somewhat understandable given her inexperience. Anyway, if nobody has any objections, I'll close this afd (I think I can close it as nomination withdrawn). Thank you all for your good feedback.

I am thankful to the handful that have had patience. We have been trying to do something that we would encourage educators and students alike to do -- contribute to Wikipedia. The real shame here is that <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threats.html" title="Threats">threats</a> and warnings are what is thought of as the first response instead of trying to let us participate with it and learn about it. I have gone to pages that some of our critics have contributed to, and am myself not overly impressed - so we ALL have room to grow. In 2 hours -- which is the amount of time that a majority of the entry was put together, we did a fantastic job that of course is open to editing. Cutting it down like badlydrawnjeff did, to nothing, and changing it so much that it lost important information about the book that a potential reader or anyone looking for a citation or reference would need was uncalled for. Huon's attitude has been so much more appropriate in dealing with this, and trying to make it a good page that others can use. Alphachimp has done nothing to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contribute.html" title="Contribute">contribute</a> to the viability of this page, yet in his own page he seeks to be an editor and someone with control at Wikipedia. Learning comes from teaching and doing, and while we have most def. learned a lot in this <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">process</a>, I wonder how much others who have been outright mean to us have learned about dealing with others. As much as you may think or try to be '<a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective.html" title="Objective">objective</a>' no encylopedia or other reference is truly objective --- any author brings a piece of herself or himself to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project.html" title="Project">project</a>. If you have nto read the book, read the book before lodging mean attacks that are meant to discourage us from participating in the Wikipedia community.

If we have an entire category about football/soccer culture and all the minutiae that goes along with that sport (don't get me wrong, I love that category), I fail to see why a single article about a facet of baseball culture that has been around for decades and shows how some players choose to present themselves to their home fans is problematic. It is not a catch-as-catch-can grab bag, as <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> has noted, but rather a list of the players and music that have made themselves notable in the sport over time.

<dd>There is an encyclopedic merit to music in baseball. Baseball, for 150 years, has been a major part of American (and Caribbean and Asian) society, something that has been reaffirmed by thousands of essays, museum exhibits and movies. The game has constantly come in contact with various aspects of daily life -- <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_films.html" title="Baseball films">film</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_first_pitch.html" title="Ceremonial first pitch">politics</a>, etc. An article about one of these connections is encyclopedic and relevant, even if it is a more modern phenomena. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 16:08, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. The list is has little to do with baseball as a game. Furthermore, while baseball has been around for a long time and is "America's Pastime", entrance music is quite new and rather trivial. A list of entrance music is nowhere near on the same level as articles on baseball films or a list of ceremonial first pitches (which have relevant historical and encyclopedic contexts outside of baseball). The list is irrelevant trivia about a minor aspect of player's tastes and ballpark atmosphere and as such, unencyclopedic <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 16:16, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article actually seems to have been at Votes for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion_archive_May_2004&amp;diff=2912263&amp;oldid=2912233" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion_archive_May_2004&amp;diff=2912263&amp;oldid=2912233" rel="nofollow">in March 2004</a> and reached a consensus to delete. However, about 7 hours after the last comment on VfD, it was instead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nude_chat&amp;diff=3196206&amp;oldid=2916028" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nude_chat&amp;diff=3196206&amp;oldid=2916028" rel="nofollow">kept</a> by <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">User:Jwrosenzweig</a>. I would have prodded or speedyed it, but I'm not quite sure where exactly this falls under process (might even be a DRV case), so I figured here was better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Basically, it's a dictionary definition of a self-explanatory term (starts out "Nude chatting is...chatting on the internet while they are nude"), with what I see as very little hope of it becoming anything more. This lack of hope is evidenced by the fact that in the 2+ years since the original VfD debate, it has seen no considerable edits except vandalism and the removal thereof, and anything that does currently exist beyond the original dicdef is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> with no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 21:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep:</b> I think this is a legitimate claim to notoriety, certainly much more immediate than many entries which delve into the obscure, yet maintain an intellectual nature and are therefore unquestioned. Furthermore, the longevity of the camp is notable. I'm really not sure why you want to eliminate this entry...

<li><b>Keep but move</b> as long as the copyright issues are addressed.

<dd>Similarly your edits on LTTE should be looked at in the same light. Were certain controversial incidents comitted by the LTTE or not&#160;? Was it LTTE policy or was it members of the LTTE doing it on their own. You seem to have one set of arguments for sham democracies and another for non-state actors.

<p>The sole incident of proven state terrorism (involving violence against civilians with sanction of the government at the time) is the entry relating to July 1983 riots.This is covered in entry on Sri Lanka in <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> page which hyperlinks to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_July_e757.html" title="Black July">Black July</a> page. Sole purpose of this page appears to be to portray Sri Lanka as a terrorist state by creating a huge list of falsities, irrelevancies and distortions(which I have highlighted on the talk page). The POV of the whole page is against Sri Lanka. <a href="../../../r/u/c/User%7ERuchiraw_fe8e.html" title="User:Ruchiraw">Ruchiraw</a> 23:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Tyronen. What do you propose renaming this article.

<p><s>:::Thinking about it, I propose the article be split into two.

The second should deal entirely with 1983 and after incidents, and that should stay as is, in the state terrorism section. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 16:37, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>I think the BBC is a reliable source. I think UNESCO is a reliable source. I think WSWS is a reliable source for their own allegations. If you'll read the article and look at how references are used, you'll see that although a few questionable references are used, they're used in appropriate contexts, and other more reliable sources are used in other contexts. Since the facts in the cases are generally disputed, of course you can trapse about saying <i>The allegations of group X are not proven</i> and this is made clear in the article - if you have a problem with the wording, that can be addressed. If you say <i>Every article that contains any disputed or unproven allegation should be deleted</i>, Hume would tell us we need to delete the whole encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> covers pretty well how to deal with these situations, and the article is doing a <i>reasonable</i> job thus far, and is still working towards perfection, which is acceptable for a new article. If you have a problem with a <i>specifc</i> citation bring it up on the talk page, but to suggest that the BBC is not a reputable source is disingenious. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see your point too, but unless we come to an understanding of what is a notable human rights violations, what is a war crime, what are state terrorism, what are attempted genocides, what is ethnic cleaning with respect to both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, the combined article is going to huge. In my view if we restrict this list to State terrorism by Sri Lanka to mean the government then it requires 2 more entries and we are done, that is the Eastern university massacres in which the military arrested 158 refugees from the University and killed them and the Chemmani mass graves where supposedly 600 disappeared people from Jaffna were buried. Off all listed items here, most can be argued that the perpetrators assumed impunity and inmost cases did enjoy impunity. Per the definition of State terrorism a government can sanction State terrorism through policy or conduct. Granting impunity to perpetrators after perpetrators is pushing the limits of State terrorism. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a></dd>

<li>If you see equally nonnotable related thingy in Wikipedia, the correct course of action is not to use it to justify your own actions. Instead you're free to nominate that stuff for deletion, which I just did. Let's discuss <i>this</i> plugin's notability here, and that plugin's notability <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Vbseo_0c51.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vbseo">there</a>. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Let's see: I read the article, and get hit by Search Engine Optomatisatisativition language (widely known as "sounds cool, just tricky to figure out what it actually means"). Then I try to think like the Apache monkey who tries to do what the SEO consultant says. And as an Apache monkey, I know the holy mantra, "mod_rewrite is like XML: if it doesn't work, use more." And then, I was shown a revelation: Oooo, so this article is about <i>a hack</i> that sits atop <i>Apache</i> that makes <i>phpBB URLs</i> actually look like they should have looked like in the first place. So it's a proggie that maps http://forum.example.com/viewtopic.php?t=12345 to http://forum.example.com/topic/12345... Stated that way, this software just doesn't sound notable at all; we don't even have articles for various different rewrite engines of web servers, just a <a href="../../../r/e/w/Rewrite_engine.html" title="Rewrite engine">generic article</a> that describes this arcane technical practice, and I believe that's all that's warranted; why should we have an article about a separate product that does something even <i>more</i> arcane?<br />
In short summary: Sufficiently advanced mod_rewrite is indistinguishable from Magic. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:16, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay... but why is vBSEO listed in wikipedia? Because vBSEO (and Magic SEO too) are not only mod_rewrite rules as you have described. Both products only use mod_rewrite to properly handle nice-url - mod_rewrite does not cover the way how are nice-url generated on the page. RAY 11:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Long story short, Vbseo is listed here because <i>someone</i> made an article - we don't get the articles pre-approved or anything, someone just made an article, whee. The reason it was kept so far was that no one asked whether or not the thing should be listed. Now that you've pointed it out, I've listed it on AfD too. We'll discuss vbseo's merits <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Vbseo_0c51.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vbseo">in its own AfD</a>. Thank you for pointing it out. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 11:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your clarification. I now understand why someone want to delete this article. I have only one note: it will be fair to keep both articles (vBSEO and Magic SEO) or delete both. RAY 12:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:20, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I forgot to say following idea: vBSEO and Magic SEO are not about rewrite rules for mod_rewrite. These products are about a techniques how are native URLs generated in the output of an internet software transfered to nice-keywords-urls - they does not require to make any changes in original internet software. It has nothing to do with mod_rewrite rules. This is the reason why can be listed in Wikipedia. I hope you understand me. RAY 00:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just because the sources aren't cited doesn't mean they don't exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> ...but it meets my "heard of this thing outside of Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects a few times" got feeling criterion, which means that it's probably notable and can be improved. The criteria cited aren't deletion grounds (just grounds for severe cleanup), aside of web notability, which I think is more than marginally established. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:11, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transfer to Wikipedia namespace</b> While I personally love the MeatballWiki, it just doesn't have the sources (or at least I couldn't find any).

<li>It's a good source, but really just a passing mention (one sentence?). If this were any website but another Wiki it would have been deleted without question as failing verifiability, and it's that bias that I'm concerned about.

<li><b>Keep</b>. 93,000 hits on Google, and many references from the Meta pages on this very Wikipedia, seems notable to me.</li>

<hr />
<p>While it may have been self-serving to have created the article, given that Meatball were the ones who wrote, designed, and adapted the original wiki software that Wikipedia ran on, and then were involved in abitrating many social disputes within the Wikipedia community, it was a Wikipedian who wrote the original article, so I think Vanity is unfair.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by citing sources and claiming you have found only one trade magazine article. The site is public. You can go see it yourself. You can also see how the site is used by others on the Internet, and it has been notable at such events as Wikimania, WikiSym, WOZ3, ASIST'04, etc. Besides, I've been in the New York Times, too, so there.

<li><b>Delete and Merge</b> It could probably easily fit in the <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_apnea.html" title="Sleep apnea">Sleep apnea</a> page, and is probably a bit too specific to ever really be very significant on its own. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 01:03, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> Term is notable (in fact my dad suffers from something similar) but probably not enough for its own article. It would make a very good addition to the <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_apnea.html" title="Sleep apnea">Sleep apnea</a> article, and would work just fine in the "OSA" section. <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmopkisn_365a.html" title="User:Tmopkisn">tmopkisn</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmopkisn_1dc1.html" title="User talk:Tmopkisn">tlka</a></sup> 05:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
