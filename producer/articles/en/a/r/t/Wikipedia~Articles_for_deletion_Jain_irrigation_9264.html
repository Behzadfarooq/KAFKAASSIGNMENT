<p>Already deleted twice as spam/advertising for a non-notable company. I was tempted to follow suit, but it seems to be a fairly large corporation — I was hoping that editors who are familiar with Indian culture could help out here. In any case, an AfD would settle the matter and open to door to protect the article in the future if necessary, since the creator seems determined to keep posting it up. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 09:56, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, this organization is big multinational. Operating in more than 100 countries, they have open to all large 500 Acres Research and demonstration center, training institutes for farmers, government officials. First time in India who brought drip irrigation and currently on top with 60% market share. Struggling to give farmers a status and drip irrigation as infrastructure industry within India. I like there mission of Organization 'Leave this world better than you found it'. Chairman respected Bhavarlal Jain bestowed with 'Significant Contribution to the Irrigation Industry outside the United States.' instituted by Irrigation Association, U.S.A. I will like to add there page in biography. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisasam_727f.html" title="User:Lisasam">Lisasam</a> 10:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>page for review, please see talk page of Jain Irrigation</p>
<p>Thanks Tijuana and Lisasam for your views,</p>
<p>In my views I am creating informative page, already page was under review by another administrator and need your attention to it's talk page. Request to review it with WP:CORP guidelines for the page, if you have any suggestions that are welcome. Deletion is a extreme step, and persons who have worked on it, they got there time &amp; resources in vain need to consider it. Deepm 11:17, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is a leading hi-tech agriculture Company and more... Jain Irrigation is the only company in the world that produces complete Drip Irrigation Systems including PVC Pipes, PVC Fittings, poly tubing and fittings, emitters, filtration equipment, and fertigation equipment under one roof. Had lot of other product manufacturing, service and support divisions. Subsidiaries of Jain Irrigation are in the USA, Europe and Africa, In India it has more than 8 plants, 58 Offices, 23 depots and 1262 distributor's. Other than India approx 5 offices, 380 distributor's, 7 Agents. Manufacturing more than 1000 products. I think this is enough to add this organizations page in WIKIPEDIA.

<li><b>Comment</b> I cleaned up the article a little today to try and give a better idea of what there is to look at. The history section is actually a copyvio of the Jain website and will need a big rewrite (if kept at all). I'm still holding off from offering any opinion about the notability of this company, but I wanted to let it have a fair shot of surviving this AfD. It can be tough to work in articles on subjects that are foreign to the mostly Western editors here (myself included, of course). While there are plenty of poor reasons offered above for keeping the article — the founder may be a nice guy, but that doesn't make him of encyclopedic importance — I wouldn't want to be too quick to delete this one. <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a></b> 10:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
