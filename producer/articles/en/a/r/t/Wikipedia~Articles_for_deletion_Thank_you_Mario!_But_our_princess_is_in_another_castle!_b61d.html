<dd>It was not a speedy keep. It was a keep that came speedily. The difference is that it was closed quickly because the user brought it to the AfD because of an edit war. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough, the result posted by the closing admin was <b>keep</b>, as you say. But the consensus was to take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_you_Mario%21_But_our_princess_is_in_another_castle%21&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_you_Mario%21_But_our_princess_is_in_another_castle%21&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit war</a> to RfC, not to re-nominate the article for deletion. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 16:56, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This single phrase from a video game certainly doesn't deserve its own article. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 15:48, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a notable phrase. Vary: The first nom was mistaken in thinking that it was only an edit war, but it's really an edit war over whether it should be deleted (and redirected), which would make AfD the place where we should have gone instead of the edit war. --<font color="orange"><strike><i><a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory</a></i><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">0</font></a><b><a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">96</a></b></strike></font> 18:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was under the impression that the procedure for the two was one and the same, but I've never actually <i>seen</i> an AfR.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Additionally, TYM doesn't transcend the original game outside of two references - one in a sequel to the game, and another in an MMORPG. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 20:18, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's quite a few more references than that - just google "Thank you * but our * is in another *" and you'll come up with tons of stuff. Most of it's just on webcomics and ytmnd stuff and whatever, but if that stuff is noteworthy enough to merit an article on AYB then it's (arguably) noteworthy enough to merit an article on TYM.</dd>
<dd>That said, I wouldn't object to this being merged into a new "List of memes originating from Mario series" article, because I'm sure there's plenty of other ones that haven't been noted on Wikipedia yet. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassandraleo_bb7c.html" title="User:Cassandraleo">Cassandra Leo</a> 21:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
