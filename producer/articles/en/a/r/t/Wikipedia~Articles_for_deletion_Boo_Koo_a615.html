<li>Just a question. How is this a promo for a non-notable thing. How is this a promo? Are you putting up deletion notices for the other energy drinks listed? No. They aren't promos, they are encyclopedic articles detailing what these drinks are. These drinks are all known. These drinks are all popular. And they are all real. What is the relevance of it being endorsed by Shaq or not? It is a popular drink. It didn't have an article made yet, and now there is one. This isn't a promo, it is an informative article on a drink. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrd00d_a0e1.html" title="User:Mrd00d">Mr d00d!</a> 21:22, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your vote is valid, of course, but I am curious why it should be merged to the energy drink page. Should the rest of the energy drinks that are linked to from the main energy drink page going to be merged as well? If yes, merge it. If not, leave them all on their own individual pages. Is it necessary to do these things on a case by case basis? Do with one drink as is done with the rest. It is given a separate page because there are separate pages for many other energy drinks. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrd00d_a0e1.html" title="User:Mrd00d">Mr d00d!</a> 04:07, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>P.S. If you don't like it as is, why don't you edit it so that it is valid and neutral, non-promo. I see it as neutral, and not a promo, so maybe someone else should fix it up so that it fits people's needs without needing to merge it for no reason. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrd00d_a0e1.html" title="User:Mrd00d">Mr d00d!</a> 04:07, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I tend to think these all these so-called energy drinks are just minor variations on a (snake-oily) theme, and could all be merged into <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_drink.html" title="Energy drink">Energy drink</a>. Unless, that is, there's something about these drinks (either in general or in particular) that has escaped me. I can't easily add to the article, even if I wanted to, as I've never heard of the stuff. There seems to be an assumption that the reader is in some nation where dollars are used; I'm not (we use yen here), and though I'm vaguely aware of a few so-called "energy"/"sports" drinks here (notably the divinely named "Pocari Sweat"), I really don't think that this one is for sale here. What I think is encyclopedic is medical and similar info (see <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=20800" class="external text" title="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=20800" rel="nofollow">this</a> for example). Or again, the main article says <i>energy drinks today are commonly associated with the image of a hacker or IT professional, sitting up late at his computer trying to stay awake. This is not an entirely inaccurate picture</i>; if somebody who's interested in "energy drinks" has the, uh, energy to write more, how about a clarification of this (to me) extraordinarily woolly statement? (Does it mean "Much of the sales of energy drinks are to people who want to stay awake and alert", and if not, what does it mean?) Incidentally, the "energy drinks" sold in the Czech Republic have <a href="http://hoary.org/snaps/czech/fd/fd258u.jpg" class="external text" title="http://hoary.org/snaps/czech/fd/fd258u.jpg" rel="nofollow">more explosive names</a>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:03, 2005 May 5 (UTC)

<p>Explain the nonsensical medical claim, and if you mean "energy stimulance", then you better argue with all the other drinks. Which makes no sense. Also, my email wasn't SPAM because I didnt market anything. I sent an email to you ACCIDENTALLY thanking you for your KEEP vote, but you probably hadnt even seen this page yet. I went to someone's talk page and saw your email there, and assumed it was that persons, because it just said "email me here". I didnt advertise the page or promote it to you, I mistakenly sent you a message that you werent meant to get. You are wrong, sir. And are all people that get nutritional information from a food product, and list a slogan, violating a copyright? No. You are being unreasonable.
