I disagree even though it's a small church it is already in the process of recieving Tax-Free status as a Not-For-Profit Church. I don't see it as an advert but more of a statement of belief. Even if you choose not to agree with the message maybe others are looking for information. How do you expect outside sources if their popularity is not exactly top-tier?

<p>I also disagree. BareNakedChurch is in the process of becomeing a "real" (as in IRS approved church). But, according to the Bible a church is really where two or more meet (fellowship), to learn about Chirst (discipleship), break bread and pray (see Acts 2). This is what's happening in the BareNakedChurch Underground Churches (I know as I attend one). All the elements are even there for their web except the break bread part. And, as far as I can tell from the Bible, no church there needed an IRS endorsement. If Wikipedia is a place to share information and learn about an organization then it will be simply a shame to delete Bare Naked Church. I suspect that the peolple who want BareNakedChurch off are really anti-Christain (see the "Jesus spam" comment). So, the other sad thing is that the BareNakedChurch is also a place where Christianty is openly challenged and discussion happens. If someting as open and growing as BareNakedChurch can't be discussed and explained on Wikipedia then this place is a joke and a waste.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.206.57.110 (<a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.206.57.110.html" title="User talk:206.206.57.110">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.206.57.110_0ae2.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.206.57.110">contribs</a>) 22:01, 5 August 2006.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Firstly, might I remind you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a>. I'm sure many devout christians get annoyed and use unkind terms about the apparent mass-marketing of religion all the time. What I'm hearing of the organisation is pleasing, however wikipedia strives to verify facts with seconary sources - such as news papers, indipendant magazines and journals, a few major websites, etc. As well as helping to prove the truth of something, this also makes it clear that the subject in question is considered to be important to those outside of it. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 23:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP!</b> Just want to reply to Bootstoots. Since when does any movement have to be "notable" to be legitimate? That's absurd. If you knew anything about Christianity then you would know that it's roots are notorious... far from notable. In fact is was subversive... made people angry... got it's founder executed (ie. the crucfixion). And as to the "ad" comment, how is explaining the purpose of a church an ad? Your logic is obviously prejudiced. Wikipedia is a place to share knowledge and information. Leave you prejudices behind or go elsewhere. If Bare Naked Church is deleted then by God we better delete all citings for all religions and non-religions (ie athiesm / secular humanism). See where this can lead?

<li><b>Comment</b> then as you say, there are doubtless thousands (if not millions) of small churches the world over. But each and every one cannot be mentioned on wikipedia. Why not consier a wikichrist wiki for such information? (name an example alone, no offense intended). No one is denying the legitimacy of the movement, however there are millions of religious and secular movements going without widespread recognition.

Just another thought. I just came from the BareNakedChurch.com site. Did any of you who want to delete their article happen to notice that they have NO commercial activity on their site? They don't sell anything. Heck, they don't even ask for donations. How can being on Wikipedia be advertising for them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Avertisting does not have to mean commercial avertising. Advertising is defined as the promotion of products, goods and services. There is nothing to stop anyone advertising for members for a group, or advertising something free to all. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 23:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Hi LinaMishima. I thought nobody was reading these things. Thanks for responding. What I'm saying is that they are new. You're not going to be able to cross verify their existence. As for the advertising discussion, again advertising is for products and services to which they are offering neither. The site and some really cool graphics are all free. I suppose if you consider Christianity and Christ a service or product they are advertising. I don't consider religious organizations either. My premise is that should someone be able to come to Wikipedia and get some general info on this church or any church? I think so, otherwise this site is the one that should be deleted. Frogman61. Oh, and why can't every church be mentioned? It's the purpose of Wikipedia... info sharing! Let's not get away from the purpose.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The positive aspects of a church, just like those provided by any community, are indeed a service. Moreso, churches are significantly bolstered by increased awareness of their existance, giving good reason to advertise them. If something is so new that you cannot verify their existance, then it is clearly obvious that they are currently of little importance. Wikipedia also suffers from a problem called <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">Recentism</a>, that new things are more likely to be listed than old things, even if said new thing will be quickly forgotten about in the grand scheme of things. Wikipedia is not for information sharing, it is an encyclopedia - you may find <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> informative in this matter. As such, all articles in wikipedia need to be verified. Again I suggest the idea of a christian based wikisite for all such information, since this would be far more appropriate <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>My last shot... they must be a church. They're getting their share of censorship and persecution... even here. So much for tolerance for everyone's ideas. When will we start the PC burnings? Finally, there are zero deletes for The Church of Satan and many other so called "churches" on Wikipedia. My question, who's to say what church is legitimate or not? Isn't that what this boils down too? I'm done!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> If you look at the article <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Of_Satan_ef5c.html" title="Church Of Satan">Church_Of_Satan</a>, you will note that it has many strong references and is clearly notable to many people, as it is the official organisation for a religion. We are not censoring or persecuting, indeed, you will see us repeatedly explaining our reasons - reasons, might I add, that are not just wikipedia policy, but the very premise of scientific practice, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>.We are not deciding on the legitimacy of anything, only on the appropriateness of a subject to be in wikipedia - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not the absolute truth of everything</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> If the prereq for entries is notability then Wikipedia is a contradiction. Think of the thousands of articles that are not references, cross check, notable. If the point is that Wikipedia is scientific, then no religion qualifies. This is not a scientific issue or notability issue. Just look at their freakin site. It's a NEW church. People may come here (but I doubt it) to get some info on them. Will it be allowed or not? LinaMishima, get some rest, looks a bit late/early there. This is Frogman1961.
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> If there are articles that you feel cannot be verified, then by all means, see if they have been AfDed before and nominate again. Although it is polite to discuss this first on the talk page. And fyi, <i>theology</i> is the study of religion in a scientific manner, and <i>history</i>, clearly an aspect of social science, is highly influenced by religion. Stating it is "New" again does not help it's case - new things rarely have much cause to be notable. I assure you I'll look after myself well, thank you for your concern.

<p>The church of subgenius is not a church as defined in the article on wikipedia. They're a parody. Rather Notable? Is that notable or not, or opinion? How about the list of Metropolitian churches referenced under <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a>? I have a friend that works for them? They are loosely affiliated with a denomination (as is BareNakedChurch). I guess I'm wondering if someone wants an outside source about BareNakedChurch, shouldn't they be able to find some info here? Can it be that simple?</p>

<dd>It's not a christian church, no - it's a church as in a religious gathering. Nor is it just a parody, it was founded in 1953, has a number of publications, and followers. The <i>rather</i> of "rather notable" was an opinion, but the <i>notable</i> was not - the article has the references, you are free to look at them. With respect to an outside source - wikipedia needs one itself! This has been explained several times. BareNaked Church would be better served by you spending your time talking about it to news agencies and the like - which would also give us the reference we need to be able to keep the article. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 22:55, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even so, the rest of the points still hold. And parodies can be quite notable - see <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spitting_Image_ca1b.html" title="Spitting Image">Spitting Image</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_America_1e04.html" title="Team America">Team America</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Ringers_2e75.html" title="Dead Ringers">Dead Ringers</a>, etc. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also note that it is defined as a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody_religion.html" title="Parody religion">Parody religion</a> rather than a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">Parody</a>. This is important because the parody religion article states:
<dl>
<dd><i>"A parody religion or mock religion is either a parody of a religion, sect or cult, or a relatively unserious religion that many people may take as being too esoteric to be classified as a "real" religion."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The parody religion article goes on to state that although the church of subgenius was founded as a parody, it is now considered notable movement in it's own right. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 14:52, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
