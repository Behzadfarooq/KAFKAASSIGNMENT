This <i>is</i> imho a valid speedy deletion candidate under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD A7</a>. If somebody wishes to challenge the speedy deletion, such a challenge surely ought to be coupled with at least a <i>claim</i> of notability? All it claims is that he is an "American electric guitarist and composer". He's a member of two redlinked bands. The article says who he is influenced <i>by</i> but makes no claim that he is an influence on anyone else of any note. That said, I accept the reversal of my deletion; <s>simply because</s> I'm not one to wheel war or go against the community.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sorry, I don't normally go around undoing people's closures. As a general rule I have no problem with early closure if consensus seems clear. However since this was already contested and there do appear to be sources (just not worked into the article yet), it seems reasonable to give it a few days. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe I'm crazy, but does being a teacher automatically make the article an advert? He's also got a few records, and he's touring Europe. I'm not saying he's obviously of encyclopedic significance, he appears to be in that gray area, but let's not hold his teaching against him, eh? <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fripp_bbc4.html" title="Robert Fripp">Robert Fripp</a> teaches too. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 18:08, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see why there is a huge argument about this article, it says in WP: Music that a musicians notable if he/she "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country,[1] reported in notable and verifiable sources."

How about also being in a band with Joe Stump, a notable electric guitarist. Does that count for anything? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 18:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seems like the HellHole, oops <a href="../../../h/o/l/HolyHell_64e5.html" title="HolyHell">HolyHell</a> entry redirects to Tom Hess. Not sure why that's the case. He doesn't even seem to be the primary member. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 19:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For what it's worth, there'd been a seperate article on HolyHell, but Zoe speedy deleted it for not being significant enough. Since this guy has two major bands, Hess and HolyHell, it seems sensible to me for him to have an article. If seperate articles on the specific bands are also warranted, so be it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:46, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm far from convinced of TH's notability (2 self-released CD's?), and I'm also far from convinced that opening slots count towards notability, but if the tour is the deciding factor, the article should probably be about HolyHell and Tom Hess should redirect to it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 20:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Doesn't being part of a notable band warrant it's own article about that person? I mean, a guy like Jeff Campitelli has done nothing notable except being part of Joe Satriani's band. This warrants him his own article. shouldn't this 'spin off' effect apply as well to Tom Hess, if his band Holyhell is deemed notable? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 21:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Afaict, they aren't. And also afaict the "better covered in the main article" standard applies to band members who have no notability of their own. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How do you pick and choose which band members are anymore notable than the others than? Each member is an integral part. Especially in bands without a member that stands out from the rest (as opposed to Van Halen, Cream, Led Zeppelin etc.) By that logic, most articles about bass players and drummers should be "better covered in the main article". Is it fair to discriminate against bands that aren't well known by only allowing one article for the whole band as opposed to articles for all the members. Why does <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Bello_b003.html" title="Frank Bello">Frank Bello's</a> article exist? <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 07:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

As he fails our guidelines for inclusion, he should be deleted. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">™</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b5/Radioactive.svg/18px-Radioactive.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.svg_3c1b.html" /></a> 20:00, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
