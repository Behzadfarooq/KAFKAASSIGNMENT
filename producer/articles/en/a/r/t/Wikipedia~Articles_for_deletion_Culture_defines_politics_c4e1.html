<li><b>Rewrite</b> to conform to standards, otherwise <b>Delete.</b> This is a heavily slanted version of the concept, designed to promote particular versions of what is a broad paradigm. User should integrate material on the relevant pages in wikipedia in an NPOV manner. There should be an article on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_determinism.html" title="Cultural determinism">Cultural determinism</a>, which is a term that people might actually look up, and which could use with a thorough, NPOV article. As a side note, the level of hostility over this VfD is far too high. The contributor should not be censured as heavily by those supporting a delete, but should, instead, be given a chance to write an article which conforms to wikistandards. Since the concept is documentable, and recurrant, it should be included. However, the current article is clearly "Gramsci's theory of cultural determination of politics" and not a general article. I hope users can back off of the personal on this one and realize that the goal is to create an encyclopedia, and not engage in turf wars to advance particular versions of ideas. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 20:10, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC) PS.

<dd>I have changed the material and have reorganized it and taken out the material. Would like to change the title again to "Cultural imprinting on politics". Furthermore, I think it deserves a seperate page just to concentrate on the political side of things. This is important for Classical studies! People need this. Is this okay by wikipedian standards. I hope I made enough changes to suit everybody and it looks good. I am not an expert at this--I just know the idea and concept well enough--I don't have access, due to my poverty, of going to a university library. I am doing all this with relative meager resources.

<dd>My philosophical basis for this work: Greeks are realists; we are lovers of nature. As Socrates says in the Republic. We must see things as they really are not as we wish them to be. Greek philosophy is based on seeing nature as is. As much as my detractors hate this material, it must be presented. Communists socialist, liberals et al., want to change reality according to their ideology. Greek thought is different. We accept reality as is and don't attempt to change it. We accept. We don't see reality through ideological lenses of political correctness. There is a big difference here. I am a Greek--- an ancient Greek. I see reality as is not the way I think it ought to be as so many others do. They butcher reality to fit their ideology. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:59, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't believe that we are seeing all these "keep" votes. This page should even be considered a candidate for automatic deletion without going through the Vfd.

<li><b>Title</b>
<ul>
<li>I like the title because it is short and sweet. And encapsulates the total meaning of the concept and idea But if there is better suggestions, I am all for it. If worse comes to worse "Culture-defined politics" is alright but for establishing the concept---"Culture defines politics is better.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 20:07, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How can the title be NPOV when it is a statement? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 05:31, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All titles are definitions. A dog is a dog. There is no NPOV or POV title of dog. A thing is a thing. Democracy is Democracy. The word encapsulates the character, essense, style, concept of what makes up the idea of democracy and it differentiates itself from other things. Maybe this will help: <a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWHEELER_Principles_of_Definition_dfbc.html" title="User talk:WHEELER/Principles of Definition">User Talk:WHEELER/Principles of Definition</a><a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:27, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li>"Culture defines politics" is a statement. "Dog" is not a statement. Do you know of any other article titles within Wikipedia that take the form of a sentence? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 16:18, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Dog is a statement. For when someone says the word "Dog" we think, "Okay, four legged animal that barks and waves its tail." The word "Dog" incorporates in a single word that one large sentence. In the German language, Germans also coin words for concepts that us in English have to describe using a full sentence or even a paragraph. The German word Weltshangshuch (or however it is spelled) is an example of this. In English, this is not possible. Ask your self, a title of anything must incorporate the essence of the subject at hand. For right now, until something better has come across, I am stumped for a good title that <i>captures</i> the essence of the subject material. Have some patience.</li>

<p>Wheeler, you and I have different understandings of the word "statement." I will try to clarify. It has nothing to do with concept or idea or representation in general. Nor does the German language having anything to do with it, because we're working here in English. My trouble is with the sentence form and the word "is", which makes your title read as a statement of fact. Do you know of any similar examples within Wikipedia? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 18:02, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, not right off hand. The subject material is about a process. The type of government is determined by the culture. So, the subject (or concept) includes two nouns and a verb.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How about "Cultural-political process"?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since this was studied by "Counter-intelligence experts" maybe someone should call them up and ask them what they call this. Somebody call their friends in Washington, to Spookville, and ask them. That ought to solve the problem.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 00:52, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sure, if it was a construct which, as such, is used notably beyond original reserach. Actually, <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a>, the current 'Culture defines politics' title (whether it is a statement or not is less releavnt) would also be fine had it been a notable, non-original reserach concept. But neither are. We are interested in what –is– encyclopedic, not what it should <i>look like</i> if it was. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 12:42, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore on title name. I have no doubts that some doughty old classical professor in some ivy covered dank hall coined a word for this subject and there is a title for it in Latin or Greek. Would someone please search old English Classicists texts. I don't want to reinvent the circle. Somebody somewhere already coined this term. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:08, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">Epistemology</a>? Frankly, the onus is on you to find a preexisting, encyclopedic term/title – nothing's wrong with asking for help, but this should take place prior to placing a piece on the article namespace, in a draft, for ex. I don't wish to chastise you too harshly, but I nonetheless urge you to be more judicious on this front in the future. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a>
<dl>
<dd>According to El C's own web page, "<a href="../../../n/o/t/Nothing_comes_from_nothing.html" title="Nothing comes from nothing">Nothing comes from nothing</a>" is a statement as a title for an Wikipedian article. I would like to point this out to Maureen.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

And unlike <i>Culture defines politics</i>, NcfN (which I authored on my first day on WP, incidentally, and which already existed, albeit was undefined) is a well-known philosophical expression that I did –not– coin myself. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:19, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this the proper venue for these thoughts? Also, a minor point, there is no need to exclaim so dramatically, if the new information is credible for the purposes of demonstrating encyclopedicity, I am confident that it will be considered and accounted for by proponents of deletion here. Yes, society is comprised by its constituents, and these constituents combined to form society – many thinkres have written extensively on these areas, but I do not see how these passages (nor the talk page where <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>'s criticism is especially poignant) elucidate encyclopedicity. It is an original research synthesis that draws its own heavily-slanted (towards idealism) conclusions, it is is poorly referenced, and it treats Gramsci (the only person mentioned in the opening paragraph) in a questionable manner which demonstrate a lack of familiarity with his works. I realize people voting keep wish to encourage this editor with his work and reserach, but they are doing so at the expense of the most basic encyclopedic conventions.</p>
<p>Again, there have been many debates and various concepts accorded to such polemics as the article highlights, but it is not the role of the editor to synthesize these together – the role of the editor is to note how others synthesized pertinent thinkers, debates, concepts, etc., in a notable fashion. This, however, is absent from this article. If the editor in question arrives at a notable concept, etc., they need to outline how it has been approached by others and who they included within the realm of such discussions; it is not the editor's role to <i>pick and choose</i> how to phrase such a concept nor most definitely which notable thinkers qualify to appear in it. Lastly, there is the slant of the debate: if this was an encyclopedic concept and if the thinkers appearing in it were not added merely at the discretion/whim of the editor, in a debate involving the intellectual rivalry between epistemological materialism and idealism, the article still needs to promote NPOV, but in fact, it promotes only one side (which I suspect is the view held by the editor): idealism. Similarly, an encyclopedic article that centres on the presentation of epist. materialism should not promote that approach, rather it should highlight the pertinent arguments and counterarguments in an objective, NPOV way. All of these factors are crucial in whether an article is deemed credible and encyclopedic, which this one falls very shot from, I'm afraid.

<dd>What El C wants from me, is a complete and finished article. This is not Wikipedian policy. Hundreds of articles have started out as stubs. Wikipedia is a "collabrative" encyclopeadia. What El C is doing is making me having to have a full fledged article. If I don't have a full fledged article, he deletes. I am not expected to know everything completely but this is the standard El C is putting on me because he doesn't like the subject material. He changes the rules to suit himself. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said that. I never said that because it's untrue. What I want is an encyclopedic start. I don't care if it's a stab. You are distorting my argument and grossly oversimplifying it. Whether I like the subject material (or your bias thereof) is not relavent, and it is quite presumptious of you to conclude what I like and dislike. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a></dd>

<dd>Paul Shorey relates that these concepts and ideas "are identified with Buckle's name". I quoted from two modern men Spencer and Mill. Read the talk page Mr. El.C, Fr. Malachi Martin knows very well Antonio Gramsci and as a Jesuit priest I trust him better than I do you. Mr. MacAlveny, William Griggs, and Father Malachi Martin know Antonio Gramsci better than I do. What about their credentials? You dismiss my sources? <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do they call –it– <i>culture defines politics</i>? Do they call it <i>cultural political process?</i> I could care less about credentials, I care about –notability– (as such, user:WHEELER, as such). Also, why do you call me Mister? Since when did I reveal to you whether I am male or female? And if I am female, I certainly could not be a Jesuit priest (and inherently not recieve the same level of trust from you – "credentials" which therefore cannot be attained by merit alone; but that is entirely an aside to all this). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a></dd>

<dd>El C is putting standards on me, that are not required of other articles and stubs. So sex acts and how to do sex acts are accepted all the time on Wikipedia, What professional Encyclopeadia ever included that in their topics? Noone. Mr. El C. Irregardless of the psychobable, Fr. Malachi Martin is pretty clear and concise. So is John Dziak. Wikipedia is a <b>collabrative</b> encyclopaedia. It's a stub to grow on.

<dl>
<dd>I understand that this is your opinion, but it contradicts established policy: a collaboration in the article name space must possess an encyclopedic origin. I place the same standards on your work as I do anyone's. Again, it has nothing to do with it being a stab, it has to do with it being original research (all the other criticisms I mentioned, which I think are important and you should approach constructively rather than defensively, are really an aside to my argument of original reserach). I am unfamilliar with the sex acts articles which you refer to, sorry. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Then the next question is Mr. El C where and what article will describe what Fr. Malachi Martin, Mr. MacAlveny, and William Griggs are talking about? There must be some philosophical, scholarly, studied basis from which they talk from. So what is it Mr. El C? <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 15:24, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
