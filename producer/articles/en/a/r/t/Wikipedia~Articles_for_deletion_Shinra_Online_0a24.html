<li>Other articles are more questionable than this one, like the donkey-punch article. At the same time, there are various important articles that seem to be missing due to a contrast of opinions in history. Also this is a article based on fact not POV. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.182.34.221 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.182.34.221_fbbb.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.182.34.221">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Shinra Online has been one of the longest consistently running communities on the Internet, which is astounding given it has no real content other than the forum itself to keep people coming back. SO was once said to be the forum equivalent of a cult film; this can be seen in its hardcore member base, as it is ranked #6 out of ~1,400 on Big-Boards.com (a site dedicated to statkeeping for forums possessing over 500,000 posts, a milestone in all itself) for average posts per user. <b>Keep It</b>. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerk_7bbd.html" title="User:Gerk">Gerk</a> 07:11, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Shinra Online admins have created their own vb coding such as the Store exclusively into existance for the website which many other forums have tried to emulate. Shinra features forums like the War Room which was one of the premier flaming websites on the net. It has had over 12,000 members register in the five years since it was created. Certainly notable. <b>Keep It</b>. Chibi Hikaru</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable, poor Alexa rank.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep It</b> This is not advertising, but a archive of the site's history. Also, "Sockpuppet Supported" and "Crap site only based on Final Fantasy" are poor and unsupported claims for deletion. Keep the childish excuses to yourself please. Also, why would we communicate through wikipedia if we already have a forum?</li>
<li><b>Keep It</b> If you look at the history, some anonymous member decided to edit our article to the point of non-recognition. Someone with the ip 71.114.80.103</li>
<li><b>Side Note</b>: All comments ranging from "A crap site seeking..." to "Delete for the sentence..." were made based on vandalized versions of the page created by the IP Address 71.114.80.103 (the first comment mentioned having been created by said IP Address, no less), and I move they should be stricken from the record. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerk_7bbd.html" title="User:Gerk">Gerk</a> 18:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep It</b> For the record, I am one of the admins over at www.shinraonline.com and having read some of these comments, there are a few errors which I would like to take a moment and address and correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. It was one our members who approached us asking to create this wiki article to record some of the sites rich history. You can read that for yourself here: <a href="http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474" class="external free" title="http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474" rel="nofollow">http://shinraonline.com/board/showthread.php?t=139474</a></p>
<p>2. Why are you using Alexa Rank? Everyone knows that its not a true estimate or accurate guage of a sites popularity since only a select portion of surfers use thier software. If you would like some better statistics, try our google rank of 4 (not bad) or our stats over at www.big-boards.com where we are ranked 581 in posts made just last week, this is great considering slashdot, dslreports, offtopic and howardsterns forum rank at the top of these lists. We are also ranked very close to the top in other catagories.</p>
<p>3. "No evidence of notability" - our site and our reputation are duly noted at a dozen other internet sites.</p>
<p>We are also the creators of the "forum points and store system", a system which was copied onto every major bulletin board package available, including phpbb, and has had well over 5 thousands unique installations across various incarnations. Please see <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267" class="external free" title="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267" rel="nofollow">http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=35267</a> for some of the demand prior to its first release in which even a vbulletin developer said they may code something akin to it.</p>
<p>4. We are not a commerical site, at this time all expenses are paid out of pocket with the occassional member initiated donation. We have no advertisements, no adsense, nothing. We make not one dime, it's a labor of love.</p>
<p>Now that that has been said, I personally think the article itself could use some work as I feel it would be more appropriate to chronical the actual history of the site rather than list the forums we have which change continuously but like all articles, this was something a member initiated and not something I or any of the staff had been actively engaged in until this moment.</p>
