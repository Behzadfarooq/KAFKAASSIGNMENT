<p>A mix of Dawkins's TV appearances (popular culture?), along with a few other references. Non notable, his 2 TV appearances can be mentioned in his main article along with anything else that's important, this doesn't need a seperate article. Plasticbottle 04:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see there has been a long discussion (<a href="../../../r/i/c/Talk%7ERichard_Dawkins_cf8b.html#South_Park_again" title="Talk:Richard Dawkins">Talk:Richard Dawkins#South Park again</a>) regarding trivia in the main article. The consensus appears to be that editors don't want trivia in Dawkins's article so they sent it off into its own article, the clearest explanation was "we decided to create the Dawkins in pop culture article for the unencyclopedic stuff." That says it all really, it seems to be the reason behind most of these "In popular culture" lists. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 06:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unencyclopedic stuff doesn't belong <i>anywhere</i> on this website. Giving it its own article doesn't make it more encyclopedic. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResurgent_insurgent_838d.html" title="User:Resurgent insurgent">Resurgent insurgent</a> 06:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> and merge selectively to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, from which this was apparently forked. My understanding is that Dawkins's chief claim to fame comes chiefly from having written a number of popular science books in which he took stands on social issues involving religion, nature versus nurture, and so forth. That he was apparently satirized on <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i> surely belongs in his article in chief. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If it's claimed that "<b>merger is not an option</b>", obviously this should be kept. Apparently some editors of the article in chief believe that the solemnity of their subject is sullied by these details of his public career. Whatever else the vague "policy" <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> might mean — your guess is as good as mine, but it nowhere defines "indiscriminate information" or "trivia", much less provide for their removal — it <i><b>surely must not</b></i> become a tool to ghettoize and then remove valid information about public figures like Dawkins. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_censored.html" title="Wikipedia is not censored">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, and this misuse of a vague heading about what might be "indiscriminate information" would become just that if this were to be deleted. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 22:15, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

As I said, such a merger can be proposed at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Talk%7ERichard_Dawkins_cf8b.html" title="Talk:Richard Dawkins">Talk:Richard Dawkins</a>, but it cannot be forced by the outcome of this AFD. That's all. Also, if this article does get deleted and you succeed in getting consensus for a merger later, an admin can undelete this and turn it into a redirect, which would give you access to the page history for merging. That's rather immaterial to the discussion here, but I offer it in case the suggestion becomes useful to you later. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 22:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although Dawkins might notable in his field, he has not achieved sufficient widespread notability to justify such an article.

<li><b>Do not merge; merger is not an AFD option</b>. Either a keep or a delete is fine with me (article creator), but this AFD <s>has been proposed apparently</s> may be interpreted by some as a merger: the nom says "<i>his 2 TV appearances can be mentioned in his main article along with anything else that's important</i>". Merger is an editorial decision and is not an AFD result. Those of you who want the content merged will have to take that issue up at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Talk%7ERichard_Dawkins_cf8b.html" title="Talk:Richard Dawkins">Talk:Richard Dawkins</a>; you cannot have the merger simply as a result of this AFD.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Where did I say anything about a merger? Don't try and alter the meaning of my nomination in order to discredit it - I said <i>his 2 TV appearances CAN be mentioned in his main article</i>. Not <i>should</i> be mentioned. It was to prevent anyone saying "keep" because they don't want to lose these details. You are just attempting a poor <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument, but it won't work. In case anyone else became confused like Coelacan, my nomination was/is to <b>Delete</b>. Delete the whole thing, I have no interest in what you do to the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> article, just don't create any more articles like this.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - why so aggressive? All he said was that he is opposed to merging and prefers the material be either deleted entirely or left in a separate article. He didn't accuse anyone in particular of favouring merging; it's simply an obvious possibility that he felt moved to comment on. (read "she" thoughout if <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">Coelacan</a> happens to be female.) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:00, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Coelacan <i>did</i> accuse me of favouring merging quite clearly; <i>this AFD has been proposed apparently as a merger</i>. I wasn't being aggressive, I was being assertive to make sure there was no possible doubt over my original nomination. Plasticbottle 03:27, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I was wrong on that point. Conceded and corrected; apologises for my error. He did say it was proposed as a merger. All the same, your language was <i>not</i> merely assertive. In talking about attempts to "alter the meaning", and to try "to discredit it" you were assuming ulterior motives, with no real foundation for doing so. That is quite aggressive language that you used, and hardly in keeping with the requirement to assume good faith. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 03:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict) Plasticbottle, I'm sorry if it seemed I was trying to discredit you, this was not at all my intention. Your nomination is within the sphere of AFD. It did, however, read to some (myself included) like it carried along with it a merge proposal. Above, for example, Smerdis of Tlön has changed their&#160;!vote to keep after I made it clear that a delete result here <i>would not necessarily</i> result in the information being included at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dawkins_c78d.html" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>. So it's probably good that I made that clear, at least from that editor's perspective. As to your proposal to delete, I do not oppose it. I have said keep or delete is fine; I am abstaining from that question. I am glad that you have also now made it clear that there is no merge proposal from you. I did misread your intention somewhat, but I think it's all clear now and I apologize for amplifying my misunderstanding. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 03:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Apologies in advance to those who disagree: this debate appears fairly high temperature; please do not bite: No need for this article; imo material should be in Wikipedia and should be on the main RD article.

<li>Whatever the decision, for the love of God <b>do not merge</b> it back.
