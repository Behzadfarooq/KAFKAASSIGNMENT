It can't be that popular though, because there's no <a href="http://www.2wconline.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.2wconline.net/" rel="nofollow">Alexa rank</a> for the entire site, and the forums have only picked up 50 members since they opened in March.

<li><b>Abstain</b> for now, at least on the J.L. Brown article. Admittedly, it does look like a bit of an open-and-shut case, but the line "<i>has spoken as a guest at several conventions on the East Coast</i>" gives me pause. It would seem to me that being selected to speak at conventions means she's pretty well known within her genre of art at least. I was at AMA 2006, and it was by no means a small event, with 3000+ people in attendence. That said, I'm not certain whether the article could be improved so as to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but the issue is perhaps not quite as clear-cut as it may seem. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I had actually done some more research into the topic than the nomination mentioned, it being long enough already. One of the things I tried, was to Google her latest comic <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Psycho+Dreamatic%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Psycho+Dreamatic%22" rel="nofollow">"Psycho Dreamatic"</a>, and you'll see there the lack of links generated. Being a guest at a fan-gathering or convention isn't notable, the first article you linked also talked about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Comedity_22f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Comedity">Comedity</a>, yet that webcomic that was deleted for similar reasons. Just as I think many of the speakers at Star-Trek, Furry and High schools aren't notable, I don't think JL Brown is. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 02:21, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> - Please do not delete these articles. J.L. Brown has spoken at several conventions as a guest and panelist on the subjects of web comics and animation. The web comics <a href="http://www.2wconline.net/aozora.php" class="external text" title="http://www.2wconline.net/aozora.php" rel="nofollow">Aozora</a> and <a href="http://www.2wconline.net/psycho.php" class="external text" title="http://www.2wconline.net/psycho.php" rel="nofollow">Psycho Dreamatic</a> are active and available on the <a href="http://www.2wconline.net/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.2wconline.net/index.php" rel="nofollow">2wcOnline</a> web site. angrypaladin 20:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - I do not understand what relevance having an Alexa rank or the fact that you don't get 20+ pages from a google search has to the need to delete an article that is obviously an informed resource about the subject. A simple check of the referenced <a href="http://www.2wconline.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.2wconline.net/" rel="nofollow">2wconline.net</a> is all that's needed to verify the contents. Also, as stated before, J. L. Brown has spoken at many conventions recently on both subjects of Anthropomorphic fandom and Webcomic fandom. Despite the submitters personal feelings, being a speaker at a convention IS a notable accomplishment. Also, a quick check on the <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/profile.php?order=ranking" rel="nofollow">webcomics list</a> shows that both comics are in the top 1000 (out of almost 7500) most read comics on the internet, no small feat.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> into Scrabble, and then shorten. These are good examples for scoring and professional play, but separate articles are not necessary.

<ul>
<li>No, actually; the point is that the game companies hold the copyright to the <i>board design</i>. A picture of people playing scrabble, used to illustrate the game's article, is close enough to fully free content as makes no difference, but a template containing nothing but their copyrighted design (which could be printed out, if one wished, and used as a scrabble board) is a no-no. (Template has now been deleted, by the way.) Also, out of curiosity, what would you suggest we merge? The scrabble article already has an explanation of the scoring and several examples, and I don't know that there's a need for more. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 16:26, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> The links provided only mention the phenomeon in passing. The actual topic covered by the news reports are about product placements by automakers on the television program and not the "curse". Information provided in the Wikipedia article is original research at best, with <b>fans</b> drawing such conclusions, not media sources. Likewise, nowhere in the media provided does it suggest that the "curse" has detered advertisers from having cars on the show; please don't insert personal opinions or theories into the fold.

<li>First of all, being acknowledged by all the above articles <i>and</i> by the Survivor contests themselves, <i>does</i> mean this meme is more widespread that if the curse was made up by <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">some kid on a school one day</a> . Also, it isn't my personal opinion/theory, I based my comment after the USA Today story which states that "In fact, no one who has won the car challenge has gone on to win the game. And the promotion doesn't seem to be faring well for the sponsor, either. General Motors has given away nine different car and truck models to Survivor contestants, and none is seeing particularly robust sales." However, I do admit I might have jumped to conclusions...--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 14:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the fact that its a (minor) theme of the show combined with the links cited by TBC make it notable. Madchester is right that the media coverage is more focused on the product placement angle. However, this adds an interesting element to the article and raises it to the requisite level of notability, IMO. The article should include more information on the effect of this "curse" on product placement and advertising. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 04:19, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A high school awards/scholarship program in a county in Maryland that doesn't meet notability criteria for inclusion.

<ul>
<li>Okay so there are about 6 of such programs at your high school. But this program is open county-wide, where there are 32 high schools. Applicants have to undergo an interview process as well. This leadership program is different from many other programs in that it is the only humanities-oriented intern program within Montgomery County. 68.48.32.65 01:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Plus I bet that the programs at your high school are almost open to anyone who wants to do an internship. This program has a rigorous selection process; in fact I, as a member of this leadership program, can attest that there were about 100 applicants to this program for the class of 2007 and only <b>14</b> were accepted. Would you mind showing me some of the websites of the internships at your school? 68.48.32.65 01:53, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there were several where only about 3/100 students would get in. The fact that it's rigourous isn't anything new or unique- there was a scholarship at my school that required a few hundred hours of community service, extra-curriculars, high marks and an interview, and I wouldn't consider it for an article because it's so minor. The scholarships didn't have websites for them- they were of the "See your guidance counsellor and take it from there" variety--<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:00, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You do realize, that there are around <i>3,077</i> counties in the USA, most with multiple and similar county-wide programs. How is this program any more notable than all the others?--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 01:56, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is, programs like these are a dime a dozen. In order to get on Wikipedia, they should be particularly notable outside of the county too. A few things to consider would include stuff like national coverage, and <i>why</i> it's important. There are thousands of such scholarships in the United States alone with very little to set them apart. If it had national coverage or was a particularly famous scholarship, I could understand, but from what I see, it's a run-of-the-mill program (despite it being difficult to get into). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 01:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> and <b>strong keep</b>.I guess the issue is that <i><b>ONLY</b></i> students from Montgomery County, Maryland, are allowed to apply for this leadership program which makes it not so notable outside of Montgomery County. 68.48.32.65 16:23, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not just that, it would also have to meet criteria set out for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, which is basically an extension of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">importance</a>. The best way to gauge the importance of a subject is to see how much <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable, independent, non-trivial information</a> has been published about it. There are easily a few thousand scholarships/co-op programs that span my province, but most of them won't get articles because they're not featured in several non-trivial independent publications. --~~</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there was a press release for this program, the following appeared in the local newspaper:</li>

</ul>
<p><i><b>Rockville, MD -- The Superintendent’s Leadership Program has selected 14 participants for the 2006-2007 class from among candidates at Montgomery County high schools. The program is the only humanities oriented honors intern program in the county. The curriculum content and style is comparable to many college courses. Students in this program are selected for demonstrating outstanding leadership, academic excellence, and uncommon maturity within their schools and communities.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Students accepted to the program are assigned to work for 15 hours per week for a full academic year under the guidance of a management executive such as a Director, Vice President, or CEO. They are given the chance to handle projects, individually and as part of a team. Business partners to the Montgomery County Public Schools program include corporate, government and nonprofit organizations. The 2007 class participants represent 12 Montgomery County high schools.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Significant program components also include site visits to meet and talk with industry executives working in a wide range of settings, didactic seminars to discuss current issues in the workplace, extensive research and writing assignments, a group community service project and an international business project that reinforces cross-cultural relations and global citizenship.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Kim Jones, Program Director of the Superintendent’s Leadership Program says, “It is critical that students with this level of maturity, that can clearly articulate their career objectives, be given the opportunity to apprentice in their discipline. This program reveals facets of a chosen industry that would otherwise take years to experience.”</b></i></p>

<p>I've just created and started populating <a href="../../../m/u/l/Category%7EMultimedia_artists_ce7b.html" title="Category:Multimedia artists">Cat:Multimedia artists</a> when I found this. However, the list is largely empty, not to mention that half of the entries don't even have their own articles, or have been deleted/deleted and protected.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and expand. If the list is empty, why not fill it up?

<li>"Varsity" is a generic term, and most of the articles linked from that page (it's a disambiguation) have to do with generic usages of the term (<a href="../../../v/a/r/Varsity_sports.html" title="Varsity sports">varsity sports</a>, etc). Scrap. isn't a generic usage of the word - the only reason it's not on a disambiguated name like Scrap. (magazine) is because it's got a weird period at the end of it. In any case, the real criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia is widespread recognition. "Scrap." doesn't have that yet. Perhaps it <i>will</i>, but until it <i>does</i> the article doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 00:17, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Seems the strong United States bias of wikipedia rampant again. I am currently living in Madrid, and a publication of this kind has historical importance in European student politics.

<li><b>Comment</b> The assertion made by Arbusto that this man is a graduate of a diploma mill is incorrect. To put it properly Arbustoo should have written that it is his opinion that <s>Tyndal</s> is a diploma mill. However, a reading of the Wikipedia article (Specially the parts not written by Arbustoo, which is rather convenient) will show that Tyndale is a highly respected school in Christian Theology. Further, Tyndale paid its fine and is still a school in Texas which is "issuing" degrees. If it were a diploma mill, Texas would shut the school down. Next, Arbustoo writes <i>doesn't even crack the top million</i> and in another of his AfD's he wrotes <i>doesn't even crack the top two million</i>. One supposes if it was ranked 101,000 he'd write, <i>doesn't even crack the top 100k</i>. Finally, he asks, <i>How does he fit the criteria</i> of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> after I wrote how he fit the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A quick reading of that section is all one needs to see that he easily fits <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is a published author, well respected in Christian circles and asked to speak at Christian colleges/universities, and even outside Christian circles (As noted above with the link to National Georgraphic) is considered notable. How one can read my first comment and then ask seriously, <i>How does he fit the criteria?</i> is beyond my ability to comprehend. I urge those who do not have a knee jerk negative reaction to Christians or Christianity to look into this further and reconsider their positions.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 14:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right, I misread the above to read that you were accusing him of graduating from Tyndale and that in connection Tyndale was a diploma mill. As a matter of fact, you don't bother to mention where he graduated from or what evidence you have that it is a diploma mill. So until you provide evidence that he graduated from a diploma mill we are left with assuming it is merely your opinion.</dd>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is an elaborate hoax. Some history: It was tagged speedy, I removed the tag because it wasn't appropriate and I actually thought the tag was added in error (see the history and you might see why). In any case, it had been added intentionally, but hoaxes are not speedy-able, so the same editor prodded it. An anon removed the prod with "not a hoax" as a summary, so we find ourselves here. I have to say, I can find no evidence that this movie is being planned whatsoever.

<li>Kind of like "A peer-reviewed journal may state a scientific foundations of new theory are solid in light of our current knowledge, but that doesn't make it <i>factual,</i>" right? =) If a couple of journalists from different mags get the bright idea to bash out an article that goes "X,Y, and Z are beginning to sound like cliches", and happen to agree on those, I'm betting that's a reasonable fact to be included to <i>any</i> article on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Touche. But I for one don't think it wise to compare a gaming magazine (that tends to give bonus points for buying ad-space) to a scientific journal. Don't get me wrong, I think this COULD work. I just don't think this is how it should be done. This is a lot like looking at an Easter Eggs topic on GameFAQs. They list a lot of stuff, but most of those aren't easter eggs. The same is true here. The crate one for example is a known cliche. But most of the ones here are either gaming traditions/conventions, or just a case of saving resources (not showing every single item on the character), or just good gameplay (not having to make sure that the inseam is right for your platemail). However, I really don't see the current creators of this page cleaning it up (just judging by the listing of "cliches" in the discussion page. And just a quick bit of info on the last attempt to delete this, I really don't think that is a good example of why it should be saved. Look at it, most of it is just "This is really cool, keep it." <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundato_bcdb.html" title="User:Gundato">Gundato</a> 01:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this article must be deleted then all clichés-related lists on Wikipedia must be AFD'd too, e.g. list of animation clichés, list of comic book clichés, <a href="../../../o/n/-/On-screen_clich%C3%A9s.html" title="On-screen clichés">on-screen clichés</a>, and so on. It should also be noted that both policies quoted by <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy">TBC</a> are closely related, and given that the list has survived a previous AFD by nearly 100% of support, I would say that <b>keeping</b> the article seems the right option.

Also, the AfD you cited that recieved a lot of support votes is a nomination on Computer and video game clichés, not Computer and video game <i>item</i> clichés.

<li>First of all, most of the items mentioned in the article logically appear in the video games due to their setting. For example, toilets would logically appear in an FPS involving humans since humans <i>use toilets</i>, and a crowbar would logically appear in games involving "breaking and opening things" since crowbars <i>are</i> used in real life for breaking and opening things. As for cleaning up the article, as Wickthework mentioned below, since so much of the content is original research, removing it would leave the article too short to merit either an article or a stub--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 04:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The Crowbar, I can give you, but the Toilet section refers to the <i>promient</i> use of toilets for humor or grossness factors. And those two don't discount the Piece of String, the use of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_satchel.html" title="Magic satchel">Magic satchels</a>, the <i>over</i>use of crates, Instant-use Medipacks(And the Turkey Leg of Healing found in the trash), One-Size-Fits-All armor, and the ever-popular Exploding Barrel. Sure, we can toss the crowbar section, and maybe cut the toilets one down to size, but those two don't necessitate the removal of the <i>entire</i> article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a> 04:48, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just going over them,. the crate one is still arguable (but probably deserves its own page since, let's face it, it is an icon of gaming). String and rope, when used in puzzles, almost always are used for their intended purpose. Just being used a lot doesn't a cliche make. Would you rather they use chain? Wire? Two pick-axes? Metal-bars? Arguable as a weapon, but not so much a prying object. That IS why crowbars exist. The toilet one is just pathetic. Barrels, yeah that is funny (and probably a cliche at this point). The last three are more gameplay or engine limitations than not. So then, all that is left are two of the entries. <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGundato_bcdb.html" title="User:Gundato">Gundato</a> 11:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I doubt this is OR, although it is in need of citations. Looking at the first two scientists listed, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Al-Nafis_9d58.html" title="Ibn Al-Nafis">Ibn Al-Nafis</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Haitham_5d7a.html" title="Ibn al-Haitham">Ibn al-Haitham</a>, the information appears to be valid. My objection is that, do we really need to break down contributions to science by ethnic group? Should we also have "(Jewish / Anglo / Incan / Egyptian / LGBT / Female / etc.) contributions to science as well"? Will we need "Arab contributions to (medicine / physics / literature / poetry / engineering)" as well? Maybe many of these exist, but it just seems to me that this opens up endless numbers of possible lists. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 15:05, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and source</b>. The point of this article appears to be to contest the standard Western attribution of some basic scientific discoveries, and as such the information has interest, <u>if the sources for the claims are specified</u>. However, I think it would be best served by merging it with <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_science.html" title="History of science">history of science</a>, so that the merits of the opposing points of view can be balanced; as it stands, it comes over as a point-of-view fork. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 16:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> (allow userfication if someone has access to the sources). I don't see a good single article to merge to. Each claim, if cited, probably should go to multiple articles.

<ol>
<li><i>A quick [google] reveals thousands of pages</i>: the user does a search for <i>Nintendo Megaton</i> (90,900 hits), but a search for <i>"Nintendo Megaton"</i> returns 13,400, and a more cleaned <i>"Nintendo Megaton" -forum -topic</i> just 2,320.</li>
<li><i>"Nintendo Megaton" has nearly 500 mentions</i>: creator acknowledges a low amount of hits</li>
<li>He gives six links as examples for importance. One is broken, three are forum posts, an article that uses Megaton in the title only, and one (apparently the only useful, found at http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=188) states that the meme ("Megaton") was first used in 2002.</li>
</ol>
<p>Article has no references, quite a lot of speculation. Finally, note that it has recently been linked from <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joystiq.html" title="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> at http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/15/megaton-the-story-behind-the-meme/ which may bring some disruption. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:53, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per the reasoning above. One other thing that you have to look at when you google a topic like this is how many pages the results for this stop after 160 something hits...

<p>Neologism; Google hits are to Wikipedia-related sources or to one blog with few comments; article itself lacks references and does not concern a term used in standard intellectual history ThaddeusFrye 05:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystheism.html" title="Dystheism">dystheism</a>. This has a two-years' history, see the talkpage: the article was created in good faith and with enthusiasm by a user who I suppose is identical with the "Maltheism movement" as announced elsewhere on the net. I tried to convince them that the correct term is <i>dystheism</i> but they insisted that maltheism was something separate, as part of online culture or something. After all this time, there is <i>no</i> evidence of this, the term <i>is</i> a neologism of questionable notability, but I see no harm in redirecting to <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystheism.html" title="Dystheism">dystheism</a> to accommodate users who might be looking for the term. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 07:51, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> There are no real references. The opening paragraph references a forum user's post. As far as I can tell some people who agree with dystheism, which itself is a term made up in 1998, made up their own term to say "God is bad" instead of just "God is not wholly good". All the Google search results on this are wikis and forum posts. It's not a recognized philosophical term; it's definitely a neologism. Maybe there's no harm in a redirect, but I imagine those who believe in "maltheism" could find an appropriate philosophy or theology article.

<ul>
<li>I know that you have some wapred definition of game guide that does not include articles like this, but by the logic you just used above, all video game guides and walkthorughs belong as they aid in understanding the game. The question therefore is, how can you possibly reconcile your above statement with established wikipedia policy prohibiting walkthroughs and game guides? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 02:47, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Walkthroughs are "how-tos" and do not belong. There is no policy against game guides except to the extent they are instructional rather than encylopedic. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:57, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That does not answer the question thought. A walkthrough also aids understanding the game, and above you said that anything that aids in understanding the game is encyclopedic. I do not think you are deliberately contradicting yourself, but I do think your initial comment was a bit careless. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>- I would not say supremely encyclopedic but it is a well written list (as well as lists can be) and it does add under standing to the game. Also it keeps these units from being spelled out on the game's main article thus keeping another more important article concise.

<li>It aids in understanding of the game by telling the user what units are effective against which other units. This is by definition a game guide in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Neither your arguement or any of the other keep arguements give one single reason how this conforms to policy.

<ul>
<li>I did not try to argue that it does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> i simply stated that this list keeps this information out of another article that is pretty well written if not a tad bloated. So by deleting it your asking for this to be added to the main Age of Empires article thus making a decent and notable article much worse. but thats just my thoughts<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyt021_3281.html" title="User:Treyt021">Trey</a> 19:41, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, by deleting I am saying that this information does not belong at all. If I though the information belonged on the main game page, I would be calling for a merge, not a delete. This information does not belong on the main game page any more than it belongs on a separate page. Also, and please do correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that you just admitted that this article violates policy and voted keep anyway. If that is your position (and like I said, I may be confused), then I would suggest that your vote should be discounted, or at the very least treated with skepticism by the closing admin. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:08, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I believe that in these discussions, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and that other users should not attempt to discredit them. If Trey believes that it should be kept, that is up to him. Also, it should be noted that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_Bureaucracy" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a> states that the Rules should not be followed to the letter, if they are followed in spirit.

I'm all for trying to solve the problem, but it's one with a lot of work and resistance attached. Additionally, I confess: I actually gave up on notability checking Indian caste list pages a long time ago.

I was intrigued by the original article, which lacked many things, and spent the better part of yesterday trying to get to the bottom of this with reliable information from valid (and citable) sources. Right now there is too much evidence to suggest that this may still have an official tie to the lonelygirl15 creators, and the two mentions in the NY Times are notable as such.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom; There are several forums available to document this. It could be added later once it's nature is determined (ARG, hoax, etc.).

<li>For the record, I committed the "highly inappropriate" step of advertising this topic by posting about it to the unfiction forums. Sorry, I didn't realize that was super-frowned upon at the time. In my defense, my posting (which I can't link to because the forums are down now) encouraged only wikipedians to come here and didn't advocate for creating new wikipedia accounts just to vote. Also, it seems that people attracted by this posting have voted both ways, not just "keep". Anyway, sorry. The forum is down and doesn't appear to be coming back with the old data anytime soon, so it seems my message contributed about four or five votes here, tops. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumpy_f2e6.html" title="User:Plumpy">Plumpy</a> 22:53, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just out of curiousity... advertising what? The "cassieiswatching" YouTube poster has no products to sell, and the Wikipedia entry has been created by fans of hers, not by an involved party <i>promoting</i> the videos, which is drastically different than <i>advertising</i>. The question is whether CIW is <i>notable</i>, not an ad-hoc assesment of whether the article was created purely by CIW's authors to promote it, which is unlikely considering the number of people who have contributed to the article. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 10:08, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Think for a minute, delete voters: LG15's article was initially deleted in a similar vote, until I nominated it for DRV and it got undeleted by an overwhelming majority, and of course since then the article has been hugely in demand. The right and wrong of that situation is clear. Wouldn't deleting this be making the same mistake? I have no doubt about this being notable. The phenomenon has reached such a level that all aspects of it, including spin-offs, are notable as well. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think deleting lonelygirl15 was a mistake. Nor was it a mistake to bring it back. The notability of the subject changed and thus it was brought back.

<li>I certainly <i>hope</i> it wasn't working properly in that instance, since she was plainly notable already when that first debate took place. We just had deletionists reflexively voting against something because of the subject: "just some blogger", "a fad" (some people think fads are non-notable), etc. It was more notable the second time around, yes, but it didn't switch from being non-notable to being notable in that time period (about a week, as I recall).

It went from have a majority of people favoring deletion the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_9cc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15">first</a> time to a unanimous keep the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lonelygirl15_%28second_nomination%29_bfa8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lonelygirl15 (second nomination)">second</a> time. What was the difference you might ask? Perhaps what made her more notable was that she appeared in several main stream media news services and put out an additional 7 videos averaging over 500,000 views where her old views were closer to 200,000. I don't think wikipedians are idiots.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - two suicides are of passing interest (perhaps more to the families of the men, but that's neither here nor there). Sadly, even a suicide is hardly "unusual circumstances", and even if it were there's only two instances thereof. As one user suggested earlier, if more of them had been hit by cricket balls and killed as a result, <i>that</i> would make the article more noteworthy.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Most of the criticisms above deal with the <i>quality</i> of the article, which is a reason for improvement but not with a valid reason for deletion (e.g. nom. talks about "needs sources" and "some entries don't belong"). A list of anti-American terrorist incidents does NOT inherently have a non-neutral point of view. I don't even know what point of view the nom thinks it is pushing.

<li><b>Comment</b> Notice that the lists you mention: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wars.html" title="List of wars">list of wars</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">list of disasters</a> are defined by commensurable standards - a war is a war etc. We don't have list of Anti-American wars for example. Why not? Because there can be no such categorisation, "anti-American" is a vague disputed term and is thus incommensurable. The nom doesn't talk about "needing sources", nor states "some entries don't belong" as you claim. It states that "none of the entries should be categorised simply as "anti-American" in an encyclopedia". The fact that there are no sources for this merely reiterates how unencyclopedic such a list is.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 19:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The term 'Anti-American' is too specific, however; one would need sources for each incident to allow that claim. 'Terrorist incident' can be interpreted as 'act of terrorism' or as 'act by a terrorist', the latter would need a conviction as such by court. Rename the article '<b>List of assassinations and acts of terrorism against Americans'</b> (which is <i>not</i> the same as incidents that happenened in the US). The term 'terrorism' is nearly <i>always</i> a POV, but is correct in the renamed title and not WP:POV as it is objectively stated from what position the view is made: from its targeted American citizens. 'Assassinations' are not always considered terrorism (hence separately mentioned in the new title), but are just as terrorism, <i>illegal attempts disrespectful of human life, seemingly to cause a political influence</i>, and are most often clearly distinguishable from other 'murders'. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_23.html" title="Sep 23">23 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 09:40&#160;(UTC)</span>

<p>The result was <b>NO CONSENSUS TO DELETE</b>. I count 12-6 in favor of Keep, but I didn't close as Keep in spite of the numbers because the argument that the list is and has been shown to be unmaintainable is the strongest argument made in my opinion.</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but it needs heavy editing. I'd say you've unearthed a pretty good collection of related articles that need to be either reworked or deleted, but the list itself (with some work) seems OK. On its face it doesn't seem any different from, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a> (which as far as i know is an acceptable page), but there is one difference: Most, or maybe all, of the people on the Nair list are probably unknown to English speakers and are not notable enough to have even more than a few paragraphs attributed to their articles. (I mean if you click most of those links, they're stubs that offer no explanation as to the notability of the individual, and even some of those that do have serious POV issues.) So i guess my suggestion is two-fold: (1) Go through and get rid of all the non-notable people in the list (there are a couple, but apparently not many); and (2) order it by name, not 'major area of work'. I don't know enough about India to do the former myself though. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">Lav-chan</a> 09:54, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.We should check whether this list serves any purpose at all. If you go to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a> and the pages linked from there, you can see that in most of the pages there is a mention of the person being a gay / lesbian. The person was famous as a gay /lesbian as well. Here most of the Nairs mentioned are not famous as a Nair. Of course it could be argued that it is a fact. Then there are many such facts and people here can be put in any of the 2000 cast wise lists, 500 District wise lists, and so on. The point is whether it is relevant. Of course, we have lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_actors_96fc.html" title="List of Muslim actors">List of Muslim actors</a>, etc. If these lists justify the presence of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Nairs_fa2a.html" title="List of famous Nairs">List of famous Nairs</a>, we should debate the relevance of the policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> ("having lists if their entries are famous because they are associated with or significantly contributed to the list topic"). I think that should be one of the criteria for a list and we can start the deletions at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_Nairs_fa2a.html" title="List of famous Nairs">List of famous Nairs</a> as it serves no purpose other than being a breeding ground for many non-notable, unverifiable and often fictitious Nair “biographies”.

<p><b>Weak Keep</b> - The concept is sound as per the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_actors_96fc.html" title="List of Muslim actors">List of Muslim actors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>, etc. However, it needs serious NPOV'ing, cleaning-up, and verification. Whether these people have denounced their caste origins or not - that is irrelevant. It is simply a list. I am not sure about serving to "further" casteist agendas or whatever. At the very least, it is a list of people. I would have said <b>Keep</b> had the article been better written. --Vivin Paliath (<span style="color: green;" lang="ml" xml:lang="ml">വിവി൯ പാലിയത്</span>)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I do not think that the comparisons given are appropriate. A list of famous caste members contributes to the perpetuation of racism and discrimination, but a list of Muslim actors does not. A person's caste should not even be mentioned in an article unless there is a reason to, such as experiencing discrimination that shaped the person's life. Wikipedia should not help, in any way or any amount, to preserve the idea that some people are better than others due to the caste they are born into. I think that part of the lack of objection to the list is that people would probably not mind being included on a list of Nairs very much, whereas being on a list of untouchables would probably be undesirable to many people. However, if we do not have a list of untouchables because it is undesirable and racist, we should not have lists of higher castes. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I do think the comparison is appropriate. Having a list of Nairs doesn't do anything to further "racism" or "discrimination". There is "racism" and "discrimination" on the basis of religion alone in many places. Being a member of a caste doesn't automatically mean you stand for discrimination or racism on that basis. I am a Nair, and I am proud of the heritage and culture behind that fact. I also acknowledge the various excesses and illogic behind caste rules and needless to say I think they are stupid. So how am I furthering "discrimination"? Identifying yourself or identifying someone as being from a caste is just that - identification. There is no agenda. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivin_8731.html" title="User:Vivin">Vivin Paliath (വിവി൯ പാലിയത്)</a> 16:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Comment</b> As I mentioned above, it is tough to maintain this article because of the many unimportant and unverified entries and too many drive-by editors (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_famous_Nairs&amp;limit=5000&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_famous_Nairs&amp;limit=5000&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Edit history</a>).

<p><b>Comment</b> This debate would become very constructive, if the participants base the arguments on wikipedia policies. We are not making any value judgments or taking moral stand points. The aim is to discuss whether this list is acceptable as an article in wikipedia, wikipedia policies regarding this and also practical considerations in implementing them. Arguments like "giving informations on any subject under the sun is the increases the relevance and scope of an encyclopedia." are in fact against the policies.

<b>Strong Keep</b>- Most of the persons got enlisted in the list of famous Nairs have incomparable contributions to the social life. Political leader Jaya Jaitly is the nephew of C.Sankaran Nair. (How many of us know that the National level leader and former M.P Jaya Jaitly is a Malayali...?). It was new information to me which I recieved from Nairs List. I have just picked a sample of valuable information. Many freedom Fighters and social reformers are enlisted in the list of famous Nairs. Are they not famous enough...? The next generation will tell that Gandhiji is not famous enough as model John Abraham or Aiswarya Rai. Somebody may ask who is Mannathu Padmanabhan...? I know only Sreesanth and Munaf Patel! <a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv._P._R._Bijuchandran_9b9c.html" title="User:Adv. P. R. Bijuchandran">Adv. P. R.

<p><b>Comment</b> This is precisely the point. Most of us know Jaya Jaitly (she is notable and so there should be a page on her) but not as a Nair, not as some one born at a particular hour of day, not as some one who keeps a particular pet, not as some one who frequents this particular restaurant, not as some one whose house number starts with *, etc. All such lists are irrelevant.<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7EClt13_a758.html" title="User:Clt13">Clt13</a> 05:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why's that? It may not be the best article in the wiki, but that's just because nobody's gotten around to fixing it. According to the wikipedia guidelines, articles doesn't need to be deleted if "it is not original research, its central information is verifiable, and it is capable of achieving a neutral point of view with good editorship." I agree, it needs to be cited more, but that falls under the third point. --MrRandomGuy 10:48, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - in a poor attempt to keep the whole "legal-terminology-thing" going here, it would set a precident for people like Brandt to have their articles deleted by pure wish. If Wikipedia was based on what people wished for, and not on the underlying policies, imagine how some articles on Wikipedia would read - <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">POV</a>-like. We cannot comprimise the encyclopaedia because of the subject's wishes - thats called vanity. And if you think that this is non-notable, maybe you should see all the other articles without even a single source - I reckon this would beat 25% of Wikipedia articles purely because it has a news source. I also agree with Longhar that <i>"Wikipedia is not here to aid a legal defence nor do families have such right to censorship of public information"</i>.

<li>I obviously know Jean-Paul Floru, because he and I are both Westminster City Councillors, and in fact he is my local councillor since I live in Hyde Park Ward (though I don't think I'm breaking any news to announce that I did not favour him with my vote in May). The article is clearly autobiographical and needs checking. As far as notability of councillors goes, AfD decisions have been inconsistent. Individual councillors have been deleted, but a mass nomination of useless substubs on Manchester City Councillors (which was my idea) resulted in a keep. Here we have a subject whose notability is not just from being a councillor but also from political and artistic activity. I would myself err on the side of <b>keep</b>. I would also say that Westminster is a small borough, but it tends to be a lot more notable than similar sized boroughs because it covers central London: Westminster councillors are probably more likely to be notable than those from rural districts. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 11:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would like to try to keep this neutral, but perhaps the fact that this person is the "inventor" of a "thought screen helmet" designed to stop "alien mind control" and curtail abductions deserves mention. But at any rate, this fails notability, verifiability, etc., etc., etc. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 12:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>- Actually... it doesn't fail either notability or verifiability. He gets 1000 hits on Google, is the son of the man who invented Captain Video has been interviewed numerous times onine, in publications and on radio and we can see photographs and people claiming that it works. This proves notability and verifiability. Just because it is an odd topic, granted, doesn't mean that it should be removed. What of all the porn people listed on Wikipedia?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think that the relevant clause of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should be interpreted as "anybody that has been interviewed". This is a weak opinion of mine. To interview somebody is vastly less notable than to have a real article on them. Hell, I've been interviewed numerous times on radio shows. I'd be the first one to put a {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} tag on an article about myself. Also, the only reason that Menkin has been so extensively interviewed (without a non-interview article) is that he is so bizarre.

<dd>The Herald Sun's online archive goes back to 1990, apparently, and I searched simply for "Menkin", which means that even if they ran an article on an egg salesman named "John Menkin" something should have come up...but nothing did. I also searched The Daily Mirror, The Standard, the New Zealand Herald, and the Sydney Morning Herald.</dd>
<dd>Now, to be charitable, we could say it might just be that the newspapers themselves don't put minor, humorous back-page sort of stories on their websites. But, if this is the case, then is this guy really notable? If in retrospect his story is not one that newspapers consider important enough to put on their sites, then should Wikipedia be bothering with him.</dd>
<dd>Look, I understand the humour here. Hell, I have been chuckling about the guy all weekend. But, Wikipedia is not a hall of fame for cranks and loonies. It is an encyclopaedia. This chap is simply not a candidate for an encyclopaedic biography. While tin-foil hats, as a pop culture phenomenon, probably deserve mention, his particular brand of them (made of Velostat, not tin-foil), is in all likelihood not notable enough to be mentioned either. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 06:19, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you have a subscription to the archives? The free search -for the Herald Sun, and most newspapers actually - is limited to articles from the last thirty days. In any case, the articles <i>do</i> appear on Factiva. I invite anyone with access to Factiva to run searches for "Michael Menkin," "Mike Menkin", and "thought screen helmet" (individually, not in combination with each other). All of the above articles should show up. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 14:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, I suppose: I don't have a subscription to the Herald Sun (why would I?)...one simply cannot be too careful, especially when dealing with a subject like this, which is apt to attract the certifiably insane; my sincere apologies for any undue insult I may have caused, Zagalejo. Nonetheless, whether or not Menkin has had a few tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-disparaging newspaper articles about him, I still maintain that that is insufficient to meet criteria of notability. I would not be averse to a (brief) mention of the "thought screen helmet" in the tin-foil hat article, either (I also enjoy the idiosyncratic humour behind this whole thing) - I just don't think that someone who makes Velostat hats to stop people being "abducted by aliens" merits a biography in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 14:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since the article is essentially three paragraphs long, and the only "notable" contribution Menkin has made is in the context of the <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">Tin-foil hat</a> perhaps the content in this article would be best merged with that entry. Then, the "contributions" and the appropriate value of this invention and its inventor are all integrated, with some appropriate caveats.

<dd>I think this is perfect. It includes some mention of Menkin's appearances in the media (both positive and negative, with statistical weight towards the tongue in cheek), is relevant and could flow nicely into the tin-foil hat entry. It seems appropriately encyclopedic, and NPOV. Nice job. I have one quibbble over one word choice, which is "target" in the phrase "has made Menking a target of..." <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 19:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How about, "Because of his unusual invention, Menkin has become the subject of <s>tongue-and-cheek</s> tongue-in-cheek newspaper and magazine articles throughout the world"? And, looking back on it, I could probably chop off the last four words of the first sentence, since I would assume that would be obvious within the context of the article. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 20:33, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(resetting indent). I think subject is better than target, and agree that there are some things that would be clearer in the context of the article. I think tongue-in-cheek is the standard phrase over tongue-and-cheek. But these are tiny details. I think that this is quite good now, and all we need is to see if the other editors who have been voting on this are pretty much in agreement, and we can go ahead and do this... Indeed, you could probably add the text you've suggested to <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin-foil_hat.html" title="Tin-foil hat">tin-foil hat</a> now, and then we can just see if others are in agreement to close the AfD and delete.

<p>The article makes sweeping POV statements that tend to condemn what Santorum said. The controversy is not any more noteworthy than incidents by, among others, Howard Dean, George Allen, and Joseph Biden, who each have their controversies described in the text of their biographies. A nearly identical summary exists in Santorum's biography, which should be sufficient to discuss the controversy. On account of it being a redunant entry, a biased article, and lacking meaningful support (for instance, the "defense of remarks" section is largely ad hoc), coupled with the fact that it's not any more noteworthy than similarly-situated controversies, it should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> the info would be too unwieldly to put into the main Rick Santorum article plus there are several facets of the controversy that are intrinsic to the <i>controversy</i> but not neccessary to the article about the Senator. For instance, the coining of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum_%28sexual_slang%29.html" title="Santorum (sexual slang)">Santorum (sexual slang)</a> was directly related to the <i>controversy</i> and not really the Senator himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think the popularity of the "santorum" slang term bestows notability upon the controversy that spawned it. I also don't buy that this is a mere content fork. It isn't even the only controversy the dude's been involved in! I won't assume whoever split this off from the main article had political motivations, especially because this may have been a bigger news item three years ago, but having a separate article now gives undue weight to the events comparatively.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 02:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think the brunt of contention is the notability of what happened. It was distinctly notability with a firestorm of attention. Looking at the discussion above, the vast majority deems the content worthy of inclusion but in what format? As its own article or merged with the main Senator's page.<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 02:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per my man Arbusto. There is a strong possibility that this ordeal will be the longest lasting memory of the good senator (by both the anti-Gay right that lionized him as a hero for his stance and the left who villianized).

The arguments to delete or merge all seem to fall under the "well, here's an example, and here's an example, and if this example, and this example, then therefore" fallacy, which I believe contradicts official Wikipedia policy. --70.108.116.231 13:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I really fail to understand how this event is any more significant than incidents of <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_biden.html#1988_Presidential_Campaign" title="Joe biden">Biden</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html#Controversial_quotes" title="Howard Dean">Dean</a>, or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Felix_Allen_0fcc.html#Controversies" title="George Felix Allen">Allen</a>? Even <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Scream_044a.html" title="Dean Scream">Dean Scream</a> redirects to Howard Dean's main page. If you can convince me that this controversy is more significant than the Dean Scream, you've convinced me to keep the article. The fact that even the plethora of incidents related to the Dean Scream make it under Dean's main article, however, suggests that it won't be too unwieldy.
<dl>
<dd>To counter this question (this is likely not the Way of Wiki, but humor me): How is this any <i>less</i> important than the Nobel Prize controversies, the Londonderry / Derry naming controversy, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy_over_Cantor%27s_theory_bfce.html" title="Controversy over Cantor's theory">Controversy_over_Cantor's_theory</a>, or anything else in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">Controversy</a> page? I have not yet read the Dean article - this I will freely admit - however, off the cuff, I could say that a senator's ten second outburst on television is slightly different than a senator being completely biased against homosexuals. It's a deeper issue, for starters - while there's plenty of sociopolitical commentary that could be had on whether or not Dean's Scream "should" have been more tolerated or less reported than it was, it's not fitting for a Wiki article. This, on the other hand, is more than "Santorum stated in a conversation that he is against homosexual acts, though not homosexuals, and doesn't feel the right of privacy applies to them" - or rather, it <i>should</i> be more than that, as anything less would be merely inflammatory. Even that inflammatory, provacative, unsourced / unqualified statement takes more words to summarize than Dean's ten seconds of fame in 2003.</dd>
<dd>Also, being that this is a relatively current event, sheer information abundance (not to be confused with information overload) may contribute to the size factor in comparison to Joe Biden - slap a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag or two on an article from an event in 1988, and you can hear the sound of Wikipedians one by one resigning themselves to a shorter article, rather than spending a day in a library with suitable historic archives.</dd>
<dd>Allow me to also make it clear that I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican, nor even a practicing homosexual (though, like many others, I <i>have</i> been called "gay" on the internet). I'm just a random surfer who has come to this page via the aforementioned Controversy page. --70.108.116.231 15:17, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I only use the "Dean Scream" as a point of comparsion. Yes, it was 10 seconds, but it's considered the singular issue that resulted in Dean's loss by many, and it was widely mimicked and imitated in television and Internet culture. I'm not saying that Santorum's position on this issue isn't significant. But Marilyn Musgrave is also opposed to homosexual conduct, as are many other conservative members of Congress. His remarks on homosexuality are no more significant than, say an article identifying a "Barney Frank controversy" simply because he's a homosexual and in the significant minority of Congress. It seems entirely POV fork to insist that a candidate significantly opposed to homosexual acts is a "deeper issue," but other issues, like incidents of racial slurs (Allen), plagiarism (Biden), or religiously-bigoted comments (Dean) are not "deeper issues."</dd>
<dd>As for Cantor's theory, genuine scientific debate over a scientific matter is entirely different than a "controversial" political position. While there's debate in science about whether a theory or hypothesis is sound or not, in politics we accept that different politicians have different positions. There's controversy, sure, but we shouldn't designate controversial homosexual opinions more weighty than others. <b>This article can easily be condensed with a few footnotes to relevant articles and merged with the main article.</b></dd>

A Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ipa2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ipa2" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> doesn't give much about this certain "IPA2" apart from Wikipedia, its mirrors, and <s>its</s> IPA2's homepage. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoozbeh_5649.html" title="User:Roozbeh">roozbeh</a> 13:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> Keep</b> I disagree with the nomination for deletion. I have my own concerns:
<ol>
<li>What do you mean by YET ANOTHER; as long as I know, there are only 2 main systems suggested for Persian alphabet: <a href="../../../u/n/i/UniPers_26dc.html" title="UniPers">UniPers</a> and <a href="../../../i/p/a/IPA2_ed0e.html" title="IPA2">IPA2</a>. Can you name others which are of great noticeability?</li>
<li>IPA2 is not used for TRANSCRIBING Persian into the LATIN SCRIPT. IPA2 is an alphabet proposed officially to REPLACE Perso-Arabic and not to TRANSCRIBE it. I used official, because an introduction to this alphabet is officially printed in proceedings of a linguistic conference held by a reputable Iranian university. I could acquire a copy and I recommend you doing the same.</li>
<li>I see no problem in the articles being created by RESPONSIBLE people. I am concerned about your point as it may lead to misleading actions to avoid your accusation, such as choosing an ID which does not show the real identity of the author. I really appreciate those people who are honest enough to show their real identity freely and without any concerns caused by people like you who are discouragingly manipulating other people's works here on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>IPA2 is a general abbreviation which can stand for many full names. Pls narrow your search by adding extra info or trying other combinations. I found some with LinguistList and Iran-Daily and ProZ. They contain info which may have been created by the same person in question. But there are resources. Besides, I do not expect much from search engines for the system is new enough not to be discussed about more than it is.</li>
<li>I also searched for your name and activities. You seem to be a biased person on this issue because you are one of the people invovled in developing a Farsi (Persian) Linux for the Iranian government. Iranian government as been againt any alphabet change and so are the people participating in Farsi Linux project who are in favour of Perso-Arabic script in use.</li>
<li>Finally, a personal question: how many articles are there which are created by you about you and about your own projects. Do you nominate them for deletion? and how many other people are there in your camp? -<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersiciser_c80a.html" title="User:Persiciser">Persiciser</a>, 17:55, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Just to emphasize that some parts of this is a personal attack towards me. I am not involved in developing FarsiLinux, and I do not remember creating any article created by me about my projects or myself. I don't care about a switch to the Latin script either. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoozbeh_5649.html" title="User:Roozbeh">roozbeh</a> 18:02, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry! But I did not mean to attack you! Cos I do not know you! That was just a result of my searches with Google. About your not being involved, here are some counter-evidence cases:

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>I don't think this article should be deleted. I think the article is informative and should not be deleted. What can happen if Wikipedia has one more article?? The author must've worked hard to write this article. Why should we delete this article and waste all the time he spent finding information on the article .etc? Also I agree with <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShashankNeo_f953.html" title="User:ShashankNeo">GreatShash</a> 03:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShashankNeo_f953.html" title="User:ShashankNeo">GreatShash</a>: Please don't SHOUT! It doesn't make your argument any stronger. Nor does an appeal to feelings. As you may see, I have alredy proposed that the article should be kept, albeit weakly. But your contribution tells us only that you think it should not be deleted: you do not say why. Please look at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD#How to discuss an AfD/Wikietiquette</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 10:56, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"How would you feel if your articles began to get listed for deletion?" — The very first article that I ever created here was nominated for deletion. I read the policies and guidelines, made a case based upon them, and the article was kept. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:11, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShashankNeo_f953.html" title="User:ShashankNeo">GreatShash</a>, thank you for improving your contribution above (though editing it in place makes my reply, and that of <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a>, look incoherent: I would prefer if you had added a new comment). But you are still not advancing an argument relevant to Wikipedia. Please look <i>again</i> at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD#How to discuss an AfD/Wikietiquette</a>. The issue is whether the article meets the requirements of Wikipedia, not how much work went into it. As I said, I have already supported keeping the article, but your non-arguments (especially since the author of the article has <i>asked</i> you on your <a href="../../../s/h/a/User_talk%7EShashankNeo_63a3.html" title="User talk:ShashankNeo">talk page</a> to contribute to this debate) do not push the discussion forward. If it were a popularity vote, your sycophantic response to <a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrMoslehi_3de0.html" title="User:DrMoslehi">DrMoslehi</a>'s request would make me change my recommendation to <i>delete</i> - but it isn't, and I continue to recommend <i>weak keep</i> on the article's merits. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 12:39, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry, ColinFine! I edited your bold tags and changed them to Italic because the BOT parser would count the bold votes as original votes. -<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrMoslehi_3de0.html" title="User:DrMoslehi">DrMoslehi</a> 21:48, 17 September 2006 (UTC+3:30)
<ul>
<li>Are you sure? I've no particular objection, but I can't find any evidence that votes are counted by a bot. <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html#How_to_discuss_an_AfD.2FWikietiquette" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD#How to discuss an AfD/Wikietiquette</a> says 'Usually editors recommend a course of action in bold text, e.g., "Keep" or "Delete"', which definitely does <b>not</b> suggest that counting is done by a bot. I've had a quick look at the AfD Talk page, and there is certainly some discussion about using a bot to close discussions, but I didn't find any resolution. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 19:20, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> Looking on google (and, yes, I know it's not the end all be all of notability) "Tommy Nero" generates 5,240 hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. But a quick look shows some are in Italian (Nero being an Italian surname) and this article is about an American. It also seems to be many pages not about the same guy. So the article says he is a fashion designer. "Tommy Nero" + fashion (a logical search since he is said to be a fashion designer, and hence the reason for his notability) leads to this - 882 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22+fashion" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22+fashion" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. I'll let the voters sift thru these links, but you will notice most are blogs and self-generated press releases matching the links on the article (www.pressreleasespider.com, www.365business.info, www.articles-hub.com, ad nauseum), and many of those are actually dead links. The constant thru all of those postings is "fashion fusion" and a place/venue called deja vu. So "Tommy Nero" + fashion, - fusion, -dejavu (if he is a real fashion designer of note, removing 2 keywords should still generate many hits) and you are down to 100<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22+fashion+-fusion+-dejavu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-06%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22tommy+nero%22+fashion+-fusion+-dejavu" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> and most of those are just wikimirrors and myspace links. The only "war correspondent" pieces offered up are an interview of an heir of the Benz family upon his graduation from basic training (not exactly in the heat of battle) and then posted on a web site called www.prweb.com and an interview with a captain who was in Iraq, a link that is now dead.--<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobunaga24_963d.html" title="User:Nobunaga24">Nobunaga24</a> 13:51, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Tomodachi Anime is definitely notable in their field, and the apparent lack of links is most likely due to their not having done anything for about 8-9 years. However, they are one of the most well-known fansubbing groups out there, even though they haven't done anything for so long. They are definitely notable. I do agree that the article needs sourcing, but that would be better accomplished by marking it as needing sourcing than nomination for deletion. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 18:26, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless seriously cleaned up. Even if it were cleaned up, I would likely say merge. There's a lot of <a href="../../../p/u/f/Puffery.html" title="Puffery">puffery</a> in stating that they were a "pioneering" fansub group because they were the first to sub a sub-genre or the first to use karaoke subs.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> There are articles on numerous other wiki packages. Should all of them be deleted because they are "another bit of wiki software"? GetWiki is certainly notable as being, thus far, the only known fork of the MediaWiki software. It powers <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>, which itself had been started by <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a>, who has been involved with Wikipedia for a very long time now and is an admin and arbitrator here. I do not see why it is such a problem to have this article here, especially when there are ludicrious articles like <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teabagging.html" title="Teabagging">teabagging</a> that are far, far more deserving of deletion - and yet those types of articles are never deleted, while informative ones are. I wonder, why is that??? Metaspheres 06:25, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but move</b>. Improper article name is not a reason for deletion. This is a dialect used throughout the Mountain West, not just Utah. However, it should be moved to the appropriate name (whatever it may be).

<li><b>Second.</b> This isn't a dialect in the broadest sense of the term, but it's definitely a unique set of pronunciation. Very little research is available on the topic both because the field of Social Linguistics is (relatively) so new to acadamia and because few linguists are studying Utah. However, I've personally volunteered with a professor at Brigham Young University who is specifically researching the topic at the moment.

<li><b>Keep</b> (and merge/move according to non-AfD consensus). What's described is without question an English dialect, though the description is odd in places. I've heard the term "Utah English" before, so I'm willing to believe this is the most common term for it. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandomP_ea0d.html" title="User:RandomP">RandomP</a> 13:49, 21 September 2006 (UTC)k</li>

<p>Keep it. Anything is considered a dialect of English if it is different in any way. If you hear a Utahan speak it, you will know what it is. And religious influences do have something to do with language, because vocabulary is a part of language.</p>
<p>Given the new sources, information, etc., I move that the article be removed from candidacy as an article for deletion. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECathryn_0f5a.html" title="User:Cathryn">Cathryn</a> 05:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>strong Delete</b> This entry breaks Wikipedia rules in so many ways that I do not have time to list them here. It is self-promotional. It is poorly sourced. It uses weasel words. It makes unverifiable claims. From my experience, it makes at least two claims that are simply false or at best extremely misleading, although I do not have the sources at hand to verify this. It is derived almost completely from his personal website. It is written by a person who has repeatedly used meatpuppets and sockpuppets to resist all changes to it. It is part of an entire network of self-referring articles about this fellow and his non-notable friends, and the network's defenders argue that the existence of the network on Wikipedia makes him notable. The existence of this article simply flouts all sorts of Wikipedia's rules and conventions.

<li><b>Delete</b> I ran a multi-decade <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> newspaper and magazine database search, and "Rod D. Martin" scored only 12 hits - of these, the most substantial were 2 hits were versions of an op-ed written by him on internal Republican Party politics in 2002, and a 2004 press release about the Bush <a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagiography.html" title="Hagiography">hagiography</a> he edited. Other mentions were all minor - major category was brief mentions of the book. The most prominent publication was a mention of the book in The Washington Times. A couple of hits - a hit in the Wichtia Eagle local newspaper listing of recent bankruptcies (literally just a list of names and asset values) in 2004, and a 3 line article reference about Arkansas higher education in USA Today in 1987 may or may not be about the Rod D. Martin under discussion. He doesn't seem to have much of a splash outside GOP astroturf blogs/fundraising network.

<li><b>Weak Delete.</b> While the subject appears to be on the cusp of achieving the required level of notability, I am more concerned with the quality of sources for much of the information presented. Besides the <i>Washington Post Online Live</i> interview transcript and the FEC press release, <b>all</b> of the other sources are either completely self-published or at the least self-submitted autobiography. And while self-published sources may be used in some cases to flesh out information on already notable subjects, they cannot be used to <i>establish</i> notability. Other than the fact that he has co-edited one book and that his campaign committee for a failed U.S. House run was fined by the FEC, almost every other statement in this article should be removed as improperly verified per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. When Mr. Martin achieves the required level of notability, we will be able to find reputable, third-party sources from which to write the new article. --<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 13:50, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP ALL: I'm the author of the articles.</b> <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_Abrams_7431.html" title="Floyd Abrams">Floyd Abrams</a> is inextricably linked with every notion of the First Amendment that we, as Americans, have. You can't separate his arguments from how Freedom of Speech is interpreted in the United States. I took it upon myself to summarize--there is *no* copyright violation, and I'm a law student, so I know--to be found here. I think this is very important information. The man has argued before the Supreme Court numerous times. His thoughts, observations, and the people he has come into contact with are living history. If you look at the biography I wrote of him (incomplete) you'll have a sense of this. I'm open to figuring out a better way to do this, but basically I am summarizing an historical document that many law students will find fascinating and informative--make Wikipedia more relevant to their lives. And to ours. I review his legal strategy, his observations on the Supreme Court and standing before them, the legal problems he encountered, and how he dealt with them. If not Wikipedia, where else? The way I have set it up seemed like the best way to go about it. It's a long process, longer than I thought. Mainly because I work and have other scholastic endeavors. But I think it would be a real shame to delete these articles without trying to preserve the information. The man is a legend. His word carries weight in many circles. He is the father of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Abrams_a334.html" title="Dan Abrams">Dan Abrams</a>. I think we would hurt the site if we voted to delete this series. Frankly, I think it speaks to what Wikipedia can be--an amazing treasure trove of information. All the wording is my own; I was carefult to rephrase and re-work the text. There is also an entire subset of articles I've created based on these cases. What I plan to do once I am done summarizing/rewording the cases based upon the memoir is research newspaper articles (with my free Lexis account) and other reviews, editorials and newspaper clippings about the cases, to make them more full-bodied and NOT just about Abrams's point of view. But my starting point has been his memoir. Yes, I do revere him--we all should, in my humble opinion--but I also want to make the articles more complete and not so Abrams-centric. That takes time, guys. I'm trying. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 03:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep all</b>, I looked over the articles expecting them to be boring but, they are not. These articles are well written and referenced. They <b>have not</b> violeted any of Wikipedias policies which would reguire a vote for deletion. I can't understand a "vote" for deletion on the speculation that they have a copyright violation. I can understand a delete vote if a copyright violation has been proven, but this does not seem to be the case. The writer or originator seems to have spent lots of time in these articles and to delete his well writen work would not only discourage him but, would also discourage other excelent writers from contributing to our Pedia.</p>
<p>Sure he wrote quite a lot of independent articles related to the same lawyer however, it would impractible to lump them all in one article. This is what is considered a "series" (and I have seen other series in Wikipedia). As long as there aren't any copyright violations and the articles are encyclopedic and informative within Wikipedia guidelines, I urge a <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">Tony the Marine</a> 04:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep all</b> per Tony the Marine. In my opinion, this is exactly the sort of detailed information that sets Wikipedia apart from any other resource either in print or on the internet. We've all written articles on some pretty ephemeral subjects at one time or another. For instance, I wound up writing a separate article for the technical specs on the Mercedes-Benz 6.9 article I worked on. I've only recently discovered this user's work, mostly because I've been away for so long. He is extremely passionate about his work and I found that out when I deleted a very incomplete work of his in progress. I can appreciate his passion and I strongly feel that deleting a body of work that took hours to complete instead of a few minutes would be a violation of the spirit of Wikipedia and a tremendous blow to the editor who created these. Let's not forget that Wikipedia is not paper. It shouldn't be a random collection of facts, but these works don't fall under that category. - Lucky 6.9 04:49, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>What's sad about your vote</b> is that I wasn't "courting votes" but asking other editors who I have been in touch with (by the way Lucky 6.9 and I only last night had a major argument where he blocked me), but wanted their opinions. Although I asked for their "help" I didn't coach them on their opinion, but said, "if you think the information is important." So, to vote delete based upon this, in my opinion, is "dodgy." can't you give some more depth to your vote than that? Did you even read the articles (which are incomplete)?

<li>I voted to <s>delete</s> merge the articles because the process for something like this is to write an article about the person and then branch out when there is sufficient information about each sub-point.

Also, informing others of an ongoing vote like <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">User:Postdlf</a> did on the WP:SCOTUS talk page seems more appropriate to me rather than contacting individual editors that you may or may not know and asking them to support you, but it's not my choice to make.

<p><b>Merge</b>—I am familiar with the work of Floyd Abrams and the impact he has had upon the law, but dedicating a separate page to each case he has worked on seems like overkill. If there needs to be a page about his work separate and apart from his biographical page, it should be one article dedicated to his work, titled "Litigation of Floyd Abrams" or something like that. It's just a thought...--<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastlaw_d235.html" title="User:Eastlaw">Eastlaw</a> 05:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Eastlaw, I have no problem with a merge.</b> To an extent, I'm working/writing in a vacuum. That's why I said above "I'm open to suggestions about how to do this." I felt this was information that we, Wikipedia, could benefit from contributing to the public sphere. But how to do so, frankly, I had difficulty in figuring out. So, I am open to suggestion. but to just delete seems so gorralia-ish to me. I can change my method, but to just not contribute this information is, in my view, myopic. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 05:25, 18 September 2006 (UTC) As a PS: Other accomplished attorneys have asked me to do the same thing for their tomes that I am attempting to do for Floyd Abrams. If you all don't see how that validates ALL of us and our work, then that saddens me.</p>
<p><b>Keep all</b> - In response to Eastlaw above, I think the individual case articles are going to be far too detailed to keep them on a single manageable list. These aren't vanity stubs, they're pretty thoroughly sourced. And just because no other living lawyer has articles on his/her cases set up in a series like this, doesn't mean Abrams can't be the first. I thought WP was in the business of innovating the way we collect and present knowledge. These articles take a unique approach that's worthy of continued experimentation.</p>
<p>Every time someone RfD's an interesting or unique article, usually on an obscure subject, just because it doesn't fit into someone's idea of what is "conventional," I'm sadly reminded of the story of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Station_%28New_York_City%29_b222.html#Demolition" title="Pennsylvania Station (New York City)">demolition of the old NY Penn Station</a>... <a href="../../../w/l/2/User%7EWl219_bdc1.html" title="User:Wl219">Wl219</a> 05:32, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge all</b> (see end of comment for details as to where). These are unencyclopedic summaries of a memoir—note <i>Speaking Freely</i> by Abrams cited as the main source in the footnotes for all of the above. It seems to me that splitting up the accounts in that book like this at best forms the intersection of discrete topics (the biography of Abrams and notable court cases), and at worst merely repeats Abrams' POV of the events without considering that he is the source for those accounts. Yes, POV is normally a matter for cleanup, but these articles are fundamentally premised on the primacy of his perspective in title as well as content, yet not written as biography either. Any factual information could be used to expand Abrams' biography and/or merged into articles on the court cases, or if the case articles don't yet exist these articles could just be moved to appropriate titles and alter content accordingly so these are about the court cases generally rather than about the role and perspective of one man in them. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 05:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep or Merge or at least Rename</b>. Information is verifiable from reliable sources. It's likely that article titles that brought on this AfD - I could see how the thinking went. These are not POV forks as far as I could tell - they're harmless forks, and some could use a merging, but these are famous cases and if someone did write the extra encyclopedic articles, we should probably thank them. These are not exactly detailed descriptions of evolved fire-breathing pokemons, if you catch my drift. As to copyvio, did it occur to anyone to just ask the contributor if he copied them out of someplace?

<li>I completely agree I at times am too impassioned. I'm willing to admit to my flaws, apologize for them, and work on them. But the source of my Wikistress has almost been exclusively in the realm of trying to beat the clock other editors set for me. I do not lightly create articles; every article I create is source-able and noteable. It's a source of stress to undertake a creative act and have someone want to tear it down before it is even complete. Which brings me to my second problem: impatience. I would be happy to create these articles in a sandbox that could stick around for weeks and week while I slowly built the articles to full-bodied examples of what the Wiki community is capable of. But the sandbox is not like that. I created "WatchingWhales" as a sockpuppet to do just that (build articles on that User page). But the Abrams series was going to be much too big for it. What am I missing? I'm open to advice. Because from where I sit, WP's biggest problem is its members desires to take content off. If it is excellent work to remove vanity and uninspired information. But when deletionist knives start to cut into bone, I wonder about the future of this site. Creating useful and full-bodied articles takes a lot of time (even more than I realized). What is the solution, because obviously impassioned argumentation isn't working so well for me. I'm open to advice. The one Abrams article that is "most complete" (but far from it) is <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_Abrams_and_the_Landmark_Communications_case_c7ff.html" title="Floyd Abrams and the Landmark Communications case">Floyd Abrams and the Landmark Communications case</a>. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 12:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I'm going to take a day off from WP and let you guys discuss this issue.</b> I want to point a couple of things out. How many people knew about <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Newton_b0ac.html" title="Wayne Newton">Wayne Newton</a> and his ties to organized crime? In the back ground to the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_Abrams_and_the_Wayne_Newton_case_3ae9.html" title="Floyd Abrams and the Wayne Newton case">Floyd Abrams and the Wayne Newton case</a> I haven't even begun to discuss NBC's role yet.

If you go to User:WatchingWhales you'll see the jungle that is the William J. Brennan, Jr. award. I start researching, and I sometimes uncover vast information. My point is that currently this project is "under construction." This AfD is a good example of how difficult it can be to work on Wikipedia, racing to finish projects before they get deleted. I'm doing this to propagate knowledge, not to propagate myself. I think these are things people need to know about. I understand about POV issues, and one of the beautiful things about WP to me is the collaboration that goes on amongst all of us. I also personally grow from it. My writing improves. My personality improves. I'll never forget when the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Qana_airstrike_8684.html" title="2006 Qana airstrike">2006 Qana airstrike</a> page took off their POV tag. It was the first time in my life that I felt the Middle East may find peace. That's the beauty of WP - it gives me hope, and shows me possibility. If there is a better way to create articles without taking them live, I'm not aware of it and could stand to be enlightened. But I also liked the idea of getting input from other editors about the task I am undertaking; how to do it better; pitfalls not to repeat. But it's inherently stressful to have the only input come in the form of removing them completely, especially since they aren't anywhere close to being finished. All of your comments are appreciated, but my other articles show I have a sense of what is expected of me when I create. I will see you all tomorrow. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 13:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>I don't mind taking the "Floyd Abrams" out of the article titles - it never sat well with me, anyway.</b> I disagree with Nlu's perspective. The reason I don't think these articles fit with the case articles is because they are more examining the strategy and circumstances surrounding the cases, and the people who worked on them, then the "just the facts" aspect of the main case articles. <b>What I most would prefer</b> is if everyone could hold off on making any judgment about the articles until at least two or three are in final format. Right now, I feel these articles are being prematurely judged, that any decision (whether I agree with it or not) might be the wrong one. Nlu, most of these had "under-construction" tags on them, yet you nominated them for deletion. Don't you find this rash, when you don't even know what they are going to look like in final form? You <i>think</i> you know, but you don't; how could you--I don't even know? I have a free Lexis-Nexis account I plan to use. What happens when I start researching Guido Penosi or Helen Whitney or any of a host of other characters in these plays? I don't know. How many other editors have been in the act of creating an article, without even getting the real meat in there, before another editor deletes? It's highly frustrating. Nlu made a comment about my "bad writing", although my <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tompkins_Square_Park_Police_Riot_7ede.html" title="Tompkins Square Park Police Riot">Tompkins Square Park Police Riot</a> article is up for a GA, once I make a few minor adjustments.

<dd><b>One solution</b>: Make the sandbox more than it is. I think the sandbox should be where editors can create and tool with articles until they are ready to go live. I don't particularly want to use my User page, which I am using to showcase my work. I could create a string of sock puppets to host these articles, but that doesn't seem to be in the spirit of Wikipedia, and is an awkward "work-around" to avoid overzealous deletionists. Is there a way to make the sandbox a sketchpad, where editors can build articles over time before taking them on the main sight? That would solve everything, in my opinion. I like the notion of getting input from other editors during the act of creation; but Nlu wants to get rid of articles without even knowing what they will look like. I don't see how he can make a sensible decision on an unfinished product, or how any of us (including myself) can. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 14:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think I need for them to be in final format in order to judge them to be too much information. (Indeed, any information you add will be too much information.) This amount of coverage, focusing on a single participant's participation in the case, is not warranted. Indeed, if these articles will be deleted anyway, I do not want you to waste your time on adding to them whereas your time can be better spent elsewhere, either on this Wiki or not. Another point that you appear to be unwilling to acknowledge is that the perceptive is inherently POV -- no matter how much you change the wording, concentrating this much on Abram is inherently taking the case out of focus and conducting hero worship.

<dd><b>Nlu, thanks for the comment, but I disagree with it, again.</b> What is "too much information" on a community encyclopedia? How do we decide that? What are the guidelines for "TMI"? I understand your concern about the POV, but I don't think it is relevant. The accuracy of Abrams's POV is not in question here. He is one of the most accomplished attorneys in the history of this country, and his re-telling of the facts and background and people in a case is not in question. Book reviews reveal that; you are relying on conjecture without citing to sources. I appreciate when people point me to policy (I really do) but <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a> is irrelevant because I am not flattering Abrams throughout; indeed, I have a section reserved on each article for criticism. But I do take him as a factual *primary* source; if you dispute that, I wish you would give reasons or at least cite to a book review that shows <i>Speaking Freely</i> is inaccurate and unworthy as a source for Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Second Point: Why I wanted to do these articles</b>: I'd like to tell you how I witnessed law students using Wikipedia in class at Fordham. When I make broad statements, please keep in mind they only apply to my own experience. It may or may not be unique. Today, law students aren't reading (all) the cases they discuss in class. That's because the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_method.html" title="Socratic method">socratic method</a> has fallen into disuse. The overwhelming amount of material we are assigned doesn't get pored over like it used to because there is little incentive. I used to always sit in front of class, but last semester I could not afford to buy any of my books, so I sat in the back. I had a perfect view of what my classmates did on their computers during discussions. They went to Wikipedia to get summaries of cases in order to understand them. What I wanted to do with the articles was to give depth to cases. I wanted law students (or anyone else--I don't write them in legalese, which I oppose anyway) to have a sense of what went into the arguments, how they were won, and where counsel messed up. I plan to make them fuller, like I wrote, but I started with the memoir <i>Speaking Freely</i>. By not including these articles in some form on WP, you deny a class of people--law students--easy access to valuable information. Doesn't that go against what Wikipedia is all about? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 19:40, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Hi Jersyko. The only issue with this is that one such article would be *massive*. Abrams is a primary source for information on cases that shape all of our lives (and so is opposing counsel and the justices themselves). I'm taking a primary source and I am summarizing it into articles, then fact-checking that primary source against other sources (newspapers, the opinions themselves, book reviews, etc.) If Abrams is not a primary source, then I would like to know how not. But since he is a primary source, the informtion belongs with the case articles, or as subarticles to the cases. I once again direct you to the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_Abrams_and_the_Wayne_Newton_case_3ae9.html" title="Floyd Abrams and the Wayne Newton case">Floyd Abrams and the Wayne Newton case</a> where he sues NBC, and I have yet to even mention why or how. It's painstaking to summarize and re-word chapters. If you saw what a mess I've made of this book. I have two suggestions: 1. Give me two weeks to put them in a state where their potential is realized and a more complete picture of what to do with them can be seen; or 2. I'll put them on my User subpages, bring them live later and we can decide how to handle them then. I'm fine with either idea. But I don't see how one incredibly large article about a book can do justice to the insights into the law and American notions of Free Speech that he has essentially created (the S.C. adopted the language from his brief in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States_b460.html" title="New York Times Co. v.

<dd><b>I think that's probably the best idea.</b> I kind of contemplated it at the time, but thought I would finish them as they are now, and then figure out how they should be dispersed. I'm fine with incorporating them into the main case articles and having other editors take a crack at the writing and remove any POV issues, which I strive to avoid. But can I be given two weeks to do it? Once accomplished, I will alert every editor who has taken part in this discussion. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 18:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no real opinion on the notability or other merits (or lack thereof) of this project, although "47 contributors" is not exactly indicative of a high notability. This renomination is motivated by guideline compliance: per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, "The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of [the notability] criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section". This article neither formulates a claim to notability (valid per WP:WEB or otherwise), nor does it back up any such claim with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. In fact, it has no non-primary sources of any kind, making it also subject to deletion under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>/<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as applied concurrently with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>This situation has not been alleviated since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wikinfo_9784.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wikinfo">first AfD discussion in July 2006</a>. The prevailing argument then was something like that: Wikinfo is notable because it is a notable Wikipedia fork. This is unpersuasive, because it involves <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reasoning.html" title="Circular reasoning">circular reasoning</a> and has no bearing on the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It was also argued that WP:WEB doesn't apply because Wikinfo is "notable not as a website, but as an open source project fork of a very notable project". This also fails to persuade, because whatever its content or subject, Wikinfo is still a website and as such subject to WP:WEB.</p>
<p>Those wishing to argue that the article should be kept because Wikinfo is of significance to the Wikipedia project or to (some of) its contributors, please consider: In the light of <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>, this should not be a consideration when assessing the notability of <i>encyclopedic content</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've found any AfD concerning a Wikipedia fork or other Wikimedia project inherently gets a lot "Of course it's notable, I've heard of it!" votes, which seem obviously biased, and this site is another one that simply does not seem to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I encourage people to remember that we don't keep articles simply because we can relate to the subject, but because they meet established and agreed upon inclusion guidelines. Please present evidence that Wikinfo has recieved meaningful third party coverage. Blurbs and mentions here and there really do not an article make, and all I've found in searching 2 good academic search engines are a small number of blurbs that say no more than "Wikinfo is a fork of WP". --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 20:32, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Move</b>. As a contributor to the article, I have an obvious conflict of interest, and I appreciate the nominator's notification to me about the AfD. But the circularity counter-argument honestly doesn't persuade me. Fred Bauder's Wikinfo effort to fork from Wikipedia with a different point of view inevitably borrows some of Wikipedia's own notability. I would note that we have articles on <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a>, a predecessor to Wikipedia which doesn't even exist any more, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>, a planned fork of Wikipedia that doesn't even exist yet. Of course, the nominator might argue that we should get rid of those articles as well, or move them to the Wikipedia namespace. I would reply that these articles also borrow their notability from the relationship to Wikipedia, as do articles on criticism/parody sites like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a>. As for the possible move to Wikipedia namespace, I wouldn't have any objection for all Wikipedia-related articles, as long as a newbie coming to the encyclopedia was directed to the article after simply typing Wikinfo into the box. But this might start overloading Wikipedia space with items that look exactly like what they are: general-interest encyclopedia articles. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 20:39, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Edit-conflict...While I know that Google searches get discounted in these debates, I was rather surprised to see the size of Wikinfo's search footprint. This effort to fork from Wikipedia with a different editorial approach has been widely noted and discussed on the web.

<li><b>Comment:</b> By extension of your argument, every fork, mirror or copy of Wikipedia would be notable by way of "borrowing" notability. So how about I start an article on the copy of the Wikipedia database I downloaded today? Humor aside, obviously any subject must have some notability <i>of its own</i>, which is precisely what is utterly non-apparent in this case (but maybe you could remedy that by adding these web sources you mention to the article?).

<dd><b>Comment</b>. To be honest, if you downloaded and started updating a complete copy of the Wikipedia database, your effort <i>would</i> be more notable than <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>, which doesn't even exist yet. Anyway, your suggested compromise of a move to Wikipedia space seems workable. After all, the distinction between article space and Wikipedia space means nothing to most casual users of the encyclopedia. (Truth to tell, it doesn't mean much to me. I really don't care if I see "Wikinfo" or "Wikipedia:Wikinfo" at the top of an article, as long as the article is accurate and comprehensive.) I would only suggest that <i>all</i> wikipedia-related articles—which after all borrow their notability from the parent project, because almost nobody would ever have heard of <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitruth.html" title="Wikitruth">Wikitruth</a> if Wikipedia weren't such a big presence on the Web—also be moved for consistency's sake. Otherwise, we get into endless hair-splitting exercises as to which Wikipedia-related projects have somehow achieved enough notability on their own. Also, casual users should be re-directed to these articles when they type "Wikitruth" or "Wikinfo" into the box on the main Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 21:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>None of this has adressed whether there's been third party coverage by reliable sources. Notability is only "inherited" if people care enough to write about a site because of it's relationship to a notable site, e.g. some in the media wrote about WikiTruth because of it's relationship to Wikipedia. These basically ammount to arguments that Wikinfo is notable <i>to us</i> but not really to anyone not in the community, which is textbook bias. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 22:52, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, I was surprised by the number of web comments I found on Wikinfo. See <a href="http://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Wikinfo" class="external text" title="http://develop.consumerium.org/wiki/Wikinfo" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://lorenzen.blogspot.com/2004/02/wikinfo-this-is-another-volunteer.html" class="external text" title="http://lorenzen.blogspot.com/2004/02/wikinfo-this-is-another-volunteer.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.bruceeisner.com/new_culture/2004/09/wikinfo_a_new_i.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bruceeisner.com/new_culture/2004/09/wikinfo_a_new_i.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://lp.greenparty.ca/tiki-index.php?page=Wikinfo" class="external text" title="http://lp.greenparty.ca/tiki-index.php?page=Wikinfo" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/hamlet/" class="external text" title="http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/hamlet/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for instance. I'll admit most of these are brief mentions that only define the site, quote its mission, and offer a few comments. But it's not like the site has gone unnoticed. Once again, the nominator's proposed compromise of a move to Wikipedia space is fine with me, along with a redirect. Seeing the article at "Wikipedia:Wikinfo" instead of just plain "Wikinfo" wouldn't bother me at all. Beyond Wikinfo, I think we might avoid a lot of storm and stress if we did similar moves on many other articles which are only notable because Wikipedia is notable. We might even save <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a> some heartburn. As an aside, I recently did a lot of work on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, an article which is notable <i>solely</i> because Wikipedia is notable. There's another obvious candidate for a move to Wikipedia space. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 00:08, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there's been meaningful criticism of Wikipedia published by reliable sources, hence we have something to write the article on... so that article isn't simply notable because it's about Wikipedia. I think you're missing the point... we include articles on a given topic because there's published, reliable information to use... not because we like the topic, or personally feel it's important, and so on. Keeping or deleting articles based solely on how important something is to us is inherently going to lead to bias. Most websites are somehow tied to something that's notable (e.g. a forum for fans of the TV Show <i>Lost</i>, or a chat room discussing the C++ programming language), the existance of many of these sites has probably mentioned on a blog or two, but that doesn't mean they get articles. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:19, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I guess I am missing the point, because there's plenty of published, reliable information on Wikinfo. I just reread the article, and it all looks like reliable, published information to me. I mean, we're not talking about a hoax or an unknown subject here. Whatever anybody may think of Fred Bauder as a Wikipedia admin and arbcom member, I don't think he's running a spurious or unverifiable site. If some of the third-party comments are to be believed—and I see no reason why they shouldn't be trusted as honest expressions of opinion, whether I agree with the opinions or not—some observers think Wikinfo might have a thing or three to teach Wikipedia. Anyway, why don't we just compromise and move the article to Wikipedia space? Then we can sidestep all the abstruse arguments about notability, which so often trail off into subjective opinion and metaphysical distinctions. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 00:32, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Blogs and so on are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>... the only thing I've found published in anything other than random websites have just been blurbs. I've never encountered Mr. Bauder or Wikinfo (beyond just seeing his work on ArbCom, which incidently I appreciate) so I am not attacking the site or him or anything, merely trying to uniformly apply concepts of article inclusion standards, as I've done before with other articles. As for the move, I don't really oppose that if people want it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 00:44, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could you clarify your bolded opinion, then? If we're going to move the article to projectspace, we're going to delete the page in articlespace, as we don't keep cross-namespace redirects. Your current post says "Keep or move" which amounts to "Keep or delete". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:11, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with what W.marsh and Sam Blanning said. I just would like to point out that just moving it to Wikipedia:Wikinfo isn't going to help very much, especially because of the no-cross-namespace-redirect thing, but also because we ought to find it some useful place in the context of the Wikipedia: namespace. My proposal is we move it to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html#Wikinfo_.28wiki.29" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz#Wikinfo (wiki)</a>, where the appropriate formatting changes can then be made. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:27, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, move it to the mirrors and forks list in Wikipedia space. A casual user will probably never find the material. But the search function is picking up <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz</a> on the third page of a Wikipedia space search for "Wikinfo", so a determined user will be able to find the information. I'm not sure why this stuff has to be tucked into such an out-of-the-way corner, but I don't object to the proposed move. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 09:04, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more point: over a hundred articles in the main space link to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>. Often it's the acknowledgment tag: "This article incorporates material from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> article", or "Adapted from the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> article." We probably don't want all those links going red, which would look pretty strange in acknowledgement blurbs. So we'll have to make sure there's a link to <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_Vwxyz_6ff9.html#Wikinfo_.28wiki.29" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks/Vwxyz">Wikipedia:Mirrors_and_forks/Vwxyz#Wikinfo (wiki)</a> once the information is moved there. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 13:59, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Message from Dr Philip Li, UCLA philip@uclalumni.net</p>
<p>Please note my posting in discussions board, indeed this non traditional University offers programs and have an international network schools with all their names and phone on, most of them are medium to big government schools.</p>
<p>My experience with their partner University in China (UCLA is working with South China Technology University on their master program) shows that they have very strict requirement in choosing partners and St Clements have postgraduate lanaguage programs with them too. The program is more then 1 year and is certainly not a diploma mill.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested I can ask their professors to talk a bit on that in Wikipedia. It is sad that I heard that they cannot access wikipedia.org and I have to redirect this discussions to them.</p>
<p>We have to be fair to global learning institutions and not only conclude from one angle. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Philip.UCLA (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilip.UCLA_abea.html" title="User talk:Philip.UCLA">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Philip.UCLA_0ccf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Philip.UCLA">contribs</a>) 05:02, 17 September 2006 UTC.</small></p>

<li><b>comment</b> He was not deleted i think you mean expelled on <i>reasonable grounds</i> being expelled for being gay is not reasonable its ignorant and prejudiced, he was expelled from a high school not a college and whether people get expelled for not being home on time is irrelevant, he meets the requirements for notability and the fact that his webpage's article may likely be deleted is irrelevant, it may not be notable, but he is.
<ul>
<li>As I se in the article he was expelled not for <b>being gay</b>, which is his private life, but for "immoral behavior and supporting an immoral cause [through his website]", i.e., for making it public <b>it a private schhol</b> which has all rights to set and execute their policies as they wish. The whole fuss is biased representation of the case. The guy violated rules or traditions or whatever. Period. Not big deal. Not national tragedy as some want to represent. Not nearly close to French forbidding Muslim girls wearing headscarf in public schools. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 16:42, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know what country you live in, but in America private schools do <b>NOT</b> have the right to set any polycy they wish.

<dd>and FYI immoral behavior was used as a euphanism for being gay, furthermore read the articles, he never made it public, the school made it public after a nosey student informed them without his consent, and then to top it off the school told his conservative parents, which then put the poor boy on lockdown and nearly kicked him out since he lives in an oppressive conservative town.Cholga 17:31, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I sympathize with the student, but this is one incident of which there must be hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions in recent history. If this incident led to a new law, or a new encyclopedically notable organization, or became iconic in the history of gay rights struggles or had some other wider lasting substantive societal effect, that would be encyclopedically notable. There is not indication of this happening so far, as far as I can tell.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> per newsworthiness. However my prefered solution would be a merge or a move that would put this content in the proper context. In particular I'd argue that while the individual is himself of little interest, his case is. What do we expect a biography entry to become ideally? Certainly not a 10 line text like this one is doomed to remain. Who cares when this guy was born, who cares where he works. The article is not about the individual, it's about the incident. Why not merge, for instance, as a section of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Christian_Academy_db6f.html" title="Trinity Christian Academy">Trinity Christian Academy</a>? I think this would make Wikipedia better as a whole since the content would not be lost, you'd still have a redirect if anyone looks for or links to James Barnett and the whole thing would be in proper context. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 02:17, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the fact that it was picked up by <u>the media</u> is relevant, and it is not relevant that it was or was not the gay press - a term which appears to me to be pejorative in this context. It was a news item about a homosexual young man and thus likely to be picked up more by gay than str8 press. (If he were a yachtsman doing boaty things he would only have been picked up by the yachting press). I think we have to look very much at the principle, here, not the individual. I don't care about the individual or the story, except to feel sorry for him. I'd never heard of him before thsi AfD, and I never expect to hear of him again. But I interpret <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to say that he is notable. This means that, whether any of us have actually heard of the kid, or the incident, his 15 minutes of fame qualify him for a place here. We have the space, and he qualifies for it. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> yes it is! And its not special interest websites dude, thats homophobic at best. With your logic ESPN has a special interest too, Gay.com and the PlanetOut network are mainstream press as much as Reuters and the Associated Press are, its what YahooNews! uses for all their gay stories. He has also been brough up by the Point Foundation and Human Rights Campaign.

Correcting <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a>'s (or anyone's) statements where you think they are incorrect with care and restrained depersonalised words is important here. We need to look at the <u>article</u> and the notability within Wikipedia's guidelines. Certainly the websites you mention are themselves notable media, and naturallythe story's media appeal is in the gay media rather than global media. And I agree with you that notable media stories about Barnett make him notable. He is of limited interest, and he may never rais ehis head above any parapet again, but his 15 minutes of fame merits a freestanding, albeit brief, article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Besides the fact that it's an address entry, the article is to be deleted in accordance to the deletion of several other elementary school articles. We have a WikiProject for adding high school entries, but not elementary school entries. There just wouldn't be that much to write about.

<li><b>Delete.</b> This school is not at all notable. Aside from being an elementary school, there's very little to say about it. It has <i><b>no</b></i> assertion of notability. What makes it different from any other elementary school? Nothing. Perhaps if it was a controversial school, or the site of a few murders, or had many famous pupils, it would deserve its own article, but there's nothing that distinguishes it from any of the other hundreds of thousands of elementary schools in the United States. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 01:12, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The notion that Elementary schools need a strong burden of proof to be notable this does not get anywhere near it. A few minor awards does not confer notability. And Srose makes a good point, by the sort of inclusion criteria people are trying to use for schools, we would have articles about everything under the sun. I find it disturbing that a few months ago we were arguing over whether to keep highschools and the argument has no shifted to elementary schools.
