<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I find it humorous that the disambiguation page for "get down" lists several songs, many of which are excrutiatingly non notable. Yet, the article (as yet a mere stub) treating the phenomenon which is the <i>source</i> of the phrase in these songs (as well as the noun and verb in AAVE) is a candidate for deletion. Did it ever occur to anyone that people might wonder about the <i>origin and meaning</i> of that phrase -- "get down" -- which is the title of all those songs? Or, the origin of the phrase in AAVE slang? I saw the need to begin an article that would explain the cultural phenomenon, how it has survived in the African diaspora, how it has transformed Western/modern dance movement -- particularly in the U.S. -- and its related meanings in AAVE. This move to delete the article is wrong-headed and absurd -- particularly since the article hasn't even been developed yet. Yes, it needs to be expanded, but it's a definite keep. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Question</b>: Why does the dance move always seem to be referenced in double quotes if its an established move?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 14:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps because, unlike European dance, black dance has only a fairly recent tradition, if at all, of being codified. Furthermore, "get down" is not one, specific move, <i>per se</i>; it's a posture with different variations, given the often improvisational and spontaneous nature of black/African dance. And even though the <i>posture</i> is significant and important; it has meaning, it's not rigid or codified like, say, a <i>pas de deux</i> or <i>plie</i> in ballet. The get-down in a ring shout is different from the git down in breakdancing.[User:Deeceevoice|deeceevoice]] 14:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cakewalk, Black Bottom, Charleston, Lindy Hop, popping, locking, breaking, krumping, Yankadi, Macru, Moribayasa, Agbekor, Agahu, Kpanlogo. It seems like black dance is pretty well codified in both Africa and America.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Affixing titles to dances is a far cry from breaking up a dance up into its constituent parts, prescribing precisely how each movement or pose/posture is to be executed and then naming each one.

<dd>As to your point about Get down referring to several types of dance, one would expect such an overarching style of move to be equally, if not more codified than the specific dances I listed-- but its not...?--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 15:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That's what I said. And, again, get down is <i>not</i> a singular movement; it is a general posture (which has no prescribed appearance, except that it must be executed with limbs flexed/bent, the waist bent, the torso relatively low to the ground) -- which may be arrived at from/through the execution of a variety of moves. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm starting to lean towards a weak keep after doing a google scholars search. However, the article seems to treat it differently than the scholars, who refer to it as a "quality" of specific dances. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22get+down+quality%22+%22african+dance%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22get+down+quality%22+%22african+dance%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Check out this search</a>.

<dd>Can you find a source that mentions Get down more than one time? Are there ANY sources that describe the movement in any detail? If you can, than it is not a neologism.

<p>Has anyone else noted the <i>complete absence of any discussion of this matter on the article talk page (which remains utterly, completely blank) before this AfD was filed</i>? The person who initiated this action made <i>absolutely no attempt whatsoever</i> to discuss this subject, its true nature or relevance, before taking such a precipitous action. It easily could be interpreted as smacking/<i>stinking</i> of intellectual arrogance ("I'm not aware of this, so it doesn't exist; it's made up!"), and/or bad faith! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:25, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yale professor and authority on indigenous African cultures Robert Farris Thompson addresses "get down" extensively in his critically acclaimed <i>African Art and Motion</i> and places it within an overall framework of what he calls the "cannons of line form." Thompson addresses get down beyond physical movement and explains how it influences, and is influenced by, the music itself. Thompson states that much of West African music is characterized rhythmically by inclines and declines, both gradual and steep -- crescendos of polyrhythms. (If you've ever heard the drumming of, say, Babatunde Olatunji, then you know what he's referring to.) That's get down.</p>
<p>Thompson also notes the prevalence of the get-down pose/posture in traditional African sculpture, as well -- knees bent, some figures appearing to be squatting. In another venue, Thompson discusses "get down" and <i>capoeira</i> and likens the latter to breakdancing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the warm-up exercises, I noticed nothing special â€“ just jumping jacks and leaps and stretches of the kind youâ€™d see at a New York Giants workout in August. But then, in a classic coachâ€™s voice, Vieira led them into the specialized gymnastics of capoeira, and <i>the movements entered the get-down zone</i>[emphasis added]. They looked as if they were break-dancing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others have noted the phenomenon using other language. From an article on the history of swing dance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lindy Hop, also known as Jitterbug, is the authentic Afro-Euro-American Swing dance. It is an unabashedly joyful dance, with a solid, flowing style that closely reflects its music -- from the late 20's hot Jazz to the early 40's Big Bands. Just as Jazz combines European and African musical origins, Lindy Hop draws on African and European dance traditions. The embracing hold, and the turns from Europe, the breakaway and <i>solid, earthy body posture from Africa</i> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Gahu dance form referred to in the article user <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> precipitously has nominated for deletion is something called a ring shout -- it's a spiritual, transcendent experience. The ring shout is performed across black Africa and in the African diaspora, including in the American South. It's a get-down -- performed feet shuffling, arms akimbo, knees bent. Author and historian P. Sterling Stuckey, in his, IMO, masterwork <i>Slave Culture: Nationalist Theory and the Foundations of Black America</i>, also described the phenomenon of the ring shout in African-American culture, its African origins and its obvious get-down characteristics. As the shout intensifies, the dancers' movements get stronger, the rhythms beat out by the feet get more percussive, and the dancers' torsos get lower to the ground. And they always move counterclockwise. Like southern black folks in the praisehouses and hush harbors, secreted away from the prying eyes of whites and those who would rebuke or punish them for their "uncivilized" manner of worship. Like <i>African</i>-American jazz legend/genius Thelonius Monk jumping up from his piano in the middle of a song, inspired, eyes closed almost trance-like, shuffling around -- counterclockwise. White folks in the audience were amused, mystified. "What the hell's he doing?" Answer: the "Moments of the Sun" -- the persistence of African culture and of African memory! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:02, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Stubs, by their very nature, are <i>articles in the making.</i> Again, when you have an objection to an article, or a question, the appropriate and courteous thing to do is <i>discuss</i> it first -- before running to open an RfD. You jumped the gun, plain and simple. If you'd merely taken the time to <i>ask</i> questions about something about which you clearly know very little, this could have been avoided in the first place. You wrote <i>not a single word</i> on the article discussion page before opening this failed attempt to eradicate it. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 05:10, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
