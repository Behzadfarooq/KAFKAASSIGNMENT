<li><b>Keep</b>, and I'd extend that <b>keep</b> to all the bundled articles. I've never heard of these folks before, but I'd have to say that a multi-generational organization with "six congregations in the United States, two colleges, missions in six other countries, and three radio stations," and a history dating back almost a hundred years, meets notability criteria. That being the case, the bios on the leaders over the last century should also stay, by my reckoning. I'm no fan of churches (and missionary organizations in particular), but nonetheless this strikes me as a well-established social entity with international aspects, not some flash-in-the-pan storefront church. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 20:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your comments are all regarding the church, not these people. The Church's own article is not included in this AfD. We're discussing the notability of these people as individuals here as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, not their Church's notability. And just because they're connected to the Church doesn't make them notable themselves. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:42, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I agree: just being "connected to the church" is not notable. But these bios seem like a good-faith attempt to document the <i>leadership</i>, over the better part of a century. It's worth noting that this isn't a "church" in the sense of a single building and congregation, but in the sense of a religious sect that appears to be spreading and growing. They're no Mormon church, but neither do they seem to be trivial. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagana_c6a0.html" title="User:Pagana">Pagana</a> 21:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Church is notable, and the founder is also notable by extention. However, the descendants of the founding dynasty of a family business are not, especially seeing that the entries are purely geneological and have the odd detail of where the went to school and which college they attended.

<p>Comment: Why is the college someone attended an "odd detail"? Every biography lists where someone went to college.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: An organization with the breadth, scope and history of the Pillar of Fire Church is exactly what belongs on Wikipedia. These articles are not merely about the "employees and their children" of this Church, but of its leadership. The top leaders of a religious denomination with the characteristics of the Pillar of Fire Church have a strong claim to notability, and the choice by the New York Times to publish obituaries for several of them is prima facie evidence of notability. I find it disturbing that so many are ready to choose to <b>Delete</b>, and not consider the possibility of a <b>Merge</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

And by the way, getting a NYT obituary isn't even <i>close</i> to being "prima facie evidence of notability": 99.9 percent of the people who get NYT obituaries do not have Wikipedia articles and never will. If you don't believe me, select any issue of the paper from any year, check against Wikipedia, and see how far you get. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 18:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you are confusing cause and effect. The fact that many subjects of NYT obituaries do not have Wikipedia articles only shows a failure to reach many worthy individuals as subjects of potential articles. The fact that the New York Times selects a handful of the hundreds of thousands of people who die each day for inclusion on the obituary pages is a very strong claim for notability that goes far beyond the far more trivial counting of Google hits. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:28, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The leader of a denomination is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> or at least <b>merge</b> into a section of the church article. This is the succession of leadership of a denomination.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The Pillar of Fire Church is definatly notable and I argue that its' leaders and prominent members are notable as well. A seperate article for this particular leader is neccessary to provide context for the rest of the subject. Again, I reiterate, <b>strong keep</b> on all of the subjects of the bundled deletion.
