<dd>Dear Blake911, Actually <i>Deletion is not cleanup</i>. If the discussion results into a delete this is not because the article is badly written, it is because the lemma has been decided to be not notable for an encylopedia. You are then actually not supposed to just start the same article again. Badly written articles about notable topics debark in the "cleanup" section not "afd". --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 07:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Encyclopedic information needs to be unbiased. If another gaming guild, shadowclan, is to be allowed then you must allow all other gaming guilds. Or else delete shadowclan as well. If not, who is it that would then decide which gaming guilds are "noteworthy" and which are not?

<dd><b>Comment</b>, I am not Blake, and you will not belittle my arguments by accusing me of hiding behind a false identity. As if any identity can really be verified on the internet. If you contend that shadowclan is notewrothy and bloodclan is not, that is your opinion, and certainly a subject for debate, but this is hardly the medium for it. I'm a live and let live kind of guy and you won't see me posting in support of shadowclans deletion on that page. But you ignore one portion of my argument wholly. Who is it then that would decide which gaming guilds are noteworthy and which are not? Certainly not you, since your opinion is obviously biased pro-shadowclan. There are hundreds of other gaming guilds out there that are far more original than either shadowclan or bloodclan, if that is to be your sole criterion of acceptance. At its core this site is for entertainment purposes only, as shown in the welcome screen "Welcome to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit." Which makes it sound fun. So I say let shadowclan have some fun by being listed here, along with all others who care to make the effort and consider themselves "original" or noteworthy.<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackson512_7c92.html" title="User:Jackson512">Jackson512</a> 23:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackson512_7c92.html" title="User:Jackson512">Jackson512</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackson512_346c.html" title="User talk:Jackson512">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackson512_dc10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackson512">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>It was recently agreed to keep the Shadowclan entry. This group is closely linked to Shadowclan, taking on the role of "carrying the torch" so to speak, therefore it should stay.

<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comment.html" title="Comment">Comment</a> I found websites to compare with Shadowclan. I know we're discussing Bloodclan but since I noticed this has evolved into some clan battle and Shadowclan survived a deletion nomination, I had to compare. When I viewed shadowclans deletion nomination entry. User Shazbot85 made supporting comments to keep the article and then later that he should not have commented since he has biases views as a member of Shadowclan. Which would make his comments here irrelevant. I personally feel both Shadowclan and Bloodclan are noteworthy.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Those in favor of keeping this article ground their position by asserting Bloodclan's equal notability with a similar gaming group, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadowclan.html" title="Shadowclan">Shadowclan</a>, whose article has survived a identical AfD nomination. According to the Shadowclan article and its AfD discussion(s), their notability comes from the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
- Being interviewed for a commercially-published book (a "<a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/...for_Dummies_1cf8.html" title="...for Dummies">...for Dummies</a>" book, no less). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471752738/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/002-3724092-4225605?redirect=true&amp;ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471752738/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/002-3724092-4225605?redirect=true&amp;ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
- Being written into the official documentation of at least one game in which it was involved, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Age_of_Camelot_5d26.html" title="Dark Age of Camelot">Dark Age of Camelot</a>. <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/article.php?id=121" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.camelotherald.com/article.php?id=121" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>
- Being the focus of developers of games in which Shadowclan participates in aside from the above. <a href="http://www.uo.com/spot_6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uo.com/spot_6.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://chronicle.ubi.com/images/FeaturedImages/20051118.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://chronicle.ubi.com/images/FeaturedImages/20051118.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>

<p>According to this discussion and the present article, Bloodclan only appears to share this last item, attention from non-official game websites. Aside from falling short of equal notability with Shadowclan, this also constitutes failing to meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">notability requirements</a> for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes">Simoes</a> 20:47, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blood clan appears to share the last two items and from what I have noticed there is several other gaming clans that survived AfD's with none of the above. They were and still are featured by <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runuo.html" title="Runuo">runuo</a> and <a href="http://www.uogamers.com" class="external text" title="http://www.uogamers.com" rel="nofollow">UOGamers Website</a> who in my opinion have a larger community than some of the shadowclan links you provided us with.</dd>

<dd>First (though I suppose this is obvious to you and everyone else), you have no evidence for your claims. Second, the last two on my list are neither necessory nor sufficient according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. And even if other gaming clans have survived AfD nominations without having any of the aforementioned items (another claim of which you provide no evidence), this would not be grounds to keep this article (refer to the logical fallacy, <i><a href="../../../t/u/_/Tu_quoque.html" title="Tu quoque">tu quoque</a></i>). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes">Simoes</a> 21:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When this article was submitted it did lack some evidenc and detail. However I prefer it be wikified or kept because it's more than noteworthy. Visit the links I already provided above who represent online gaming websites that feature Bloodclan. <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runuo.html" title="Runuo">Runuo</a> and UOGamers Developers also have mentioned that they focus their attention on Bloodclan.</p>

This vanity page has zero notability. Being mentioned on non-official gamer sites doesn't establish notability, nor does it compare to the recognition Shadowclan has garnered from game developers.

I seriously doubt that Shazbot85 is a sockpuppet Thodice, nor are Fisherman1 or Jestix or Wickerhewok or 90% of every other person who commented that a delete would be appropriate. I see very few comments made here by anyone who had anything to do with the Shadowclan page, besides myself, Shazbot 85 and...oh, you! Simoes, who has constantly made it clear to you that your fan-site "notability" is not adequate was not involved with Shadowclan either. If anyone is sockpuppeting here, it's you.
