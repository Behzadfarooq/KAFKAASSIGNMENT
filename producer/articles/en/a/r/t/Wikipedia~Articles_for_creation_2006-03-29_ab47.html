<p>Sigma Psi Kappa is a local sorority at New Jersey Institute of Technology. It was founded on November 8th, 1992 as a safe haven for women. It's founding sisters, Elfie Almadin, Jeannie Lee, Chin Yu (Jenny) Lin, Rebeca Luengo, and Omnia Samra came together to build this organization, that focuses on community service, scholarship, and strength, for strong and independant women who strive for excellence.</p>
<p>Today, Sigma Psi Kappa is locally seen as such an organization. More than 70 women of been inducted, and the ideals that the founding sisters strived toward are the same ideals our sisters strive toward today. Sigma Psi Kappa is known for hosting 2 blood drives each semester, doing well in school, being active in our campus community, and are seen as leaders at New Jersey Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>Dave is currently in his 24th year of radio in the Valley. Dave started his radio career at 16 years old on KELK in his hometown of Elko, Nevada. Dave loved growing up in a ranch town where he was great in baseball and basketball, and once rode a horse through a casino (true story).</p>
<p>After high school graduation he moved to The Valley to attend Arizona State University. In 1981, Dave was hired by KUPD where he stayed for 20 years and Pratt in the Morning became America`s Longest Running Rock n' Roll Morning Show.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Dave joined CBS radio`s KZON. Dave has always enjoyed both rock and country so The Mayor jumped at the chance to stay with CBS radio and join Stacey Brooks to host Dave Pratt in the Morning on KMLE Country 108.</p>
<p>Dave Pratt has won many awards, and has been nominated over 50 times for local and national rock personality of the year awards including Billboard, Radio and Records, Gavin, Arizona Republic, Tribune, New Times, American Women in Radio and Television, Country Music Assocation and others. Dave Pratt and his band, Dave Pratt and the sex machine have sold well over 100,000 albums and live home videos, and he has headlined to sold out shows in major venues throughout the state. He is also part owner of Alice Cooperstown in Downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>For over 24 years loyal Pratt listeners have raised millions of dollars for Arizona charities. In 1996, the Dave Pratt Dental Clinic for underprivileged kids was founded by The Boys and Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Phoenix. The clinic now serves over 5000 kids per year. The Mayor has been on the Board of Directors for the Arthritis Foundation for 13 years, and Dave and Paula Pratt are proud to personally help fund Camp Cruz, a summer camp for kids with Juvenile Arthritis.</p>
<p>Dave has a wife of 17 years, Paula and his 4 children.... David 12, Kyle 10, Sammy 7, and Madison 4. Dave and his family reside in Paradise Valley. 24 years ago Dave promised his listeners that he would never leave Arizona.</p>

Bands he has played in include The Noise, Hat and Tractor, Hours Till Awesome, and Lunchtime Policies, a short-lived Noise cover band.</p>

These bands include Noise, a <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> group, Hours Till Awesome, a pop group, and Hat and Tractor, his current band, which plays an eclectic blend of pop and rock in the vein of television <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> theme songs.

<p>Bryce Falcon is a legend across the world, and there is debate to whether he really exists or not. Known as Bryce Falcon by day and the better known "Blue Falcon" by night, it is rumored that Bryce is currently living in California and attending high school there. He has a mass cult following, with thousands visiting his Offical Website/Fanclub every day. Members of the club believe that Bryce is the equivalant to the second coming of the Christ, although members usually do not specify any religion preferring the ambiguous title of "a Falcon fan."</p>

<p>Bryce is also a musician and has released his first studio album, titled "The Omnichord EP." Rumors stipulate that the original Omnichord EP emerged during the Preolithic Era and that this is just a re-release, but again this matter is seriously debatable. Other rumors dictate that Bryce was the mastermind behind the Beatles and the Ben Folds Five.</p>

<p>A radio transmitting/receiving device, usually strapped to a person's chest via a waist and shoulder strap, which continually transmits an emergency signal, that can be received by a another Avalanche Transceiver on the same <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_frequency.html" title="Radio frequency">radio frequency</a> in the event of that person being trapped in an Avalanche.</p>
<p>The device is normally worn by people in snowy areas where Avalanches pose a risk. The Avalanche Transceiver is left on transmit mode under the persons clothing (for protection) while the person is in the risk area, and will only switch to "receive" or "search" mode when looking for a lost person wearing a similar devise. Older <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogue.html" title="Analogue">analogue</a> devises produce a louder noice (in receive mode) when the receiving unit gets closer to the transmitting unit and sometimes shows the direction of the signal. Newer digital transceivers show the distance using an <a href="../../../l/c/d/LCD_display_f1f8.html" title="LCD display">LCD display</a> as well as the direction. Both analogue and digital devises are cross compatible.</p>

<p>One of more CIDR addresses (length + prefix) published by a BGP-capable router.</p>
<p>When a router supports the BGP internet protocol for exchange of routing information with other peers, it needs to communicate them which networks are advertised. It does so by sending, per each network, a set information consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destination: One or more CIDR addresses (length + prefix).</li>
</ul>
<p>Called Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).</p>
<ul>
<li>Path information: how to reach that destination. Composed of several “Path attributes”</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of path attributes</p>
<p>- NEXT_HOP: It is the IP address where the packets should be forwarded to in case the route is used. This is the parameter to be installed on the FIB if that route is used. It doesn´t have to be the IP address of the peer distributing the route - AS_PATH: It is the sequence of ASes (identified by its AS ID number) that should be traversed to reach that destination. This parameter is key in avoiding loops and implementing policies, and can be used to select the route with fewer AS traversed. It ,ay not be the route with fewer routers involved</p>

<p>vanquishing is a fictional method that is given in the television show, Charmed, that is used to destroy demons and other evil creatures. while upper level demons require a specific spell to either be read out while they are in earshot, or to be mixed and thrown at them, lesser demons are easily vanquished in normal ways that would kill a person(eg. stabbing them with a knife etc.)</p>
<p>demons that have been vanquished often display spontaenious combustion. where as a normal human would bleed, fire spills from the wound that the demon has substained (if it was a spell, they will either simply explode, or ignite) and consumes him or her until he/she is either burned into ashes or explodes. the more powerful the demon, the bigger the explosion is (cole turner, the Source of all evil's explosion literally blew his apartment up)</p>

<p>From the east end of Toronto, four young entrepreneurs had the vision of being successful in the hip-hop game. Chubbs, Durty, Protégé and Diddy realized that to get to the top of the rap game, they would have to grind and depend on no one but themselves. They had the talent and just needed the machine behind them to get their music out to the world. Realizing how the game works and knowing that they couldn’t wait for a major label to put them on, the four of them decided to take fate into their own hands and launch an entertainment company; 2005 was the birth year of Clean Cash Entertainment.</p>
<p>The four men formed Clean Cash Entertainment as a foundation and corner stone of their career and it’s sole purpose is to let the world know what real rap music is all about and to put Toronto on the map. The camp set up shop and spent countless hours in their studio working on their debut album released by the camp’s rapping duo New Money entitled “Just A Matter Of Time”. With no help, the four men hit the streets and got Toronto buzzing about the potent product they had to offer. With the success of their first project, they are on their way to being a top force in the hip-hop industry. To date, Clean Cash Entertainment is now comprised of an elite team of artists and producers who are steadily accomplishing what their fallen soldier/co-owner set out to accomplish…..to put Toronto on the map.</p>

<p>(* 1898 in <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potsdam.html" title="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>; † 1985)German acoustic and explosives physicist</p>
<p>His important habilitationpaper “Physics of tonecolours”, published Berlin 1929, in which he brought the proof that music instruments have fixed formantics and that their structures change depending on the dynamic and the highth of the tone. Since 1929 Schumann was managing the department of Acoustics at the Institute of Physics at the Berlin University, teaching experimental and theoretical physics.(1)</p>
<p>In 1934 he headed the research department (Heereswaffenamt HWA) of the german army (2) On the 15th of June 1939 he founded the department for Atomphysics at the HWA. He gave the command for this to Dr. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Diebner_32a6.html" title="Kurt Diebner">Kurt Diebner</a>. From then on Schumann was seemingly not intensively involved in nuclear physics anymore. This would change in the year 1943. Especially the work of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_charge.html" title="Hollow charge">hollow charge</a> experts of the HWA unter the command of Dr. Walter Trinks which brought promising new ways to a <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_bomb.html" title="Atom bomb">atom bomb</a>.</p>
<p>Trinks habilitationwork „ Release of atomenergy through nucleussynthesis with light elements“ was the base for the idea of a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermonuclear_bomb.html" title="Thermonuclear bomb">thermonuclear bomb</a>, on which also other research groups in other weapon development departmens experimented in the same direction. In autumn 1944 Schumann and Trink´s researchteams were stopped by the SS. If they themselves were still involved in the weapon configuration in October 1944 and March 1945 remains open.</p>
<p>Walter Trinks is taken prisoner by the americans in summer 1945, Schumann goes into hiding for almost 2 years „ the eastern and western occupation authorities had a high interest in getting me ...“(4)</p>
<p>In Autumn 1946 he contacted the Max-Planck-Institut in <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goettingen.html" title="Goettingen">Goettingen</a> which immediately took position for him towards the british occupation authorities.(5) In July 1947 Schumann gave himself over to the British, who interogated him a couple of days and let him go in August 1947. In the mids of 1947 Schumann had his old fellow-worker recapitulate out of their memory secret pattent which was destroyed at the end of the war on a 8 page researchpaper. „After recomposing this report their was no doubt that based on all those findings during the war and the known discoveries this would lead to their goal. A small experiment, which eventually had to be explained, brought positiver result in the laboratory.“(7)</p>
<p>In the secret patents and Schumann´s report the findings on the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion.html" title="Fusion">fusion</a> research of the HWA were pointed out. With the „x-trigger“ named configuration, the scientists of the HWA had found a way to obtain <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermonuclear_reaction.html" title="Thermonuclear reaction">thermonuclear reaction</a>.(8)</p>
<p>The report was given a little later to the British who did not understand it. Schumann was willing to disclose their findings of the research of the HWA and was preparing in autumn 1948 a publication „The truth on the german research and propositions for the atomic problems (1939-45)“.(9) He wanted to obtain for his team and himself the scientific priority on those findings and deny his responsibility in the failure of the Uranverein. Collegues and friends urged him to avoid breaking the rules of the allied occupation with the publication of it.(10) In the end he withdrew the manuscript.</p>
<p>The patents of the group were about 4 problems: process and devices to establish highest pressure and temperatures, synthetic manufacturing of diamants, atomic reactions and atomic highloading. In August 1952 the patent was applicated. The later founded Ministery of Defence of the Federal German Republik took over the of patent and put a vail secrecy over the application. Because of the long years of vain efforts of evaluating the patent, the group seperated. Erich Schumann died in April 1985.</p>

Davis</a></span></h2>
<p>Steward Machine Company v. Davis</p>
<p>Steward Machine Company v. Davis 301 U.S. 548 (1937) was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the unemployment compensation provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935. The Act established a national taxing structure designed to induce states to adopt laws for funding and payment of unemployment compensation. The decision in Steward signaled the Court’s acceptance of a broad interpretation of Congressional power to influence state laws.</p>
<p>The primary challenges to the Act were that it went beyond the powers granted to the federal government in the Constitution and that it involved coercion of the states in contravention of the Tenth Amendment—calling for a surrender by the states of powers essential to their quasi-sovereign existence.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In the first months of 1937 the Court handed down decisions that affirmed both national and state prerogative to legislate regarding social welfare. The decisions were the first wave of what has become known as the constitutional revolution of 1937.</p>
<p>There are three additional issues that set the stage in early 1937: 1. Use of the Spending Power of the national government to regulate commercial economic activity 2. Expansive view of general welfare 3. National economic conditions in the United States</p>
<p>1. Use of the Spending Power of the national government to regulate commercial economic activity By 1937 it had been well established that regulatory taxes controlling commercial economic actions were within the power of Congress. Hampton &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928) held that a regulatory tax is valid even if the revenue purpose of the tax may be secondary. The Supreme Court had also held that a tax statute does not necessarily fail because it touches on activities which Congress might not otherwise regulate. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40 (1934): “From the beginning of our government, the courts have sustained taxes although imposed with the collateral intent of effecting ulterior ends which, considered apart, were beyond the constitutional power of the lawmakers to realize by legislation directly addressed to their accomplishment.” Further emphasizing the broad power of taxation, Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U.S. 506 (1937) asserted that a tax does not cease to be valid merely because it regulates, discourages, or even definitely deters the activities taxed. In that case the Court held (regarding a tax on dealers in firearms): “We are not free to speculate as to the motives which moved Congress to impose it, or as to the extent to which it may operate to restrict the activities taxed. As it is not attended by an offensive regulation, and since it operates as a tax, it is within the national taxing power.”</p>
<p>2. Expansive view of general welfare</p>
<p>The Supreme Court had recently decided U.S. v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936). The main point of that case was whether certain provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 conflicted with the Constitution. In the Act, a tax was imposed on processors of farm products, the proceeds to be paid to farmers who would reduce their acreage and crops. The intent of the act was to increase the prices of certain farm products by decreasing the quantities produced.</p>
<p>The Court held that the so-called tax was not a true one because the payments to farmers were coupled with unlawful and oppressive coercive contracts, and the proceeds were earmarked for the benefit of farmers complying with the prescribed conditions. Making the payment of a government subsidy to a farmer conditional on the reduction of his planned crops went beyond the powers of the national government. Specifically, the Court said:</p>
<p>“The act invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.”</p>
<p>Although it struck down the Act, the Court dealt positively with expenditure of funds to advance the general welfare as specified in Article 1 § 8 of the Constitution. The Court stated that the issue “presents the great and the controlling question in the case.” After comparing expansive vs. restrictive interpretations of the Spending Clause, the Court adopted the philosophy that:</p>
<p>“The clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated [,] is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them, and Congress consequently has a substantive power to tax and to appropriate, limited only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide for the general welfare of the United States. … It results that the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The idea that Congress has authority separate and distinct from powers granted by enumeration was (and still is) controversial. The fact that the Court struck down the Act despite an expansive interpretation of the Spending Clause reflects the turmoil in the Court’s thinking at this critical time.</p>
<p>3. National economic conditions in the United States</p>
<p>The nation was in the midst of the Great Depression. In its Steward decision, the Court noted that:</p>
<p>“During the years 1929 to 1936, when the country was passing through a cyclical depression, the number of the unemployed mounted to unprecedented heights. Often the average was more than 10 million; at times a peak was attained of 16 million or more.”</p>
<p>Decision</p>
<p>The unemployment compensation provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935 establishes a tax imposed on employers. However, provided that a state has established an approved unemployment compensation plan, the taxpayer is allowed to credit up to 90% of the federal tax paid to the state unemployment fund. In effect, the Act established a taxing structure designed to induce states to adopt consistent laws for funding and payment of unemployment compensation.</p>
<p><br />
The main controversy in Steward was whether the tax coerced the states and whether the tax was within the powers of Congress. Justice Cardozo wrote for a sharply divided Court—one that was in the process of changing its character relative to affirmation of national action for the general welfare:</p>
<p>“The question is to be answered whether the expedient adopted has overlept the bounds of power. The assailants of the statute say that its dominant end and aim is to drive the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government.”</p>
<p>The key holding regarding the excise tax of the Act was: “The excise is not void as involving the coercion of the States in contravention of the Tenth Amendment or of restrictions implicit in our federal form of government.” An important part of the rationale was the ruling that even if the excise taxes: “were collected in the hope or expectation that some other and collateral good would be furthered as an incident, that, without more, would not make the act invalid. Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U.S. 506. This indeed is hardly questioned.”</p>
<p>The arguments placed the actions of Congress within its Constitutional power. The Court then established that the tax and the credit in combination are not weapons of coercion that would destroy or impair the autonomy of the states. The first step was:</p>
<p>“To draw the line intelligently between duress and inducement there is need to remind ourselves of facts as to the problem of unemployment that are now matters of common knowledge.”</p>
<p>After reviewing the distressed condition of the nation’s economy, the Court noted that:</p>
<p>“The fact developed quickly that the states were unable to give the requisite relief. The problem had become national in area and dimensions. There was need of help from the nation if the people were not to starve. It is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that, in a crisis so extreme, the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the general welfare. Cf. United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1.”</p>
<p>Although not quoted specifically in Steward, the relevant aspect of Butler addressed the constitutional powers of Congress and established that Congress has a “separate and distinct” power to tax and spend that is “not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.”</p>
<p>Directly addressing the contention that the tax is coercive, Justice Cardozo wrote:</p>
<p>“The difficulty with the petitioner's contention is that it confuses motive with coercion. “Every tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.” Sonzinsky v. United States. In like manner every rebate from a tax when conditioned upon conduct is in some measure a temptation. But to hold that motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion is to plunge the law in endless difficulties. ... Nothing in the case suggests the exertion of a power akin to undue influence … the location of the point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement, would be a question of degree.”</p>
<p>An important issue in a tax not being coercive, satisfied in Steward, is that the conduct to be encouraged or induced accomplish a national end (general welfare) and be related to the tax itself.</p>
<p>“It is one thing to impose a tax dependent upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite another thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.”</p>
<p>And then, finally, Cardozo made explicit the liberty of the states to make agreements with Congress.</p>
<p>“The states are at liberty, upon obtaining the consent of Congress, to make agreements with one another. … We find no room for doubt that they may do the like with Congress if the essence of their statehood is maintained without impairment.”</p>
<p>Based on all the forgoing arguments, the final judgment was to affirm the lower Court’s decision upholding the constitutionality of the Act. The ruling upholding the act was one of two Social Security Cases that upheld elements of New Deal legislation in 1937.</p>
<p>The Dissents</p>
<p>The essence of the dissents was that the Social Security Act of 1935 went beyond the powers that were granted to the federal government in the Constitution. Imposing a tax that could be avoided only by contributing to a state unemployment compensation fund was effectively coercing each state to make law creating such a fund.</p>
<p>Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.</p>
<p>“That portion of the Social Security legislation here under consideration, I think, exceeds the power granted to Congress. It unduly interferes with the orderly government of the state by her own people and otherwise offends the Federal Constitution. .... [Article 1, Section 8] is not a substantive general power to provide for the welfare of the United States, but is a limitation on the grant of power to raise money by taxes, duties, and imposts. If it were otherwise, all the rest of the Constitution, consisting of carefully enumerated and cautiously guarded grants of specific powers, would have been useless, if not delusive.”</p>
<p>Separate opinion of Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (concurrence VAN DEVANTER).</p>
<p>“The threat implicit in the present encroachment upon the administrative functions of the states is that greater encroachments, and encroachments upon other functions, will follow.”</p>
<p>Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.</p>
<p>“… the statutory scheme is repugnant to the Tenth Amendment. … The Constitution grants to the United States no power to pay unemployed persons or to require the states to enact laws or to raise or disburse money for that purpose. The provisions in question, if not amounting to coercion in a legal sense, are manifestly designed and intended directly to affect state action in the respects specified. And, if valid as so employed, this 'tax and credit' device may be made effective to enable federal authorities to induce, if not indeed to compel, state enactments for any purpose within the realm of state power and generally to control state administration of state laws.”</p>
<p>The dissenters are sometimes known collectively as the Four Horsemen, the consistently conservative members of the Court who opposed the New Deal agenda of President Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Subsequent Jurisprudence</p>
<p>Steward was part of a set of decisions in which the Court consistently upheld New Deal economic and regulatory legislation. Its key role was the expansion of Congressional authority to the regulation of state activity, and marked the end of Supreme Court attempts to limit Congressional power based on advancement of the general welfare. In fact, Butler, just the year before Steward, was the last case in which the Supreme Court struck down an Act of Congress as beyond the authority granted by the Spending Clause.</p>
<p>Steward marked the beginning of the recognition that Congress could use the Spending Clause, under the umbrella of general welfare, to regulate state laws through incentives and encouragement—but not coercion. The national government may induce the states, or tempt them, or seduce them—but not coerce them into passing legislation considered desirable to meet national needs. Before Steward, Congress could regulate only commercial economic activity; after Steward, Congress could regulate the actions of state governments.</p>
<p>It is now common for Congress to tie grants-in-aid with requirements and restrictions upon the states, although the practice is still often controversial. In a modern case depending upon the jurisprudence of Steward, the Court held in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) that Congress could influence states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21, by threatening to withhold funds for federal highways. In her dissent, Justice O'CONNOR stated:</p>
<p>“When Congress appropriates money to build a highway, it is entitled to insist that the highway be a safe one. But it is not entitled to insist as a condition of the use of highway funds that the State impose or change regulations in other areas of the State's social and economic life .... Indeed, if the rule were otherwise, the Congress could effectively regulate almost any area of a State's social, political, or economic life.”</p>
<p>And then later, approving of and quoting Butler:</p>
<p>“If the spending power is to be limited only by Congress' notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives "power to the Congress to tear down the barriers, to invade the states' jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed." … This, of course, as Butler held, was not the Framers' plan and it is not the meaning of the Spending Clause.”</p>
<p>The controversy will no doubt continue, revolving around the nature of the appropriate power vested in the national government. In her closing words of dissent, Justice O'CONNOR reinforced that the United States “remains a Government of enumerated powers.”</p>

<p>Terry Nichols Clark is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. He is the coordinator of the FAUI (Fiscal Austerity and Urban Innovation Project) in Chicago.</p>
<p>Perhaps Clark's most famous theory relates to the outmoded nature of prior urban theories. In Clark's view, cities have forgone the policy of "growth at any cost," and embraced workers endowed with high levels of human capital. The "new economy" of urban life therefore positions cities as an entertainment machine, producing consumption opportunities and leveraging cultural advantages. Clark identifies several components of this change, including the rise of a citizen-consumer; a decline in bureaucratic decision makers; a decline in transaction costs; an increase in arts and aesthetics; and a new role for government officials in implementing these changes. Today, the city becomes a spatial arena for the real.</p>

<p>A Phood &amp; Booze party is an extraordinary event which originated somewhere at the end of the 90's. Boredom of a couple of college students was the inducement to launch a new, spectacular, massive happening. The phase of getting wasted at lame student parties was something these people left behind for a long while already. They craved for something more mature, but yet thrilling. They found what they were looking for in what mankind nowadays calls 'World Class Dining &amp; Top Notch Guzzling'. Unlimited eating sprees at tables loaded with the finest fresh spare ribs, prepared on a quality grille. This beyond unproportionous dining madness is ultimately combined with a foolish guzzling frenziness. Liters, no, GALLONS of beer are consumed within a very short period of time. Usually after a gallon or two per person the switch to hard liquor is made, to ensure stomach and intestines are still capable of handling the booze quantity and the amount of alcohol still has an increasing level. No one really know's how this mania usually ends. The only thing known about the aftermath is that people usually need a day or two to clean the house and recover. This also implies an answer to a frequently asked question: Why Phood &amp; Booze parties are always planned on a Friday?</p>

<p><b>Rejotnik the Russian Rent-boy</b></p>
<p>Rejotnic Zukmeov was raised in a quiet back-street sex shop in the centre of Moscow. Many historians believe that it was on the eastern edge of the city, but their research has so far been inconclusive. Strict though they were, his parents loved and cherished him and always supported his views and ambitions. He worked alongside his father in the family shop, the "Woodpecker", and grew fond of specific customers. He seemed to have a knack of knowing just how they liked it and returning clients were a frequent event. In a normal adult pleasure distributor there are, from time to time, protégés, or boys that have a special talent for what they do, but due to the confined social climate in which the Zukmeovs lived they did not realise their sons special gift.</p>
<p>As the months and years passed the time came for Rejotnic to start at Primary school and, looking out for his best interests, his parents sent him to a high achieving public school. His first day, week, month and year flew by and he made lots of friends due to his bubbly and charismatic persona. As Rejotnic was walking home one day with a particularly esteemed colleague by the name of Sheezagot Bigtats, when she asked him if they might play a game of ‘hide and seek’. Rejotnic was somewhat startled by this proposition, as the hour was late and his parents would be wondering where he was. After a little persuasion he gracefully accepted and he and Sheezagot played the game in a nearby wood. They ran about and found interesting crevices in which to hide, until they were quite exhausted. To recover they laid down on a large tree limb and talked about their day at school and how much of a dick-head that Alex Hagerdorn kid was. The conversation shifted into their previous lives, before school had grasped their feeble little minds. Rejotnik reluctantly told Sheezagot about his life in the shop and she proposed that he demonstrate his working technique on her. There was an awkward silence in which the two children looked into each others eyes and longed for their relationship to be preserved for aeons. Then with a flick of his middle finger he said “Fuck off ……….oh, all right then, ten quid”, and the evening ended with some bum-splittingly good sex.</p>
<p>The word spread of Rejonik’s talents and soon a small networked founded itself and customers would travel to meet this gifted child (for an arranged fee of course), and so, the legend was created. Posters on teenager’s walls were changed from pictures of the spotty cunts they call the Arctic Monkeys, to compromising snaps of the famous Rejotnik Zukmeov. Little did the general public know that there would never be anyone quite as good as ‘Rejotnik the Russian rent-boy’.</p>

<p>The Thompson Brothers are in fact Jason and Rob Thompson and they are in fact brothers. They are radio personalities in San Antonio, Texas hosting a show on 1200 WOAI called Prime Time San Antonio with the Thompson Brothers (PTSA). This show is different from their previous work, and their current work for Fox Sports Radio, in that it is not about Sports. Prior to PTSA they hosted the tremendously popular Hard Core Sports on a local sports station but in the summer of 2005 they launched PTSA covering news, politis, current events... pretty much everything. Their very different personalities are the source almost daily conflicts but in the end, their differences are tolerable if not entertaining because they are family.</p>
<p>As hosts of Game Time Sunday Rewind on Fox Sports Radio they return to their Sports roots on weekly basis. They are also frequently asked to fill-in on the Fox Sports Radio line-up and have hosted The Morning Etravaganza, Out of Bounds, the Steve Czaban Show and most often, JT the Brick.</p>
<p>The most common description of the Thompson Brothers shows is the "sounds like the kind of discussion you would have over drinks at the bar".</p>

<p>Rho Pi Phi (ΡΠΦ) is a professional pharmaceutical fraternity that is established in 1919 in the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. The goal of this fraternity is described in its 3 mottos: 1. …to maintain the ethical standards, dignity of and pride in the most ancient and honorable profession of Pharmacy. 2. …to contribute to the moral, social, and intellectual welfare of all students in pharmacy. 3. …that we may take the lamp of research into the dark recesses of things unknown, and make our contribution to our fellow man.</p>
<p>The fraternity also follows the Oath of Maimonides: "Thy eternal providence has appointed me to watch over the life and health of Thy creatures. May the love for my art actuate me at all times; may neither avarice nor miserliness, nor thirst for glory, or for a great reputation engage my mind; for the enemies of truth and philanthropy could easily deceive me and make me forgetful of my lofty aim of doing good to Thy children.</p>
<p>May I never see in the patient anything but a fellow creature in pain.</p>
<p>Grant me strength, time, and opportunity always to correct what I have acquired, always to extend its domain; for knowledge is immense and the spirit of man can extend infinitely to enrich itself daily with new requirements.</p>
<p>Today he can discover his errors of yesterday and tomorrow he may obtain a new light on what he thinks himself sure of today. O God, Thou has appointed me to watch over the life and depth of thy creatures, here I am ready for my vocation, and now I turn unto my calling."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The fraternity currently has 4 active chapters:</p>
<p>Lambda Sigma Delta, located at University of the Pacific, CA</p>
<p>Beta chapter, located at Union University, Albany College of Pharmacy, NY</p>
<p>Beta Galen Chapter, located at Philadelphia College of Pharmacy &amp; Science, PA</p>
<p>Gamma Gamma Rho, located at Northwestern University, IL</p>

<p><i>Pay Cards!</i> was a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game show</a> based on the card game <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a> and produced by Nick Nicholson and Roger Muir. The show aired in syndication from<a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. <i>Super Pay Cards!</i> aired from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and was syndicated by Metromedia. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_James_c4cc.html" title="Art James">Art James</a> hosted both versions, but was joined by hostess Mary Lou Basaraba on the <i>Super</i> version.</p>
<p>On <i>Pay Cards!</i>, three contestants, one of whom was a celebrity guest, playing for a member of the studio audience, competed by choosing cards from a board of 20 hidden cards. In the first round, each player, in turn, would select three cards to be revealed to start his or her poker hand. If the cards did not show a pair, the player could either keep those cards or turn them back. However, if a pair or three of a kind happened to be amongst the three selected cards, the player must keep those cards. Upon keeping three cards, the player selects one card and may either keep it or return it. Should a player refuse a card, control of the game passes to the next player. If only one player has not completed their hand, that player must keep each card he or she selects from the board. After each player has completed their hand, they are paid as follows:</p>
<p>One pair: $10 Two pair: $20 Three of a kind: $30 Full house: $50 Four of a kind: $100</p>
<p>The player with the highest hand after each round earns a $50 bonus.</p>
<p>The second round is called the "Strategy Round", in which four of the 20 cards are revealed to start the round. On each of the first two turns, each player calls out two cards to be revealed and then selects two cards from the six cards cards displayed to add to his or her hand. On each player's last turn, one card is called out and the player adds one of the five cards to complete his or her hand.</p>
<p>In the third and final round, hidden amongst the 20 cards are a series of "wild cards" which allow for a payoff of $150 for five of a kind.</p>
<p>The player who won the most money would be given the opportunity to win a bonus prize. The player would be shown a board of 12 cards to study for 12 seconds. The player would then spin a wheel which would determne which card the player must locate on the board. If the player locates the card which the wheel landed on, the player won the prize.</p>

<p>Two contestants faced a board of 16 hidden cards. Each player selected three cards and may keep them or turn them back. However, if a pair happened to be amongst the three cards, they must be kept. Upon keeping three cards, each player calls out one card on their subsequent turn and may either keep it or turn it back. As soon as one player completes their hand, the other player must complete their hand by keeping every card he or she selects. As soon as both players complete their hands, They are each paid as follows:</p>
<p>Pair: $20 Two pair: $40 Three of a kind: $50 Full house: $100 Four of a kind: $200</p>
<p>The player with the higher hand after each round earns a $50 bonus.</p>
<p>The second round may be played in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>2, 3, 4, 5: One set of five of a kind was hidden on the board, allowing for a payoff of $300.</li>
<li>Four of a Kind: Four sets of four of a kind were hidden on the board.</li>
<li>Strategy: Three of the 16 cards are revealed to start the round. Each player, on their first two turns, calls out two more cards to reveal and then selects two cards from the five showing to add to their hand. On each player's final turn, one cardis revealed by the player, who then selects one to add to his or her hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the third round, a few "wild cards" are hidden on the board. This allows for a possible Five of a Kind, which results in a payoff of $300.</p>
<p>After three rounds, the player who earns the most money advances to the bonus round. The other player would receive a copy of the <i>Super Pay Cards!</i> game.</p>
<p>In the first part of the bonus round, the player would be shown four cards to study for four seconds. Mary Lou holds those same four cards in her hand. The player selects one from a blind draw. If the player can recall the position of that card on the board, the player wins $50</p>
<p>The second part involves the player studying eight cards and their positions for eight seconds. The player selects a card from a blind draw. If that card is found on the board, the player wins $500.</p>
<p>On the third and final level, the player examines twelve cards for twelve seconds. If the card selected from the blind draw matches the first card revealed on the board, the player wins $5,000.--&gt;</p>

<p><b>Pitfall</b> is a game show hosted by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Trebek_48f4.html" title="Alex Trebek">Alex Trebek</a> from 1981-1982 and produced by Catalena Productions. John Barton served as the announcer.</p>
<p>Two contestants, and the studio audience, were given a survey question and four answers. Each audience member used their own electronic device to lock in an answer that best suited them. Each contestant then locked in their guess as to which answer was the most popular amongst the audience. One point was scored by each contestant who gave the top answer. The first player to score five points, or the player with the higher score after seven minutes of game play, advanced to the Pitfall round.</p>

<p>The champion would be given the opportunity to cross an eight-space bridge within 100 seconds. The set would dim and the eight sections would light up randomly. Each safe section would light up once, and each "pitfall" section would light up twice. After viewing the light show, the player would select from eight "pit passes" numbered 1-8. The player selected pit passes corresponding to which sections of the bridge he or she believed were "pitfalls". The contestant was allowed to select one pit pass if he or she scored one or two points in the front game, two passes if three or four points were scored, or three passes if he or she scored the five point maximum.</p>
<p>Alex and the contestant would then ride an elevator to the second level of the two-level bridge. Before stepping to the first section of the bridge, the contestant must answer a question correctly. Each question answered correctly would allow the player to step to the next section. If the player stopped on a "pitfall" section, the clock would continue counting down as that particular section lowered to the first level. The player remained at the lower level until answering another question correctly. Doing so stopped the clock and raised the section back up to the upper level, but the player must answer another question correctly before advancing to the next section. If the player comes to a section which he or she believed to be a "pitfall", he or she may hand Trebek the "pit pass" for that particular section before crossing over it. Reaching the other end of the bridge before 100 seconds ran out would win the player a prize package worth over $5,000 (Canadian). Otherwise, the player earned $100 (Canadian) for each section he or she crossed over.</p>

<p>Many players from the show's last few weeks were not paid their winnings due to Catalena Productions' financial troubles. The company would go bankrupt soon thereafter.</p>
