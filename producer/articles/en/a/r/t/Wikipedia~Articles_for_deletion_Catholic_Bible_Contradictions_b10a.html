If you want to enter lists of quotations, put them into our sister project Wikiquote</a>. A properly cited NPOV article would be fine IMHO, but list of quotations is just tedious. It is like having an article about the sinking of <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Titanic_9d7a.html" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a> which just presented a list of passenger names and whether they died or not. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 17:38, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>. They are not indiscriminate. It is the best way I could think of presenting what is an important, major theological dispute in a NPOV as informatively and concisely as possible. Wikipedia is not intended as a source of general entertainment - there are plenty of tedious index style articles. The point of the quotes is that they make the representation of a viewpoint beyond doubt. Its very different to the titanic example as it allows the religiously inclined to determine for themselves if the contradictions exist. If you think the page is quote heavy, write some analysis. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 17:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> For me, the problem is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_in_eight_words_51f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia in eight words">Wikipedia is not a simple collection or list of facts. There is a process of summarizing, grading, organizing and collating involved, to ensure that the resulting articles are as useful as possible for readers seeking both detail and overview</a>. If the quotations are the result of your own research, then that makes it original research; but even if not then the fundamental problem for me is the style. See, for example, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html#Interpretation" title="Christianity">Christianity#Interpretation</a> on how an article might approach the differences between the two branches (although for my tastes that section is lacking in sources). I agree that it could probably be fixed by adding analysis, although I lack the expertise (and the inclination) to do this. I would also be picky about how NPOV the article is. e.g. "(Most) Protestants see salvation as coming..." – How do we know what most Protestants believe? Is there a source for this statement, is it credible etc. <a href="../../../j/l/l/User%7EJll_a192.html" title="User:Jll">Jll</a> 18:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> The entire section of quotes is still just that, a list of quotes. If you want to write an article about a position (so-and-so feels catholicism is not christianity) then do it. As it stands now it is still a list of quotes preceeded by a brief statement of "context." I would suggest taking each of your sections, writing what Rick Jones, or someone else, believes, and using the quotes to evidence their position. I am open to recinding my vote, but at this time I remain in favor of deletion. Also can I suggest that you begin posts after the first with <b>comment</b> rather than <b>keep</b> as it will prevent people from thinking you are trying to vote multiple times.<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_my_leg_8d24.html" title="User:Not my leg">Not my leg</a> 17:55, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

As the article currently stands I don't know how it can be salveged. I tried a rewrite, but couldn't get through more than a section without stalling and being at a complete loss for how to make this NPOV.

I could very easily dig up entire scholarly articles debating the "true meaning" of almost every single Bible passage listed, so to simply dump the quotes onto the page without any attempt to provide context renders the article useless. In addition, the article is also a rather nasty - some might say outright bigoted - <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> violation ("Catholic views" vs "<i>Biblical</i> views"?

<li>Well biblical views vs catholic views is how many protestants see it (reported POV of some protestants not authors POV), call them catholic bashers if you like. Im reporting this oppinion objectively, not holding it. Its a genuine theological dispute, to claim that reporting it in detail is nasty is censorship. If catholicism is consistent with the king james bible then the 2 views should be the same. As I used a NPOV i left this assesment to the reader. There are a huge number of christians who claim the bible is accessable and says what it means. That profesional scolarship is required to understand the bible is a biased oppinion. If you want to write a section at the end about those who believe that the bible needs expert interperetation, be my guest. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 19:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's irrelevant that "many Protestants" see it that way. The terminology is inherently biased and directly implies "Well, there's the Catholic view and then there's the <i>Christian</i> view." It's a thinly-veiled way of saying "Catholics aren't real Christians." That's an opinion, not a fact, and opinions are not allowed to be posted as fact on Wikipedia. And I'm not accusing you personally of holding these views; it would be fine with me if you did, as that's your business, not mine. I'm purely concerned about the article and whether or not it adheres to Wikipedia policy. By the way, Catholics generally don't use the King James bible. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 20:02, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a forum for debate, nor for discussion of opinions outside the context of articles about the persons or organizations who publish those opinions. Moreover, comparison articles are almost never encyclopedic, nor do they often maintain a neutral point of view. The content in the article is clearly written to advance the notion that catholicism is incompatible with biblical texts; there is no conceivable way to edit such content into a perspective that respects the breadth of religious interpretation that is required to preserve a neutral point of view. —<tt><a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonhalcon_96f2.html" title="User:Donhalcon">donhalcon</a></tt><sup><a href="../../../d/o/n/User_talk%7EDonhalcon_64c9.html" title="User talk:Donhalcon">〒</a></sup> 20:25, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, some things to be going on with when working on this article: <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">avoid weasel words</a> such as <i>"It is a widespread (but not universal) belief..."</i>. This tells a researcher and a casual reader precisely nothing about the scope and depth of the topic under discussion and, more importantly, attempt to cover a Point of View. Articles shouldn't be partisan and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is a guide to avoiding this stance. The article tells me nothing about the dispute between the two authors but instead prompts in my mind the question "What line is the author trying to push in the debate?". Secondly, presenting illustrative quotes to raise awareness of a debate is not the same as contributing an encyclopædic article about said debate. <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">How to write a great article</a> is a good guide towards constructing something for inclusion in WP. Please read it whilst thinking of further improvements. Why not precis the debate? What is the context? What are the points of view of the contending authors? A NPOV guide to the debate is worth far more than a series of quotations which are really quite boring to read. Sources and citations for researchers? Is this debate continued in journals of religious studies? References to these would be really worth having for any researcher interested in the debate. In summary, NPOV; introduction with topic &amp; scope; analysis of POV of subjects' work; one or two illustrative quotes so as not to disrupt the flow of the article; summary if appropriate; citations, references and further reading. I hope that my comments are useful. I would like to read about the debate but I can gain nothing from reading this article as it stands. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 21:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> for all the reasons mentioned, most importantly that it violates NPOV. While one could request it be neutralized rather than deleted, salvaging this article would require changing the title, the structure, the wording of every single section and adding major content.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>: 1) the fact that it's quotes makes it original research. Possibly someone else's, but original research nonetheless. An article on the alleged controversy might be encyclopedic, but only if the controversy itself is verifiable. 2) The Bible is inconsistent with itself - you can't reasonably expect any document to be entirely consistent with it. 3) Mainly it violates NPOV as it is merely thinly-disguised Church - bashing. The Catholic Church doesn't claim the catechism is consistent with every single word in the Bible. I only looked through a few examples (I just couldn't take any more) and they all said, not that the Catholic Church isn't Christian, but that it isn't Protestant, hardly a fact meriting it's own article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 08:35, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>What does <i>Biblical</i> mean? NPOV is violated by the implication that the catechism is flawed, that the contradictions imply something. The Bible is interpreted in a particular context. Aside from the lunatic fringe that believes the Bible is to be interpreted literally, there is no objective measure of what it is to be Biblical. And, again, the catechism isn't intended to be Biblical by <i>Protestant</i> standards; you might as well have an article that the Theory of General Relativity isn't Biblical. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 18:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Biblical means consistent with the bible. That the catechism is flawed/contradictions mean something is not an implication. Its the oppinion of many protestants which i am reporting in NPOV. "there is no objective measure of what it is to be Biblical" - most protestants, in fact almost all christians would disagree. Most believe that the bible is literal except for certain well defined parts (the parables) - especially the reported speech of jesus is considered literal. This is an important article as these contradictions are behind much protestant rejection of catholicism - which is noteworthy. No one in their right mind would consider the theory of relativity a biblicaly/christian doctrine - catholicism on the other hand... <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrippled_Sloth_4708.html" title="User:Crippled Sloth">Crippled Sloth</a> 22:04, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All that you're saying is that Catholicism isn't Protestant (in fact a very specific meaning of Protestant), not that it isn't "Biblical", whatever that is. You're also saying that Catholic (and presumably Greek and Russian and Bulgarian Orthodox) perspectives are not valid in assessing what is Biblical. You might want to check, you know, the Bible, it mentioned Jesus' opinions of the Pharisees who believed they monopolized interpretation. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 23:42, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I thought I had gotten out of this, but I can't help but come back in now. When you say that almost all christians would disagree that there is no objective measure of what it is to be biblical you are doing one of two things. Either claiming that catholics are not christians, which backs up that this is personal advocacy, or claiming that almost all christians agree to a strict literalist interpretaion of the bible, which is patently false. Most don't care about wearing cloth of two different fibers, for example. Even those that do accept a strict literalist interpretation usually grant some wiggle room for potential human error in transcribing the perfect word of God. Otherwise many would argue that a strict literalist interpretation would make the bible not internally consistent. That is another topic though. The point is that your claim about the meaning of biblical is by no means agreed upon by "nearly all christians". <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENot_my_leg_8d24.html" title="User:Not my leg">Not my leg</a> 22:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> i cant see any definition of biblical other than "what the bible says". Some Protestants claim that the inconsistencies mean catholics as non christian (<b>they</b> see christian and protestant as synonymous). This line of argument i am reporting, not advocating. Possibly my last comment came out wrong. what i meant to say was "nearly all christians do not think you can interperet the bible however you like and still call yourself a christian". Most christians see some books (ie gospels) as strictly literal, and others as metaphorical (ie genesis). Not - its all whatever you want it to be. 129.234.4.76 10:42, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>cant see any definition of biblical other than "what the bible says"</i> That's the bias right there. The Bible says a lot of things, many of which have nothing to do with Christianity. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 15:27, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> Summary of the defense case thus far. There seem to be 4 main areas of debate.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1. Is it NPOV?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I would say so. Its intended as an article on <b>the belief that catholic dogma is inconsistent with the bible</b>. Such a belief is biased and some would call it church bashing. I think i have reported it in NPOV - the quotes from the catechism are catholic view <b>fact</b>. The quotes from the king james are biblical view <b>fact</b>. The commentary is relatively short (and i believe completely objective). If anyone still believes that to be biased/weasel words ill change it if they tell me whats wrong. I think thats everything. It doesnt give catholic counterarguments, see style.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>2. Is it an apropriate topic to wikipedia?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>To reitterate Its intended as an article on <b>the belief that catholic dogma is inconsistent with the bible</b>. If such a belif had a name (something-ism) this dispute wouldnt arrise. The fact that it does not have a such name does not change its appropriateness as it is a theologicaly important, published belief. If you can think of a better name for such an article, then by all means suggest a move - i was at a loss when writing it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>3. Is is original research?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The quotes given for each argument are the same as in one of the sources, Rick Jones - Understanding Roman Catholicism.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>4. Style</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, its not great. It could really do with more context, and more sections than just the quotes one (for which ive put suggestions in the talk page). Im new to wikipedia, and was under the impression that people could submit work in progress articles and people would help them finish them. If this is not the case, and articles should be finished/rounded before submission then i guess delete it, ill "finish" it outside wikipedia and resubmit it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>On NPOV</b>. What exactly do you all define NPOV as? I undestood it to mean 1)giving all opinions in reported speech, and 2)not using biased/weasel words in commentary. As far as i can tell ive done this. Are there any requirements ive missed?</li>
