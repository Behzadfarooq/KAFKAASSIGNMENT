<p>Non-notable biography. Undeleted from a CSDA7 because of nagging by creator. No claim of notability beyond having acted in porn films, no independent third party reviews of her work. She fails all the "Valid criteria" in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>. We need to remember <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in these cases and weigh how much useful information is in these articles against the possible harm they can do to living people. This article makes no case for her being anything more than your standard run-of-the-mill porn actor. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:42, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> She is notable by the fact that she has appeared in over 100 movies, as stated in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>. <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> states 'modern American heterosexual performers are usually notable if they appear in more than 100 films'. The article had reliable sources proving that she is a prolific pornstar. That is all that is needed. There is nothing written in the article that isn't sourced. The <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> criteria are derived from results of past AfD discussions which shows that precedants have been set. I've seen many articles like this at AfD discussions and they've always been kept. There are many less notable porn stars than her on Wikipedia. This is clearly not just a vanity article. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 17:52, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I never claimed that it was vanity. Also, the fact that there are less "notable" pornstars on Wikipedia is a bad reason to keep an article. Also, things change, AfD is not strictly based on precedent. It also says <i>usually</i> notable, not <i>always</i> notable. The only point in her favor as far as notability is concerned is that she's prolific? I think that's somewhat absurd. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 17:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Number of films in a genre <i>can</i> contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and the prolificness of their work and can be used <i>in conjunction with</i> more valid criteria of either <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn <i>in general</i>, or anything else for that matter, as Googling her gets under 400 hits. I get more relevant hits if I Google <i>my</i> name (real name, not WP name), and I'm not notable enough for a WP article. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources <i>in conjunction with</i> other <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a>, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites <i>alone</i> are not acceptable as reliable sources.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 18:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The reason she has low Google hits is that there are numourous variations of her name. 'Mia Bangg' comes up with over 200,000 hits. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's still significantly less than most (if not all) of the other AfDs in which I voted keep. I searched the variation you suggested on Google and still came up with anything that could be considered a reliable source. Even what appears to be her official website provides no information so as to be used as an acceptable primary source. If you can expand and appropriately reference this article with sources that I have overlooked, please do. I never vote in an AfD without first seeing if there's something I can do to "save" the article in question (unless of course it obviously appears to be crap or otherwise inappropriate for WP). I am not at all unopposed to changing my position on an AfD if the article is improved to acceptable standards.

<li>Hmmmm. Carmen Hayes 199,000 hits, Mariko Morikawa 25,000 hits, Amanda Lexx 123,000 hits, Alexis DeVell 30,000 hits, Anastasia Christ 179,000 hits. But OK, I'll assume good faith. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 23:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
