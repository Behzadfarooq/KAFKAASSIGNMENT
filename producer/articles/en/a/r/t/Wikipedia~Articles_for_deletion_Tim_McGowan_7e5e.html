<li><b>Delete</b> as NN, vanity. There is a profile of him on <a href="http://newmusic.clearchannel.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://newmusic.clearchannel.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The home page of that site says, "Clear Channel has partnered with GarageBand to showcase the best undiscovered talent on our radio station websites." He lists nine CDs, but the only three I can find label information for were self-published (the "Tim McGowan" label and the "McMusic" label). Doesn't meet WP:MUSIC that I can see. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 19:25, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Just because the home page for Clear Channel states it is partnered with Garageband to showcase unsigned artists is irrelevant...Does that mean every artist listed on Clear Channel is unsigned? NO! Google "Tim McGowan" He is all over the place, get your facts right 1st! Overly illustrated!! Because someone showed the initiative to brighten the page up and be informative at the same time with album cover pictures and logos? This artist deserves to be listed. Have any of you heard of Kitaro or Arkenstone either??? Don't know where you got your "half of the story" release info from but his music is released by McMusic International <small>(edit by McMusic (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_McMusic_d40e.html" title="Special:Contributions/McMusic">contribs</a>))</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. McMusic International does not qualify as a major label or one of the more important indie labels, as defined in WP:MUSIC. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> [[User_talk:Dalbury|(talk)]] 20:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> In your opinion...and who are you to state this? Uncle Sam? Important enough to have released over a dozen albums from several artists...be listed on the All music guide, Amazon in several countries including Japan - France - USA - UK, Yahoo music, AOL music, Napster, MSN, Sony Connect and dozens more!! His music has been in international/national radio station Top 10 lists for over 12 months, sometimes 4 - 5 different tracks simultaneously in the same Top 10 list. You would have learned this if you had researched properly. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.218.167.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.218.167.77_8cab.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.218.167.77">contribs</a>) 21:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Kill it with fire</b>. Blatant self-promotion. If Mr. McGowan is indeed found to satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, it'd be best to start over from scratch from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> point of view.

<li><b>RE: Kill it with fire</b> "Blatant self-promotion" would be the case if I was indeed Tim McGowan but, Tim McGowan I am NOT!! What do you find offensive about this page? The CD Cover artwork? The Logos? or his promo picture? #1 When Reading about any artist many people like to see the cover artwork...it adds to the collective information about the artists and tells a story in itself. #2 Many people like to see what the artist looks like. #3 Logos are as much a part of an artists identity as #1 &amp; #2. #4. Permission was granted for inclusion of all materials used. Who knows their career history better than the artist himself. You are assured 100% accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really don't see what the fuss is all about here. Other than being unfamiliar with the artist in question...Maybe you should broaden your horizon and listen to different genres. New age is a small selective market but thousands of music lovers do appreciate it. I am sorry you don't particulary find the information interesting but many fans do. McMusic</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's see... McMusic is the music label. Your username is McMusic. How is that <i>not</i> self-promotion? You're promoting an artist on your own label with an ad disguised (poorly) as an encyclopedia article. <i><b><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">a</font></a></b></i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">ndroid</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 05:48, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>So Cynical</b> You my friend are promoting yourself on your page...telling the world your likes dislikes and just how wonderful you think yourself to be. It doesn't matter what I chose to use as a user name it's just a name. Your chose android79...Does this mean you are less than human and lack compassion, understanding and just common sense?

<li><b>Please note</b>. Android, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedias.html" title="Encyclopedias">Encyclopedias</a> can be general, containing articles on topics in many different fields. An <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics. An encyclopedia seeks to discuss each subject in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. All of which was done in article. By your comment above are we all to take it that all information on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_musicians.html" title="List of musicians">list of musicians</a> and artists listed on Wikipedia are nothing more that ads? Are we to go edit each of them with notices saying they shouldn't be listed? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.154.231.159 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.154.231.159_bdf3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.154.231.159">contribs</a>) 19:32, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</small>

<li>Uh, that's my <a href="../../../u/p/_/WP%7EUP_7462.html" title="WP:UP">user page</a>. It's not a part of the encyclopedia. Note that there is no Android79 or (insert my real name here), only <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">User:Android79</a>. Draw whatever conclusions you wish from my choice of username, though I've explained the meaning, such as it is, on my user page. Please refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>. The fact that you chose McMusic as a username indicates you have some relationship with the music label – <i>that</i> was my point. I'm well aware of what an encyclopedia is. I've got no problem with including an article on Mr. McGowan in this encyclopedia if he is shown to meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria</a> for inclusion and if the article is written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, non-<a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam">advertising</a> tone. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 19:47, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Criteria Met</b>. It says in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">criteria</a> "is notable if it meets ANY one of the following criteria:" He definately meets several of them, (#1, #2, #3 and #4 immediately jumps out just by visiting his website), if you want you can do the research...The article I wrote is neutral...I did not say he was the best thing since chocolate. I merely described his music for the reader who may never have heard any and wondered what to expect, as in style, if they did. His bio tells the story of what he has done in his musical lifetime so far. How is that an ad? There was no personal attack on your name either, as you put it "Draw whatever conclusions you wish from my choice of username" It was merely a conclusion such as yours on mine. Albeit a wrong one! You say you don't have a problem with Mr McGowan being listed, you can see he meets the criteria, therefore, if you have indeed become an administrator, please put an end to this nonsense and remove any notices and allow this page to be accessed directly without any further obstruction.
<ul>
<li>The article indicates that McGowan's <i>former bands</i> meet criteria #1 and #2; this is an article about McGowan himself. McMusic does not appear to be a major label, so #3 is out. I see no indication of meeting #4. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 20:36, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Mr McGowan being the writer and copyright holder of the songs for previous bands he has worked with still entitles him to be considered to the meet the criteria of #1. regardless of who else played an instrument along side him in the recording. As far as #2 goes. I can also confirm that McGowan has toured the UK, several times, and I presume you will agree would be considered a medium size country. #3 and #4. are moot points, one does not have to meet all criteria listed...it states "ANY" should be met.</li>
