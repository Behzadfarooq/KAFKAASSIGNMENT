Service stations are notable, multi million pound businesses. The article is a stub which needs expanding.

<li>WP:INN is not policy though it is, of course, a consideration. In fact if WP:INN was a ploicy then a large chunk of railway stations would become candidates. I think other discussions are relevant as a consensus was formed on as as notable (nor not dependent on your point of view) - if this didn't apply then, again, the stations would be up for a cull. A quick google search has resulted in <a href="http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/motorway_panel.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/motorway_panel.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. There is no doubt more to be found - I have not seen a reference to an earlier installation of microwaves at a UK motorway services - something that makes it notable. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 23:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reference you provide states the cafe of the station used to be more or less Space 1999-themed for a while. Good for Wikitravel, maybe, but hardly a proof of encyclopaedic notability per se. Other AfD discussions indeed serve to establish a consensus - bot on whether to delete or keep <i>the article(s) being nominated</i> in those cases. They are not inclusion criteria or notability guidelines, which still exist as separate entities. An article proposed for deletion must be evaluated on its own merits, and must establish its own notability. This page is not for discussing the concept of notability for a whole category - it is about one specific article and whether it has sufficient proof of notability to avoid deletion or <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>-style merging.</li>

It describes the automated microwave in Washington services, but the fact that it does not describe others does not equal to a statement that there existed no others.

Also according to <a href="http://www.msatrivia.co.uk/chron.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.msatrivia.co.uk/chron.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> it is the first service station in the North East and on the A1(M) based on the fact that all the others are in the North West or South of Manchester.

<li>The <b>first</b> of the two new links you mention is, as you correctly note, someone's post on a newsgroup, and thus satisfies neither <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> nor <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so it cannot be used as a Wikipedia source; even if it were, it states they did have microwaves back in the day, true, but never states they were the first to do so on a national level. The <b>second</b> link states indeed that Washington is the oldest service station on that particular road, but that's hardly a claim to notability (every motorway sooner or later has a first station built). The oldest service station in the country, that's probably a claim to notability, but that is not the case here. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 15:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why is it not a claim to notability? Would the first pub in an area not be notable for that? Would the first road in area not be notable? There are motorways that have no station and will probably never will do, so it is not "inevitable".

<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with everything Regan says, plus the fact that they are stubs, we have not yet had time to expand them (there's lots of 20th Century history to chronical), and they form a part of the 20th/21st Century which in all likelihood will not be with us forever. Already some have been rebuilt, there have been fires, shootings, prostitution, asylum scandals, others have won awards for design or food quality. South Mimms, which is one that has been marked (again) for deletion has had a TV documentary shown about it, and books written which reference it. My feeling is that these service areas, as unpleasant as many of them are, have their own stories to tell, and one day when we're long forgotton about probably will be wiped from existance altogehter, making this the perfect place to detail their histories. <a href="../../../c/2/r/User%7EC2r_192d.html" title="User:C2r">C2r</a> 23:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, I don't see the point in keeping 66% of the articles and trashing the other 33%, therefore my comments are relevant to this article as well as I was using South Mimms as an example of how others can also be significant and relevant - just because at the moment I don't have these details to hand doesn't mean they don't exist. <a href="../../../c/2/r/User%7EC2r_192d.html" title="User:C2r">C2r</a> 23:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Motorway services in the UK are very notable as they are used by maybe a million+ people each year. This isn't just a petrol service station on a minor road or in a town, this is a motorway service station which are of massive use and necessity to the millions of drivers who use the UK motorway network each day. Also these services, as they are on the A1(M) are most likely one of the busiest on the network. There are also two hotels at the services which can be added to the article if people think it's too stubbish. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, so it's a <i>big honkin</i> petrol station.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wish people would stop nominating these without any apparent knowledge of their significance within British culture. Motorway service stations are not ordinary service areas. Their names are very well-known to British people all over the country - they are not just local institutions. There was even a programme about them on the BBC the other night. Such areas may not be notable within America, but they most certainly are in Britain.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I don't believe <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> can possible apply here anyway, Motorway Services aren't just petrol stations used by local people, they are more commonly used by non-locals, people passing through on long trips. As a result they are know by people up and down the country, not just local people who may not actually use them at all. The Motorway Services on the UK network aren't like the ones you tend to find elsewhere, these are usually large complexes with hotels, restaurants, shops and many other facilities designed to assist and aid motorists on long journeys up and down the nations network. They are very much a part of UK life and are used by millions of people every day. We're not talking a little petrol station in a town used by a couple hundred locals every week, and we're not suggesting making articles about each of them. Many of them are household names, many documentaries have been made about then, even entire series based around the everyday activities of them. Why should articles like <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_Canberra_05af.html" title="Hotel Canberra">Hotel Canberra</a> which is a hotel used by no more than a couple hundred people a day be more notable than something used by thousands, maybe tens of thousands. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 11:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is likely to be reached in a week at many UK service stations. Why is one more notable than another? Why is one deemed appropriate for an article and the other not? Why does two strips of concrete and an out house open around 4 hours a day become encyclopedic and a place used by millions every year not? What is so notable about the railway station that allows it to stay on here and yet a service station is deemed to be so unnotable that it must be deleted? And on culture, yes these are part of the cultural history of the UK, for better or for worse. I personally spend as little time as possible at service stations, but they were once gleaming symbols of modernity in transportation (I know it is hard to believe). <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 14:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Service stations are not necessariyl linked to individual roads, however, some are on multiple - therefore by putting ones like this into the road article (which would be the A1), and ones like south mimms which aren't on an individual road (it's on three), it becomes confusing as to where the articles might be found. Furthermore, this article and articles like these aren't like Joes Esso on the relief road... they're actually created at the time the special orders are passed for the motorway or afterwards as they're specified by the government - you can't just come along and build one anywhere. It's also interesting that Railway Stations and airports are deemed to be automatically notable while motorway service areas are not, which seems to be a very perculiar (political?) ruling - could someone direct me to the page where this was discussed and deemed to be the case, as I'm sure the same reasoning could apply to motorway service areas as applies to railway stations.... As far as I'm aware there's absolutely nothing of significance about either (for example) Bayford or Crews Hill stations that could not be included on the 'locality' page about the villages.... whereas Motorway Service areas exist independently of location (they may be near none, and those that are near towns or village have nothing in common with the town/village, so probably don't belong on the pages for the town or village), and as stated previously I don't think they really belong on the motorway pages either; the A1 page, for instance would become incredibly crowded with information about the motorway sections, the historical sections, the different routes as the road has evolved over time.... Having said that, I've got better things to do with my time than argue over the deletion of stubs, as they're fairly easy to put back again once sufficient information on them is found (o; <a href="../../../c/2/r/User%7EC2r_192d.html" title="User:C2r">C2r</a> 20:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

The comparison with rail stations is close. But does each still need their own article? I think better to create one big article describing these in general, with a list of them perhaps as a sub article. There are not that many of this size in Britain - I think one article or two might work. Or perhaps one artcle for each major motor way.

<dd>How about each major motorway just having a list, like, say List of service areas on the A1 and A1 (M). No doubt these are areas with multiple business generating multi-millions of pounds, but so are shopping centres and many US tollway service areas, and not all them are notable, either. The argument that railway stations each get their own article doesn't hold water, not all railway stations <i>do</i> get their own article, and not all <i>should</i> get their own article, however, (a) there's already been a precedent set in the case of RR stations, and (b) Generally, there's only one railway station in each town or neighborhood, and they're often a transportation hub, rather than a stopoff. Many railway stations are historically or architecurally significant, few service stations or service areas are. (Some railfans have their own bent perspective on the importance of railway minituae as well)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with that solution is you'll end up with articles that are just the same. The reason being that motorway services are actually not that common and the vast majority of motorways only have 1 MSA on them. The M2, M20, M27 (I think) only have one on their entire length, even the M25 only has two Motorway Services (I think. It could be three but I'm not sure). Some motorways don't have any. So you'd end up moving them to articles with different titles but end up with the same information in them and the same arguments. However maybe there is a solution that involves combining them together in some form, and redirecting from the individual names, I just can't think of the best way to do that. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, since the people wanting to keep are predominantly British, that's not really a useful question. As a Briton, I don't know whether articles on service stations in other countries are worth keeping or not, which is why I wouldn't express an uninformed opinion on them in an AfD basing their worth on the perceived worth of <i>similar</i> (but probably not identical) facilities in my own country (comments like "it's just a big gas station" just go to show that many people commenting here don't actually know much about the subject at hand). Why should we be comparing them with service stations elsewhere? That's not the issue at all; the issue is their significance in their own milieu, not somebody else's. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:11, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this <i>is</i> the <b>English language</b> Wikipedia, not the <b>British</b> Wikipedia, so how this all fits in the overall WP context does count, at least IMHO. I'm still a little puzzled as to why these are considered notable in their own milieu. It's not like Britain isn't loaded to the gills with notable places and structures (it is). Also, if someone later decides to put up similar articles in other countries, they're going to point to this kind of article out as an example to justify it. Whatever, I've said my <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tuppence.html" title="Tuppence">tuppence</a> worth, I'll shut up now. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're completely misinterpreting what I said. I can't compare British service stations to American service stations because I have no knowledge of American service stations. All I can do is give my opinion as to the significance of British service stations in British culture, not how they compare to vaguely related institutions in other countries. To ask me (or anyone else) to compare them to something I/we know nothing about is ridiculous. But I do know how significant they are to many people in Britain, and how well-known many of them are. A lot of people here seem to be comparing them to ordinary "gas stations" or diners, and that's not what they are. Coincidentally, here's an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" rel="nofollow">article</a> about them that featured on the BBC News website today, which highlights a particular service station. Are there articles about American service stations on national American news? And anyway, of course subjects' significance in their own milieu counts; American state representatives have absolutely no impact on or interest to most people outside the USA, or even their own state, for instance, but they still all have their own articles, as justified by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think there really needs to be a substantive discussion on an overall policy on inclusion of waysides, MSA's, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Tollway_oasis_cf89.html" title="Illinois Tollway oasis">tollway oases</a> and roadside whatnot, as there is on railway stations, see: <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_Wikipedia_is_not_a_timetable_2ab6.html" title="User:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable">User:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable</a>. I would note in the tollway oasis article, one of the first things that's said about them is that they're similar to British MSA's, which is the impression I also had when I visited an MSA. The first line of the BBC article is <i>Motorway service stations have become a byword for bad food at top prices</i>, a charge that was levelled in the past at tollway oases, too. (Now they have <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a>, which is some improvement) Yes, some gas stations, truck stops and so forth get media mentions in the USA if they're notable, eg: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-19%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22dixie+truckers+home%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-19%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22dixie+truckers+home%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Dixie Truckers Home</a>. BTW, many state legislators in the US don't have articles, and IMHO, few deserve one, either, despite <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. British peers automatically get in, too. Lastly, at this point, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area.html" title="Motorway service area">Motorway service area</a> redirects to "Rest area", which really isn't the right place for an article on MSA's, if you ask me. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 19:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether state legislators deserve articles or not is not actually the point - under WP:BIO they are allowed to have them, no questions asked. British peers, incidentally, are <i>national</i> legislators.

<li>Even if these service stations are culturally significant in the UK (as their supporters argue they are, despite the lack of solid references), that still doesn't make <i>this particular</i> service station notable. <b>Delete</b> (and create Cultural significance of motorway service stations in the United Kingdom if you think it's notable and you can reference it). <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 13:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be some consensus growing to fix - it seems to me a consensus to move away from 73 articles. We need to together find a great solution. What if we create 3 articles - one each for the main suppliers - and perhaps one on the cultural impact. This particular page can become a redirect (not delete). Two extra comments. Look what was on the BBC today <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" rel="nofollow">NEWS</a>. As this source shows, this is a government issue to fix - imagine if Nancy P was speaking on interstate rest areas. And forget the comparison with Illinois area.

<li><b>Merge</b> to United Kingdom motorway service areas I would say that motorway services are probably as notable as the numerious railways station articles (say <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanhill_railway_station.html" title="Jordanhill railway station">Jordanhill railway station</a>). However for the most part they are not that interesting. Theres a lot which could be said about them as a class, which would be distinct from US varients. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 20:36, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There used to be a UK MSA article, but it got merged into the general Rest Area article. It might be worth considering a demerge and reinstating the UK specific article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSG_062d.html" title="User:MarkSG">MarkSG</a> 15:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

I still don't see how they're any different from the service areas on <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_401.html" title="Highway 401">Highway 401</a> or the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Turnpike_8c79.html" title="New Jersey Turnpike">New Jersey Turnpike</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirjtc2_8434.html" title="User:Kirjtc2">Kirjtc2</a> 15:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I only said it "might be" worth considering - I'm not making a definite argument in favour of doing it yet. But it's a suggestion which might be suitable as a compromise here, as it gives a place for all the information in these stubs to find a natural home without having to delete it altogether.</li>

<li>Having said that, I think there are good reasons for demerging it from Rest Area. For a start, an MSA is a very specific type of Rest Area, which operates under specific government guidelines and regulations. It's not just a big gas station on a major road - it's part of the UK motorway infrastructure. The current Rest Area article is somewhat misleading, in that it implies that MSAs are what Brits call facilities that elsewhere would be called a Rest Area, when in fact they are more specific than that. It's a bit like having an article on roads which suggests that "Interstate" is what Americans call roads that elsewhere are called "major roads" - sure, an I-road is a major road, but it's more than just being major that makes it significant. An MSA is a subset of rest areas, rather than just being the British name for them. And, as far as I'm aware, the UK concept of a motorway service area is unique - one of the things that makes them controversial in the UK is because they are regulated in a way that equivalent facilites elsewhere, such as the US and mainland Europe, are not. So, taken as a group, they would satisfy the Wikipedia requirements for notability even if an individual site would not. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSG_062d.html" title="User:MarkSG">MarkSG</a> 15:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not all of them are worthy of article. I do not know about Washington, but I am not convinced that <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> would necessarily apply. Firstly because some of these are enormous franchises granted by the government, and their existence can be verified on every UK road map. These are often much more than service stations, sometimes incorporating shops, restaurants (sometimes with starbucks, mcdonalds) and motels. They may belong to chains such as Granada, but whole motorway service network of motorway services are not under single ownership. We are now seeing a proliferation of articles on shopping malls, where we already see very passionate debates about their notability or otherwise, MSA may well fall into this category should we perhaps draw up a guideline called "WP:MALL" to cover these?&#160;;-) As most of these articles are pretty much stubs, they could be merged and populated if people think worthwhile. Per above debate, it may be useful to have these as sections in the relevant motorway, or include them as part of the relevant franchisee, with a navigational page List of United Kingdom motorway service areas. I would like to see a <b>MERGE</b>, probably to the relevant motorway <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
