<li><b>Speedy</b>.This "article" is a good example of some shortcomings in our speedy delete policy, in my humble opinion. There are two sentences on the page: "efront - virtual real estate frontage. Beach front, street front, efront." I do not know what the person who created this page is trying to say; it is most plausibly an ad, although google does not seem to show any company with the name selling real estate in the first hundred or so items. He may also have been attempting to define words. Or it may be spam. Regardless, it is not clearly comprehensible, and it most <i>certainly</i> should not be on Wikipedia. It is not unreasonable to allow sysops to delete this on sight, IMHO; we waste quite a bit of time voting on stuff like this. Is there a <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a> that applies? I'm not certain, although I think a strong case can be made for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">G1</a> (see item 2 in <a href="../../../p/n/_/WP%7EPN_ca1e.html" title="WP:PN">WP:PN</a>). I will apply the speedy tag(-patent nonsense), in the knowledge that a closer can always disagree and remove it, if in their opinion this should go through a vote.

<li><i>Comment</i>: mascot of a university sports team should probably make this doggy notable enough according to the rather low notability bar for such things on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Taquito and Oski are not really comparable. Oski is a mascot for a whole (very major) university, Taquito is a mascot for a single team at a (not nearly as major) university. Also, Oski is a "character" played by numerous real bears and later by people in suits, while Taquito is just one individual dog. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 11:33, August 11, 2005 (UTC)

<p>i recommend the article to be deleted for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. "Chiangchun" is a dialect term (Hokkien?) not recognized internationally. i did a google search with "chiangchun" and all results returned were "Chiangchun Harbor", "Chiangchun River" and the likes. This means that the term "chiangchun" is not widely accepted or used at all.</p>
<p>2. The Chinese idea of a general is no different from that in the West. Until perhaps the invention of firearms, leading men of armies around the world often engage in duels to determine the outcome of the conflicts. And whether in China or elsewhere, they do follow a set of honor codes.</p>
<p>Therefore, i believe this article is redundant and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 02:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I was the first person to defend the article in the original discussion, it was simply based on a hunch I had when I saw that the Google hits were extremely low on "changchun" that it wasn't hanyu pinyin. I was, as I soon found out, correct, so I suggested the move. I only knew this because I had a single semester of <i>putonghua</i> in college (so I'm not an expert on the language, either). I <i>cannot</i>, however, claim any real amount of knowledge of Chinese history or her military. I'm guessing that most people who contribute to Wiki and read the VfD page don't, either, and so I don't want it on my head if an article disappears simply because I don't know a thing about it. I leave that for the Chinese historians to debate and either improve the article as it stands now or make it a disambig (since apparently it has several meanings). --<a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemiller226_eedc.html" title="User:Jemiller226">Jemiller226</a> 05:22, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support the idea of renaming the article. Unlike how other cultures interpretation about generals, the term were use by chinese in the past more like a collective term for any commanding personal in the military than simpily generals. The term should be seperated to let us identify there is a significant difference between how different cultures defined the role of the generals. --User:wuzika12 011:33, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> The article now is factually incorrect, as there has never been a military class in China - except in periods of foreign rule, in which case the upper-ranking marshalls - but not the officers - are restricted to that race. -<a href="../../../h/m/i/User%7EHmib_4096.html" title="User:Hmib">Hmib</a> 01:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you guys see where this is leading to? The article might as well be a subsection of "Military history of China". It shouldn't exist as a separate article because "chiangchun" or "jiangjun" are not recognized at all. Let me give you an example of an earlier edit someone made to the article <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guan_Yu_6fe0.html" title="Guan Yu">Guan Yu</a>: <b>Guan Yu</b> was a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiangchun.html" title="Chiangchun">chiangchun</a> (general) under the... Don't you think that it sounds awkward, too? Furthermore, it'd be ridiculous if every Chinese term should have its own article, just because the Chinese perhaps view the subject a little differently from the rest of the world. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 13:27, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mate, that's the same as saying the Chinese chess equivalent of the King in the International Chess is "jiangjun". Should we then start a "Ju" article, which is the equivalent of the Castle, or a "Ma" article, the counterpart of the Knight, and so forth? Anyway, when used as a verb, "jiangjun" could mean either "check" or "checkmate".

<li>This is an <b>obvious delete</b>, for the following reasons. <b>1.</b>The page was created by the authors of the blog. Creating articles about one's self or one's works is frowned upon on Wikipedia because it (a) makes it likely that the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> will not be adhered to (as is apparent in this case), and (b) makes it more likely that the precepts of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> will be ignored (as is also apparent in this case). See also <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <b>2.</b> The subject of the article is not "notable." For an article to have a rightful place in Wikipedia, it must be of sufficient significance and importance to merit mention in an encyclopedia. There are more than 15 million blogs in existence <a href="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/08/34.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, the vast majority of which do not meet most reasonable people's idea of notability. "Notability" can sometimes be difficult to determine, but there are usually less problems when the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">no original research</a> policies are understood and applied; they weren't in this case. <b>To the new users who created the article page on their blog</b>: welcome to Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is just a rehash of the debate just finished.

The article was kept, but many wanted to break it up into smaller articles. This article was a section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a>, and was recently split off into a separate article, as were many other sections. If it gets deleted it will just be returned as a section of the original article. We might as well keep the smaller lists, but in the greater scheme of things, it doesn't matter, the information will end up somewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Slightly more NPOV than List of Catholic Criminals, but still a list that is non-encyclopedic and would take forever to compile all actors and actresses who are Catholic (that list is big, but by no means is it complete, I'm sure.) <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 16:22, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not even close to completion, it would be impossible, there are alot of Catholics, and alot of actors and actresses. In countries like France and Italy, almost everyone is Catholic, so in theory over 90 percent of their actors and actresses should be on this list, 25 percent of American actors and actresses, and many from the many other largely Catholic places in the world.

<li>We may need to set some guidelines on the validity of lists of people existing on Wikipedia, because it appears that some just don't like them, period. In addition to all the actor-related lists you listed, there are dozens of Catholic lists, Jewish lists, Muslim lists, and on and on. Should we VfD each in turn? It seems to be the trend. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 17:18, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have wanted to say, “delete” for the past few days, but I have changed my mind. I wanted to see the value of such a list. What value could it have?
<ul>
<li><i><b>VALUE</b></i>: Let's say you are an 11-year-old school child and wanted to write a paper for class of prominent Catholic entertainers, or are a reporter for the Bumpkintown News and wanted to write an article about prominent Jewish physicists. You might want to include a list, and/or work off of one to create your assignment.</li>
<li><i><b>MORE VALUE</b></i>: I would like to see the list have even more value by placing more information into the list. Instead of just a list of names, it would be move valuable if it contained useful information. I would like to see notes added in parentheses after a name entry: “(practicing)”; “(born into Catholic family)”; “(served as alter boy)”; “(converted at age 69)”; “(non-practicing)”; etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for the list becoming long: that is for the people who contribute to it regularly to worry about. They can start filtering by prominence later, as they see fit. You don’t need every Sean, Carlos, and Mario on the list, if the list gets to big, you can make it prominent actors.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> we can have infinite lists of 'people who are in category X, who are also in category Y' (e.g. 'List of blue-eyes sportsmen<i>). Unless the two categories are likely to impinge on each other (e.g. 'Catholic philosophers', 'Afro-American politicians') or we are dealing with a minority cross-sections, which have otherwise become notable in debates (e.g. 'List of American actors who were professing communists'), I would always say delete --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:45, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</i></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> To Doc's point, I think we can legitimately establish that a list identifying some remarkable condition (i.e. being from Quebec) warrants a presence, if only to satisfy the lust of listmongers. In this case, however, Catholic seems too universal a category to be of much interest or value.

<li>1.Having read the "delete answers", I've come to a unanimous (hehheh..) conclusion: the list <b>must be kept</b>. Arguments for deletion go something like this: <i>yeah, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html" title="List of Muslims">List of Muslims</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html" title="List of Buddhists">List of Buddhists</a>, .., too.</i>. It won't happen. These list will not be deleted. So- <b>either all or not a single one</b>. Since the former option is out of question- the RCC list must stay (albet radically modified in not a few features). Since I was the one who has been, initially, the most suspicious about the RCC list, I can ask with some authority: why is this list here at all&#160;? <b>Not accompanied by other fellow lists</b>&#160;?

<li><b>Keep.</b> (AGAIN-AS I ALREADY VOTED, BUT WANT TO ADD SOMETHING)-Skysmith--do you mean fanatics like Mel Gibson; trampy hypocrites like Loretta Young and Grace Kelly; IRA supporters like Morrissey, Mickey Rourke, Eddie Dowling; nuns like Dolores Hart (and formerly June Haver); Peter Boyle, a former Irish Christian Brother; horrible/sadistic/reactionary folks like Bing Crosby, Arthur Godfrey, Pat O'Brien; converts like Jane Wyman, the Barrymores (child converts), Sir Alec Guinness; et al--the list is fascinating and should be kept. Why is Zoe allowed to reopen a previously closed subject, particularly AFTER some of us have spent a lot of time, energy and money to update (the list was already in existence before I ever edited, added or deleted anything) this list. Yes, in theory, it could go on forever, but nobody is going to put down unknown, minor or cameo actors from predominantly Catholic foreign countries, and if someone were stupid enough to do that, those entries could be culled from the list by any editor or member of the Wikipedia community paying attention, as someone always is, as I have learned. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.100.55.13.html" title="User:67.100.55.13">67.100.55.13</a> 18:11, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>First, I think this comment is at least bit out of line. Second, most of those people are not famous for their religion but for their other endeavors. Based on this comment, you plan to fill the list with inappropriate POV commentary about them and that would constitute vandalism.

<p>I think on a page like this POV is not only OK, but essential to the decision of whether or not to keep the list, on which I have spent a lot of time and money and thus have an investment. I don't think I was out of line, but I apologize to anyone who was offended. I used the above examples as examples of how interesting the list can be with surprises and personal details and yes, exposing the hypocrisies and false images of people in the public eye who may not be what they pretend to be, and the Catholic church is a great place to start--it lends itself more to that aspect than say, Methodism or Presbyterianism--given its history of censorship and condemnation. And I don't plan to include POV about them, as it would most likely be removed anyway and would get me blocked, but I think given the subject matter some POV is inevitable, as opposed to other areas (science, technology, mathematics, geography, astronomy, etc.) where POV is wholly unnecessary and should be punished.</p>

<dd>Again- the discussion on the validity of this list is completely out of touch with reality. We got actors who are Lutherans, born-again Christians,..(they're incorporated in denominations' lists, for instance: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Lutherans_0d51.html" title="List of Lutherans">List_of_Lutherans</a>, List_of_born-again_Christian_laypeople,<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latter-day_Saints_df82.html#Actors" title="List of Latter-day Saints">List_of_Latter-day_Saints#Actors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buddhists_09ab.html#Celebrity_Buddhists" title="List of Buddhists">List_of_Buddhists#Celebrity_Buddhists</a>,...). This is a list of people who are nominally Catholics (as is the case with Lutherans or Mormons/LDS people). As I see it, we got here double standards.

Why is it OK to have lists of Lutherans, Mormons, Jews, Buddhists, Christian laypeople, et al and NOT Catholics?? I think Mir Haven destroyed his own talking points with illogic. WikiDon and NoSeptember, who seem to be the "leaders of the pack" (if you will) have it right. And again, why was Zoe pemitted to reopen this debate which was fairly settled and finalized--isn't that kind of sabotage and willful disregard for the norms of the debate and a respectful acceptance of the will of the majority (why usually goes AGAINST me, by the way) a violation of Wikipedia Netiquette?? If Zoe is an editor then she should be penalized for causing this kind of dissension and turmoil. By the way, Skysmith, why would I care what religion you are?? I am Jewish if you want to know. I look forward to everyone's responses, once again, in this infernal, endless, pointless waste of time, debate, which as far as I am concerned was already settled once.

Why was Zoe allowed to reopen this debate and threaten all the time, money, work, effort that I have spent on this project, which for whatever reason, it doesn't matter why, is interesting and is something I look forward to. I also contibute to the Jewish show business figures page, but admittedly, not as much. NoSeptember promised that the lists would remain, albeit configured differently.

<p>I know I'm going to be unpopular with the trekies. Now, I conceed that Star wars is very notable (OK), and a page on the history of Starwars might be notable (OK?), and a page on a starwars fan-website might (just) be motale, and a message board from that website might be worth a passing mention in that article (possibly?), but a dedicated page with a detailed history of a message board of a website of a movie - is cruft.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I do not see why an article on this message board's history should be kept under any circumstances. It is simply unencyclopedic. Wikipedia is not a place to record the daily goings on of message boards-it takes an extraordinary interpretation of what an encyclopedia is to permit that. It fails Jimbo's verifiability test: if something was truly notable (and of such notability to be considered for inclusion in an encyclopedia) it would be the subject of independent study and/or reporting. Are there serious works on this message board (or <i>any</i> message board, really)? Has it been reported in the press for something significant? Are there sociologists or other scholars who study the board? Are there reputable secondary sources that one can use to write about the board? I mean, come on. This is an encyclopedia, and that's an internet message board. One's not going to be in the other. There is only one type of article that I can see having a rightful place in Wikipedia on the subject of message boards, and that is an article looking at message boards and how they are shaping or contributing to public discourse or forms of communication in developed economies. Not this.-<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 11:32:43, 2005-08-11 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Quietmind I ask that those who are wanting the page to be deleted be aware that the current "article" on the page was not the right way to go for it. In addition to it being a problem in itself (it was lifted from another JC member's site, possibly without permission), as it was never meant to be used like this, it also lends itself to the sort of joke entries that have already been made. Unfortunately, the problems you see and are using as reasons for deletion stem partly from the very popularity that makes the JC as big of a board as it is. If I had my way, I would prefer to approach the JC and its history from a completely sociological and scientific lens. I'm interested in the sociology and psychology of internet message boards, and the JC has been truly remarkable in both areas. Instead of what has been used so far, I ask that you simply delete the "timeline" part of the article (which is what's so long, and causing other problems) and allow others to build the page back up in ways that will be of interest to anyone who wanders by, not just JC members or Star Wars fans. Unfortunately, a few people have taken a completely wrong (if well meaning) approach, and the result is an understandable desire to delete the page. As could be expected, a number of people have (or wanted to) added their relatively pointless entries ("Flarestorm trolls wikipedia", etc.). I ask that you not let this deter people who are actually interested in writing something that's up to wikipedia standards. The JC is a message board with a rich history, one that can be used to speak to both web life and real life. That is why I argue for it to be kept, and why I request that those who want it to be deleted reconsider their positions. Were you in our shoes, I think you would feel likewise. If you were able to see what a few of our members could do, I think you would agree that it would be a fine addition to Wikipedia.
<ul>
<li>You don't have to ask us to delete the timeline. This is a wiki, and you are a Wikipedia editor. <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">Be bold</a>! If you can improve the article to address the concerns of the editors who are in favour of its deletion, then you are encouraged to <i>please do so right away</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:30:59, 2005-08-11 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see how anyone outside of the forum itself (or even inside for that matter) can care on what date Larry Fett or Darth Friedman was promoted to moderator. This belongs on their website, not this one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:15, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not true. That's part of what I tried to say above. The problem lies not in the page itself, but in the approach taken in it. The timeline should be cut entirely. Just remove that and let a few capable people write something that other people *would* care about. You are basing your judgment on something that should not be there in the first place. Please observe the <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantArt_94f5.html" title="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> wikipedia page. That has been allowed to remain, and rightly so.
<ul>
<li>In writing about things that "other people <i>would</i> care about", I strongly recommend <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">citing sources</a>, such as (for example) news media coverage. Cited sources will lead you to things that people <i>have</i> cared about. Please be aware of our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy and the fact that an encyclopaedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:30:59, 2005-08-11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I ask how many of the other websites or forums that have wikipedia entries have been the subject of extensive media coverage? How many have merited independent academic study outside of wikipedia or other methods of online chronicalling? I can't recall seeing many books on IGN or DeviantArt at my library. Let's at least be consistent here. Dark Lady Mara</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li><b>Delete</b>, just another fan forum and thus not a notable webpage. All the timeline removal in the universe will not alter that fact. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 17:45, August 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you think it's "just another fan forum" and therefore not significant, I recommend you delete your entire section about internet forums for consistency's sake. Why are those other boards more "notable" than this one? Also, I do know as a fact that the JC has spawned ideas which influenced fandom and pop culture. Do you remember the cover of Mad magazine once featuring a fake Sith lord with an upside-down yellow lightsaber? That was a joke first invented on the JC which later spread around the fandom! Dark Lady Mara
<ul>
<li>1) Being ripped off by MAD Magazine (and no, I don't remember the cover in question because I haven't read MAD Magazine since it started sucking, which was a while ago indeed) does not notability make. 2) I wouldn't terribly mind seeing some of the other forums we have here go either, but I don't care enough to go out and hunt them down and especially not to just satisfy a bunch of fanboys that their little slice of the Internet is somehow special. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 06:52, August 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Comments only, no Vote</i>: I think that the present contents of the article do not qualify for a page in wikipedia and the contents of the article is not encyclopedic; otherwise “Panicker”, also spelt in slightly different styles, is a notable <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surname.html" title="Surname">surname</a> / <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_name.html" title="Family name">family name</a> of several persons of <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> - just by way of an example: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/panickerism/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/panickerism/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>which claims that “Panicker” is a surname bestowed upon the family by the Kings for exemplary services to the nation.

<li>Thanks for your understanding. Please note, though, that Wikipedia does not accept unverifiable material. This means that, since this subject doesn't show up on Google at all, you'll have to provide references of some kind (newspaper, book, or periodical mentions, for example) for the article to be kept, no matter how detailed, extensive, or well-written it is. Remember, above all, that deletion isn't anything personal against you or the article subject. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:22, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Male clothes are often better equipped with pockets</i> is just one of the BJAODN-worthy "highlights" this page has to offer. The ingenial authors of this piece have made a list of stereotypes about men and women, and have not even shied away from grouping the resulting ugly list into 'gender gaps favoring men' and 'gender gaps favoring women'. (Needless to say, we all know Wikipedia - the "gaps favoring women"-list is of course twice as long as that of gaps favoring men.)

<p>fourth edit:</p>
<p>I just finished talking to him and he told me to get it off the net ASAP, and that he didn't want to be known for his affiliation to socTH. Please delete this.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am the author of the article; I don't think this should be deleted, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>(1) I am not Alex Wice, which already says alot.</p>
<p>(2) People in the community want to know who he is.</p>
<p>(3) He is easily one of the top 5 people that has contributed to the field, and IMO in the top 2.</p>
<p>(4) People may be unaware that he has written x,y,z articles (the articles that he has written, not literally "x" article, duh) or cannot match his psuedonym to his real life name.</p>
<p>(5) He has very strong, 'professional' (as in, related by work) to notable people, such as "Mystery" (Erik von Markovik), and "TylerDurden" (Owen Cook). To give you a sense of how they are notable, "Mystery" claims that he is the best pickup artist in the world, and backs up this claim with open challenges as well as thousands of testimonials that validate that he is infact the best seduction teacher on the planet. That means that this person is #1 at something, by affiliation the person that is close with someone who is #1 is also notable (not in whole because of their closeness, but in part.)</p>
<p>In response to "Collabi"'s vote for deletion&#160;: if you read the page, I provide a note which explains how internet-research is just as notable as "real" research (research affiliated with a university.) The reason is that there are alot of nonstandard ideas that are logically valid but are discarded in a 'professional' setting, and also that people that work in this field really need to have a different set of beliefs (an 'open mind'&#160;?) that lets them explore.</p>
<p>In response to "Dbiv"'s vote for deletion&#160;: if you look at the entry "Macky" in wikipedia, you will see that this is a biography of someone born in 1990, who is notable. The age doesn't matter.</p>

<p>second edit:</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">Wikipedia:Importance</a>;</p>
<pre>
  1. there is clear proof that a reasonable number of people (eg. more than 500 people worldwide) are 
     or were concurrently interested in the subject.
</pre>
<p>you only have to use google for 'pickup' or goto bristollair.com to see how many people are interested in pickup articles; then it is quite easy to find his handle (psuedonym), which by then you will figure out that many people have read his articles, which is evidenced by the hit counter at the bottom of the page in just one of the many places that hold copies of his writing.</p>
<p>so stop saying "nn" : easily more than 1000 people has read some form of his work and many are interested to find more about his work, and possibly in the future where they can find his work / more of his work.</p>
<p>another thing is that his presence in the dictionary may provoke him to come out of hiding and start writing for the general public again.</p>
<p>ps. for the record this is still the same vote even though my signature appears above this.</p>

<li>The most difficult VfD I've seen so far; I have respect for what Taku is saying here. The rules first: WP cannot have two articles on the same subject under different titles, that's not an option. So a decision has to be made in either choosing one of the current titles, or choosing a third that is agreeable to all concerned. The last option will intuitively sound the fairest; it is also never going to happen. So choose one, we must. Now, an article on this subject need not be intrinsically POV. It can document in the most rigorous terms the different POVs, and this one (the V-J article) <i>does</i> (it goes to great lengths to tell us what the day is called in Japan, etc). If everything in the article is meticulously NPOV, then all that remains a point of contention is the title itself. But we can view the title as merely a <i>marker</i>: a marker for interested readers to find a story on the subject. What ought to be important to us is <i>making sure that our story is fair</i>: the title is merely a <i>link</i> to get to the story. Therefore, choose the title most people are familiar with. On the English Wikipedia, that title is V-J day. <strike><b>Delete</b>.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 14:16:30, 2005-08-11 (UTC) NB.

<li><b>Keep and do one of the following</b>. (1) If we don't have a well-considered article on the surrender debates in the Japanese government, then this would be a good name for it -- PBS recently did a good job on the subject, so we should be able to do at least a stub. A disambuguation paragraph can then point to V-J day for anyone who is looking for that topic under this title. (2) If such an article exists, then this article can become an extended disambiguation page, pointing to V-J day, the surrender debate article, and the relevant sections of the articles on the atomic bombing. (3) If all of these exist, then this can be a redirect. There doesn't seem to be much to merge that is not already at <a href="../../../v/-/j/V-J_Day_ccef.html" title="V-J Day">V-J Day</a>, but this can be looked into by whomever does the fix-up. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A West</a> 14:40, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Interesting that you say that, Chris. There are 9 votes on this page. 3 votes are for <b>keeping</b> the page, (apparently) as it stands. None of the three who voted this way said a word to explain why they think as they do (this is not necessarily a bad thing). 6 others have voted for a change - all 6 believe that the page should not remain as it does. Most think that the page should become a redirect after it's contents are either merged or deleted outright; Robert suggests other things that may be done with the article space. In each case these editors explained why they think what they think. Perhaps reading their comments may answer your question as to their rationale, and explaining your own view would help us understand why you think the page should be kept (apparently as is).—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 17:20:10, 2005-08-11 (UTC)

<li>A number of people seem to have a rationale for merging; I disagree with this merge because V-J Day and the surrender of Japan are two separate things. e.g., descriptions of the annual celebration of the event belong on <a href="../../../v/-/j/V-J_Day_ccef.html" title="V-J Day">V-J Day</a>, and descriptions of the surrender process (which of course covered more than one day) on the Surrender page. If the pages were to be merged, this seems to be transparently the better title, as it makes sense everywhere and addresses the entire topic. It remains unclear why this is on votes for deletion and not being discussed as a merge. The nominator provided no basis for deletion, and Raul's comment directs us to the talk page, which this article appears not to have. Again, what's the problem -- unencyclopedic, POV, etc. -- that's prompting the deletion of this article? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 20:18, 2005 August 11 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and/or delete</b>. As I said on the talk page, there is no rational basis for having this article. Taku created it because he's currently in an edit war with just about everyone on <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">Operation Downfall</a>. His logic is surreal - Taku claims that because the Japanse Wikipeida doesn't talk about the reasons why Japan surrendered, neither should we.

<p><br />
<b>CHRIS</b>: The editors who vote on the VfD page are charged with a simple task: to determine whether the article in question satisfies criteria for deletion from Wikipedia. The question before us is unambiguous: does the article now lying at <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrender_of_Japan_510b.html" title="Surrender of Japan">Surrender of Japan</a> deserve deletion? The first thing to do is to look at that article. It has four sentences. It states that the Emperor announced Japan's surrender to the Allied forces on Aug 14 1945, that that day is known as Victory day in the US but <i>Shusen-kinenbi</i> in Japan, and that it is generally considered to mark the end of WWII. That's it. There's nothing else there.</p>
<p>Now, the reason this article is before us is clear. There is another article, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_over_Japan_Day_efb2.html" title="Victory over Japan Day">VJ day</a>, which relates precisely the same events, and which has been around for two years. There is a WP policy that you <i><b>cannot have two articles on the same thing</b></i>. Since the content of SOJ was so similar to the corresponding, relevant portion of VJD the question essentially boiled down to: which title page should this article come under? I explained in my first post how I answered that question. My opinion is that the article at SOJ should be removed. Other editors have said that the content of SOJ should be removed and "merged" into VJD — that is fine too, the reason I didn't suggest that myself is that I read both articles, and it seems to me there is essentially nothing in SOJ that is not already in VJD.</p>
<p>Now, you and the anon have suggested that the article be kept, and that a future article detailing the whole surrender process can go to that page. I find nothing objectionable in the least about writing an article under that title that would narrate all those issues that you point out — sounds to me like a splendid idea. <i>But that is not our charge</i>. We are asked to decide what to do with the article sitting very publicly on that page right now. (There is a reason why articles that are VfDed are "frozen" - that is the version we are judging, not something in the past or the future.)</p>
<p>Would I object if the SOJ page was blanked and a new version such as what you speak of was put up? No, of course not. I'd want to see a good article like that up sometime. However, I cannot be asked to respond affirmatively to, "Well, why don't you keep this article that violates policy, because in five months we'll have a different article here." This is similar to "In five months I'll be bigger than the Stones, dude, so keep the currently non-notable article on my garage band." —<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 22:55:59, 2005-08-11 (UTC)</p>

<li>Chris, this is really taking up quite a bit of time, isn't it? I'm afraid I can't explain my position any better than I already have. While I am unable to understand why it is that you respond as if you haven't read what I wrote (and this has happened twice), and am moderately amused that you're telling me stuff about SOJ that I already know and have agreed with, I'm perfectly happy to leave this as it is. This is a VfD, and outcomes are best when editors who understand policy evaluate each matter disinterestedly. We've all said our piece: great. May the closer decide what's best. I'd urge anyone voting here to 1. Read both the SOJ and VJD articles, 2. Read the posts here 3. If they haven't lately, read <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>, and 4. Vote!

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. The article and Victory over Japan Day are about different topics. One is about a day; the other is about an ongoing process. The article can take into account lots of events that led to the surrender of Japan, such as the outcome of the Battle of Okinawa; the Potsdam Declaration; Russian preparations for invasion of Manchuria; continued bombing of Japan; internal conditions such as evacuation, mobilization, food supply; internal political discord ... there is enormous potential for gathering in one place the factors that led to Japan's surrender. None of this belongs in Victory over Japan Day. This situation has important differences from the analogy to a band (as Encephalon asserted): the article does not violate policy; the event is already proven noteworthy and encyclopedic; the possibility of growth is in the article rather than the subject. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 00:23, August 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>make it pretty unambiguous that the article we have now is referring to the day, if not the hour, japan agreed to accept surrender. we can keep and list it as a page needing expansion, but the natural direction to expand in is likely to just result in more content redundant with what's at V-J Day. if expansion is desirable, then i think we need more variegated content than we have now, or at least a very clear request for such on its talk page. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 04:48, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Final Comment</b>. From reading some of the above, it doesn't look like it has been grasped. I think the basic facts here can be summarized as follows:</dd>
<dd>There have been <b>13 votes</b>. Of these, 2 votes are for simply "keeping" the article (ie. keeping the article <i>as is</i>). The other <b>11 voters</b> want some sort of change to the status quo. The disagreement appears to be with <i>what form</i> the change should be. <b>6 voters</b> want the content of the article at the SOJ page removed and merged into the VJ article, should there be anything to merge. The other <b>5 voters</b> want the article to be kept as is for now; they say that in future it could make a great page for a number of hypothesized possibilities.</dd>
<dd>I have explained why I disagree with that view. The SOJ article is not a marvelous treatise on the series of events surrounding the end of the War. <i>It is a 4 sentence paragraph repeating, almost verbatim, stuff from the 2 year old VJ page</i>. <b>Wiki policy on this is clear</b> - merge (if there is anything to merge), and redirect the page. Since this is a wiki, there is no harm done to any party with this action: if an industrious editor writes an outstanding article on SOJ in the future, he can always put it up, and he'll have my full support, for sure. But do understand that I will not change my vote to allow a clear policy violation to get through because of a hypothesized future alternative.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>(since, I recently discovered, I <b>still</b> have too few edits to be acceptable to the</i> <b>Cabal</b> <i>to be accounted a responsible voter)</i>&#160;:: IMHO 'V-J Day' is an extremely POV title, and panders to the triumphalist Brit-o-centric mentality which I thought was supposed to be being eradicated. On the other hand, an article on why one country decided to end a war by surrender, rather than continue to a futile defeat, seems an eminently valuable piece of original exegesis. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 11:29, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While the page is currently mininmal, there is a great room for expansion.

<li><b>Excellent work, Fg2</b>. I believe most editors vote out of a concern for policy, and desire to see WP filled with as many good, strong articles and as few poorly written, sorry excuses. Our differences arise mainly with what to do in the interval; whether we're willing to tolerate a poor article/policy violation remaining on WP in hopes it will eventually improve, or not. Editors who vote to "include" have valid reasons for choosing as they do; I think the most valuable among them are those who actually put their keyboards where their mouths are and work to improve the page. As it now stands, the SOJ article is a decent <i>precis</i> of some of the main events surrounding the Surrender, is clearly distinct from VJday (ie. it is not a redundant page), and has good scope for expansion. Editors on VfD judge what is on the page — with Fg2's excellent rewrite, I see no reason for this page to be "kept-but-merged/blanked/made-to-redirect," and remove my earlier vote for such. I now vote simply to <b>keep</b> (and hope the involved editors can find a way to settle their differences and <b>expand</b>). To Fg2, keep up the good work.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 13:50:10, 2005-08-13 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. V-Day is about a specific day. Surrender of Japan covers a longer time period, it should have details on which events led up to the surrender, which I think is much more encyclopedic and interesting content than the fact that this day is actually still called victory-day in the US (enough criticism on this mentality was already posted here), and that it is still celebrated. If one of the two article seems redundant, by all means keep "surrender" and <i>delete V-Day</i>. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 12:24, 13 August 2005 (UTC) A no-merge vote is a good choice now.

<li><b>Comment</b> Incidentally, it perhaps bears mention that there was no reason for any editor who wanted this page to be kept to fear deletion — no one here (with the possible exception of one editor) voted for the page to be deleted. People were voting to merge-redirect, keep-expand, keep-as is —all of which imply keep. (The closer of this VfD has the simplest of tasks ahead of him/her.) The debate we're having here is essentially one that could (should?) have taken place on the Talk page of the article, because all the actions involved may be performed by any one of us. VfDs like this one are symptomatic: it's actually being used as a dispute-resolution process. I am not sure why the person who brought this VfD did so, since when I checked the history, it looks like the person who brought it himself does not believe the page should be deleted.

I agree that the circumstances surrounding the surrender of Japan in World War II should be better explored; a good aspect would be the attempted coup by members of the Japanese military prior to Emperor Hirohito's broadcast (I think I'm gonna work on that as well&#160;:)). The article on V-J Day is just a commemoration of the <i>actual</i> day of surrender. This promises to be a good "killer" article, although a better, more precise title may be in order.<a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERashBold_0410.html" title="User:RashBold">RashBold</a> 21:29, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has obviously been substantially expanded since the start of this voting process. It looks to me now to be a robust piece of work worthy of keeping in it's own right, particularly given the current topicality re the Hiroshima / Nagasaski bombings and the renewal of historical debate regarding the reasons for the Japanese surrender - i.e atomic bombings / role of USSR etc. The comaprison to the VJ Day article, and calls to merge with that seem, to me, to be patently wrong. -- <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECactus.man_4fe2.html" title="User:Cactus.man">Cactus.man</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cactus.man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cactus.man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Reply</a> 11:38, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As a native speaker of Swedish and being a fluent English speaker since the age of 10, I can confirm this.

<li>I don't see why English terms should take precedence over others (if those are encyclopedic/notable).

<li>It's an <i>English language</i> encyclopedia. It might have global appeal, but it's still written in English and including slang notable only in languages other than English is going, far past any reasonble interpretation of our inclusion policies. It's one thing to include persons, ideas, events and places not notable or even completely unknown in English-speaking countries, but slang terms... That's just taking it too far. Whatever happened to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a slang and idiom guide</a>? / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 22:03, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>That argument is inconsistent. If that is your opinion, why don't you put <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraut.html" title="Kraut">Kraut</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/i/Gringo.html" title="Gringo">Gringo</a> for deltion, or <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gottfried_Piefke_a141.html" title="Johann Gottfried Piefke">Johann Gottfried Piefke</a>, who is really only notable because of the slang term?

<ul>
<li>It's realistic, if anything. I'm seriously unamused by the though of keeping every imaginable slang in term notable only in every imaginable language besides English. I think it lowers the general credibility and standards of Wikipedia and encourages additions of other articles on idioms known only to non-English speakers which are difficult to verify and is very hard to put some decent limit on. <i>A lot</i> of slang in most languages is extremely notable and there's always information to add about which of social or ethnic groups that use it, <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymology</a>, differing pronunciation, etc. etc. It's very easy to claim that nearly any common slang term should be included. <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraut.html" title="Kraut">Kraut</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Gringo.html" title="Gringo">gringo</a>, just like <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a>, are veritable institutions of the English language, and keeping such extremely notable English-language terms (even if I would <i>prefer</i> not to have them) feels like a very reasonable compromise to me; extending this reasoning to <i>other languages</i> does not. And <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gottfried_Piefke_a141.html" title="Johann Gottfried Piefke">Pfieke</a> is a poor example in this context since he is a person who has done other things besides become famous for being associated with an idiom and... well... he's a person, not a slang term. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 10:54, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having thought about this a bit, I have decided to vote <b>weak keep</b>, as this and "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blatte.html" title="Blatte">blatte</a>" both are slang terms used frequently in modern Swedish society, and can probably be linked from articles on Swedish youth culture and immigration issues.

I'm not adverse to revisiting the issue if the articles haven't shown signs of growth in six or twelve months. I have asked <a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsaddik_Dervish_c96b.html" title="User:Tsaddik Dervish">User:Tsaddik Dervish</a>, who writes articles on <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_hip_hop.html" title="Swedish hip hop">Swedish hip hop</a>, to look at the articles. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 06:33, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Article growth isn't the issue here. Even unencyclopedic articles can grow exponentially in notime. Just look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_phrases_in_various_languages.html" title="List of common phrases in various languages">list of common phrases in various languages</a>.

<li>I still think small discussions, like this one, are useful. I'd say people have a right to have their opinions and votes, no matter their logical correctness... in fact , using the argument "I like waffles" would be just as valid as anything for voting... Otherwise, the List of similarities between Canada and New Zealand would surely have been deleted by now... --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_chessplayer_5059.html" title="User:Fred chessplayer">Fred</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_chessplayer_69d7.html" title="User talk:Fred chessplayer">Chess</a> 08:32, August 20, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If neither logic nor reason are expected nor asked for in these discussions, we might as well not have the discussions at all and just have unmotivated, silent (hell, even secret) votes. Demanding <i>respect</i> (not acceptance) for making non sequitur argumentation is only going to further polarize the inclusionist/deletionist discourse and keep fueling bitter disputes among Wikipedians. At the very least admit that it's about a form of opinion-pushing, not a product of well-balanaced reasoning. Anyone who claims that your above example is a healthy sign of quality improvement should think it over.

<p>Blatant promotion. He is a lawyer in Dallas, and did take part in the case stated, but he inflates its importance. The remainder is trivial. I tried to edit to significant only, but he keeps reverting the page. In the end he's just another lawyer with a high opinion of himself, so instead of an edit war I decided to vfd <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutlanderssc_453d.html" title="User:Outlanderssc">Outlander</a> 15:39, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not true. I am not Michael Kevin Hurst, but Outlander apparently bears a grudge against the guy. The remainder is not trivial, per Wikipedia's guidelines. In the end Outlander is just another random troll on the internet (or an arrogant person who lives in his own world) who gets his only joy in life by deleting the content that others work hard to create.

<li>Yes... moving on from that surreal encounter. I'll happily change my vote when I see any <i><b>evidence</b></i> of this notability.

<li>As to the "customer experiance"
<ul>
<li>It's submitted <i>by the company</i> to IBM,</li>
<li>It's a requirement to become an "Advanced Partner", and</li>
<li>The footnote on the page indicates <i>"It is simply verification that your application is installed at a customer site running on strategic IBM technologies."</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mere <i>presence</i> of a quote submitted <i>by the company</i> to IBM means what again?</li>
<li>Ahhh... I see the quote. One line in an on-line magazine. Hmmm.</li>

<li>Aaron, you've moved the goalposts. You ask for media mentions, I give them. You ask for evidence that they're an IBM business partner, I give you that. Then you misrepresent <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_World_cf5b.html" title="Computer World">Computer World</a> as "an online magazine", you misread the criteria for advanced membership, and you wave away the masses of direct recommendations of the company's product on IBM's own website as "Google-scratchings". And then, faced with evidence that this is a company whose product is directly endorsed by the number one player in business intelligence and mid-range computing, IBM, you have the nerve to ask for evidence of '<i>notability</i>! --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:40, 12 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ummm. No. Not at all. I asked for <b>news media</b> mentions. I stated <i>I</i> did not find them on IBM's website. You did, a tribute to your persistance. The "bar" to advanced membership involves operating IBM "middleware" at one of your client's sites. Which almost always involves the client <i>buying something from IBM</i>. That's <i><b>why</b></i> they make people partner's - to sell IBM profucts and services while basking in the reflceted glory. I fail to see <i>masses</i> of direct recomendations... in fact I fail to see even one. What I <i>do</i> see is quite a lot of company-cruft, originated <i>by</i> the company in question <i>on</i> IBM's website. And if you have evidence that the one-line quote in Computer World appeared in print you have failed to present it. Why don't you (and I) get off this VfD and let the people think for themselves? Is that really too much to ask? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 07:00, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Would not delete. I am sure that I know Dr.Harvey. Much of his BBC World Service work has been in Moscow even though I myself did try to find things on him in Google and found only ONE entry confirming a doctor of late 20s (probably suggesting the date) in philology (if you can call that linguistics). Whether him or not, I listen frequently to Radio 4 in England and can say that I do know who this man is. He appeared in Episode 8 of the Roots of English transmitted in early 2000: my daughter has been using the tapes of this show for a college project and she borrowed these recordings from the local library.

<p>This article is a mixture of translation and description of an uncited primary source: the war diary of a man identified only as Corporal Nakamura. I have been unable to trace the source document through Google, the British Library or Nielsen Bibliographic Data. The first draft of the article was in broken English, from which subsequent editors have guessed the intent, but the accuracy of the present version of the translations cannot be verified without the source. It has been suggested that this should be transwikied to Wikisource but the work is inappropriate for that project because it is not simply a transcript of a source. So, as matters stand, the article is not quite encyclopedic, not quite a source and not quite original research. Perhaps it would have a home somewhere at Wikicities. I am convinced, however, that it has no place here. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 16:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Overlong bio of a guy who ran in the Republican primary for a seat in Congress, losing badly. He also was on some town board or something somewhere, but it's hardly noteworthy. Members of Congress are notable, but random people who make poor attempts to reach that office are a dime a dozen. I'd say your average grade school teacher has a greater impact on the world. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:05, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Strong keep. I think that NPOV articles about minor politicians are fine.

<ul>
<li>What ad hominem attack? I'm perfectly serious when I say a grade school teacher has a greater impact on the world than a guy who kind of ran for a pretty high office, or a member of the board of trustees for a township. Teachers directly impact thousands of people, often pretty substantially, over the course of their careers. Town board members maybe cast a vote on whether to raise the sales tax a quarter percent and such. Most people can't name a single one, but I bet everyone remembers who their fourth grade teacher is. That's my point. If he actaully got the nomination we <i>might</i> have something, but he didn't even come close. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:38, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ten minutes of actually reading some of the 62,000+ Google hits results in learning that Ethel ('60) was the only hurricane to make originall landfall in the region between MS and the FL panhandle, that it is unusual for hurricanes to form in the Gulf of Mexico, that there were only 2 Cat 5 storms that year, and that the name Ethel was not retired as a result of this storm. All of this seems notable enough to mention. The fact that WP is not paper means that we can be expansive on what articles appear, provided that smaller articles are well-linked to more substantive articles that will round out the topic for the casual reader (who is the only person using this resource). --<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMddake_4278.html" title="User:Mddake">Mddake</a> 00:06, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus.</b> The amount of new users here is disturbing, and therefore I cannot close as a delete, despite the overwhelming amount of delete votes. I suggest that this discussion may be reopened later, but it should not become such a circus (caused by both sides) again. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:39, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact that some of Filepile's 8000 members wish to maintain it as a sort of secret club does not justify removing or defacing accurate information about this important online community.
<ul>
<li>The site has been mentioned and discussed numerous times on several Web sites and blogs, including Metafilter (11 times!). Google reports that nearly 7000 pages contain the site's URL (filepile.org). Given that Filepile is well-known and often discussed, there is a wealth of verifiable information about the site.</li>
<li>As well, Wikipedia contains a great many articles on <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_societies.html" title="Secret societies">secret societies</a> -- including the <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> -- information about which one would expect to be difficult to obtain.
<ul>
<li>This "wealth of verifiable information" does not appear in the article, nor are the statistics about how many times a subject has been discussed on Metafilter particularly impressive or encyclopedic. The "secret societies" named have all actually done something that made an impact on the world. If "FilePile" has achieved any notability, it has not been demonstrated here. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:43, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> i created an account at Wikipedia today. yes, thank you, i am feeling right at home. i'd been a bit of a lurker, reading lots of great articles but never felt i really had the time to get involved. i could tell that people put a lot of time and effort into creating compelling and accurate content here. but then today i got an IM from a friend telling me about all of this ridiculous business going on relative to this File Pile stuff. always interested in a good laugh i came to check it out. so i find what appears to be an inaccurate and volatile page dedicated to a website that nobody knows much about. i see alot of accusations of "vandalism" but without any way to verify one way or another, who's to say anything is valid or not? a screenshot is hardly a smoking gun nor a basis for fact. what's the big deal about a site that exchanges pictures, music, and movies amongst members? i could name 15 of those off the top of my head. i suppose i am not a member of File Pile because i have found outlets for what i want at every turn(link) on the internet. please accept my delete vote as my first official contribution to Wikipedia. if i can't be buggered to create new content, i can certainly help by getting rid of the useless stuff. - dexXed

<li>Second Dystopos. Also, though there appear to be sock puppets / very new users voting on this article, that in itself is certainly not a reason to KEEP the page -- at the most, their votes should simply be discounted. Xed, thanks for being vigilant about who's who in this vote, but I will point out that you haven't offered a <i>positive</i> reason for why it should be kept. The real issue is whether this article is appropriate for the Wikipedia -- can you offer an argument for why this <i>particular</i> private, inaccessible, low-membership site deserves inclusion?

<li>Where did this figure of 8000 come from? A <b>lot</b> of discussion on the merits of small census-designated places and GNAA has taken place and they have been kept for various reasons.

The link just goes to the login page. So we can verify it's existence. Also, it looks like he worked on "DropCash" which I *have* actually heard of. Maybe an article about Torrez or DropCash with a mention of FilePile as a private file-trading site is better than keeping an article with little hope having encyclopedic content?

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Ignore every other argument about new users voting, vandalism, personal vendettas, etc. and cut this argument down to what the vote for deletion page says it must be about. The article. In this case, what you have is one description which may or may not be accurate about a closed or perhaps non-existent site. How would anyone check the veracity of the article? At the present time it's of no more value than idle speculation and as such is not going to help anyone understand anything. If the article were re-written to the point where it was filled with "alleged to", "supposedly", "might have", "has been rumored to be", etc. then maybe it would meet what seem to be the quality standards required of Wikipedia. If not, then the article as it stands is of no merit, because there is no way to take what you have in front of you and verify whether it is in fact true or utter nonsense. And furthermore, that situation is not going to change. When I go to FilePile.com I get no site at all and FilePile.org is a login with no new user signup.</li>

Xed, can we possibly avoid having an edit war on the section below? You have had your say above -- I proposed this section as a way to tally which voters had a large number of edits, not as a quick summary of every attack that has been made against every voter. The admin who decides this issue will, I'm sure, read everything that everyone has written, and make their decision based on that. If we are just going to fight over this section as well, I suggest we simply delete it, as it will not help anyone. So instead, can we just keep it NPOV -- that is, just that information on which we can all agree? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover"></a> — <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Conover_8f77.html" title="User talk:Adam Conover">†</a> 16:55, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have deleted the tally. It was doing nothing but causing an edit war, and it didn't actually provide any information that wasn't already available above. (It is also against the VfD process, as it turns out.) I suggest that the annotation of specific users continue in COMMENT format -- so Xed, if you want to say something about a user, you can add a comment below their votes, and if someone else wants to refute it, they can comment below your post. That way no one will be deleting anything, only adding comments. This deletion on my part is not vandalism -- rather, it is an attempt to change the way matters are being conducted on this page to minimise endless reverting and foster real discussion. If you feel any information might have been discarded with the tally, go into the history and find it, then post it above. I think, though, that we'll all be better off without a revert war, right? Let's do this right, guys. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover"></a> — <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Conover_8f77.html" title="User talk:Adam Conover">†</a> 23:42, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reinstated. The only reason people wanted it removed was to remove evidence of their vandalism, to remove mention of their filepile membership, and to obfuscate the vote etc. The tally saves anyone time by letting people see immediately, rather than trawl thru the history. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed">Xed</a> 23:47, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Redeleted. Xed, the problem with the tally is that there is no way to discuss what BELONGS on the tally other than via a revert war. For example, I take exception to your description of one user as a "hoax user", an accusation which you have not explained or justified. However, if I try to alter the tally, you revert it. The tally is, in essence, useless, because we are not going to be able to come to an agreement on it. Therefore, we need to enable ourselves to discuss each charge, and the tally box is preventing that. Once we all agree, we should certainly reinstate the box, but until then we cannot possibly have a stable, undisputed, tally that doesn't cause interminable revert wars. Unless you have no interest in resolving the current untenable state of affairs -- or another suggestion for how we might do so, other than that we all meekly allow you to label users in whatever way you wish -- leave the tally deleted for now. You will still get your say in the comments on votes above. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover"></a> — <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Conover_8f77.html" title="User talk:Adam Conover">†</a> 23:55, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Redeleted again</b>, as it remains clear the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html#Discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia Guide to VfDs</a> <i>specifically</i> says that tables like this should not exist ("Please do not refactor the discussion into lists or tables of votes, however much you may think that this helps the process.").

<li>Thanks Jason -- I read that guideline earlier today, but was in a rush as I made my last edit so I didn't have time to go find it. I fully admit that it was my own mistake suggesting it in the first place -- my goal was to pull the content out of the mess this page has become a little bit, but obviously that effort was misguided, and backfired to boot.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Linwood, I have that concern as well. Still, if you read over the various votes, even if you exclude all the "new users" and half of the rest of the voters Xed wants excluded for whatever reason, it's pretty clear that the voting is heavily lopsided towards Delete. Of course, "consensus" is (as defined by <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>) a huge grey area, and this VfD is obviously grayer than most -- still, I have confidence that a careful admin will be able to sort through this mess without TOO much difficulty, and make a decision that isn't influenced by our or anyone else's bad behavior. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover"></a> — <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Conover_9b4a.html" title="User:Adam Conover">Adam Conover</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Conover_8f77.html" title="User talk:Adam Conover">†</a> 05:32, August 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unsourced, unverifiable. I strongly suspect that this is a hoax. The phrase "Duke of Liempt" generates no Google hits. None.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The stated justification for the deletion nomination is invalid. Users have no right to anonymity on Wikipedia. There is certainly not right to a degree of anonymity greater than the IP address used by the only two contributors to the article so far.</p>
<p>That said, the current article contains essentially no <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> information. Some information mirrors that of the company's website but the article itself cites credibility concerns with the source. The company lists itself as a Florida corporation but shows up on no search of US companies that I can find.</p>
<p>Despite having only one valid "delete" vote, I am going to exercise my judgment on this one and call it as a "delete" for lack of verifiability. This decision is without prejudice against the recreation of a verifiable article on the same topic. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 00:52, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As several commented, this should properly be resolved through <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Redirects for deletion</a>, not VfD.
