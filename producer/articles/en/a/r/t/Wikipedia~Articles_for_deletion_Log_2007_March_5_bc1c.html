<p>(Apparently) autobiographical article that doesn't assert notability of subject until it gets near the end.

<li>See my note below; <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regression_to_the_mean.html" title="Regression to the mean">"regression to the mean"</a> is an even more comprehensive term for this concept. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBaccyak4H_9457.html" title="User:Baccyak4H">Baccyak4H</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/c/User_talk%7EBaccyak4H_c254.html" title="User talk:Baccyak4H">Yak!</a>) 02:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, but nobody <b>uses</b> that term in this context. I don't think there's even a perfect concordance, as the point of "sophomore slump" is generally one of expectations rather than of actual quality. A sourced comment to the effect in the <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophomore_slump.html" title="Sophomore slump">sophomore slump</a> article could be appropriate, but let's not collapse all concepts to their logical endpoints.

<p>This seems like no more than an advertisement to a myspace page. Also the idea behind such an article is implausible, "cool" and "webcast" have their own entries and their sum is no more than the combination of their parts. I would have used "speedy deletion" but this article has already been edited by several and resisted a "prod" (deleted by an anonymous editor). Eldar 00:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article's subject is unverifiable; I can't find any mention of an Anna Shulgin or Shulgina that matches the article's description on Google, outside of Wikipedia mirrors. The article makes some <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7EREDFLAG_c5bc.html" title="WP:REDFLAG">extraordinary claims</a> but provides no substantiating evidence. Even if substantiated, the subject's claim to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a> is somewhat dubious. --<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchness_6152.html" title="User:Muchness">Muchness</a> 02:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although potential <b>merge</b> candidate- does this warrant an article on its own?

<li><s><b>Keep pending cleanup and references</b></s> The gag itself is real and probably verifiable, and the article even has a good snapshot of an actual package with a snappy gum packet. It was also a classic gag staple in cartoons like Tom and Jerry. So I would lean toward keeping the article, but will point out that it will eventually need proper references and some cleanup.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Keyboards do not need to be "manufactured" with a specific keyboard layout in order for that layout to be used. All that is required is that a table in the computer memory or the disk file storing the table be changed, so that the value that is registered when a particular key on the keyboard is pressed is the value that the layout calls for. Given that this layout is designed to be easier for computer programmers to use, it's unlikely that anyone who would be inclined to use the layout would not know how to implement it. See <s><a href="../../../d/v/o/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard_b8ad.html" title="Dvorak Simplified Keyboard">Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard</a></s> <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyboard_layout.html" title="Keyboard layout">keyboard layout</a> for a picture illustrating how people who use specialized keyboard layouts customize their keyboard keys with stickers to help them remember the layout.—<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a> 06:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ditto. I've used Dvorak off and on for years and NEVER considered buying a non-QWERTY keyboard. I dont care what the plastic says because I dont look at the keyboard when I type. Further, alternate layout keyboards are ridiculously expensive and you have almost no choice in the things you care about (extra function keys, clicky-ness, springy-ness, etc). These issues really matter to a person who is dorky enough to even consider an alternate layout, and someone that dorky who cares about the labels on the keys will probably just pop the keys off his favorite keyboard and reorder them. Whether there is a manufactured keyboard of this layout does not suggest notability in my mind. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 16:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Google hits do appear to indicate that this is not "just another layout" and that it is being used. The fact that no keyboards are manufactured doesn't really make sense to me, as i explain above.... - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 16:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - It definitely has problems with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (which has relpaced WP:V and WP:OR) - There is not a single citation to show that these men were even Freemasons, much less that Freemasonry had some connection to their businesses. This comes across as a poor man's version of a conspiracy page. I <i>think</i> the intent is to imply that large corporations are in some way nefariously tied to Freemasonry (always a favorite with conspiracy fans), without actually saying what the connection is. At best, the info could be added to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemason_conspiracy_theories.html" title="Freemason conspiracy theories">Freemason conspiracy theories</a> , however it would need citations for that as well. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:45, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is largely original research. Further, it actually makes a strong case why this isn't notable as a topic. I quote verbatim: "Erotic poetry is so under repesented in Australian poetry anthologies that it could be said to be a non existent poetic form in Australia. The Penguin Book of Modern Verse, 1961 and the more recent The Penguin Book of Modern Australian Poetry (1991) contain no examples of erotic poetry. The National library of Australia until quite recently (2006) had no category called "erotic poetry Australian" Colin Leslie Dean and Collins, T. M. (Timothy Maurice), are the only two poets listed under the subject category "erotic poetry- Australian" in the National Library of Australia catalogue." <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 04:30, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Becuase there is very little Australian erotic poetry it is important to have an article on this subject. This argument is spurious it is like saying in the late 1700s that because there is little romantic poetry ie Wordsworth then Wikipedia should not have an article called romanitic poetry. This sort of argument will just hinder the presentation of new ideas genres and themes on Wikipedia and thus make it not up to date and at the cutting edge of new developments. This sort of argument could be applied to the net itself which is changeing every day and thus hinder Wikipedia fropm giveing up with current trends. The deletion of Australian erotic poetry will stop Wikipdedia from being at the forefront of what is happening in Australian poetry. Deleting this article would be like deleting an article on post modern Australian poetry or hyperlink Australian poetry -all underrepresented in Australia- and thus not giving a broad coverage of the current trends in Australian poetry. This article should not be deleted as it give the current trend and direction in Australian poetry. Just because some topic is new and novel and not at the moment have many represenatives is no reason why an article should be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gamahucher (<a href="../../../g/a/m/User_talk%7EGamahucher_76d4.html" title="User talk:Gamahucher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gamahucher_8f62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gamahucher">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The suggestion for two articles makes no sense. There seems to be no good reason why there cant be an Australian erotic poetry article just as there would be no good reason why there cannot be a modern or post-modern poetry article. Why categorise the poets under Australian poets then sub categorise them under erotic poetry -makes no sense- why not just put the poets in an article dealing with Australian erotic poetry-there seems to be some unspoked issue with an article called Australian erotic poetry</p>

<p>GEEE you say no reliable sources yet one of my sources is straight out of the Wikipedia database- All this is getting a bit out of hand people are just pulling things out of the air to justify deleting the article It seems if someone gives a negitive valuation every one else just follows suit.I have come to the conclusion that the deletion of the article has little to do with its content but rather some other unspoken issue with the article. I draw this conclusion from viewing the range of contradictory comments: some say the article is nonsense other say it is interesting some say it is not notable other say it is moderatly notable some say it canot be sourced other say it can be sourced some say it should be rewritten other say it needs just a bit of work. All these contradictory reasons indicate to me that a lot of subjective feelings are going into the reasons for its deletion. An article cannot generate such a wide variety of opinions if it was fundamentaly flawed. A fundamentaly flawed article would have more consensus regarding reasons. Every time I answer an argument the gaol posts are moved . This indicates that people have it in their minds-for what ever reasons-that this article should be deleted and as such will just go on producing arguments no mater what counter arguments is presented-the goal posts will always be moved to accomadate their feelings about the article<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gamahucher (<a href="../../../g/a/m/User_talk%7EGamahucher_76d4.html" title="User talk:Gamahucher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gamahucher_8f62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gamahucher">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>- I think the issue should not be in the style it is written, but the notability and potential of the article. An article written like an essay about a notable subject should not be deleted, it should be corrected. This is not to say that the article is notable, or to assert any other opinion other than you should make sure you are deleting it for the right reason. Original research also- if it's notable, don't delete it, fill it with secondary research. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanMD80_c3b4.html" title="User:SeanMD80"><font style="italic" color="#008B8B">Sean</font><font color="#008080">MD80</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeanMD80_b065.html" title="User talk:SeanMD80">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SeanMD80_8829.html" title="Special:Contributions/SeanMD80">contribs</a></sup> 00:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We don't have an article on erotic poetry yet, or even a separate article on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_poetry.html" title="Australian poetry">Australian poetry</a> -- just a section in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_literature.html" title="Australian literature">Australian literature</a>. Are you saying we should keep an article that's completely unacceptable from start to finish, just as a sort of work order for someone else to create something encyclopedic about this particular niche subject? I don't find that persuasive, to put it mildly. This isn't just an article that needs a quick copyedit, or some unencylopedic rhetoric trimmed away; it has deep <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> problems and would need to be completely researched and rewritten from scratch. If other editors do that, they will be using up time that could be better spent on more urgently-needed subjects; if they don't, it will remain bad indefinitely and be of little or no help to the person who -- perhaps years from now -- undertakes to write an encyclopedic article on this topic.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually the anti-poetry page is much the same as the Erotic Poetry page - empty headings, an advert for Mr Dean's work and some original research to bulk it out. I've added an OR tag to the page to try and generate some discussion and discover if there is more to anti-poetry than Mr Deans. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 13:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is nothing wrong with creating entries that adds to the knowledge pool even if they happen to be about one person-there is no universal law saying a person canot be multitalented. You obvious obsession in hunting down such minute detail about what entries have been placed speacks volumes about what may be just personal bias and hostilty or some other unsavory human disposition. A commentator asked for some erotic poetry erxamples so i give a link and all you can do is find some problem with it GEEE have you some big problem with the erotic</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem here isn't with the fact that it's one person, it's that you are basically using Wikipedia to promote someone the success of whom you have an apparent vasted interest in. Therefore you have an obvious Conflict of Interest as covered by <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> as well as the other problems with the article. You seem to think that this all some personal bias on people's part, but that is not the case <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 13:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is ridiculous It like saying that because someone puts entries about <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Richard_Francis_Burton_e279.html" title="Sir Richard Francis Burton">Sir Richard Francis Burton</a> in Wikipedia in such entries as anthroplogy poetry india arabian nights etc he has a vested interet in pushing him. This is all getting a bit silly and really speacks volumes about unspoken issues</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No, the problem isn't the gentleman being in several places, it's that you personally appear to publish Mr Deans; that he doesn't appear to be notable and that you have created multiple articles whose primary purpose is to link to your own site and which serve almost entirely to promote Mr Deans. If someone writes articles which mention Sir Richard Francis Burton in several places, that's fine - he is notable, he's a historical figure and no-one can be said to have a conflict of interest in writing about him. You seem to be using Wikipedia as a means of promoting or advertising someone you personally publish - and that's not what Wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 13:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I donot publish mr dean I publish topics and themes he has contributed to. This article is not about mr dean it is about erotic poetry which he has contributed to. If mr dean happens to be multitalented why does that preculded the areas he has contributed to from excluision from WikipediaMr dean did not invent Australian erotic poetry -that was created by the National Library of Australia. Are you saying that because he is not a world famous person he cannot appear on Wikipedia. ARE YOU SAYING ONLY WORLD FAMOUS PEOPLE CAN APPEAR ON WIKIPEDIA. Are you saying that mr dean canot have any entries about areas he contributes to I think that is patently ridiculous We have moved from not notable to original research to not enough sources to no examples of erotic poetry to now conflict of interest. It seem you all just jump on the next badwaggon that comes along. What next will it be perhaps becuase the the article was written with my left foot that makes it illegitment. We have moved from attacking the article to now character assinating the author-where will this all end really getting silly and speacks volumes for unspoken issues. All this new bandwaggon of cohorts simpply because I was asked for some examples of erotic poetry. Get real you asked for it I did not give it till asked -so if I was pushing dean why wait to be asked and not just give the link initialy</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please believe me that no-one here is attacking any authors, but as you rightly say the problems with this article cover non-notability, original research, not attribution and conflict of interest amongst others. For those reasons alone, it should be deleted. The article (and the others you have contributed to Wikipedia on Meaninglessness and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-poetry.html" title="Anti-poetry">Anti-poetry</a>, plus contributions to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_literature.html" title="Australian literature">Australian literature</a>) are <i>all</i> without exception about Mr Deans and feature links to your own website which apparently publishes Mr Deans. A Google search for Colin Leslie Dean has virtually no hits which aren't either a link to your own website or links to web fora which feature new members praising Mr Dean, only to be shot down imemdiately by more established forum members for spamming and self-promotion. And while this is meant to be a calm discussion and not an argument, might I suggest that the reason you did not initially feature your web address was because on Australian Literature you were immediately edited for link spamming? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 14:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>If I wrote articles about Sir Richard Francis Burton and owned a bookshop that sold his book would that be vested interet and exclude me from writing such articles. Are you saying bookshop owners canot wriite articles which therir books deal will Get real . If you did not want examples of erotic poetry you should have not askedNo matter if I put a small quote from mr dean all this conflict of interest would still arise. I am afriad that you have set in your mind like some world leaders a course of action and no matter how your arguments are refuted you just keep moving the goal post each time . As I say your obsession with hunting mr dean on google really speacks volumes for an obsessive mind with untoward dispositions</p>
<ul>
<li>Eh, OK. Here's a simple question which, leaving out the question of COI/OR/ATT, should make things crystal clear. Can you point to a set of verifiable, secondary sources (i.e. not ones which simply link to your website) which demonstrate that Mr Dean is <i>in any way</i> a notable poet and not, to quote a reply to one mysterious web forum post claiming Mr Dean was great, "some sort of self-published no-hoper who has no place in a forum for published poetry" [<a href="http://www.writingforums.com/showthread.php?t=70977" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writingforums.com/showthread.php?t=70977" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStuartDouglas_2def.html" title="User talk:StuartDouglas">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_StuartDouglas_1724.html" title="Special:Contributions/StuartDouglas">contribs</a>) 14:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>go to the Auslit Resourse for Australian Literature website <a href="http://www.austlit.edu.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.austlit.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austlit.edu.au/</a> and type in colin leslie dean to see that he is a notable Australian erotic poet by being listed- you may need to subscribe or your library may give you access. And as I Say if you where around in 1790 you would delete an article on romantic poetry featureing Wordsworth- notablity is no criteria for value just as being disparaged is no criteri for inablity- I recall Galileo was disparged in his time to IMr dean is also in cambridges publication <b>2000 outstanding scholars of the 21st century</b> as an Australian poet philosopher if you have a copy have a look- if that aint notable then nothing is . If you have access to worldcat-the library database you will see mr dean has books at such univserities as yale Harvard and the library of congress</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment Sorry, but notability <i>is</i> what matters here. And as I can't access the link you included, perhaps you could cut and paste the relevant section. To stress again, no-one is out to get you or Mr Dean, but as things stand your contributions to Wikipedia appear to be entirely an attempt to gain publicity for a non-notable and self-published poet with no critical review. As for the <i>2000 Oustanding Scholars</i> book, that seems to be a pay for inclusion scam, the site for which revolevsa roudn askign people to nominate as many people as they want for inclusion. Anyway, I;ve said more than enough - the AfD will end up in consensus I suspect <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 15:26, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>you harp on about notablity but i can see your moputh drop when you read this Mr dean is also in cambridges publication <b>2000 outstanding scholars of the 21st century</b> as an Australian poet philosopher if you have a copy have a look- if that aint notable then nothing is . If you have access to worldcat-the library database you will see mr dean has books at such univserities as yale Harvard and the library of congress. Once again you change the goal posts. You want notablity i gave it to you and you just ignore it-once again unspoked issues <b>2000 outstanding scholars of the 21st century</b> is not a pay for vanity publication you saying that really indicates you cant handle mr deans notablity and must try and proove to yourself by any illusion it cant be that he is notable I suppose you are going to say Yale Havard and the library of congress only put books in catalogue based upon vanity domination-GET REAL-you trying to dispage mr dean is reaching the hights of the ridiculous</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This AFD has turned into a bloodbath. The points that have been stated above are:
<ul>
<li>There is questions as to whether the two named poets are notable. I don't doubt they probably are, but Wikipedia is quite strong on *asserting* notability - i.e. you have to say in the article how the individual is notable. <s>Cambridge's book as above may well be enough to do this so long as someone else is willing to vouch for this.</s> I had taken this on face value, but it turns out it is simply a publisher called International Biographical Centre based in the town of Cambridge, England. The website is <a href="http://www.internationalbiographicalcentre.com/pages/menu.html" class="external text" title="http://www.internationalbiographicalcentre.com/pages/menu.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The publication is not in any state, local or university library in Western Australia and is not listed on the <a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au" class="external text" title="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au" rel="nofollow">NLA catalogue</a>. (Interestingly, Colin Leslie Dean's work can be found in most of the above)</li>
<li>The article this AfD is about, Australian erotic poetry, will probably be deleted per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">our attribution policy</a>, which expressly states that "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publisher of original thought. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true. Wikipedia is not the place to publish your opinions, experiences, or arguments." This article reads like an essay, and basically is one.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>if you want library holdings as a giude to status As Isaid mr dean is in "Dictionary of international biography" the National Library of Australia has 3 entries and there are 227 entries ib library around australia. He is also in 2000 outstanding intellectuals of the 21st century and this is meantioned at the National Library of Australia. He is in international whos who in poetry and poets encyclopedia which is in the National Library of Australia. He is also in Whos who in the 21st century the National Library of Australia has and there are 16 entries for libraries in Australia</p>
<p>you all talk about original research not wanted but Wikipedias entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Biographical_Centre" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Biographical_Centre" rel="nofollow">International Biographical Centre</a> is completly original research even with a long list of items foun on a google search. If it is good for one why not others-there is a bit of biased selection going on here</p>
<p>you say surprisingly mr dean is in a number of Australian libraries if you had of checked the sourse i give in the article you would have seen that-you all say I dont give sources, I do but you all dont even bother to look at them</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> as the name of the author (and main "keep" proponent on this AfD) is the same as the press which publishes one of the poets in question, and may thereby have a vested interest in promoting the work. I don't know if this is the case or not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>At all times it should be remembered this is an encyclopaedia and not a web host or publisher. As I suggested some time back in the debate, perhaps the solution is to create a category "Australian erotic poetry" and create two articles, one for each of these poets, and put them in the category. Any reliable independent sources (eg ADB if he has a listing there) could be used to construct a biography of the guy. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 16:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Cambridge</i>, aka the International Biographical Centre has its own article on Wikipedia, under Confidence Tricks: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Biographical_Centre" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Biographical_Centre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Biographical_Centre</a> See also the section of this page titled <i>Nerd Scam</i> [<a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/000432.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/000432.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>] This is of course getting wildly off topic, but I thought it worth pointing out in the face of being told to 'eat my words' <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 16:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>nevertheless as your link points out entry is based on merit and not a pay for entry-even if nominated you must have merit to be included - and they are not a vanity press even if entrants pay for bigger spreads they must have merit to be included -eat your words. As i say there is a lot of effort to disparage mr dean that borders on psychological obsession</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Eh, there's no need for this constant aggression - civility costs nothing and nothing said here is personal. Also, no - the article says it is <i>superficially</i> true to say that there is no need to pay, before making it clear that it is a vanity press where paid, larger entries are bulked out with worthless self-nominated entries. Any actual merit on the part of those included is wholly irrelevant and secondary to the fact that they have paid to get in.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final point - I see that amongst your edits to Wikipedia is one where you edited an article on a CD of music called <i>Erotic Poetry</i> to include a copy and pasted section from this article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erotic_Poetry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112827362" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erotic_Poetry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112827362" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>], all about Mr Dean. Can you really deny that you are Mr Dean? Or that his article and every other edit you have made is designed to promote yourself? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartDouglas_6aae.html" title="User:StuartDouglas">StuartDouglas</a> 17:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry you link specificaly says merit is required and there is no payment for entry -only for wanting a bigger spread or wanting to an award. But the article states merit is required and that payment is not required for entry. you contradict yourself and show your agenda when you say "the article says it is superficially true to say that there is no need to pay" then say,"they have paid to get in" I am courious you asked for examples of erotic poetry has any one gone to the link and download any free books of erotic poetry - you asked for examples so how about commenting on some. YES I pasted to the erotic poetry becuase it is obvious that this article wil be deleted so just trying to get some information about Australian erotic poetry on Wikipedia StuartDouglas has obviously a bee in his bonnet as he has intiated discussions on two of my entries Anti-poetry and Meaninglessness. These articles are not about colin leslie dean, but about areas that he happens to have contributed to It is not my problem that colin leslie dean is at the cuting edge of new ideas and new trends. There was a time when the only entry under "relativity" would have been Einstien. So dont blame colin leslie dean or accuse me of promoting him if he is one of the only ones in certian important areas -like Wordsworth or Einstein where at one stage</p>

<p>I am outstounded It seems wikipedia is no more than a poor mans encyclopedia brittanica. It seem to be aligible for entry in wik you must first be in encyclopedia brittanica -so why not just go to encyclopedia brittanica . So much for open sourcing and internet democarcy Once again mainstream takes control of the net Wik may as well just get payed monkeys typing AUTHORATIVE articles so it can sell them to the highest bidder ie encyclopedia brittanica. It seems all wik is is a watered down version of brittanica with articles which just reproduce briitanica written by amateurs who in effect just paraphrase more authorative sources.</p>

<dd>Yes, they are lists of works described by the list compilers as being important works in the realms of discourse about which the compilers are noted as experts. According to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a>, an academic is notable if "The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources," or if "The person is regarded as an important figure by independent academics in the same field." The fact that notable, recognized authorities on libertarianism/anarchocapitalism have cited Watner's works as "essential" or "recommended" seems to clearly meet these conditions. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 16:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Watner has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals. If you want to argue that he can't be called an "academic" unless he works at a school, I think think you are using an overly narrow definition of the word. The editor (Long) and the editorial board of the <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Libertarian_Studies_79d4.html" title="Journal of Libertarian Studies">JLS</a></i> are all academics and Watner's submitted articles have apparently passed muster with them. The same is true with other journals. To your second point, I don't think it is trivial for six recognized authorities (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans-Hermann_Hoppe_f071.html" title="Hans-Hermann Hoppe">HHH</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_Institute_745b.html" title="Cato Institute">Cato</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">MNR</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Institute_1391.html" title="Independent Institute">II</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Long_4e23.html" title="Roderick Long">Long</a>, and Gordon) in Watner's realm of discouse to say that his writings are "recommended" or "essential." To me that means that he is a reasonable subject to cover in an encylopedia that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">not paper</a>. And just to add to those above, here is a <a href="http://libertariannation.org/a/f24l3.html" class="external text" title="http://libertariannation.org/a/f24l3.html" rel="nofollow">quotation of Watner</a> by Long in a paper presented in 1995. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Martin_%28professor%29_9dce.html" title="Brian Martin (professor)">This academic</a> has notably <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01nvc/nvc05.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/01nvc/nvc05.html" rel="nofollow">criticized</a> Watner's theoretical work. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 05:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would additionally note that Watner's article in the <a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_03.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mises.org/journals/lf/1975/1975_03.pdf" rel="nofollow">March 1973 <i>Libertarian Forum</i></a> was seemingly written as a response to some history of thought writing that Rothbard did. This is noteworthy for our purposes here because Rothbard was arguably both the foremost libertarian thinker (for a while anyway) <i>and</i> the editor of <i>LF</i>. This means that Rothbard more or less thought Watner's response to his own work was valuable and notable. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 17:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I looked through the "citations" offered by DickClarkMises above. Long's reference to Watner is merely in the context of a summary of a magazine issue — if that counts as a "citation", then by jove, one may as well say that a journal's table of contents counts as a "citation"! Also, it's the <i>references</i> to Watner which need to be peer reviewed; and as far as I can see, Rothbard's and Gordon's essays haven't undergone any rigorous peer review process. (Well, Rothbard seems to be some sort of authority on libertarianism, but he mentions Watner only very briefly, as someone who discovered another work by someone else.) I don't think any of these add up to notability for Watner. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 18:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do note my political affinities on my userpage, but what I was objecting to <i>as a Wikipedian</i> is that you are applying what I consider to be an unusual standard to this case. I wasn't quite sure why you would persist in favoring this AfD after the verifiable sources above were known, so I looked at your userpage, where—to your credit—you disclose that you are the proprietor of the site I linked above. I may be a libertarian, but I hadn't read anything of Watner's before, met him, or heard him speak, although I had seen him cited in the literature during my time working as librarian at the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mises_Institute_a2c6.html" title="Mises Institute">Mises Institute</a>. This is the reason that my first sources were from there, because I already knew the guy was mentioned in a few places at mises.org since I recalled having seen his name on the front cover of the Institute's quarterly <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Libertarian_Studies_79d4.html" title="Journal of Libertarian Studies">JLS</a></i> and elsewhere. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">DickClarkMises</a> 14:24, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems more like a religious community than a city. Though I generally think cities are notable, it does not strike me that this should be considered as a city. One thinks of a city, especially in the United States, as a public institution, but this community seems to operate under private control judging by their adherence to specific religious mores. If the article is kept, the distiction needs to be clarified and the city related tags and categories removed. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:34, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In defense of my earlier comment, those sources seem to be using the colloquial meaning of <i>city</i>. If I am wrong and it is a city in the legal sense, meriting all the categorization and appurtenances of a city on wikipedia, count me baffled that "All of Vedic City follows a certain system - a lifestyle laid out by the Maharishi that combines Transcendental Meditation and specific architectural principles" per the Desmoines Register link. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:49, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The argument that an article needs to be sourced is not a good reason to keep it. If you believe an article should be kept because it <i>can</i> be sourced, then by all means source it and the issue is resolved. One cannot simply argue to keep an article expecting someone else is going to eventually get around to citing sources. The sources either exist or they do not, and this article has had sufficient time to be sourced. No one has done so thus far, and if no one will by the time this AFD has run its course it shoudl be deleted. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 22:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: It's 1) a dicdef but doesn't add anything to 'cuddle' and 'buddy' separately, and anyway 2) the meaning described is limited geographically. (Where I live it definitely <i>does</i> mean something beyond non-sexual cuddle.) <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 04:35, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The problem lies in the fact that it's a cultural phenomenon that has been largely ignored by mainstream media or other "reliable secondary sources." . . . Crap. I may have just argued myself into admitting that there aren't going to be any sources, and encyclopedically, we have to wait until there are. But I still want to keep it. Maybe we can find some sources. There might even be some about it being more sexual than non-sexual.

<p>Since this article was created it's been bogus. Note the references to "Ben Dover", and mafias. If you read the article carefully you'll basically notice that it's crap. It's been continuously edited, making it even worse from the original. "English porno film directors", is not a reference to individual directors, but a moronic article about Ben Dover and his mafia woman.</p>
<p>I hope this can be deleted asap.</p>

<p>No-one has commented on Porn Gold and perhaps to be fair they should read the references on Mike Freeman before commenting further. Porn Gold by David Hebditch and Nick Anning is a hardback and is available from libraries on request. It is also online to official librarians. Linda Pow, teacher.</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: this page is notable. The type of cancer she had does not recieve enough attention publicly and adding faces to a disease helps others understand it more and realize its effect on the world community. Kayla is notable for more than just being a victim of a tragic disease, because there are several developing projects that she serves as an inspiration for. Similar to the Komen foundation for breast cancer there is a foundation named after Kayla that is being formed currently for glioblastoma multiforme. This information will of course be added to the Wikipedia article as it develops. Also, there is an annual concert called the Gala for Kayla that is going to be held this. Its first year was in 2006. Furthermore, notable is a very relative term. Granted she isn't in any movies and she isn't famous like Abe Lincoln, but what hasn't been reflected on the Kayla Nebeker Karhohs page is how she did have a great effect on those who were lucky enough to know her and those who have simply found out about her story. If you lived in Reno you would have heard about her. Google her name and look at all she has accomplished. The local news has done a story on her and several publications have done stories on her. I have read the guidelines expressing "What Wikipedia is Not" and I did not find her page in accordance with anything on that list that would deem her page inappropriate for wikipedia. I acknowledge more needs to be done to her page and encourage anyone who joins this discussion to add their input to it. Finally, I don't know how "notable" is defined, but I think that after anyone looks at the changes made to her page, they will see that for a 23 year old woman she accomplished a great deal on her own merits and that while it is sad she died an untimely death that is not the only thing that she is known for. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarhohs_90da.html" title="User:Karhohs">karhohs</a> 7:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Mr. Karhohs, I understand that the brain tumor that Ms. Karhohs had is a serious illness, but she is just not notable enough for Wikipedia, compared to <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Noble_811e.html" title="Ivan Noble">this person</a>, who was a BBC journalist with the same disease, and gained widespread notability for a BBC News blog that documented his battle on BBC's website.

I have TV broadcasts and lots of newspaper articles. I noticed the articles about her that were online have been removed from their websites. Would it do anything if I put them back up on the web? I would appreciate it if the people voting to delete this article would go further than a sentence and explain their argument more, so that I can work to remedy what the article is lacking. I read the notability article and do understand there is a certain threshold that must be met and I do understand it is an encyclopedia. However, if the threshold is made too high, then information will be lost. This article should not be deleted, because it is still growing. Soon the foundation and the concert will recieve a lot of third party attention and when it does I know someone will want to learn more about Kayla and why there is a foundation and a concert named after her. It would be awesome if this hypothetical person only had to go as far as wikipedia to find out all they want to know. Does someone need to write a biography about her in order to support the information that is currently in the article? Is there a certain amount of grace period that the article can exist while changes are still being made? If this article is going to be deleted, because there is a lack of evidence supporting its contents and thus it is deemed non-notable, then please give me some feedback of more than a sentence. Isn't the idea to collect more knowledge?

<li><b>Commensuration Argues for Inclusion</b> - From an objective viewpoint, this article is facing deletion for one reason only, namely, this article is meaningless for those not involved in that particular region. Unfortunately, some people do not understand that there is limitless space as well as a simple and fair threshold that must be met for an article to be included. This article meets those (at least when I viewed it just now)requirements. I think several of the arguments for deletion are now obsolete or hold no water (MSJapan and Arbiteroftruth). "<i>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publisher of original thought. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source."</i> "<i>Wikipedia:Attribution is one of Wikipedia's two core content policies. The other is Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles; that is, content on Wikipedia must be attributable and written from a neutral point of view.</i>" This article meets these two criteria (admittedly this article has some flavor of opinion). The information in this article may not all be attributable, but I see several sources listed. These sources are easily not "questionable or self-published sources". (<i>A questionable source is one with no editorial oversight or fact-checking process or with a poor reputation for fact-checking. Such sources include websites and publications that express views that are widely acknowledged as fringe or extremist, are promotional in nature, or rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions</i>.) I also see that this article may have been very heavily slanted at one time, but it is now apparently no more slanted than several articles that are widley accepted. Therefore, it meets the two major hurdles (a somewhat neutral viewpoint and reliable secondary sources) You can not judge inclusion of this article based on regiospecific interest. Remember that something can be important regionally, and yet mean nothing to 80% or 90% of others (the election of a mayor, or her resignation relative to poor conduct). That is one of the wonderful facets of all of this. By the rules alone, it can stay.

<li><b>Comment</b>- Yukichigai, this article is, by no stretch, notable. I, myself, made local news a couple of times for positive reasons and I made school newspapers as well in the past. I am also a news reporter for a university student TV, but so what? Does that give me a ticket to Wikipedia? This story is very tragic, I know, but that should not cloud our judgement. Wikipedia is not a memorial for the departed. We MUST not let emotions cloud our decision. This article will survive well in blogosphere, but not on Wikipedia. She only made news for her illness, and she is hardly the first person to have that kind of brain tumor. There are more famous people with the same diseases who still lives or have departed.

<li><b>Weak keep, but only if rewritten</b> I must admit I'm a bit of an inclusionist, or else I would probably vote delete. Just on the hairy edge of notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the author has made a valiant effort to cleanup the article to meet Wikipedia standards and I have to commend the effort. Based on a narrow interpretation of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> it can be argued that the notability criteria has now been met, however I have to admit that I am unconvinced. The articles all read like local human interest stories rather than having much substance. At the risk of sounding insensitive, when you filter out all the fluff about where she grew up and who she married, the only thing she did to establish any real notability was to die of an unfortunate illness. As far as the foundation in her name or related events establishing some notoriety, that may be a different story, but the story of a nice, well liked girl who died in sad circumstances is still not encyclopedic material. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 22:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - Here's a passage from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> on notability --- Notability is generally permanent</p>
<p>If there are multiple independent reliable published sources that have a topic as their subject, this is not changed by the frequency of coverage decreasing. Thus, if a topic once satisfied the primary notability criterion, it continues to satisfy it over time. The reverse is not true; subjects may acquire notability as time passes. However, articles should not be written based on speculation that the subject may be notable in the future.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>With that said, do we expect this person who has since departed to retain the "notability" (if we can even call it that) 6 months from now? True, her families will remember her, but people as an ordinary citizen, people like me, would most likely (pretty much certain to) move on. I don't think any Average Joe would continue to mourn this person's passing after a few weeks.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, what I am doing here is unclouded by conflicts of interests, as we cannot let our emotions get in the way of editing Wikipedia. My sympathies are with the Karhohs family for their loss, <b>but this is not, was not, and will never be, a ticket to an article on Wikipedia.</b> <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbiteroftruth_4aad.html" title="User:Arbiteroftruth">Arbiteroftruth</a> 00:24, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Notability has nothing to do with whether people will "remember" something. Very few people "remember" James Polk, but that has no bearing on his notability. The passage you cite actually weakens your point. According to it, if a subject passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> once (which it has done), it is taken to have passed it over time, <i>even if coverage of the subject decreases</i>. Once satisfied, always satisfied. Whether that's a good thing or not can be debated, but as it stands, this article has passed <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This bias (even if perhaps a valid one) against a "sympathy package story from a TV station" or an article "from a campus newspaper" is not grounded in any policy or guideline. Per our rules, this article qualifies for inclusion. Pointing me to another person who's received more coverage doesn't prove much, as there are also millions of people that receive less coverage. Don't get me wrong, I understand your argument and the points you raise. But as I see it, this article meets WP's current policies and the fact that it is well-attributed leaves me without incentive to even try to justify its deletion.

<p>Notability questionable, and based on a brief media storm around a preprint that quickly died away. Does not seem fair to brand here as the mathematicians who claimed to have proved Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness but was mistaken. It was just a preprint, and preprints are not publications <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 12:09, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: the "brief media storm" seems to be limited to mostly blogs (such as Peter Woit's) and several articles, e.g. in <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061002/pdf/061002-14.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061002/pdf/061002-14.pdf" rel="nofollow">Nature</a>, <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/10/the_proof_is_in_the_blogging.php" class="external text" title="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/10/the_proof_is_in_the_blogging.php" rel="nofollow">Seed</a>, <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/2006/10/18/ft/articleEKE8R.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nzz.ch/2006/10/18/ft/articleEKE8R.html" rel="nofollow">NZZ</a> (for nonsubscription access to the Nature article see <a href="http://agutie.homestead.com/files/world_news_map/navier_stokes_fluid.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://agutie.homestead.com/files/world_news_map/navier_stokes_fluid.htm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). In terms of "notability" <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia: Notability</a> would assert this coverage was enough and cannot diminish over time; however, this guideline (whose status has always been kind of dubious anyway) is at the moment heavily contested. I would like to add that feelings of sympathy ideally should not play into whether this article is kept or not. It is best to be consistent in what we decide is kept or not, regardless of how we feel about the subject. Nonetheless, in my opinion, articles like this can never be more than marginal keep. I personally think creating a whole bio on Smith because of this is rather dubious. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 04:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> The "independence" criterion requires both, see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: <i>"Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other."</i> I wouldn't mind a merge and redirect to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Mathematics_Institute_c60b.html" title="Clay Mathematics Institute">Clay Mathematics Institute</a>, where the information on the Millennium Problems is kept, but she isn't independently notable. As an aside, is there a reason why the article's title is "Penny" instead of "Penelope"? Most sources, including her website (and even the article's first sentence) seem to use her full name. <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 22:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, you're still misreading it. "Independent of each other" does not mean covering independent events, as "each other" is referring to the sources themselves. The sources I listed do not appear to be dependent. This part of the criterion is designed to avoid the situation where one source may basically just be copying another. This is not the case here; it appears each news source did their own investigation. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very weak delete</b>. Well, mostly it's certainly not original research - the list of cultural references is taken straight from the lyrics. The only bit that might contravene <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> is the "..the song is thought to be..." part, but OTOH that's pretty obvious from the lyrics.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Neither appears to qualify it as notable under Wikipedia guidelines. Different, yes, interesting, yes, but notability means it has "been the subject of secondary sources [and] such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other." Until it wins a Grammy or takes an unexpected turn into pop culture such as Dandy Warhols "Bohemian Like You" did, it probably fails WP:N.

<li>Given the vast number of articles that have been deleted as indiscriminate collections without having their article type explicitly named in the Big 8, given that there is not a single word in the policy that can reasonably be interpreted as making the Big 8 definitive and given that under the simple rationale of basic common sense a presidential biography is not an indiscriminate collection of information, it's you who's being misleading by pretending that IINFO has no possible application here. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not saying it has no possible application. What I'm saying is that is has no application <i>grounded in policy</i>. One can make a very compelling argument that something or another is indiscriminate, but no matter how <i>fantastic</i> that argument is, unless it's one of the Big 8, it's not grounded in policy and should not consist of a simple, unexplained link to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. I intend to review my position in light of Mangojuice's comment that this article is <i>semi-redundant</i>, but until an actual argument is made as to why this is indiscriminate (except "who gives a damn"), I cannot see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> as applicable. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:03, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have nominated this page for deletion for a couple reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. I once went to a far more remarkable school with the same name, 1200 enrolled kids, several Honor School of Excellence awards in NC, and winning A School To Watch award along with only 107 other schools in the country. Yet nobody ever considered an article.</p>
<p>2. The only reason the English Wikipedia has over 1.2 Million pages is because of nonsense like this. As I said, there are much more remarkable schools that have no article or even a passing mention anywhere in Wikipedia.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem I have with this article is one of notability. The sources we have are:
<ol>
<li>The school's website and the local school profile obviously aren't independent sources.</li>
<li>The County Fair and the Opera Theatre are both passing mentions, more for the location than for the school itself. "Independence" is debatable.</li>
<li>The Washington Post definitely is independent, reliable, an all-round good source (though it wasn't there when I first voiced my opinion), but the incident reported is rather strange - I would call the depth of coverage "not substantial" per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.</li>
<li>That leaves us with the <i>Great Schools</i> website, one where I'm very skeptical. If it were to confer notability on this school, does it also confer notability on every other school mentioned on that website with a comparable amount of information?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In conclusion, I don't see notability established by mentions in secondary sources. The Washington Post might persuade me to make it a very weak keep, but then we have a school <i>notable for a teacher playing Mah Jongg with some of her pupils during the lunch break</i>... <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 11:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a>'s reasoning. In reading this article I was tempted to add to the "Trivia" section the phrase "all this article", but I manfully resisted. I can see the way this debate is going: it's pretty clear that the undiscriminating masses have virtually "won" the battle over high schools, and have moved on to middle schools. Despite their protestations that they would stop with high schools they haven't, and they won't stop here. Kindergartens will be next, and then post offices. And then malls. Maybe I should just argue for keeping everything too, and then sit back and laugh as <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> and his friends try to maintain thousands of articles. There is no reason why anybody in the world, other than people with a personal connection, should have any interest in this school. Let's just be clear about this school: it's entirely unimportant in the great scheme of things, and has no more bearing on the history or future of mankind than my little finger. It's just a school like thousands of others. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 15:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I find it very annoying that most of the schools in the Arlington County school district have articles, the only schools that should be on wikipedia IMO are high schools, and even then only if their are exceptional in some way or a notable event has occoured there. [[Strongsville High School is notable for example because their marching band is annually featured at the Macy's Day Parade and has performed many other major events, not to mention the sports team winning several state championships.

Things I would regard as notable: it has won some major national award or recognition; it has a proud history of winning sports championships; it has several prominent alumni; it dates from, say, pre-Civil War era; it is located in a historic school building; some significant events of the civil rights era occurred there; some maniac once shot 12 students, covered them with peanut butter, and asked the police for grape jelly. I'm not hard to please, but I don't see <i>any</i> such claims here. Not a whit. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 07:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The school has the second largest gymnasium in Virginia;</li>
<li>The school is used as the location for Arlington County's annual fair;</li>
<li>The school has been noted in a <i>Washington Post</i> article; <i>and</i></li>
<li>The sixth grade lobby is green, the seventh grade lobby is yellow, and the eighth grade lobby is blue. Although this last one doesn't do anything to establish notability, I find it rather (disturbingly?) strange. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Post article is a little "people" story about the teacher who plays mah-jong with students; it is only incidentally about the school. The gymnasium is at the community center next door, it is just used by the school. Site of local annual fair - how... unexciting. But I appreciate your working with my strange demands for something interesting in the article. Anyone else? (We once moved into an apartment where all the rooms were painted different pastel colors, apparently after the colors of <a href="../../../n/e/c/NECCO_16c7.html" title="NECCO">NECCO</a> wafers. It was slightly disturbing, but I'm not writing a Wikipedia article about it.) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, there is nothing wrong with a "people" story, given that it is about a teacher <i>from this school</i>. Second, what you (and admittedly I as well) find unexciting is not particularly important: a county fair is a county fair and it undoubtedly attracts significant annual local attention (see <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>). And no offense to your (former?) apartment, but it probably has far less significance than a school which tens of thousands will attend. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:28, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In answer to the points you made:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is a private address, It is not registered to any organisation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Without publishing its accounts it is not an official organisation, I do not have to prove that it is not publishing accounts, YOU have to prove that it IS publishing accounts.</dd>
<dd>It is not registered with the electoral authorities in any of the nations that it professes to be active in, all political organisations and not just political parties have to be registered.</dd>
<dd>Google is a search engine and so can't be used for referencing.</dd>
<dd>The only reference for it on the BBC website is in the 'action network' section and was written by the organisation itself and has not been updated for almost 3 years. The 'action network' section can be written by anyone and needs no proof or evidence that what has been written is true. <a href="../../../r/e/p/User%7ERepublicUK_7ada.html" title="User:RepublicUK">RepublicUK</a> 10:55, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It has been mentioned that the address is a residential address, I would just like to point out that that isn't true. There are many businesses resident in the same building as the provided address, and it appears on the satellite images, and internet research to be an office building of some sort. Also the claim it only has 50 members is shot down by the graph at the bottom of the main page that clearly shows exactly how many members it has, looks to be around 200 members. Not a lot I'll agree, but more than 50. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:38, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Important Comment</b>. I find it interesting to note that the OP's very first edit on Wikipedia was to this article, to add something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105053001" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. A couple of days later he added more information on it being controversial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105719742" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. This was then deleted by an anon user, but RepublicUK then altered the article again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Commonwealth_Society&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109294595" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, seemingly knowing something going on about the organisation. The following day he nominated the article for deletion. I'm sorry but I feel there is something else going on here, the OP expands the article, adds some bits that are removed and then nominates it for deletion. Almost all the OPs edits are to this article. Call me old fashioned but there could be something else going on here with this nomination, I think someone may be trying to make a point and this nomination is in bad faith and singleminded against his declared membership of Republic (whatever that may be). His contribs also seem to show a singleminded push against the organisation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RepublicUK" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are no references in the article and there is no indication that there has been any notice taken of this organisation by media or official bodies to signify its notability. Simple "keep" statements without verification are discountable. The BBC mention is not a news item but a post from the organisation itself by the look of it. If editors want this article kept, I suggest they get to work on it very quickly. At the moment there is no justification <i>in the article itself</i> for not deleting it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. After much comment on this page I'm going to call for a delete on this. I can find no notability on the net for it outside of bits the organisation itself has posted or comments on forums. Even the webpage for the organisation seems confused as to what it is calling itself the "United Commonwealth Society" in most places rather than "Federal Commonwealth Society," and "United Commonwealth Society" receives exactly 0 Google hits which is damningly low (oddly enough doesn't even pick up the main site). Even the threads on the forums seem concerned more with less serious issues (not in itself damning) and seems more like a collection of like minded people (for the most part) hanging out rather than trying to achieve anything. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Really, I think your attitude towards other users is outrageous and wrong. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a> 09:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is my take (and MrDarcy may have something different to say): editors often turn up on the same AfDs because they have the same interests. The problem occurs when those editors merely express biased opinions based on whether they approve of the subject or not, without attempting to objectively apply non-negotiable policies such as <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, or guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. No one attempting to do this could possibly argue for the retention of this article. This does become a matter of concern and needs to be addressed. MrDarcy and I have taken the same stance on this article, because any non-biased editor would have to&#160;!vote delete, if they were following policy. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:35, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well said. The only thing that I would add is that I was pointing out that when those editors are expressing the SAME biased opinions, using the SAME flawed justifications, it looks like users are acting in concert to sway Wikipedia in one direction. And that, to me, is unacceptable. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 01:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Folks don't forget that some of us that 'voted KEEP' have actually posted material that we thought supported the position (the Africa Crises one where someone was making fun of the FCS as a racist organization that would support an "white" South Africa in particular looked 'good' to me at the time I added to this discussion), I have of course after review conceeded that the blog in question doesn't pass the 'reliable' test...

<dd>It's obviously not directed at you, because you are doing what should be done, namely searching to see if references are available to justify the article, not just saying keep based only on personal preference.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> in general agreement with MrDarcy and also per my comment previously. I am disappointed that those wishing to retain the article do not seem to understand that this cannot be achieved merely by expressing an opinion, but only by providing proof through verifiable sources that substantiate notability. Otherwise the comments might just as well not have been written. I would ask the closing admin also to comment on this, if s/he feels it appropriate, for the benefit of contributing editors, as the problem is not restricted to this AfD. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment on comments</b> This bickering is quite irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether it is in accord with anyone's views or in conflict with them.

<li><b>Keep</b> If every little section of state or county roadway, every Pokemon, every pro soccer player, and every person given a title of nobility in Britain are inherently notable and need provide no secondary sources, then I suppose every broadcasting mast might be similarly inherently notable since they are approved by the government to serve the public good and their existence can be verified in databases if one looks a bit. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:37, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">The Pokémon defense</a> "<i>is frequently used in error, given the amount of publicity and renown the "average Pokémon" has gotten worldwide</i>". Pro-soccer is one of the most followed sports on earth today, and plenty of sources exist every week. In class-obsessed Britain, every person given a title of nobility is continually hounded by the British press, who often publish articles about the minutiae of their aristocratic existence. Please don't confuse compliance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. Radio and TV stations may be notable, but the same cannot be said of its transmitter tower. The database information is already included in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> article, so a merge is pointless. I have responsible for purging wikipedia of over 300 of these hopeless stub articles with little potential for improvement, and this is but a final clean-up of those few which have not been deleted, merged, or redirected to their respective TV or radio stations. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 01:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> on the basis that these towers don't have any sources and will never have articles longer than one line. These articles always lay around for months and say "x is a tower in y and is z metres tall." There have been several dozen (probably hundred by now) AfDs of a similar fashion, usually done one region at a time. The reason major roads, pokemon, soccer pros, nobles, etc, get articles is because they actually have sources about them. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 23:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that my complaint was with fans of roads, knighted Brits, soccer players, and Pokemons claiming "inherent notability" in the absence of sources satisfying <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. The baronets or knights may have only a listing is a peerage book(a mere directory listing). The roads are referenced to a roadmap or a states online listing of paving bids (not a substantial nontrivial reference) or someone's hobby blog (not a reliable reference). The pokemons are referenced to a TV show (O.R. inferences throughout) or to the instruction manual of a video game (not independent). If the knight, road, or Pokemon had multiple nontrivial independent reliable sources their articles would absolutely not be an issue. My problem is with claims of inherent notability for the subjects some editors LIKE in the absence of sources satisfying <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> or <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and then arbtrarily deleting articles some other fan of some other subject likes. I am not a big fan of any of the subjects named, and would like to see only articles for subjects with sources meeting WP policies for notability and attribution.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is a notable person... There have been countless minor articles in local publications, and dozens of articles in major media on his surviving legacy (Zendik Farm), including a CNN news special on Wulf Zendik, A Rolling Stone magazine/ABC tv collaboration called "State of the Union" featuring an interview with members of Zendik Farm and Wulf Zendik (both were in the 1990's)...</li>
</ul>
<p>1.5 million Zendik magazines containing his work have been sold to date, and many books, Cds, shirts, and other art are purchased by people all over this country and the world every week, which seems to indicate that Wulf Zendik and his work are notable to them. Barnes and Nobles carries "A Quest Among the Bewildered", his auto-biographical novel.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article just needs some attention and balance.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The nominator can vote, right? I've already explained my position.

Zendik.org is. "Delete" is my official vote, but I'm also open to the idea of <b>keep w/cleanup</b>, and I also agree with DGG that most of the entry should go.

<li><b>Comment</b> I know I'd find it a useful resource if in Beijing/Shanghai. "City Weekend" (beijing OR shanghai) gives about 28 hits, including an article copied into a German magazine, and someone in California referencing work writing for them in their CV. It has been publishing since 2004 at least, and many places in China seem to make reference to their selections in "best of" lists in the magazine. It looks like a good magazine, with good articles about expat life and concerns. ("Ta he de tai duo jiu"&#160;:-) But free because advertising is the main focus? And in China, and for expats. What is notable enough for magazines such as this? (Wow, typed "3500 RMB in dollars" into Google, and got an answer!) <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 04:33, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What's the basis for notability? You have not successfully answered this question to justify the statement, something that has already been pointed out in the comments you have made <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2007_March_3_6cce.html#Template:WA_JSHAA_Members" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2007 March 3">here</a>. While the organisation may have notable members, this does not confer Notability by default on the organisation. No person in the community at large would have any awareness of the subject matter. The article as a list is totally redundant and pointless as it links to none of the schools and the same function could easily be handled thru better categorisation of the member schools, a point which has already been proven thru the restructure of the list of WA schools that are members of the organisation. To simply move to keep something because you had some involvement in the content's creation is not enough of a reason for a keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewinchester_2be0.html" title="User:Thewinchester">thewinchester</a> 11:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had little to do with the making of this article, in fact - i only added a solitary reference. I think that the way this should be handled is that the cat:JSHAA should be like the parent category, with the ~5 sub categories to each states category of members, and those categories have links to all of the member schools. There should also be lists of the schools in each state etc etc <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">SM</a><a href="../../../s/m/b/User_talk%7ESmbarnzy_6a65.html" title="User talk:Smbarnzy">BarnZy</a> 12:12, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete unless expanded and referenced</b></s> Actually, contrary to Wafulz's opinion above, the article as currently written <i>is</i> just a dictionary definition of the term. It makes no attempt to discuss the term beyond what would appear in the dictionary, such as the history of the term, what the technique actually is, how and why it works, or its appearances in published media. The article is also unreferenced. So unless it can be expanded to be more encyclopedic with some proper sourcing, delete. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just added a few sources (and additional sentences) to the article, but must stop for now. I believe the article (as it currently stands) merits inclusion in WP: it is not inherently a dicdef and it passes the notability guideline as per the multiple sources (references and external links). The article does require cleanup and, if it is kept, I will work on it some more (removing unsourced portions, adding more information, etc.). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:52, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> does not in fact read like a dictionary entry, but should every martial arts move have a Wikipedia article?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. As it seems you're suggesting a merge, I should note that articles that are merged should not be deleted, but rather redirected. I don't actually know how many martial arts moves there are, but this one at least meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> by having multiple sources published about it. If a merge is performed, it should be to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_%28attack%29.html#Punches" title="Strike (attack)">Strike (attack)#Punches</a>, but it does not fit there that well. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 16:45, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Good point, I didn't think of it that way. Still, it seems akin to listing every kind of drum roll in a separate article, since there are multiple published sources about all of them as well. I suppose if it was my field I wouldn't feel that way, so maybe it should be kept. --Parsleyjones 21:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This series certainly has a level of notability, and this is growing as the books become more widely available. Besides the fact that they are, effectively, a "spin-off", from what I have seen they are being merchandised in much the same way as "Mr. Men" books are (similar size and length books, similar price, similar merchandising display...)</dd>

In the 10 years it's been online, the site has established a very good reputation with major comic book publishers, freelance writers/artists, games publishers, and movie producers, so much so that it was responsible for my landing a freelance contract with Marvel (and hence my stepping down as EiC to avoid any conflict of interest).</li>

<p>It's listed as a Webzine link <a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/links/index.php?PID=58&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;sr=10&amp;pp=10&amp;cp=2" class="external text" title="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/links/index.php?PID=58&amp;PHPSESSID=&amp;sr=10&amp;pp=10&amp;cp=2" rel="nofollow">here</a> as being "one of the Web's premier comic book and pop culture resource sites".</p>
<p>That said, I think the main reason for retaining an article on this - and other comic news sites - has been said best <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComic_Book_Resources_b4ab.html" title="Talk:Comic Book Resources">here</a>. --Daelf1969 23:21, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Links from forums really aren't <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and the other site linked from is under AfD as well for not being notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Also, a link from a link directory where you can submit your own link and description definitely is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Finally, the argument that this site merits a Wikipedia article because Anna Nicole Smith has one, well what can you really say to that? <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 23:45, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those aren't merely discussion forums; they're articles that are featured on the respective sites' front pages. That's how a lot of comics news Websites operate.</p>
<p>I'm all out of arguments on this. If you guys can't see the merit, well there's not much else I can do. Fans and professionals in the business know what the sites rep and importance is, and as such I thought it would be cool to have the site featured here.</p>
<p>After the amount of hassle I've had to go through just to (most probably) see my first contribution wiped, rest assured I won't bother to contribute any further articles to this or any other Wikipedia-affiliated sites. It's just not worth the time and effort. --Daelf1969 03:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I took a look at the deleted parts. From what i read the only thing that would make her noteworthy enough for an encyclopedia article is the fact that she recieved the "PROGRESSIVE JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATİON- 2001 BEST DOCUMENTARY AWARD". The association seems to be a legitimate Turkish Association, but I have no idea as to whether this award or the association as such are particularly important, i.e. if recieving this award makes her noteworthy. Possibly some Turkish wikipedians can comment on that. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravelbird_9a21.html" title="User:Travelbird">Travelbird</a> 12:49, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I am aware Wikipedia is not a directory of information, it <i>is</i> an encyclopedia that references companies that are notable, which according to Wikipedia guidelines, this company is.

<li>I am still not convinced this company is notable. Both sources <i>are</i> promotional in nature and do not contain independent analysis of the company, both read like advertisements. Solidbiz seems to be trying to sell the reader on the business opportunity that is Vitacraft. Upon examination of the main website, the stated aim of Solidbizopps.com is to provide "everything you need to succeed while starting a new business."+ The fact that few articles on the company exist from any publication and the promotional nature of the provided sources (one of which is in Japanese) tell the tale of a company that is not notable.</li>
</ul>

<dd>+ Examples of advertising-like language from the Solidbizopps source:

<ul>
<li><i>"Vita Craft has grown through years of commitment and excellence."</i></li>
<li><i>"They would like to help you find the opportunity that allows you the flexibility and freedom you want and most importantly, the opportunity that suits your personality."</i></li>
<li><i>"the customers build lavish look"</i></li>

<dd>Vita Craft, made in the United States, is a healthy cookware company that was created from as a result of research and development of two specialists from Seattle University and University of Wisconsin. The pans keep the natural taste of food and cook food in a healthy way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Vita Craft is made on the basis of preventative medicine, “The health of the family should not be protected by taking medicine, but rather by using waterless, non oil, low temperature, and low pressure home cooking.” (Seems to be a quote from a Vita Craft spokesperson)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, food can become medicine, but it can also be damaging. The type of cookware pots you use determines if you cook healthy food or damaging food.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Features of Vita Craft</dd>
<dd>-Has thermal efficiency, so the pans require less energy.</dd>
<dd>-Extensive 5-ply layer system.</dd>
<dd>-Can be used in multiple power sources, including Induction Heating of 200 volts.</dd>
<dd>-Can use cookware pans without excessive oil and can cook some items without oil.</dd>
<dd>-Can cook cakes without burning them like oven cooking often does.</dd>
<dd>-When you turn off the heat, the pans can still use heat stored inside the pans to cooke the food.</dd>
<dd>-Easy to take care of.</dd>
<dd>It has a long-term warranty of 10 years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most important feature of the cookware is the nutritional value that does not get destroyed because of waterless cooking. The lid to the cookware pans is designed with a vapor seal that makes it difficult for heat and moisture to escape. As a result, “waterless cooking” is possible to cook items like vegetables by using the water inside the vegetables. The loss of vitamins easily dissolves in water, likewise with waterless cooking, the loss of vitamins is held down to a minimum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When cooking items like meat, you need less salt because the taste of the food is natural and because excessive oil is not used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have not heard about Vita Craft pans until now, you might desire to buy the cookware.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You must get the price of Vita Craft from the official web site. While the cost may be high, the daily cost of energy will decrease, which will decrease costs in the long run.</dd>

<dd>Ranking of popular pots:</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Aagtbdfoua, I generally agree with you. However, COI is about editors who have a conflict; the subject itself, if notable, should not be "punished" because the editors have a conflict of interest. That being said, I often support deletion in close cases with a COI aspect. In my opinion, this is now a decent article, having been cleared of most of the advertising (though the reference to the vision of high quality cookware should probably go), and has just enough referencing to justify inclusion.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 04:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I saw some other fan sites, big but not very big either, having pages with only links to them, while searching. So thought it is allowed to add information about notable sites. This site is the oldest one among Turkish Sims sites, numbers might be small compared to big international sites. Text I posted was the history/information page of the site prepared by the owner of the site, not a spamming message. You may delete it if it interferes with the policy. Sorry.

<li><b>Keep</b> The first Jewish Press article and the Forward article constitute non-trivial, reliable, multiple sources, meaning the article passes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a>. I haven't read further (no time). I strongly suggest that information from these sources and others be used to improve the article with more information.

<li><b>Keep</b>: It's much larger than originally stated, however, the article makes it seem very small or unorganized.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above.

Still, she does have a longer list of credits and more Ghits than the typical "up and coming" starlet, and if she can keep up this pace for a few more years, she could qualify through quantity even without a major role. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 23:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fails WP:N. Original link to CNN report now dead, and link to Hubble site appears to be about a completely different object. Furthermore, google reveals that the name came from a <i>description</i> of the object as a 'large pathetic galaxy', and no suggestion that this should be used as its name has ever been made anywhere apart from on Wikipedia. It was detected via its effect on the Milky Way's disk; if it's considered important then it could be mentioned in the Milky Way article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislintott_1b69.html" title="User:Chrislintott">Chrislintott</a> 19:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC) In case it's not obvious, <b>delete</b> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislintott_1b69.html" title="User:Chrislintott">Chrislintott</a> 15:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The arguments in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Large_pathetic_galaxy_95bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Large pathetic galaxy">previous AFD discussion</a> for this article incorrectly assumed that the object in question was simply "unnamed" and that therefore "Large Pathetic Galaxy" should at least serve as a placeholder name. The object in fact has a number of proposed names in use, and the article that mentions them - <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a> - existed at the time of the previous AFD. The object istelf passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> with flying colors, however the term "large pathetic galaxy" was <i>never</i> used as a provisional name for the object, but merely a generic descripton of it. A redirect might be cheap but it would be misleading as it would effectively endorse the idea that LPG is an alternative name for this object, when it is not and never has been. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 19:48, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>. Although Arkyan makes a valid concern about endorsement, I think it does not harm because, if nothing else, it might prevent recreation of a similarly named article down the line. Part of me thinks it'd actually be cool to have a galaxy named this, though. Incidentally the fact the only linked source on this article is no longer active underscores the weakenesses in using online sources that fall behind subscription walls or simply expire. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:52, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To redirect suggests that Large pathetic galaxy is an alternative name for something called the Virgo stellar stream. This isn't the case.

<dd>I think the original statement about a "a rather pathetic galaxy" attributed to Robert Lupton is now called the Virgo Overdensity,<a href="http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3841" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3841" rel="nofollow">[66]</a> or Virgo Stellar Stream. So I believe 23skidoo is correct and a redirect would be suitable.

<dd>I've had a quick look through this paper, and see no evidence that it is the same object that is described in Large peculiar galaxy.

<li>Okay, in the Reuters link where Lupton says "large pathetic galaxy", he's not using that as a name, so there shouldn't be a redirecting title. A trivial comparison suggests the actual object Lupton is talking about is surely <a href="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20060109.virgooverdensity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20060109.virgooverdensity.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and that SDSS release directs the reader to <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510589" class="external text" title="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510589" rel="nofollow">astro-ph/0510589</a> where the name "<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>" is proposed. Identity established, but as others have said, a redirect would be misleading so let's not merge. Instead of using any content from this page, I will write from scratch a blurb that includes "large pathetic galaxy" over at <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_Stellar_Stream_2b54.html" title="Virgo Stellar Stream">Virgo Stellar Stream</a>. That way the GFDL does not demand the revision history of this page (since I'm not cross-pollinating content), and searchers on google will still be able to find relevant information using a "large pathetic galaxy" search string (which may have entered the public consciousness, if someone used the phrase to start an article here). Anyway, that should resolve everything, and there's no need for a merge, so <b>delete</b>. <span style="white-space: nowrap">— <a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant: small-caps">l</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan">acan</a></span> — 07:15, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - normally I would agree with Noroton ... however this is an exception. Note that it is a <i>former</i> high school (the school closed in 1974). The article definitely has issues with <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> The "notable alumni" are not actually all that notable (six men who died in WWII) and there is confusion as to whether the article is about the school itself or about the <i>building</i> the school was housed in. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Good points, but the article is really about the high school and still seems to be useful as history. If it were merged, I think some worthwhile information would be lost. My little essay at <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_opinions_6a18.html" title="User:Noroton/opinions">User:Noroton/opinions</a> doesn't much depend on whether the school is defunct or not, although in time it becomes less worthy of inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b> Theres enough there to meet notability and theres a photo, a table and a reference. Its worth keeping and I think the history, graduate stuff should be added back, but rewritten, rather than just copied and then referenced.

<li><b>Delete</b> - now fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The problem is that the rest of the content is unverifiable unless a new source can be found. It is not possible to "added back, but rewritten, rather than just copied and then referenced" without brand new references. Rewriting a copied source in slightly different words still means that there is a copyvio. BTW I have put Outterbridge Grammar School up for speedy since all the substantive content is a lift from this source. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 00:40, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Surely, I thought, a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonewall_riots.html" title="Stonewall riots">gay</a> Masonic lodge would be notable. However, the "Stonewall" here does not appear to refer to this. It is in the American South, so perhaps the reference is to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jackson_b9cd.html" title="Thomas Jackson">this man</a>. I never found out what the "Stonewall" <i>actually</i> refers to, though, because there are <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22%27Stonewall+Masonic+Lodge+No.+296%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22%27Stonewall+Masonic+Lodge+No.+296%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Search+Archives" rel="nofollow">no reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObiterDicta_b9a4.html" title="User:ObiterDicta"><b>ObiterDicta</b></a> <small>( <a href="../../../o/b/i/User_talk%7EObiterDicta_88da.html" title="User talk:ObiterDicta">pleadings</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ObiterDicta_3d4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ObiterDicta">errata</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_ObiterDicta_8ff5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/ObiterDicta">appeals</a> )</small> 06:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article claims that it's eligible to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but I can't find any documentation on the <a href="http://www.nr.nps.gov" class="external text" title="http://www.nr.nps.gov" rel="nofollow">National Register Information System</a> or within their new listings that the building has been determined eligible. It's possible that someone is still working on the nomination. I'm going to make a <b>weak</b> recommendation to <b>delete</b> this article for now, but if the history of the building was expanded to mention why it's historic within the county or state, then I could certainly change my mind. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> - <a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a> 21:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the article is an extreme stub which is unlikely to be expandable. As stated in the nom, the article confuses the building with the organization that meets in it. Neither is notable. As has been mentioned, the building is not on the Register of Historic Places, and the organization is mearly the local chapter of a much larger organization (which does have its own article). <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> cruft. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:53, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> "Kite" and "Peace on Earth". "Kite" is one of U2's most significant songs of recent years in terms of theme and its sound arrangement, and was a big concert production number during the Elevation Tour; its closing reference to the New Media also marks it as a time capsule of sorts. "Peace on Earth" is Bono's big-plea-for-world-piece-number of that album; you could write an article just tracing the political/philosophical evolution found in those songs. The idea that U2 songs should be ranked in notability by the semi-accident of whether they happen to be released as a single in some country or other is very faulty; <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_%28U2_song%29_35fb.html" title="Bad (U2 song)">Bad (U2 song)</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullet_the_Blue_Sky_337d.html" title="Bullet the Blue Sky">Bullet the Blue Sky</a> are far more significant than <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staring_at_the_Sun_101a.html" title="Staring at the Sun">Staring at the Sun</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_of_the_Species_541c.html" title="Original of the Species">Original of the Species</a>, for example. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 17:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think we should play around with relative notability. (ie, this song compared to that, eytc). The fact is that Bad is notable, it doesn't need to be compared. Kite (as great a song as it is) in terms of notability has nothing on Bad. Furthermore, what is actually gained by having a seperate article? What is the advantage? In fact if anything, if it helps the album article then I'm all for it. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 12:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I still do not myself see why these two songs cannot be explained on the album's page rather than have separate articles. Peace on Earth already has an unlinked mention on the <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omagh_Bombing_b54b.html" title="Omagh Bombing">Omagh Bombing</a> page and there is no reason why that can't be linked to the album. Single release is not the sole criteria for a song to notable independently of its album, but if a song has not been released separately then I contend that it really would have to become properly world famous to warrant its own article and (as lovely as these songs are) I don't think these songs are that well known in circles outside of U2's fans. <a href="../../../a/1/o/User%7EA1octopus_952d.html" title="User:A1octopus">A1octopus</a> 18:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment response</b>. If your criteria for notability is "world famous and known by non-U2-fans", then Bullet the Blue Sky and Bad both flunk too. You better merge them back into their album articles, right now! Indeed, there are by <a href="../../../u/2/_/Category%7EU2_songs_f462.html" title="Category:U2 songs">Category:U2 songs</a> 116 U2 song articles, and I bet only 15 or so of them are really world famous and known by non-U2-fans.

<li><b>Keep</b> because this song as well as all other U2 songs are perfectly notable. Just because the song was not a single does not mean it is not notable. An article exists for just about every U2 song on every album, and if this one should get deleted, so should all the others. There is no reason to delete this article or any of the other articles for the songs on this album. I even added a citation for this article to further support its importance. There is much to say about this song in its article, therefore it should be kept. –<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashintome4196_49cb.html" title="User:Crashintome4196">Crashintome4196</a> 04:17, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because asserting notability does not make them notable. Significant history of a song to the band is not the same as significance to the world at large. All of this information can be discussed within the album's article. Our policy is generally that non-notable non-singles do not get their own articles. GassyGuy 11:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Kite. There is enough detail on Kite that can be used (information about its progression live, how the meanings changed, etc.) that would not be kept in the ATYCLB article because it would be too much. I think it should be a song-by-song basis for U2's material. For example, and article about songs like 4th of July, So Cruel, or The Playboy Mansion would be unnecessary, as there is little material that couldn't be given in the respective album articles. But the details found in Kite's article are enough to warrent keeping it. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillies26_75ec.html" title="User:Phillies26">Phillies26</a> 21:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as indiscriminate list of trivia about, mostly, Anime and video games. As is usual for articles of this type, this one was created in October last year to remove the irrelevant "popular culture" section of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metatron.html" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> which is quite a good article.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I could go either way on this one, and don't want to vote (yet), but if it is kept, it should be discriminated. In other words, the more trivial references should be removed and then the raw list should be segmented into sub-sections like Anime, Literature, Movies and film, etc. that would at least make it more readable. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 22:50, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It could be less completely crappy, I agree. However, per <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> the end goal here has to be an article, not a list of disassociated facts. Unless we at least <i>start</i> on that goal, we aren't making progress: indiscriminate facts will just be added back in again. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:41, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as an indiscriminate collection of information and directory seeking to capture not only every reference to the angel Metatron with no regard to its importance or context, but of anything that happens to be called "Metatron" whether it has anything to do with the angel or not. <b>Strongly oppose</b> merging any of it back to the main article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:02, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we do so, we should probably remove the redirect left behind; I don't like the implications of "Metatron in popular culture" pointing to a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b>. I agree that most of the passing mentions should be deleted. But should there also be no mention of the fact that he/she/it was featured as a major character in <i><a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">Dogma</a></i>? Whether we like it or not, actual persons, groups, or concepts are at times notably featured in popular culture. Seeing the word "Metatron" on a poster in the background of a movie <i>obviously</i> has no place in WP, but a major character in a controversial movie? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:24, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Characters of similar importance in other fictional universes have had articles written about them, so in theory an article Metatron (Dogma) could be created, although the character was, as I recall, not an especially central one. Also, if someone were to write a coherent article about the Metatron myth in modern times (which is what this article would be if it was trying to live up to its title, rather than being a list of trivia), that reference probably would and should be integrated. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 20:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do not think the character was sufficiently central to the movie that a Metatron (Dogma) article is justified. However, I believe the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metatron.html" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> article should have <i>some kind</i> of reference to this. An article about the myth in modern times would be <i>wonderful</i>, but it doesn't exist unfortunately. Although I agree that these "in popular culture" articles need to be purged (and usually deleted), I feel the most important parts should be merged. The question is: how? <i>How do we include the main "popular culture" portrayals of an entity (real or fictional) in the main article without opening the way for a list of pointless trivia?</i> I believe the answer is monitoring: Create "in popular culture" sections in articles, but require that any new entries be sourced by <i>secondary</i> sources, and remove <i>any</i> that are not sourced as such. If a popular culture portrayal was significant enough for someone else to write about it, then it probably deserves mention. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Italian_Americans_5f49.html" title="List of Italian Americans">List of Italian Americans</a> is ridiculously incomplete and could be 20 times its current length and still not be exhaustive, and I'm sure you could say that for any of the six or seven major ethnic groups in America.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with Vicjm about having the same policy for all ethnic lists at once. I feel very, very uncomfortable with a phony "Caucasian" list up for deletion and the only real ethnic group whose list is up for deletion is African American. The exact same arguments could be made for all major ethnic group lists. I don't know how to nominate a lot of lists in one deletion discussion. I hope somebody else will.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> change to <b>Weak Delete</b>.</s> CHANGE TO <b>STRONG KEEP</b> (reasons in comment below labeled "Reasons") Way too broad a category.

<li><b>Response</b> The problem, Black Falcon, is that limiting the list to "only the notable ones" would still leave a list of gargantuan proportions. There are a LOT of notable African Americans; far too many for a list like this to ever hope to compile. The fact of the matter is that notability simply does not narrow the spectrum sufficiently. For one obvious example: a significant majority of NBA players are African American (80% is one statistic I've seen). Furthermore, if I'm not mistaken, every NBA player is also considered "notable." Accordingly, wouldn't nearly all NBA players be appropriate candidates for this list? I would think not, as this would dilute the list to meaninglessness (a backup pointguard on the Knicks just isn't on the same level as Martin Luther King and Miles Davis). All the African American players in the NFL or Major League would also be appropriate for this list. Including these "notable" individuals would render any attempt to compile a list of truly "great" African Americans ineffectual. To have any meaning or utility, a list like this would necessarily have to introduce a higher standard (double secret notability anyone?). This leaves aside the question, of course, concerning whether or not a list of "great" African Americans would be overly subjective and not encyclopedic... <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicjm_5b6f.html" title="User:Vicjm">Vicjm</a> 23:18, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>True, it would be long, but the same problem applies to the category, and it's no easier to navigate a category with 1000s of entries than a list with same amount.

<li><b>Response</b> Black Falcon, how do we define notability for purposes of this list? Having a Wikipedia article or a good prospect of having one? If so, this list could get very, very long. If we set a higher standard, what is that standard? I'd be interested in what you think of <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists of American Jews</a> as an alternative way of organizing. I agree, lists are more helpful than categories.

<li>Noroton, I think that method of proceeding (further subdividing by occupation) is ideal. However, that can only be achieved through a merge and not a delete.

<li><b>Responding to Falcon's claim about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a></b> - clearly, there is nothing in the plain text of the policy that says the eight things listed there is or was ever intended to be an exhaustive list of the only things ever that could possibly be considered indiscriminate information. List of blue things is not barred but such a list would not pass <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. List of people by favorite ice cream would not stand under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> despiter there not being a specific "no listing people by ice cream" section in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Dozens of articles that do not exactly fit one of the eight specified items have been deleted as indiscriminate collections of information in the last couple of weeks and Falcon has participated in the debates for many of them so why there is this continued insistence that only things that exactly meet one of those eight criteria can possibly be considered indiscriminate information remains a mystery to me. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Otto, if it's not on the list, you can't say the policy supports you! How about if I suddenly feel that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> includies biographies on U.S. presidents? Sure, it's not on the list, but then again, if it's not exhaustive that doesn't matter. Of the dozens of articles that have been deleted, I have suggested to delete in probably over &gt;70% of cases. However, my reason for the suggestion has rarely been <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, as other criteria applied. Also, this list is nothing like the "in popular culture" articles, so the comparison cannot stand. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notion of comparing a sourced verified biography of a president to a list of people who happen to share a common continent of origin is, to put it bluntly, amazingly stupid. There is no comparison between the two. The notion of asserting that a well-sourced verified biography might possibly run afoul of NOT#IINFO is similarly amazingly stupid. There is absolutely no support for your assertion that only the Big 8 can be considered indiscriminate by the simple fact that <i>other kinds of articles have been deleted as indiscriminate</i>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/Res_ipsa_loquitur.html" title="Res ipsa loquitur">Res ipsa loquitur</a>, to borrow a term of law. And whether or not you <i>agreed</i> with the deletions of those articles you've seen AFDed as indisciminate collections, the fact remains, as I said, that you've <i>seen</i> them deleted for being indiscriminate collections and it is your assertion of the Big 8 as exhaustive that cannot stand. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let us, for a moment, put aside the issue of your incivility. You make two errors in your post above. First, the quality of sourcing of an article has no relevance as to how it stands in relation to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. Second, "African Americans" share more than a common continent of origin: they also share their nationality and their status as a minority in the U.S. Race is a major issue in the United States, and it would not be if classification by "continent of origin" was an indiscriminate criterion. Now with regard to my comment. The presidential biography was <i>an example</i> intended to demonstrate a general principle. That principle being: the Big 8 (as you've named them) are those types of articles for which a consensus exists. Sufficient consensus <i>does not</i> exist for other types of articles, just as sufficient consensus does not (will not, should not) exist for excluding the hypothetical example of presidential biographies. Dozens of articles were deleted, but you fail to mention that dozens were kept. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In spite of Usedup's recent nomination, it seems that the concensus of those voting delete is that the list is too broad and too large. I agree, but as some have noted, these lists are terribly useful. Especially this one, as each entry includes a few words on who the person is. From the AfD of other lists, one commenter noted, "as the anonymous parent of two Puerto Rican schoolchildren, I can assure you that this list is a primary source of information that at least one of my kids will consult on a weekly basis to do school assignments. Administrators should take into account the users' needs and, as a user, this list is invaluable!" As such, I think that we should try sorting and any category that is overlarge we should send into a sublist. Even if this list is deleted in its current form, it will probably become a super-list of lists organized by occupation. If anyone is interested, stop by <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_List_of_African_Americans_6e35.html" title="User:Smmurphy/List of African Americans">User:Smmurphy/List of African Americans</a> and do some sorting. Once its sorted, we can create sublist articles for the larger lists, and put whats left back into this article.

<li>The games in superettan was probably of the kind where Falkenberg was in for a clear win and Astrit came in the last 6 minutes. That is a way of giving them playtime and pushing up the price by saying he played in real games. Very common in Sweden.

<li>I think that the professional or not thing is barking up the wrong tree. Falkenbergs play in the second highest division in Sweden, and some have said that they are a fully professional club. It's not like we'd go around deleting famous Rugby Union players from before the professional era is it? Admittedly this kid isn't all that famous, but he's not exactly unknown.

<p>I just wanted to eliminate fruitless searching in Google for the wrong name, for those looking for notability. Even so, despite the fact that he has won academic awards, there's an issue if this is enough to qualify for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requirements. - <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsfullofstars_bea3.html" title="User:Itsfullofstars">Itsfullofstars</a> 00:16, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added some of the above sources to the article. Complicating matters in searching for notability is that he seems sometimes prefers to go by the nickname "Abdi". <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22abdi+farah%22+%22owings+mills%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22abdi+farah%22+%22owings+mills%22" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>. He seems to be an athlete as well as having artistic talent, although that is likely to have little bearing on whether the article is kept. - <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsfullofstars_bea3.html" title="User:Itsfullofstars">Itsfullofstars</a> 02:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>: It kind of seems like this is an article about a particularly good student. Though it has too many notable national awards for me to ignore, do we then create articles on winners of the annual NG Geography Bee or the other winners listed alongside this one in the sources? It would only be fair, but the whole thing would be a collection of, to me, less than important knowledge. You can see my conundrum. One solution would be to create an article on the awards themselves, and have lists of winners which would contain a very brief summary of all that is notable (And besides, almost or all of what is important about this article is that they the won the award). <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanMD80_c3b4.html" title="User:SeanMD80"><font style="italic" color="#008B8B">Sean</font><font color="#008080">MD80</font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESeanMD80_b065.html" title="User talk:SeanMD80">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SeanMD80_8829.html" title="Special:Contributions/SeanMD80">contribs</a></sup> 02:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
