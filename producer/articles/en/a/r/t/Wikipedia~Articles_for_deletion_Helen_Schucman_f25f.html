<dd><b>Comment</b>. Helen Schucman was actually considered by most who knew her to be a highly intelligent and intellectual woman. As is discussed on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> article (an article Ste4k wants deleted), Helen Schucman never literally meant that Jesus was the source of A Course in Mircales.

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a> itself is largely unsourced and unverifiable, and appears to hope to establish notability by being listed in this encyclopedia rather than being notable in the first place. Most of its articles were written by two people who suffer from too much information looking for a topic. The creeping-artikalism of such a category in itself required at least six speedy deletes for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, there is a great deal of verifiable evidence about A Course In Miracles. You simply will not accept this. I wish you would stop wasting everyone's time and stop trying to call attention to yourself and get everyone's approval. As per the large amounts of Google hits and its Amazon.com sakes ranking, it is obvious that ACIM hardly needs Wikipedia to establish its notability. ACIM was notable BEFORE the invention of Wikipedia. And the authorship of the book is indeed established, and is in fact discussed on the pages <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, pages which, if you had your way, others would not be able to read because they would be deleted.</dd>
<dd>The issue is not whether ACIM is notable or not, but that you <i>don't want</i> ACIM to <i>be</i> notable. I find this fascinating. I find you fascinating. Please share more about yourself with the rest of us. So far, we know that you are new to Wikipedia and don't like ACIM. Is there anything more you'd like to share? -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 19:08, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Important Comment</b> I think that my contributions page is available for anyone to look at, and it can speak for itself. Per the acronym "ACIM", the cited sources, specifically the court case, show that the other cited sources are all one board of directors and three different names for the same group. The logo "ACIM" is also a registered trademark. As an editor concerned for the sake of the encyclopedia, I believe that using registered trademarks is a means of gaining brand acceptance. I don't feel that it is necessary to provide a brand name in an article, but most especially since the book itself is out-of-print and in the public domain. That in my opinion is providing a severe POV and can be construed as a means of attracting business to the owners of the trademark "ACIM" which are listed currently as the other cited sources. Those cited sources should also be considered as primary sources rather than secondary sources since the court case points out plainly that they are all of the same association which failed to establish copyrights for the book in the first place. Ste4k 07:42, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I hope everyone is aware that Ste4k has a personal vendetta against all ACIM-related articles on Wikipedia. In addition to supporting the deletion attempt of the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, this user has initiated deletion attempts of the following ACIM-related articles: <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, Kenneth Wapnick, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>. And on the main ACIM page, this editor will not accept anything, not even the official sites of Foundation for ACIM and Foundation for Inner Peace, as acceptable sources. Personal bias masked as attempt to uphold Wikipedia guidelines (all the while ignoring Wikipedia guidelines by trying to deprive Wikipedia of articles about a notable topic). -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 18:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The conduct of an editor with respect to an article has no logical connection with whether the article should be kept (with the possible exception of an editor writing a vanity article). I have looked at some of these articles and think that while Wikipedia should have an article on ACIM and on each of the authors, the other articles should either be merged (if they contain useful information) or deleted outright as, to use a wikilogism, <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamicruftisement</a>. I was not aware of the existence of some of the articles on your list and will review them too. Thinking that crappy, POV articles should be deleted rather than improved is a common mistake for new editors to make, so let's not bite the newbies, assume good faith and be civil. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 19:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

I tried to work out our disagreements on his/her talk page, to no avail. This editor has repeatedly, and erroneously, given the false implication that the only reason I am interested in keeping these pages from being deleted is because I am making money off of ACIM. That is false, and perhaps even liable.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> can hardly qualify as a cult when it is only a book. I am a "student" of the Course, which means that all I do is read the book. I attend no meetings, and do not interact with anyone (aside from the Internet) on a daily basis who reads the Course. I have altered no behavior in my daily lifestyle as a result of reading the Course. It isn't a cult. Just a book. And I'm not saying you said this, but just to clarify, I didn't create all of these ACIM-related articles. I agree that some of them are of dubious importance, such as the ACIM church movement one, and a few others (come to think of it, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_Healing_eb20.html" title="Attitudinal Healing">Attitudinal Healing</a> may not be of note either).

Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as “verifiable” websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations.

<li><b>Comment</b> - One could, with at least as much accuracy, question your own bias, seeing as your contribution list shows that you are significantly invested in these articles. For my part, I'm failing to see why believing that the entire ACIM movement (and thus, all related articles) is non-notable constitutes <i>prima facie</i> bad faith, nor what is objectionable about Ste4k's proper insistence on unbiased <i>third party</i> websites for verification; of course we're not going to take ACIM's uncorroborated word for its claims about itself, any more than we would about any other subject's own website. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 00:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The only "investment" is an investment in fairness. This editor is claiming that ACIM is not notable and not even a verifiable phenomenon, which is tantamount to saying that ACIM doesn't even exist. When we present the official websites of ACIM in attempts to prove that ACIM <i>does</i> exist and <i>is</i> notable, this editor ignores that and says they are not suitable.</dd>

<dd>Because I do read ACIM, it goes without saying that these articles are of interest to me. But that isn't the issue at hand. The issue is that most editors agree that ACIM is a notable topic, and this person is on his/her own campaign to contradict what is the consensus of many neutral editors.</dd>

<dd>You have presented only the flimsiest of assertions as your "facts". Plainly the same editor has filed these AfDs, but I've done the same when I've filed an AfD and found several linked and equally non-notable articles. So far, the vast majority of your contributions to these AfD debates involves spamming them all to claim vendetta, and far less about what elements of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and the notability guidelines you believe these articles meet. Myself, I'd prefer to see less smokescreen and more debate on the merits, please. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 06:38, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you agree that what I have presented is factual (that all these deletion nominations are filed by the same person), then how can it be a smokescreen? I suppose I've offered a factual smokescreen. Interesting.</dd>

<dd>The point in noting that this person filed many deletion attempts of related articles is in noting that this person singles out the same topics, likely because he/she doesn't like them personally. Personal dislike of a particular genre does not justify deletion of articles related to the genre.</dd>

<dd>The other thing that makes me think that this person does not like this genre and is attempting to rid Wikipedia of it, is that this person will not accept ANY verification that these topics <i>exist</i>. If you offer this person the official sites of these organizations, he/she cries "spam". If you offer the link to the Amazon.com or Barnesandnoble.com listings to demonstrate notability by way of high sales rank, again, he/she cries "spam". If you offer an article that discusses the notability of the topic, he/she contests the qualifications of the person who wrote the article. And then, after all of this has failed, the person turns around and accuses you of being "too close" to the article, in my case alledging that I'm making money off of this (all without evidence, I might add; I make NO money off of ACIM). There is no winning with this person. It becomes evident that he/she just doesn't like this topic at all.</dd>

<dd>I agree that the article is not very well written at present. I didn't start this article and I only started working on it after this deletion nomination.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A rather obvious keep to me. We have many articles on much less read authors. As we should. If the article has POV issues or other flaws then fix them, don't just delete. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 08:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or, fail that <b>merge</b> per jzg. Seems like a few committed sould running around filling up WP with diverse content spun from the ACIM to give the fringe movement a reputable web presence and then preying upon the good faith assumptions and consensus approach of WP editors. Bringing an article to AfD is designed to promote <i>discussion</i> and certainly does not entail automatic deletion. Insofar as this debate helps clarify the value of such articles, accusations of bad faith are unhelpful and come across as contrarian. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Talk about a lack of good faith.... I am not the one who started this article or most of the other articles that Ste4k is nominating for deletion. They were mostly started by another guy whose intentions you are not aware of. I think they were started by him because he truly believed these were notable topics. To be honest, I myself, a student of the Course, was surprised that he thought certain things about ACIM deserved pages. But on the other hand, I think it is wrong that Ste4k (or whatever) is attempting to have all these pages deleted simply because he/she doesn't like this topic. That's all any of this is really about. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 21:25, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This one seems obvious... <b>keep</b>. No idea who she is, never read her book, but it has sold millions of copies apparently. Authors of works such as this are notable. I did a little research and found her name in many publications. Need me to name them? While the content of the article may need work, ithe entire article need not be deleted. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">LV</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 14:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
