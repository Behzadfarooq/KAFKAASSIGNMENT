<h2><span class="mw-headline">What we've got so far</span></h2>
<p>Here's what we've settled on so far (just edit this list as consensus is reached on different things):</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a weekly collaboration to overhaul sub-par articles, hopefully elevating them to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article_4840.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article">Featured Article Status</a>.</li>
<li>Candidates will not be stubs.</li>
<li>AID will have ten candidates per week, which will be voted on by registered WP users. Any additional nominations will be placed on a waiting list.</li>
<li>Each week (say, every Sunday, like on COTW) the two articles on the 'active' list will be chosen as AID articles for the duration of that week. The other eight articles will be dropped to the bottom of the waiting list (unless this is their second time through, in which case they will be dropped off the list completely, do not pass go, do not collect $200).</li>
<li>Any article which does not make AID status will be placed at the bottom of the waiting list and rotated through again. After an article's second time through rotation, it will be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Stub Snub: Reloaded</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I had a bit of a radical idea I'd like to run past you guys. Why do articles have to be stubs <i>at all</i> in order to be COTW candidates? Why not just take <i>any</i> sub-par article and overhaul it? I got this idea from the people at the Music COTW. I admit this would make the COTW and Peer Review pretty much the same thing, but beyond that, all the benefits are good.</li>
</ul>
<p>...boy, that last sentence looks like something from Yogi Berra, doesn't it? -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 23:33, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think PR is more for <i>good</i> articles that people want to get to featured quality, while this is for <i>bad</i> articles to get to featured quality. The thing is now there are nice black-and-white rules defining a "bad" article. I'm borderine as to whether those rules should be relaxed. –&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamurai_ba1f.html" title="User:Flamurai">flamurai</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../f/l/a/User_talk%7EFlamurai_f545.html" title="User talk:Flamurai">t</a>) 01:05, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps there should be a second general-purpose CotW, one for stubs/non-existent article and one Peer Review of the Week for a reasonable article on a major subject. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 01:21, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would be interested in a nonstub COTW. I'd prefer to work on broader topics than the ones usually listed here. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 05:17, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Specifics?</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps we should start to formulate goals and criteria for a general-purpose article quality project? Obviously the first being it should not be a stub, as that's COTW territory. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 06:51, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, here's an idea to start that discussion: Any nonstub article be considered. ("Nonstub" being at discretion of voters, but at least more than a paragraph.) Only five nominations would be voted on for each week. (That is intended for simplicity.) Further nominations would go on a "pending" list and be considered five at a time, in turn. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 07:19, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why only five? I see your point: it's harder to look over full-length articles than stubs, but five a week would make the bottleneck too small...how about ten? And we need to think of a name for this. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 00:29, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, 10 is fine. But I think we should only consider a week at a time. That is, the nine that don't make it can be added to the bottom of the "pending" list by the nominator or get dropped off. I'm not sure how well I'm saying this. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 05:40, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's what I think you're saying: Articles A through J are nominated. Then, H gets picked. A and the others get dropped back to the bottom of the stack, behind all the newer noms. Interesting. But how will they be eliminated? There has to be an elimination round or something so they don't pile up forever. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 00:16, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That sounds like a good policy. Maybe after the second or third time an article has been considered, it will be eliminated rather than going back to the pending list; that would eliminate having to vote out old articles. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 04:04, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My only only worry there is that some nominations could go through, conceiveably, four rounds of consideration (if there is a short list) or only one consideration (when there is a long list). I think that it should be based on number of times it has been considered, not merely time. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 00:29, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point. Maybe my idea is too complicated, at least until we have a better idea of how many articles and people will actually be involved.</dd>
<dd>Maybe it would be simplest just to start with the procedures used for the main COTW and then we could re-evaluate as needed. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 05:23, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As 11 of 42 nominations on COTW currently only have one vote, note that the 'waiting list' idea gives the opportunity of letting articles sit until they are seconded. Not sure how solid the waiting list is, but thoughts on that extension? <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 05:53, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That articles not be moved out of <i>Pending nominations</i> until at least one person agrees with the nominee and signs. If we're only voting on 10 nominations per week, that'd help reduce duds that no one would vote for. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 06:08, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Goals" id="Goals"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Goals</span></h3>
<p>So far it seems such a project would select non-stub articles and improve them. Alright, now improve them how? I suggest we consider at least some of our goals be to ensure NPOV, ensure it is comprehensive in factual scope and summarizing every major viewpoint, and attribute/reference every major claim/argument. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 23:27, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those are fine goals, but I expect they are something to reach for more than something that will be achieved on a regular basis. Time will tell. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 05:23, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Multiple "winners"</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps it would be beneficial to run a few 'winners' each week. If these are non-stubs, the contributions one can make may be more specific to a field of knowledge, and we'd be leaving a lot of people idle I'm sure if only one article per week was nominated (and genre-specific COTWs have had difficulty keeping participation adequate). <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 04:51, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point, but I am concerned that multiple winners would dilute the collaboration too much. Maybe as a compromise, it would be good to start with two winners and then re-evaluate in a few weeks. Also, hopefully the nominators will be able to direct people to good sources. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 06:24, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because so far, we only have a couple items on the pending list, I'm thinking maybe we should tweak our planned procedures until we get at least 10 items on the list. For instance, we could just remove whatever items have the single lowest number after a full week.</p>
<p>That is, if we have one article with only one vote, it gets removed. Or if we have the articles with the fewest number of votes have two votes, they get removed.

<dd>A limit of two runs was specifically mentioned before. By getting rid of this, we are having articles run for their fourth week almost non-stop and accumulate votes in a way that is essentially COTW's long, drawn-out voting. This is really defeating the purpose of AID's supposedly faster voting, of not waiting a month from proposal to actual work being done. With only the two most popular and two least popular articles being dropped, six articles will continue on with enough votes that they are very unlikely to be the least popular in the next round of voting, essentially discriminating against newer nominations (two of the four new will be the least popular then) and giving us a pool of half-there nominations which need only show up enough times before they accumulate votes. Again, that is slow and COTW-like. I strongly disagree with this. <a href="../../../1/1/9/User%7E119.html" title="User:119">119</a> 18:29, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think maybe things got a little confused because we started off with so few articles that we didn't initially need the Pending list. This is my understanding of what we agreed to:

<li>the top two of the ten become AID,</li>
<li>the bottom two are dropped off the list,</li>
<li>the other six are dropped back down to the bottom of the pending list,</li>
<li>articles are limited to two weeks on the current nominations list (not the pending list, and the weeks don't need to be consecutive.</li>

<p>I don't think nominations are a good milemarker, anyone can put them in, we can have a hundred today, if you want. Many of the nominations were made by me in the course of a kind of regular maintenance and in an attempt to give people options of all areas to vote for. The real success would be people actually <i>participating</i> in expanding/footnoting/illustrating or otherwise improving the article that won the most votes. This situation has not changed since my attempt at revamping the site: the participation is as low as ever, even though it is slightly better on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade.html" title="Trade">Trade</a> this week, I have to admit. And of course participation was lower before that because of the downtime and then it was lower this week because of the 4th of July and from now on it is expected to be lower because people are on vacation. So there is no sign of improvement on the improvement drive, but because of these inhibiting factors we can be glad it is holding up at all. (Maybe we should close some of the COTWs down for two weeks in summer?) I am thinking that the problem goes deeper: people just don't know what to do on the IDRIVE, as opposed to the main COTW, where the goal is clear: fill it with text and there are enough people to have the guarantee of the satisfaction of an almost complete article by the end of the week. The articles under consideration for the IDrive are usually much more complicated to do. Not that it would make the IDrive obsolete, but, in the long run, I believe, the thematic COTWs or COTMs will probably prove more efficient in improving non-stub articles. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 8 July 2005 07:30 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I really do doubt that. The themed COTWs all tend to fall apart after a while - the only one with any real staying power is the Gaming COTW, which has survived all its contemporaries except the COTW and the AID/TWID. But still, I do see more participation here now than I ever saw while I was running it. Trust me on this one point, thought: <i>Do not shut it down as a temporary measure.</i> You will most likely just drive away anyone that's left. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 8 July 2005 16:47 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I did not mean the IDrive or the big COTWs, but some of the smaller collaborations.

If you put restrictions on voting it will restrict voting for sure and maybe even participation.<br />
The lack of participation is probably due to the summer vacations and I don't think you can do much about it now. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 11:19, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that one of the problems, speaking as an outsider and non-participant, is that trying to do two articles per week, especially on the large, comprehensive topics that seem to be the ones most often nominated, is just trying to do way too much. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the time for improvements from a week to a fortnight, but start a new project each week so that you have overlapping projects</li>
<li>Try working with some of the different Wikiprojects and Regional notice boards
<ol>
<li>Ask for articles that they think they may need some "outside" help with</li>
<li>Another suggestion is to look for articles that overlap two or more WikiProjects</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Try to pick a few articles that will be quick and easy to improve instead of always going for the big topics—even try occasionally for a topic that might be fun or even a bit silly</li>
</ol>
<p>Just a few suggestions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 23:09, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've changed my mind. The list is starting to balloon out of control, and I think that all articles in August and thenceforth should require 4 votes weekly.

<dd>I had been wondering this same thing, Cuivienen. I noticed very little change made to the Rome article, with most of that change having been made by myself. I am nearly convinced I will not be participating in AID any longer. Perhaps those that vote should be obligated, to the extent we can enforce any "obligation", to contribute in improving the article they vote upon. I'm really hoping this same fate does not befall the Italy article, my own nomination. <a href="../../../s/i/c/User%7ESicilianmandolin_1854.html" title="User:Sicilianmandolin">Sicilianmandolin</a> 18:20, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you look above, this issue has been brought up many many times before, since this isn't a recent problem.

<p>I think the most visited articles, e.g. Maths, World War II, Western Philosophy, should be getting higher priority in terms of improvement and welcome discussion on this.

<ul>
<li>I'm unsure (that's why I'm asking), so my criteria are in flux, but here's what I have so far:
<ul>
<li>I tend to support bigger topics. I supported <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrimp.html" title="Shrimp">Shrimp</a>, which covered an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_%28biology%29.html" title="Order (biology)">order</a>, but did not support <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chum_salmon.html" title="Chum salmon">chum salmon</a>, because it was only one <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a>.</li>
<li>I've also been avoiding U.S.-centric topics, mostly because I think it helps combat <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. I'm probably wrong about that, but it makes me feel good about myself. :)</li>
<li>I've been picking topics I deem "important." This is probably the most fluctuating of my criteria, as what is important to me changes regularly, often based on the last person I talked to. This is the reason I did not vote for <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a>. —<a href="../../../d/-/r/User_talk%7ED-Rock_5fc2.html" title="User talk:D-Rock">D-Rock</a> 23:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The way it works. Articles have to "battle it out" to see who decides which one will get the best cleanup, often resulting users to look for other techniques that are longer and slower; that would mean users have to do it themselves, leaving a lot of stress on this and no back-up support. This page needs to find a better way to do this. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><font color="#007FFF">Iola</font></a><b><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_Esperanza_2625.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima/Esperanza"><font color="#50C878">k</font></a></b><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><font color="#007FFF">ana</font></a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKilo-Lima_aad1.html" title="User talk:Kilo-Lima"><font color="orange">T</font></a></sup> 22:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most users do have to do a lot of things themselves anyway. That's the wiki way - if you don't like something, fix it yourself . . . and if you don't know how, learn. Projects like this are attempts to help give a broader outlook that will improve some articles in quality. "Cleanup", as I understand it, is something that can be learnt and should be done by everyone. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 00:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Renomination guidelines?</span></h2>
<p>What is the policy on renomination? Is it allowed, or is an article 'disqualified' permanently if denied? If it is allowed, is there a certain time period that must elapse first, or can an article be renominated immediately? –<a href="../../../d/v/a/User%7EDvandersluis_3730.html" title="User:Dvandersluis">Dvandersluis</a> 15:04, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just wait a reasonable amount of time ... at least a month, in my view. That's all. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 15:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
