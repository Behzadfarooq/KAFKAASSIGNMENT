<p>This article is just a plot summary of a tv show episode. This fails part of Wiki policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, my understanding of "aspect of a larger topic" is that you can use a plot summary to say: this episode is important to pop culture/society/whatever...here is what happens in the episode...here is why what happens is important.

<li><strike><b>Keep</b> <b>Delete</b></strike> <b>Weak Delete</b>. I did not originally notice that there was a page (<a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a>) that laid down specific policies on this sort of thing. Per a violation of that page, I have changed my vote accordingly. As a postscript though, I'm not sure we should delete any and all articles that just need a bit of cleanup. Is it not possible that, considering the page is only a few weeks old, someone could have cleaned up the article with the appropriate sources in the future? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> 16:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)<strike>I have never heard of this show, nor do I want to see it, but a precedent has already been set for articles on a TV show episodes. Look at the articles <a href="../../../t/h/e/List_of_Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_episodes_58e8.html" title="List of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes">List of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_House_episodes_22f4.html" title="List of House episodes">List of House episodes</a>, and you will see that these shows have articles for almost every episode of their series. While this TV show certainly isn't as well known compared to my examples, as long as it recieves non-questionable third-party media coverage, then it mandates inclusion, in my humble opinion. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> 02:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</strike>
<ul>
<li>I don't know about House, but if you look at most any article on a Star Trek episode, it is more than simple plot summary. Plot summary alone does not make for an encyclopedia article. And seeing as how these are the only episodes with an article for the show and not a whole lot of activity in improving them, I don't see any reason to keep them. I mean, if you want to bring them all up the the level of quality of Star Trek episode articles, that'd be just great--but, good luck with that. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, a precedent has <i>not</i> been set. The best indicator of whether Wikipedia should have articles on individual episodes of television series is whether those episodes have <i>already</i>, <i>outside</i> of Wikipedia, been documented in detail individually, independently of the show's creators/producers/promoters. Episodes of series like <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Babylon 5</i> <b>have</b> been documented in detail, individually and independently. <i>That, not precedent,</i> is the basis upon which we can justify having articles on the individual episodes. Precedent, i.e. "If article X then article Y.", is a fundamentally flawed argument. To make a good argument, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a>, in this case sources where this episode of a television show has been individually documented in detail independently of its creators/producers/promoters. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:09, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Provisional Keep</b> as an episode of a notable TV show, I'd say it's a keep by default. However, this article should be tagged for clean-up and other improvement. Make it something more like the Avatar episodes. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In what way is this a "notable TV show"? Where are the books about it? Where are references to critical reception? <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was on KidsWB! and now the CW, and it involves derivations from long-established Looney Toons characters. Pretty much says notability for a television series to me. How is it not notable? Because some college professor hasn't taught a course on it yet? Oh well. I don't need that sort of thing. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is really something odd that I just discovered (and probably a nice little example of systematic bias) but the "Who shot J.R.?" episode of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_%28TV_series%29_fce9.html" title="Dallas (TV series)">Dallas (TV series)</a>, the second-most watched television episode of all-time, doesn't have its own article. It has simply a paragraph along with about 5 other notable episodes in the Dallas article. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This topic has been coming up a lot lately. Notability guidelines for fiction require that articles be MORE than just a summary and that they MUST provide real world context. Having articles for every single episode of every single tv show is a bit much, wouldn't you say? I've suggested that in cases where a show has lots of such articles that they be merged into articles covering the show by season, which also helps to place them in context with the show as a whole at least. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's funny that you would pair such a helpful suggestion with such a confrontational vote. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I vote on a number of AfDs daily anymore, it's not very confrontational, just an administrative type function that average editors on the Wikipedia do. The suggestion was to merge it into a broader article that covers the season in which it appeared; if there's nothing to merge it into, I <i>still</i> think it should be deleted. The article of an individual episode needs to be deleted regardless. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Having articles for every single episode of every single tv show is a bit much, wouldn't you say?</i> No, I'd say that's exactly what I'd like. Ok, not every single TV show, since game shows, for example, would rarely qualify, or news programs, and soaps would probably be a bit overwhelming, but for the most part, yes, I would like most TV shows to have an article. Oh, sometimes all the episodes might well be described in one page, but the important thing is to have the information. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 13:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per above.

<li><b>Delete —</b> Were this not a simple plot summary, but an article with a real-life subject, I would probably vote delete for the following reasons: Stinks of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>; no sources; few wikilinks; no cats and a non-notable (<a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>) subject. With it being an article about just one episode of a notable (as established by the fact that it has an article) TV series, I feel that it should definately be deleted - the text in it is really unneccesary, as all the inforamtion that most people need (and which should be on WP) is in the table. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_Esperanza_4562.html" title="User:Martinp23/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartinp23_2732.html" title="User talk:Martinp23">rtinp23</a></strong> 15:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
