Clarence Tan Ming Yew is a Singaporean who lives in the United Kingdom and embraces the British way of life. Ever since moving to the United Kingdom in 2002, Clarence has had a considerable amount of success in his education, chalking up a series of distinctions in his 'A' levels. Clarence, like a whole lot of his associates, is proudly unsingaporean. He is currently going through National Service in Singapore, where he will devote two years of his life to learning the art of dodging responsibility as part of the office culture experience. His avoidance of combat vocations is due to his asthma, which surprisingly disappears while he is engaged in the animal act of mating. A natural scholar, Clarence was begged into entry by Oxford University, where he is confirmed a place in its prestigious Medical School.</p>

<i><b>The Chosun Journal</b></i> is an independent, non-profit <a href="http://www.chosunjournal.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chosunjournal.com" rel="nofollow">website</a> that promotes human rights in North Korea. It was started in February 2001 and purports to be North Korea's first virtual holocaust museum set in real-time. In addition to serving as a portal to the latest news related to North Korean human rights, CJ <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/cRosett/?id=110002093" class="external text" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/cRosett/?id=110002093" rel="nofollow">reportedly networks</a> rescuers, refugees, defectors, government officials, intelligentsia, and the media to bring further momentum to the North Korean human rights movement. CJ is featured as a <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/favorite" class="external text" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/favorite" rel="nofollow">"favorite site"</a> of the editors of the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>CJ is premised on the belief that the more people know about the human rights atrocities happening in North Korea, the more pressure the world will bring to bear on the Stalinist regime, resulting in less leeway for Kim Jong Il to continue abusing the 21 million North Korean people with impunity. CJ has <a href="http://www.chosunjournal.com/campus.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chosunjournal.com/campus.html" rel="nofollow">hosted</a> alleged survivors of North Korean concentration camps to share their testimonies at U.S. college campuses and churches. CJ was also reportedly behind the <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=4463&amp;R=EB38314D4" class="external text" title="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=4463&amp;R=EB38314D4" rel="nofollow">asylum of four North Korean refugees</a> via an <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/6374" class="external text" title="http://www.worldmag.com/articles/6374" rel="nofollow">underground railroad</a>. Other CJ activities involve lobbying government bodies to pass bills that assist persecuted North Korean refugees hiding in China, and petitioning officials to grant leniency to those that are caught seeking asylum.</p>

<p>English Poet</p>
<p>Joseph Brian Woodcock is a very proud English citizen who lives in Essex. Joseph has written many famous poems, non of which are sadly on the internet. Although Joseph has an email address, he does not want any of his poems written on the internet because of many personal reasons. I however got my hand on one of Joseph's greatest love poems ever written;</p>
<p>The concept of my life is a good one, But there are moments in life, Which ends in sadness and tears, When living is no longer fun,</p>
<p>This one person was a friend, In my opinion still is a friend, But I'm not sure if she thinks the same way, My heart is reaching it's end,</p>
<p>Don't laugh at a boy who writes poems, Because a boy has emotion too, Cos I'm no longer a special person, To this person I knew,</p>
<p>She's my best friend, I don't wanna lose her, She's such a great friend, Or am I just a dreamer?</p>
<p>I've opened up my heart, And it got threw back in my face, Or is it all okay? Maybe my problem is just a trace,</p>
<p>I'm so confused, My opnion has changed through writing, The power of love has changed an opinion dramaticly, My friendship is actually growing,</p>
<p>Confusion is a powerful force, When love combines with it, A bond can be broken or not, But it'll cause serious ****.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about Joseph Woodcock, the famous English Poet has kindly left his email to me. Use it wisely please... <small>e-mail address removed</small></p>
<p>Please do not copy the poem written above as it is copywrited and we will be forced to take legal action.</p>
<p>¬© 2006 Woodcock Poems.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: If anyone copies any of Joseph Woodcock's Poems, including the one above, will be taken to the court of law if Joseph Woodcock chooses to. Personal poems are written but they must not be taken and changed. That will also count as counterfiet, and will not be tolerated. For more information, email Joseph at <small>e-mail address removed</small>. No purchase necessary. Joseph writes poems purely for enjoyment.</p>

<p>English Poet</p>
<p>Joseph Brian Woodcock is a very proud English citizen who lives in Essex. Joseph has written many famous poems, non of which are sadly on the internet. Although Joseph has an email address, he does not want any of his poems written on the internet because of many personal reasons. I however got my hand on one of Joseph's greatest love poems ever written;</p>
<p>The concept of my life is a good one, But there are moments in life, Which ends in sadness and tears, When living is no longer fun,</p>
<p>This one person was a friend, In my opinion still is a friend, But I'm not sure if she thinks the same way, My heart is reaching it's end,</p>
<p>Don't laugh at a boy who writes poems, Because a boy has emotion too, Cos I'm no longer a special person, To this person I knew,</p>
<p>She's my best friend, I don't wanna lose her, She's such a great friend, Or am I just a dreamer?</p>
<p>I've opened up my heart, And it got threw back in my face, Or is it all okay? Maybe my problem is just a trace,</p>
<p>I'm so confused, My opnion has changed through writing, The power of love has changed an opinion dramaticly, My friendship is actually growing,</p>
<p>Confusion is a powerful force, When love combines with it, A bond can be broken or not, But it'll cause serious ****.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about Joseph Woodcock, the famous English Poet has kindly left his email to me. Use it wisely please... <small>e-mail address removed</small></p>
<p>Please do not copy the poem written above as it is copywrited and we will be forced to take legal action.</p>

<p>Laura Esplin, born on the 18th of July, 1990 currently attends Cheltenham Girls High School. She is a year ten student, and has achieved outstanding success as a music student. She is rapidly becoming well known with her debut single, "believe". She is known to be an outgoing, charismatic person, and many can see her success as a rising star in the near future. She plays the piano, the flute and sings, and is always learning new instruments such as the guitar and the saxophone. Her twin brother, Scott is also noted for his talent as a singer, piano player and drummer. Many say that they can see the "Esplin" twins enter the musical industry with a great impact. Being only 16 years old, it is evident that they will be soon widely known, and Australia is informed to "watch out" for these new artists, as their unique talent for composing becomes increasingly popular.</p>

<p>Visual Tinkers (version 2.0) was created By Andrew Dowell and Mike Gough as a new fresh attempt at reaching our shared dream and a new adventure. In late 2001, after going to a web design exhibtion in London we didnt really have a clue what we wanted to do, or even how we where going to do it; but we had been inspired and had a direction.</p>
<p>Over 4 years later we are still very excited and evolving. Originally we just wanted to be actively involved in the World Wide Internet boom with all the new and exciting creative media possibilities. As a Web Design company we changed to a more general Design Solutions company as we didnt want to limit ourselves to just one type of media; and now it Fashion with the launch of our own clothing range!</p>
<p>We now have plans for world domination, watch this space!</p>

Laura Esplin, born on the 18th of July, 1990 currently attends Cheltenham Girls High School. She is a year ten student, and has achieved outstanding success as a music student. She is rapidly becoming well known with her debut single, "believe". She is known to be an outgoing, charismatic person, and many can see her success as a rising star in the near future. She plays the piano, the flute and sings, and is always learning new instruments such as the guitar and the saxophone. Her twin brother, Scott is also noted for his talent as a singer, piano player and drummer. Many say that they can see the "Esplin" twins enter the musical industry with a great impact. Being just 16 years of age, Australia is told to "watch out" for these new artists, known for composing their own unique music. As they become more incresably popular, it is aparent that they will shine in the music industry at such a tender age.</p>

<p>Mr Men Book: Number 7</p>
<p>Where does he live? Anywhere!</p>
<p>Mr Snow as you can imagine, is made of snow. When it snowed two days before Christmas, all the children were so excited because it had never snowed so much! It then became a bit of a problem because when Father Christmas came to deliver the presents to the children there was too much snow and he had to find someone to help him. He then saw a snowman that the children had built. He worked his magic and brought the snowman to life! Mr Snow and Father Christmas then made sure all the children got all the right toys.</p>
<p>Mr Snow Facts: ‚Ä¢ Every year, Father Christmas chooses a snowman to help him. So if you build one, then you better make sure it is a good once, because you never know, Father Christmas might choose yours!</p>

Fabeline was born in a small town called V√•ler in Norway in 1981. She grew up on a farm with four sisters and three brothers. The family had a computer (8088) and two horses. She and her famous fjord horse Maja Taran became Sol√∏r champions in show jumping in 1996. Her greatest intrests was animals, computers and astronomy. She got her fist telescope in 1998 and made her first computer program in GW-BASIC aroud 1990. In 1999 she went to space camp to And√∏ya Rocket Range, and became seti@home user of the day in 2002.</p>
<p>She is most famous for her popular diary at the internet. Some will call it for a blog, but it is more like the paper diary genre. Both programmed and written by herself. She started to write on the Internet in 1996, inspired by her oldest sister, Huldra. Huldra started to write in 1994, and was one of the first to write a public diary on the internet. She also won several prices for it. Unfortunately she deleted all her web pages when she had written for ten years. Fabeline wrote only for a year the first period, continued working with it in 2001. She then studied informatics at the University of Oslo, and got inpsired to work further with the diary. The diary became a masterpiece both in design, functionality and content.</p>
<p><b>Famous poem made by Fabeline:</b></p>
<p>Det var en gang ei loppe</p>
<p>Som var s√• flik t'√• hoppe</p>
<p>Men til slutt s√• m√•tt'n stoppe</p>
<p>for lokke' vakke oppe</p>

Who is Nisky Ponce? She is one great example of a model student. She doesn't recieve any awards, execpt for simple ones like MTAP (Mathematics Teacher's Association of the Philippines) and MTG (Math Teacher's Guild). Nisky is from Poveda and she is very cool. She wants you all to know that if you saw this, you are wierd because you were searching about her. Interesting enough, Veniece, as some people call her, loves you all. Yes this article is preety pointless, yes it is a waste of time, yes it is a waste of internet, but reading this article is very funny to her. Ha and another ha.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-30_041c.html" title="Edit section: Veniece and Nisky: Knowing the difference">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Veniece and Nisky: Knowing the difference</span></h3>
<p>Have you ever heard of a split personality? Well, I for one have. You see, I have a friend here named Veniece (or Nisky). She has a split personality.</p>
<p><i>Veniece is Nisky, and Nisky is Veniece. That's just how it is.</i> --Nisky/Veniece</p>
<p>What comes to your mind when you hear the name Veniece? Genius? Extraordinary? Gorgeous? Okay, so maybe those we are a little exaggerated, but nonetheless, Veniece is a pretty great girl. Slow to anger, and very open, Veniece always tries to be her best to socialize and be one great friend to all. Most of the time, you can see her laughing with friends and telling jokes and stories to them. Sometimes, she can be a bit shy, but that only happens to people who are not that close to her.</p>
<p>Veniece always tries to do her best at school, although sometimes she fails, she holds her head up high and smiles like nothing has happened. She is one of those people who take on anything life throws at her.</p>
<p>Veniece is also quite an achiever. She was able to rank 4th in advance science, and this is a great achievement for her because she doesn‚Äôt really study at all. So she may be a bit lazy, but hey, you just have to admit, she really is rather smart. Veniece is part of the varsity softball, and proud of it. She enjoys playing all kinds of sports and ends up doing it well.</p>
<p>Veniece enjoys making people laugh. She shares her wacky ideas, jokes, stories or wit to make a smile appear on anyone‚Äôs face. She enjoys the comical times with her friends so much, that she always tries to keep the laughter going. Although sometimes it can be green, Veniece tries to always make her friends smile because she knows that the memories of her friends will always be treasured.</p>
<p><br />
She always tries her best to be a compassionate, caring, understanding, thoughtful, friendly and trustworthy person. Veniece may sometimes seem sad, but in truth she feels so lucky to have the friends she has. Funny, smart, fun, sporty, witty and pretty, Veniece is one of the great friends you will have, and always will.</p>
<p><br />
And for Nisky, we have...</p>
<p>Nisky is a genuine filipina. Compare Veniece to a Maria Clara (see Jose Rizal's Novels: Maria Clara), and you can compare her to a cartoon character. Nisky has a million funny stories, jumping from how she almost killed her brother to how she makes teeth necklaces. Ask her about them later, if you can. Nisky makes friends with a million wierd people, because she enjoys the company and such. When she starts something, she tends to not finish it, sadly; probably because of boredom. She would like to get this trait out of her system.</p>

<p>Nisky is Veniece's nick name. She is very funny and is nothing much like Veniece. Veniece is a study-know-it-all smarty-pants with a reserved characteristic. Veniece is in the blooming process right now. Nisky is a dare-devil and full of risks and isn't afraid to show herself or be spontaneos.</p>
<p><i>Veniece is developing into the Nisky, and the Nisky is developing into the Veniece</i></p>

A concentration country is an advanced form of concentration camp , were a large group of people are against their will grouped together into a sealed area. The advantages of a concentration country to a concentration camp are numerous. Are the number of people in concentration camps limited to tens or even hundreds of thousands, the amount of people in a concentration country may easily be millions. Secondly a concentration country services its own country inmates, as inmates tend to lead more 'normal' lives were they enjoy currency, their own property, work and all the advantages of a country. This of course makes the concept more 'stealthy' and more difficult to recognize.</p>
<p>A concentration country may be recognized as follows&#160;:</p>
<p>- Walls prohibiting free traffic between at the countries borders - Inmates are defenseless against attacks from the surpressor(s) - Random kidnapping and or killing of inmates - Surpression of inmates by using food , energy and basic needs as bargaining tools</p>

<p>Jeanette's first national title was the English Schools junior 100m in 12.11 in 1997. In 1998 she was 2nd in the AAA U17 indoor 60m in 7.71 and at 100m outdoors was 3rd in the English Schools inters and AAA U17s (in 11.93w). She was 4th in the AAA indoor 60m, but missed the outdoor season in 1999. She was again 4th in the AAA Junior 60m indoors in 2001, in 7.66, and at 100m was 5th in the AAA U20s and 3rd in the English Schools (11.88w). After improving indoors at 60m in 2002 to 7.56, 7.54 and 7.52 to take the AAA U20 title, she had an early breakthrough at 100m to 11.70 at Loughborough and she made the British junior team, with 11.75 for third in her semi-final at 100m and running the first leg on the bronze medal winning 4x100m team at the World Junior Championships.</p>
<p>Now at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughborough_University_c16c.html" title="Loughborough University">Loughborough University</a>, studying politics and economics, Jeanette won the 2003 British Universities 60m indoors in 7.51 and was 6th in the AAAs in 7.55. After taking 0.08 off her pb with 11.62 in her semi, she was 2nd in the British Universities 100m. Then she was 2nd in the Inter-counties 100m and had an important win at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughborough.html" title="Loughborough">Loughborough</a> in 11.54 before making her senior international debut by running the third leg for the British 4x100m team at the European Cup. She won the AAA U23 title and was 7th in the European U23 100m in 11.61 after 11.59 in her heat. She was also 4th in the AAA 100m and reached the semi-finals of the World University Games 100m.</p>
<p>She consolidated her position amongst Britain's leading sprinters in 2004 with pbs for 200m at 23.66 and 23.62 and twice ran the 100m in 11.44w. She was AAA U23 champion and was 4th in the AAAs at 100m.</p>
<p>She has made further progress in the 2005 indoor season at 60m, as she ran 7.20 and 7.27 at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughborough.html" title="Loughborough">Loughborough</a> in January and further times of 7.22 and 7.27 before winning her first senior AAA title in 7.27, but was a little below this level with 7.33 and 7.34 at the European Indoors. She was held back by a hamstring injury in the outdoor season but returned to win the 100m/200m double at the AAA U23s and to be 2nd in the AAA 100m. She ran 11.66 in her heat but aggravated her hamstring injury in warming up for the final of the European U23s.</p>
<p>She started 2006 in fine form, with five indoor 60m times in the range 7.22 to 7.27 but, heading for a clear win in the AAAs, pulled a hamstring about 10m from the finish and collapsed in agony; she was unable to take her place in the British team at the World Indoor..</p>

<p>Early Years</p>
<p>The team started in 1986 as the Spital 69ers, with the name soon changing to Birkenhead Nighthawks. As with many teams at this time little money was available for equipment, but the team went ahead anyway, playing matches against other un-kitted teams.</p>
<p>At this time the other local team, Wirral Wolves, gained some financial backing, and some success even, playing home games at Prenton Park, home of Tranmere Rovers FC.</p>
<p>Despite their secondary position the Nighthawks continued to bring in players, one of whom was Gary Lee, who became instrumental in turning the team into a fully-kitted and competitive one.</p>
<p>In the first season of kitted football the team had two wins and six losses in the CGL Baron Division North.</p>
<p>At this time the Wirral Wolves, the Nighthawks local rivals, were having problems within the team, which meant that the Nighthawks were gaining new players. The team was going from strength to strength.</p>
<p>The following season the Nighthawks played in the newly formed British National Gridiron League. In addition, the struggling Cheshire Cats joined forces with the Nighthawks and the team began playing home matches at Oldershaw Rugby Club.</p>
<p>The Merseyside Nighthawks</p>
<p>Two years of consolidation followed with the team gaining promotion in the second year. Home games were now played at Bebington Oval. Over time other teams in the North West of England came and went as did many of the players.</p>
<p>It was now 1990 and the club gained sponsorship, which resulted in a change to white shirts. At this time the team from over the water, the Merseyside Centurians, folded. Now being the only team in the area, the Birkenhead Nighthawks changed their name to Merseyside Nighthawks.</p>
<p>That year the team narrowly missed out in the play-offs to eventual winners Barnsley Bears.</p>
<p>However, 1991 proved a difficult year. Promotion to the Premier Division meant competition was tough and many games were lost in the last few seconds.</p>
<p>Lessons were learned though and in 1992 the Nighthawks became Premier Division Champions.</p>
<p>Being champions turned out to be a mixed blessing. Now playing in the National Division, the teams nearest rival were the Glasgow Lions from Scotland. An away match meant an overnight journey to Glasgow, which proved to be a strain on both, the club finances and the players' families. After numerous meetings with all parties involved, a decision was made to pull out of that season and return the following year in a more appropriate league. Many players decided not to wait a full year and moved to various other teams.</p>
<p>January 1994 became the lowest point in the club's history when attempts to re-group failed and the books were officially closed.</p>
<p>Re-Birth</p>
<p>However, the name "Nighthawks" had not ceased completely. In early 1992 former player Gary Lee formed the junior version of the Nighthawks team with the help of some other senior players. Playing at Bebington Oval against mainly collegiate teams, the team went 7 and 1 in the first year.</p>
<p>On hearing about the demise of the senior team during '94, Gary decided to attempt to rebuild the seniors.</p>
<p>With the help of local T.V., radio and other media a team comprising of new and old players was recruited. 1995 started with the team entered into the British American Football Association, Division 3 North West. A 5 and 3 record meant that the team had narrowly missed out on promotion.</p>
<p>1996 to 2002</p>
<p>On a firmer footing, the club was playing in the top division during 97. Playing at Wallasey Rugby Club the team enjoyed some success but numbers started to dwindle. Playing at the highest level dissuaded new blood from joining the team. As a consequence, a decision was made to drop a division.</p>
<p>2003 to 2005</p>
<p>Under a new Head Coach, Andy Ley, the team has had to go through some rebuilding. Aftter famous victories in the 2003 season which included a thrilling win over the Staffordshire Surge, 2004 and 2005 have not seen such successes continued. With a large number of the Nighthawk veterans retiring the team is starting with a new core of players who are just finding their feet. However, with a great team attitude which can't be found anywhere else in the league, this new bunch are very much on the rise.</p>

<p>Makaan a Vagyr warlord who has recently (in events of Homeworld 2) come to control the vast fleets of the Vagyr and Taiidan. After his discovery of the third hyperspace core, he styled himself the "Sajuuk-Khar", or Chosen One. This is a reference to an ancient prophecy, which states that the End Times are coming with the discovery of the third core. Under his leadership, the Vagyr have been moving ever closer to the Hiigaran homeworld Hiigara. He commands his fleet from a flagship roughly equivalent in size to the Hiigaran mothership.</p>

The <b>Temple Challenge Cup</b> is one of the eights races at the prestigious annual <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henley_Royal_Regatta_8f31.html" title="Henley Royal Regatta">Henley Royal Regatta</a> and is open to male crews from universities, colleges or schools. Combined entries from two colleges of the same university, or from different schools, are allowed. There are restrictions on individuals rowers to ensure that the faster crews row in the Ladies' Challenge Plate. A rower cannot take part in this race if he has previously won an event at Henley, except The Princess Elizabeth or The Fawley Challenge Cups.</p>
<p>The event was first staged in 1990, and, after a successful first year, the Stewards decided to make it a permanent fixture. The cup, awarded to the winning crew on finals day, was made in 1835 by Charles Fox, and has been engraved with a sketch of the Temple.</p>

<p>W.A.N.C.U.R.S.-syndrome</p>
<p><br />
Originally discovered by Doctor Spancal Ldetime in 1857, the W.A.N.C.U.R.S. syndrome is widely known for its teriible effects.</p>
<p>An estimated 50.000.000 people in the world suffer from WANCURS, most of them are either completely blind, some can still see a little bit.</p>
<p>Cause of the W.A.N.C.U.R.S-syndrome is masturbating. The reason that many people eventually die at this disease is their shame of telling their doctor about it.</p>
<p>However, IF discovered on ayoung age, many lifes could have been saved.</p>
<p>The cure for the W.A.N.C.U.R.S-syndrome is wearing the special glasses for at least half a year.</p>

<p>66.152.205.254 16:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC) Scale of time in the corporate work environment as proposed by author/worker Lawrence E. Nelson. A response to the dehumanizing effect of living more than 8 hours a day in a corporate cubicle doing nothing. The existential effect of being surrounded by people but being left virtually alone. Only to be discarded at the drop of a virtual hat when a publicly traded company needs to balance its books.</p>

anglo-american holocaust or north american holocaust</p>
<p>anglo-american holocaust, the holocaust which killed more than 100 million anglo americans during years of fierce surpression and civil war, during the first years of the 21th century. When the United States of America split into three factions, a civil war resulted almost immediately, in which armed militias grouped around brutal regimes and fought each other for years without a desired result. Killing tens of millions of anglo-americans, in stampede-control measures, concentration camps, areal bombardments and street violence</p>

<p>Jason John Hardy (born 16th January 1984) is an English/Italian/Greek IT Student who recently completed his study tenure, securing a BTEC Nation Diploma in Information Technology in the process.

<p>Jason Hardy was born in Dagenham on 16th January 1984. He has one elder sister whose name is unknown. Jason started his education at Five Elms primary School in Dagenham in 1988 and later progressed to the world famous Eastbrook Comperehensive School in 1995. Here, Jason faced many new challenges, including fighting (and chinning) Stefan Birkett, throwing a chair at a fellow English Student, numerous detentions at the hands of Mr Ramsbottom, and perhaps the toughest of all, wearing CICA trainers. Jason gratuated from Eastbrook in the Summer of 2000. No one is sure of his exact grades, but they were enough for him to enter Barking College.</p>

<p>Jason has always been a fitness fanatic. He regularly goes for long runs, plays football and tennis. Although Jason cannot ride a bike, in 1999 he did try to learn thanks to lessons from his good friend Bradley Whitcomb. However, these lessons were unsuccessful and resulted in Jason barely avoiding riding into a river. Jason is also a keen clubber, having graced many a Romford dancefloor since becoming 18. He's also a bit of a ladies man, having seduced many women including a middle aged lady whose boyfriend was standing right behind her. Having said this, Jason has still not found the right woman for him, although he is still searching.</p>

<p>After a string of failed romances in 2002, Jason took the decision to forget his English roots and pledge his allegiance to Italy. In 2004 when Greece won the European Football Championships, Jason become half Italian/Greek. Not much is known whether any English still resides in his confused, multi-nationed body. One thing that is for sure though is this; Jason is a very special fellow.</p>

A concentration country is an advanced form of concentration camp , were a large group of people are against their will grouped together into a sealed area. The advantages of a concentration country to a concentration camp are numerous. Are the number of people in concentration camps limited to tens or even hundreds of thousands, the amount of people in a concentration country may easily be millions. Secondly a concentration country services its own country inmates, as inmates tend to lead more 'normal' lives were they enjoy currency, their own property, work and all the advantages of a country. This of course makes the concept more 'stealthy' and more difficult to recognize.</p>
<p>A concentration country may be recognized as follows&#160;:</p>
<p>- Walls prohibiting free traffic between at the countries borders - Inmates are defenseless against attacks from the surpressor(s) - Random kidnapping and or killing of inmates - Surpression of inmates by using food , energy and basic needs as bargaining tools</p>

Clayton Andrew Harderson was born on September 8, 1987 in Russellville, Arkansas. He spent most of his life in nearby mountainous community Ozone, until accepting a scholarship to attend Neumont University in South Jordan, Utah. The life of Andrew isn't the most interesting, but in time perhaps it can grow into an astounding story, as only 18 years of his life have been completed.</p>
<p>The Early Years</p>
<p>By the time Andrew was 3 years old, he'd learned how to read, write, and speak very clearly. The money was tight, as his father was the only working parent, and his mother had to find a job. Because she couldn't stay with Andrew during the day anymore, she decided to send him to school at the age of 4, where he excelled in academics as a child, up to college. Aside from the academic progress, he was like any other kid. He loved Saturday morning cartoons, playing outside, and even loved school at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the Christmas of 1993, Andrew would recieve a gift from his Uncle Marty that would define the rest of his life. It would alter the decisions he made for school, for college, and for his career. The gift was a Nintendo Entertainment System(NES) and Andrew fell in love with it.</p>

<p><b>Pasar Seni ITB</b> (‚Äùpasar seni‚Äù = art market) is a 5-yearly event held by ITB Arts and Design students. The main idea of Pasar Seni is to facilitate interactions between artists and public. In Pasar Seni ITB, the focus of the event is direct transactions between artists and buyers in huge amount. This can be considered a rare occasion, since many artists have given special prices on several previous Pasar Seni ITB. Not only the art market, Pasar Seni ITB has been entertaining the visitors with pretty different performances. Traditional and contemporary arts, music, and art performances from many participants has marked the atmosphere of Pasar Seni ITB.</p>
<p>Year 1972, A.D. Pirous, well known as a painter now, was inspired by his visit to USA. He participated in an art exhibition in autumn before everyone was preparing themselves for winter holiday. He was pretty amazed by the interaction built in the event, where the artists can directly communicate with the visitors. Such idea might just solve the problem of Indonesian art movement, as he thought. Then he came back to Indonesia and held the first Pasar Seni ITB, where not only exhibits and sells artworks, but also performed many kind of arts, including traditional arts. Until today, Pasar Seni ITB has been held 5 times (now the seventh). The last Pasar Seni ITB 2000, has gathered more than 40 000 visitors in a day, 600 artists, craftmans, and designers, performers, and has become a landmark for Bandung‚Äôs tourism event.</p>

<p>Vulvar Vestibulitis Syndrome (VVS) is a condition which causes inflammation the vestibule, the opening of the vaginal canal. VVS occurs in women who are sexually active and also in women who have never been sexually active. The exact cause for VVS is unknown, yet research shows that there likely a culmination of causes that differ from woman to woman. It is believed that there is an alteration in the neuropathway of the vulva so that sensations such as touch and pressure are percieved as pain. Women who have chronic yeast infections, urinary tract infections, vaginismus, and vulvar skin issues seem to be predisposed to VVS. Some woman can pin point the onset and other's can not.</p>
<p>Signs of this VVS include irritation of mucous secreting glands, and redness/erythema and edema/inflammation of the vestibule. It may include all the area around the opening of the vagina but is most commonly seen in the lower part.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms are sever pain with pressure (usually noted with biking, tight fitting clothes, sitting on hard surfaces and intercourse); vaginal penetration with intercourse, speculums or tampons; sensations of burning, stinging, itching, or rawness in the vulvar area; and the urge to urinate frequently or suddenly. The duration of symptoms can weeks to months.</p>
<p>Many women with this problem have suffered physically and emotionally for months or years, have seen a number of physicians, have been mis-diagnosed with urinary track infections or yeast infections, and have tried many unsuccessful treatments in search of relief.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of VVS: With a cotton tip applicator the doctor palpates specific spots around the vestibule that correspond to the mucous secreting glands. This ‚ÄòQ-tip‚Äô test not usually performed in standard pelvic exams by OBGYN. A sample of your vaginal discharge is also collected and tested to rule out infection.</p>
<p>Treatments of VVS include but are not limited: lidocaine topically applied, physical therapy, non burning laser treatments, and vestibulectomy.</p>

<p>Along with the Selwyn Ballet the Capping Sextet is one of the most enduring student institutions in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. There has been a sextet-type group of singing men (sometimes there were more or less than six members) in every Capping Show at <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otago_University_0ecc.html" title="Otago University">Otago University</a> since the 1920s. The six male singers are drawn from all faculties of the university and sing <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satirical.html" title="Satirical">satirical</a> or <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgar.html" title="Vulgar">vulgar</a> lyrics.</p>
<p>For several decades the Sextet has worn two costumes: white tie and tails and a<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequin.html" title="Harlequin">harlequin</a> outfit. The Sextet uses harlequin-style makeup.</p>
<p>The Sextet usually sings about six songs in the Capping Show: one set of three songs in the first half and the other songs in the second half. The Sextet's music has varied considerably over the decades, for many years the Sextet sang accompianed by piano and the accompanist was an essential part of the group. Since the 1990s the trend has been to sing unaccompanied. Singing in unison, two or three parts was usual for the Sextet for many years. For several years four-part <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbershop_music.html" title="Barbershop music">Barbershop music</a> has been important in the Sextet's repertoire. Since the 1970s the Sextet has borrowed heavily from the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Singers_8795.html" title="Kings Singers">Kings Singers</a> and therefore has increased the number of parts it sings in to five and six. Latterly the Sextet has tended to sing mostly six-part <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_cappella.html" title="A cappella">a cappella</a> music. Many people have made arrangements for the Sextet, notable amonst arrangers are: Dr. Nigel Eastgate, Professor John Drummond and Associate Professor Patrick Little.</p>
<p>Since at least the 1970s the Sextet has toasted the University at the end of each Capping Show using first the Tom Lehrer song 'Bright College Days' changed to 'Bright Otago Days', then to the tune of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudeamus_igitur.html" title="Gaudeamus igitur">Gaudeamus igitur</a> sings 'Sexiamus mania, frustrutatum randium(x2) prostitutem contraceptum, mastubatum manualem, satisfactor releivium (x2)', to finish the show the Sextet leads the cast and audience in singing Gaudemamus Igitur.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been various female versions of the Sextet such as 'The Six Tits', 'The Short and Girlies' and 'The Sexytet'. The female groups have not developed a tradition to rival the male Sextet.</p>
<p>Some well known former members of the Sextet are: Composer Richard Madden and opera singers Martin Snell and Jonathan Lemalu</p>

<p>Widham is a small hamlet which is now encompassed within the village of Purton, Wiltshire. Originally Widham was a few houses along the Highway and parts of Witts Lane and the Toll House at Collins Lane, with Widham Common in the centre. Purton eventually engulfed the Hamlet and only one small area is now left known as Widham which was split in two during the mid 19th Century when the railway line was built between Swindon and Gloucester. Widhill can be found approximately 4 miles to the north near to the A419 at Blunsdon.</p>
<p>Widham appears on maps dating back to the 1700's. During the Enclosure Act the Common was Awarded to the Earl of Shaftsbury with 'foot rights' to the cottages around the common to the highway which had been a private road with Tolls collected at the Toll House. The highway at this time became a public road however Tolls continued to be collected into the 1800's.</p>
<p>Pincocks Orchard dating from the 1700's lies behind the houses on the south of the railway, originally Thomas Rincock's Orchard and now reduced in size to around half an acre. Planted with Greengage and other fruit trees.</p>
<p>Meaning of the word Widham could come from two words - Druid and Hamlet. The word 'Dru- wid' means 'oak-knowledge' and 'Ham' meaning Homestead or pennisular. The English word 'wisdom' traces its origins to the Primitive German word Wid, meaning 'to know'. Wid in turn, is derived from the Sanskrit word Veda, meaning 'External Knowledge'</p>

<p>KLEG-LP is a low-powered <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">spanish</a> <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_station.html" title="Independent station">independent station</a> in Dallas, TX, serving the Dallas/Ft.

<p>This station was first established in 1996 as K19BW on channel 19 with spanish programming, then on February 1999, the station was airing news from <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemundo_Internacional_64bf.html" title="Telemundo Internacional">CBS Telenoticias</a> (now Telemundo Internacional). By September 1999, K19BW was moved to channel 44 to make room for <a href="../../../k/t/v/KTVT_a1d1.html" title="KTVT">KTVT</a>'s <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_terrestrial_television.html" title="Digital terrestrial television">Digital signal</a>, thus the station was rebranded K44FO. By December 2000, K44FO dropped the CBS Telenoticias affiliate in favor of the spanish independent programming. By March, 15, 2001, the station is once again rebranded to KLEG. Two months later, it has picked up the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mas_Musica_2b00.html" title="Mas Musica">Mas Musica</a> network, only temporarily, then the network was moved to K57IG-LP (now <a href="../../../k/s/e/KSEX-LP_d4a7.html" title="KSEX-LP">KSEX-LP</a>). Now, KLEG is currently showing various spanish programming, a line-up that continues to this day.</p>

Mr. B is Slovenian most famous gangster rapper. He has produced several songs, mostly rap, but also some ballads that were not released. His role model is 50 Cent, a rapper that changed his life, as Mr. B mentions several times in his writings.
<p>A little town called Viƒç is where he is known to reside. His first public appearance was, when he had made his first video called Wanksta in May 2005. Shortly after the first, a second video named Candy shop, followed in mid June. The latter made Mr. B the most known Slovenian rapper (a rap group called Kocka had lost its first position). Both videos were made as a tribute to 50 Cent, therefore his lyrics were used.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, in May 2006, Mr. B finished recording his latest song, called Gospodar Wica (The lord of Viƒç), and started making making video for the song. Beacouse of the popularity of the first two videos, the budget for the third video as much more bigger. The cast was bigger, professional cameras and props were used, and permission for filming was acquired from Ljubljana's mayor Danica Sim≈°iƒç.</p>
<p>Mr. B is currently working on his new project that still remains unknown. He claims that the idea for the project came to him, on his longer visit to Thailand, where he lived as a native and meditated with the Buddhist. <a name="Short_biography" id="Short_biography"></a></p>

Born in Slovenia, in part of Ljubljana called Viƒç, on the 10.10.1987. The family situation was unstable. Mr. B's mother was killed after a few years after giving birth to her first son, leaving him with her husband. Eyewitnesses claim, that a group of long haired hooligans, wearing shirts with various hardcore metal bands names, tried to rob her, using a handgun to intimidate her. She fought them,and was killed, the robbers were never found. His father was a hard working miner with a low pay, so their life was not easy. When attending school, Mr. B met several people that became his close friends and supported him in his career.
<p>The street life became interesting to young Mr. B, and at a young age of 14 he had to attend his first trial for petty crime. He recieved his first warinng and a probation period of six months. Two years after his mother's death , his father was also murdered when returning from work. That event changed Mr. B, he quit school, started rapping and continued with his new life as a criminal. Many of his closest friends joined, forming a strong group.</p>
<p>To promote his work, he joined a online board called mn3njalnik, under a name LordBebo, which was by a strange coincidence very simmilar to the boards administrator. There he published several of his guides ranging from testing computer firewalls, becoming a rapper, getting laid, and most of his lyrics and all videos. His latest video was added to a DVD and CD, that comes with a computer magazine called Joker. He has already recorded a music CD with all his hits which will be published soon. <a name="Social_view" id="Social_view"></a></p>

Viƒç is believed to be Slovenians ghetto, beacouse of its mostly black, latino, and Albanian population. Crime statistic also show, that Viƒç is at the top in crimes such as armed robbery, drugs, etc.
<p>Ljubljana's mayor is trying new, more liberal techniques for stopping the crime. These include trading all kinds of weapons for toys or books, lectures on violence and displaying anti hate movies. Most of these, take place in front of O≈† Viƒç, where most young people meet and where crime is the highest.</p>
<p>So far, the situation is improving, beacouse of the no violence treaty, that was signed, by the two rival gangs - Rdece rutke and Modre rutke. These two gangs have been in conflict for the last five years. The leader of Rdece rutke, is believed to be Mr. B. They are a less violent violent group that concentrates only on fighting the opposite gang. The reason for rivalry is unknown to outer observers</p>

<b>HISTORY</b> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_service" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_service" rel="nofollow">maid service</a> industry has grown exponentially over the last twenty years. The 80's were dominated by independent cleaning persons that served a handful of clients. Eventually, franchises were formed to serve homeowners on a large scale. Today, there are at least seven franchises that serve the entire country. The maid service industry has evolved from an amateur operation into a corporate operation in the matter of just one decade. As a result, there is lots of room for an aspiring maid service entrepreneur to grow.</p>
<p><br />
<b>HOW TO START YOUR OWN MAID SERVICE</b></p>
<p><i>One House At A Time</i> One option is to start the business by starting out just like people in the 80's started out. Clean one house at a time and grow one house at a time. Many of today's most successful maid service companies were started by one person cleaning one house. The biggest advantage that this option provides is that your start-up costs are small. If the new venture doesn't work out, then you've got nothing to lose. The biggest disadvantage that this option provides is that the rate of growth will be slow. A person will risk less, but the reward will also be less (at least in the beginning).</p>
<p><i>Franchising</i> This option has become very popular since the late 90's. Examples of franchises include <a href="http://www.merrymaids.com/franchise/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.merrymaids.com/franchise/index.php" rel="nofollow">Merry Maids</a>, <a href="http://www.mollymaid.com/FranchiseMain.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.mollymaid.com/FranchiseMain.aspx" rel="nofollow">Molly Maid</a>, <a href="http://www.maids.com/aspx/franchiseopps.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.maids.com/aspx/franchiseopps.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Maids</a>, <a href="http://www.maidpro.com/maidservice-franchises" class="external text" title="http://www.maidpro.com/maidservice-franchises" rel="nofollow">MaidPro</a>, and <a href="http://www.maidbrigadefranchise.com" class="external text" title="http://www.maidbrigadefranchise.com" rel="nofollow">Maid Brigade</a>. Franchising allows a person to be taught how to run the maid service without going through the growing pains of a new business. Most maid service franchises charge an initial fee plus royalties for the life of the franchise agreement. A franchise doesn't guarantee success, but it can be very helpful if you are new to the business. The disadvantage of this business arrangement is that a business owner must follow the rules of the franchise. A franchisee can not create operating strategies that are not designed by the franchise.</p>
<p><i>Partnership</i> This option is new to the maid service industry. In fact, there are only two companies attempting this strategy, <a href="http://www.ineedamaid.com/opentwomaids.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ineedamaid.com/opentwomaids.html" rel="nofollow">Two Maids &amp; A Mop</a> and <a href="http://www.maidservicesofamerica.com" class="external text" title="http://www.maidservicesofamerica.com" rel="nofollow">Maid Service of America</a>. The partnership model is a great choice for the entrepreneur that has limited capital. Basically, you partner with the corporate company and run the business yourself. As a partner, you own a stake in the business and receive profits based on that ownership stake. The capital required for this is low because the corporate company funds all start-up costs and initial working capital. The corporate company also provides the same type of training and support that a franchise provides.</p>

<p>Lucy Purnell, aged 16 years, currently resides in the north of England. She is a member of the National Academy for the Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY) and attended an Advanced Maths Summer School in 2006, creating a complex model of populations in the Amazon Rainforest. In NAGTY she met two stunningly attractive, intelligent and inspirational young men. One of them, Harry Mike George, is currently her boyfriend, and the other is currently writing this article.</p>
<p>Ms. Purnell has been often described as deligtful and lighthearted, if slightly obsessed with mathematics. She feels that she is rather evil, but is in essence wrong; the quality of her character was proven by the collosal effort she volintarily (and without beign asked) put into organising a reunion of her contemporaries in Birmingham.</p>
<p>In her spare time she likes to climb rocks, and listen to music such as Placebo and Jimmy Eat World.</p>

<p><br />
The Dragon Coaster, found at Playland, in Rye, NY is an old fashioned wooden rollercoaster that opened in 1929. This ride was created by the famous rollercoaster designer Frederick Church (1878-1936) and was one of two of his famous rollercoasters opened on this site, the other being his Aeroplane Coaster (1928-1957) that stood at Playland until it was dismantled in 1957. However, the Dragon Coaster remains. This ride features a 90 foot drop and over a 100 foot long trip through a tunnel that is shaped in the body of a dragon. The Dragon Coaster still operates with its original old fashioned skid brakes, which is applied by an attendant moving a giant red lever. Although much of this rollercoaster is original it does not sport its original Church Trains. They were replaced in the late 80's with more lightweight fiberglass Morgan trains. This ride, to this day still gives a fast paced thrill ride and it one of the remaining classics from the golden age of rollercoaster. In the off-season in between 2005-2006 the Dragon Coaster underwent a massive restoration and paint job.</p>
