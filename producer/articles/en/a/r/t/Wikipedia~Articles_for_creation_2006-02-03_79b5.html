<p>John Taylor “Still the same.” - Bob Seger</p>
<p>The details in a landscape mean nothing if they do not express some mood of nature felt by the artist/photographer.</p>
<p>I strive to capture internal feelings and the external harmony of the natural world - the passing seasons of life.</p>
<p>The La Cloche mountain range of Northeastern Ontario is one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world. Less than two billion years ago and before glacial erosion, these beautiful quartzite and granite mountains were as high as the Rockies. It is a beautiful and spiritual area on the north shore of Georgian Bay with Killarney Park in the east and the town of Spanish in the west.</p>
<p>Generations of people have been intrigued by the quartzite mountains, crystal clear lakes, windswept pines and abundance of wildlife. The continually changing light and shadows have entranced artists and lovers of the outdoors for centuries.</p>
<p>Jon Butler, a retired newspaperman who changed his clothes to enjoy the passing seasons of life, has been capturing and enjoying the light of La Cloche for more than 25 years. He concentrates on solitary and contemplative landscapes and atmospheric effects.</p>
<p>The colour, details and shadows seen in his photographs are achieved through the use of camera settings (in some cases a polarizing filter) and Jon’s unique sense of light. He uses no additional or altered colour and no digital enhancement. He photographs with 35mm Olympus, 2 1/4 Mamiya and 4 X 5 Linhof cameras.</p>
<p>His photographs reflect years of meditation on the subject matter and they draw viewers into the light of La Cloche.</p>
<p>All limited edition photographs are original, manipulative free and in a limited series of 10 or less. The negative is then destroyed.</p>
<p>Jon’s ‘Photo Haiku’ is a form of mixed media combining limited edition photographs and an original haiku written on natural surfaces. A haiku is the expression of temporary enlightenment, in which we see into the life of things and in this case it is La Cloche. Each of the haiku series is limited to five or less.</p>
<p>Private and corporate collections in Canada and the United States have purchased photographs by Jon Butler.</p>
<p>Recent awards include first place photography at the 2004 Heritage Alive Art Show at the Centennial Museum of Sheguiandah, first place photography at the 2004 Massey Area Museum Art Show and first place in photography at the 2005 La Cloche Art Show. In May 2004 a one man show was held in Sudbury at the Cedar Street Gallery and in 2005 there were shows in Sudbury at Black Cat Too in February, Cedar Street Gallery and the Manitoulin Art Tour in June, Turner’s Gallery of Little Current in July and The Deer Trail Studio Tour in September. In February 2006 photographs will be at the Sudbury Theatre Centre. La Cloche and Killarney tourist publications use Jon’s photographs.</p>
<p>‘The stark beauty of Jon Butler’s Cranberry Narrows was judged the Best Photography.’ - The Manitoulin Expositor, September 15, 2004</p>
<p>Jon, his wife Kerry and son Sam live in Willisville located in the heart of the La Cloche mountains. Daughters Loren and Vanessa are in the heart of Toronto.</p>
<p>Photographs and photo art cards are available upstairs at Turners Gallery of Little Current, The Whitefish Falls General Store and The Art Gallery of Sudbury gift shop. Participate in your landscape. -30-</p>

<p>Aliqua is a vocal ensemble based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The group is made up of 12 young women with a passion for music and performance. Founded by Erin Bishop and Christie Ray, the idea behind Aliqua was to create a group that would rejuvenate the image of choral music. By singing exciting and unique a cappella arrangements in a wide variety of styles, the groups pursues a mission of making choir cool. The fact that the group is made up of attractive, young, hip women helps to abate the image of staunchy, dull and sleep inducing music that are unfortunately the stereotype of the word 'choral'.</p>

<p>Domitan of Masbolle is a Sergeant and squad captain in the Third Company of The King's Own. This group of single men are lead by Sir Lord Raoul of Goldenlake and Malories Peak. Domitan, or Dom for short, is a comical person, who enjoys teasing Keladry (Kel) of Mindelan. Dom is also the cousin of the House of Queenscove, and is thus related to Nealan (Neal) and Duke Baird of Queenscove. He is also the man that Kel happens to have a crush on throughout the 3rd and 4th books. The last lines of the fourth book, Lady Knight, are, "Lovers, Kel thought, rolling her eyes. At least that was one headache she <i>didn't</i> have. She was about to tell her friend he could wait when she remembered that she'd get to see Dom while at Steadfast. It would be nice to be able to sit and chat for a whilie without knidnapping, flight, and war to distract them. She nudged Hoshi into a trot." Because we don't know what went on when they reached Steadfast, the possibility of their romance is quite probable.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-03_79b5.html" title="Edit section: Cambridge University Boat Club (CUBC)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_University_Boat_Club_2632.html" title="Cambridge University Boat Club">Cambridge University Boat Club</a> (<a href="../../../c/u/b/CUBC_ac00.html" title="CUBC">CUBC</a>)</span></h2>
<p><b>CUBC</b> is one of the oldest university rowing clubs in the UK. It is drawn solely from student members of Cambridge University and exists primarily for the purpose of trying to beat arch-rival Oxford University Boat Club in the annual Boat Race on the River Thames at about Easter time. This race has been raced since 1829 with interruptions for wars and other events meaning that the 2004 race was both the 175th anniversary of the first race and the 150th actual race.</p>
<p>Although winning the Boat Race remains CUBC's primary concern, the Club also competes at Henley Royal Regatta and is usually at least a finalist and often a winner of an event there. In the run up to this international event, the Club participates in some of the most prestigous regattas on the UK circuit such as the Metropolitan Regatta and Marlow Regatta. In recent years the Club has also gone to race the Head of the Charles which it won in 2004.</p>
<p>Membership of the Club is theoretically open to any male undergraduate or postgraduate oarsman in the University, and coxwains of either sex. In practice, however, membership of the Club is largely restricted to an elite few, the precise number varying throughout the year. In general, at the start of the academic year trials are held and all oarsmen who appear potentially good enough to compete in the Boat Race are retained for at least a few weeks. Following erg trials and the annual Head fo the River Fours race in November, some oarsmen may be dropped from the squad - known as 'binning'. At the end of Michaelmas Term (in early/mid December) the Trial Eights races are held over the Boat Race course on the Thames. This pits two evenly matched VIIIs against each other over the course to enable the coaches to see how the oarsmen react under pressure and how the coxes cope with the unusual and stressful conditions prevalent on that river. After Trial VIIIs the squad is reduced to 20 (or more recently 18) oarsmen plus three coxes.</p>
<p>During Lent Term, the oarsmen undergoe further tests including seat racing over defined distances. From the squad, eight oarsmen are chosen to race in the 'Blue Boat' for the Boat Race and eight more are chosen to form 'Goldie' which has raced its Oxford counterpart 'Isis' in the Reserves Boat Race 30mins before the main event since the 1960s. The last oarsmen and cox are the official spares, in case of injury or illness. Usually the Blue Boat is announced first, about a month or so before the Boat Race and the Goldie crew is announced some time later.</p>
<p>The Blue Boat is so-called because participation in the Boat Race earns the participant a 'Blue' - a form of university colours awarded at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Cambridge Blue is dervied from an earlier Eton blue, both being a kind of turqouise or duck egg colour, hence CUBC being referred to as the 'Light Blues'. Oxford Blue is a standard dark blue in colour.</p>
<p>Members of the Goldie crew are awarded unique 'Goldie' colours, donoted by blazers consisting of alternatinv Cambridge Blue, dark green and bright gold stripes.</p>
<p>In recent years the Club has also ran a development squad - 'Dev Squad' for the purposes of raising the standards of talented college oarsmen, mostly those who have learned to row at their college. This squad races under the name 'Goldie' in the annual Head of the River Race on the Thames a week before the Boat Race. This crew should not be confused with the true Goldie crew which is of a significantly higher standard.</p>
<p>Originally, members of the CUBC tended to be undergraduates of the university who also rowed for their college boat clubs and had mostly learned to row at public school. More recently, there has been a trend for many international oarsmen from across the world to take up postgraduate courses at the university in order to compete in the Boat Race. This has undoubtedly raised the standard of the event to near world-class but has led to some criticisms that the club is no longer so representative as a club for members of the university.</p>
<p>However, raising the standard has helped the club to remain one fo the best rowing clubs in the UK and to nurture talented but inexperienced oarsmen which is one of the reasons for the recent Dev Squad innovation, mentione dabove. Recent successful examples include two oarsmen from Jesus College, Ed Sherwood and James Orme, both of whom learned to row at their college in their first undergraduate year and yet made it into the Goldie crew of the following year and then onto the under-23 World Championships. They were both in the Goldie crew again in 2005.</p>

<p>Printed books were published in 15th century for the first time.Initially the subject material was informative and religious. However within few decades periodicals were publishing articals (essays) of political nature. With increase in literacy and circulation of printed materials political interest and avtivation became more common. Since then print media is reporting,creating, watching,and enfuencing polital issues.The most important example is influence of 'das capital'by Marx on world polital thoughts.</p>

<p>'Jewish Youth Study Groups' is a network of peer-led study groups around the UK. JYSG or 'Study Group' as it known, started during WW2, as a response to young Jewish evacuees who desperately wanted some Jewish education in the remote rural areas where they lived. People from traditional homes suddenly found themselves in places throughout Britain that had never seen a Jew before.</p>
<p>From London weekly study sheets were sent out to groups of homesick Jewish evacuess who eagerly received and enthusiastically discussed the content of these sheets at lunchtime meetings in schools. These groups came together for the first time at a summer school in Cambridge, in 1942. Jewish friendship, Jewish learning and Jewish atmosphere were so precious to those teenagers in wartime England.</p>
<p>After the war, local Jewish study groups continued to meet up and engage in Jewish learning and a national executive committee - called the national va'ad - along with an adult national organiser, were charged with running national events, a winter and summer camp, national 'reunion' weekends and more recently a tour of Israel.</p>
<p>JYSG [<a href="http://www.jysg.org.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jysg.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] still exists as an independent youth group for Jewish children between the ages of 13-16. It defines itself as a youth movement for people from any religious background dedicated to fostering an intellectual and practicle understanding of orthdox Judaism. JYSG has in the past been run under the auspices of the United Synagogue of orthodox congregations and still recognises the authority of the office of the Chief Rabbi of the UK and commonwealth. JYSG has in the past been one of anglo-Jewry's biggest youth groups -with past members including the likes of Michael Howard- it now struggles for numbers as a last vestige of the middle-of-the-road provincial brand of anglo-Jewry (committed to orthdoxy if not in deed then in mind). JYSG is unique in Britain for not being specifically dedicated to any zionist ideology. It just wants to be a platform for education, informing the choices that young Jews are bound to make about where they want to be religiously and empowering them to make them for themselves without indoctrination.</p>

<p>Cinema Festa Internazionale di Roma is the Italian name of a major new film festival in Rome.</p>
<p>Announced in January 2006 by Roman mayor Walter Veltroni, the first outing of the festival will be from 13-21 October 2006. It has a budget of €7m.</p>
<p>The festival may well pose a threat to the future of the Venice film festival, which is already experiencing financial difficulties. However, Mayor Veltroni says that he sees the two festivals complimenting each other, with Rome being more populist that Venice.</p>

<p>A pancake kegger occurs early on weekend mornings, wherein students pay a flatfee for unlimited pancakes, keg beer, and sometimes mixed liquor concoctions (such as Purple Jesus). Unlike 'keggers', pancake keggers are usually hosted during specific events, such as Queen's University Frosh Week and Homecoming. Pancake keggers, by definition, are hosted at student's houses, and are in no-way sanctioned by, or affiliated with, the University. Students typically host these parties in order to raise funds, or from a sense of traditional responsibility <a href="http://www.http://www.queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol133/issue19/news/story4.com" class="external text" title="http://www.http://www.queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol133/issue19/news/story4.com" rel="nofollow">1</a>Frecs and Gaels, for example, are leaders in the frosh week festivites, and have a long history of ensuring that Frosh attend such social events.</p>
<p>In recent years, the festivities have come under attack from both Queen's University and Kingstonians alike. In addition to ethical and health risks, the pancake keggers depend on an illegal sale of alcohol for existance. Pancake Kegger hosts can be charged by the police and/or fined by the University for their participation.</p>

<p><b>Wells-next-the-Sea</b> is a small town on the North Norfolk coast. Historically its main significance came through its harbour - one of the largest along the Norfolk coast between Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn. Although historically a notable port, in recent years Wells has become principally a tourist and recreational centre. However the harbour remains important and significant sized vessels can gain entry at high tide.</p>
<p>As a tourist centre Wells has several assets. Firstly there is the harbour itself which provides excellent facilities for yachting and many other watersports. Then there is the town which houses quaint narrow streets, often lined by small flint-walled cottages or larger brick built merchants' houses. Near the centre of the town is a grassed area called The Buttlands (indicative of former use for archery practice) surrounded by a mix of buildings but notably a number of imposing Georgian houses. Further south (i.e. inland) is the parish church of St Nicholas, where a survivor of The Bounty is buried.</p>
<p>North of The Quay is the beach, a third major attraction for tourists, with a large sandy beach backed by sand dunes and pine woods and lined by distinctive beach huts that stretches west to the nearby village of Holkham's beach. The beach is also the location of the Lifeboat Station, a point of interest in itself. The area adjacent to the beach is an area for camping, caravaning, and recreation.</p>
<p>Close to Wells are many other tourist attractions such as historic houses (Holkham Hall, Blickling Hall) and world-class bird watching opportunities with much of the North Norfolk coast now designated as some form of nature reserve or site of special scientific interest (e.g. Scolt Head, Blakeney Point). Wells houses both a Youth Hostel and a Field Studies Centre.</p>
<p>The commercial heart of Wells has contracted since the 1950s when shops and commercial businesses lined most of the walk along Staithe and High Streets from The Quay to St Nicholas Church. Now shops are mostly found only on Staithe Street, where tourist traffic from The Quay provides added trade for several outlets. Historically Wells possessed a remarkable number of public houses for a town of its size, probably reflecting maritime links, but now many of these have closed.</p>
<p>Wells was linked to the national rail network in 1857, and for many years was a terminus on two separate lines. However the East Coast floods on January 1953, which also affected Wells significantly, precipitated the closure of the coastal line to Heacham (and then on to King's Lynn) to the west, while the 'Beeching axe' saw the closure of the line through Fakenham and Dereham to Wymondham and Norwich in the mid 1960s. However Wells has seen two separate light railway narrow gauge systems in operation - one from the end of The Quay to the beach and the other from south of the town to the religious centre of Walsingham a few miles inland. Neither of these, however, reach the former railway station.</p>

<p><b>Retail Ethics</b> has come to the fore in recent years in the wake of similar movements in wider business ethics and marketing ethics.</p>
<p>However it would be wrong to see retail ethics as wholly new - philosophers such as Aristotle and Cicero, for example, mused on the fairness of retail transactions.</p>
<p>Modern retail ethics has concerned itself with a wide range of issues such as the selling of 'sweatshop' products, green issues, fair trade, consumer endebtedness, retail employment conditions, issues of privacy and data protection, the movement of stores out-of-town and the decline of the High Street, selling 'socially undesirable' products (such as tobacco products, firearms, alcohol, pornography etc., although clearly definitions of 'undesirability' are highly subjective here), alleged abuses of 'retailer power', controversial advertising, and so forth.</p>
<p>A number of models of what might be 'ethical retailing' can be envisaged. Firstly there is the model of the retailer who only sells 'ethical' products (although what constitutes an ethical product may be disputed). For a while Body Shop would have been an obvious example for many here, but the work of such as Jon Entine has challenged that notion. Then there are businesses that are seen as ethical by virtue of their organisational structure and use of proceeds - such as co-operative retailers. However a wider definition would be one that seeks to treat all stakeholders ethically (although that in itself is a highly challenging concept to operationalise).</p>
<p>The central paradox of ethical retailing is perhaps the extent to which the market will reward virtuous businesses. Will consumers pay more, say, for ethical goods or is this a limited niche market? Or is striving for an image of virtue and fairness a risky strategy when so many are apparently waiting to expose the slightest shortcomings of anyone seeking to claim a higher moral ground in the world of highly competitive global retailing?</p>

<p>Peter George Patmore was a periodical writer active betwee nthe years of 1820-25, known mainly for a series of articles in the 'New Monthly Magazine' entitled 'Picture Galleries of England', acting as a critical guide to the main aristocratic collections of Old Master paintings at the time. These articles were a response to, and in some ways a dialogue with, a similar series begun by the great critic William Hazlitt, at around the same time, and published in the London Magazine. Patmore's works were serialised and published in a single volume in 1824, of which a copy si available in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was forced into publication due to the announcement of several other works of the same name attempting to capitalise on his (or possibly Hazlitt's) succes.</p>
<p>He was also the father of the minor Victorian poet Coventry Patmore</p>

<p>Mauritania has an offshore petroleum region discovered between 2001 and 2004 which is said to have oil reserves of several hundred million barrels (source: Woodside petroleum). It is currently under development. Being offshore, these discoveries are thought to have less risk of terrorism and kidnapping but are still not immune from disputes over income sharing between foreign and local stakeholders.</p>
