<dd>There were a number of articles in there from independent publications. Since when are interviews with Network World and a write-up by a staff member of CNET consider company issued marketing? There is a request for deletion of this article (I believe by you?) and while this request is being considered, you took it into your judgement to delete references which can help other editors decide on this issue? Why don't you leave these references alone while the decision is being made? I also noticed that you took the time to edit the features section of this article extensively. Have you reviewed the features section of other companies (like <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skype.html" title="Skype">skype</a>) and tried to implement the same editing criteria? I have re-added reference articles for this article so that others can decide their validity.

<li>Agreed. With the exception of your addition of {{<a href="../../../a/d/v/Template%7EAdvert_8bb0.html" title="Template:Advert">advert</a>}} to <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabber.html" title="Jabber">Jabber</a>, the majority of your dispute tags added to non-notable communications software articles are perfectly accurate. Those programs are clearly in the same class as damaka and I will endorse their deletion without reservation if they are nominated in their current states. One question, though: how did you learn to apply dispute tags so quickly, and what motivated you to apply them exclusively to competitors of the software described in the article discussed on this deletion debate? Don't be surprised if some others question your good faith! <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 00:30, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not that difficult to put in a dispute tag. Also, the earlier entry on this debate page listed the competitors in the same space. I thought i'd follow the link and see if the complaint that perhaps this request was launched by competition holds true. and I found that some of the vote for deletion come from editors of competing companies. I think this will be a problem that wikipedia will increasingly face in the future. competitors trying to block or sabotage competitors pages. I could care less if this article is deleted. But I do care that the wiki team finds a way to maintain fair rule of play. (Martha.weinberg 01:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)).

<li>If we end up with a bunch of companies all nominating each other's spam articles for deletion, then I'd say the problem has solved itself. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 12:47, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
