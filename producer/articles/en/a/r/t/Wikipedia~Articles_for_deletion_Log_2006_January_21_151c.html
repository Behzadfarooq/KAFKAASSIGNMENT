She seems to be prolific, but the article, as it is, isn't even a stub.

<li>Five O’clock Dog - Five O’clock Dog Book</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Qualification Statement:</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon further investigation we have come to realize that there is a very large amount of commercial fee based porn sites and other commercial services listed on Wikipedia. These pages inside Wikipedia were created and are maintained by Wikipedians as an advertisement that have direct links to the “pay a fee – buy some porn access or DVD’s - join here ” porn industry websites. (To many easy to find examples to list here)</p>
<ul>
<li>Further Qualification:</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Position from the beginning has been:</p>
<p>These aforementioned web sites are selling commercial products. The Wikipedia page for them is an informational advertisement. Large numbers of the pages contain trademarks as a site designation and heading. Many digital images on the Wikipedia website contain the ® after the Trademark. (This is just one example of many - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Intel-logo.svg</a>)</p>
<p>We are Neutral regarding all maters related to this. We are not singling out one industry, only using the above as a typical example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary:</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedians are in the process of deleting a children’s book page. (Stub) We assumed that since we did not see an 18 or over sign on the Wikipedia front page that Wikipedia is for all ages.</p>
<p>At last check there was 100% voting in favor of deleting the Five O’clock Dog Book stub page. (Article) (18 Wikipedians )</p>
<p>We feel that we have been singled out in a very discriminatory fashion. Further, we feel that deleting the Five O’clock Dog book stub is hypocritical.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per above. I very rarely vote to delete, but the publisher's comments here are simply unacceptable. I suggest they not attempt legal threats while not understanding that Wikipedia is no more obligated to carry their content than bookstores are to carry their book. Deletion is not "discriminatory", and the publisher should understand that even if Wikipedia were to be massively, unfairly discriminatory in its deletion policies, there would still be no grounds for any legal action. That said, I urge people nominating and voting on AFD to be carefully uninsulting to the subjects and authors of articles up until the point where they say things like what this publisher has said above. -- <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake_Nelson_33c5.html" title="User:Jake Nelson">Jake</a> 23:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

To clarify, I don't think she clears the notability bar by very much, but I think she clears it. The article in its current state is way too vanity, though. —<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 03:57, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Claims to be a paraphilia, and yet: 103 hits for arachnaphilia and paraphila together, no quotations. A lot of these seem to have referenced this wiki article. No hits on google scholar (the term arachnophilia by itself seems to be some kind of internet formatting program, zero hits associated with arachnophilia and paraphilia), no hits on a search of American Psychological Association article search with or without the term paraphilia, No relevant hits on lexis nexis (although one about nonsexual poems about liking spiders). The 100 google hits suggest that this is a role playing sex term that is in very low currency- how many role playing sex terms get so few hits on google?

<li><b>keep</b>: I just discovered this "i liek milk" thing tonite when I found the wikipedia page, but it seems like a legitimate (if bizarre) article. Google brings back 19,000 hits for the phrase. 15,500 if you search for "i liek milk" with "hitoshi".

<li>Well, if "unremarkable people or groups" (A7) is a speedy criterion, then "unremarkable websites" should also be, since websites are inherently much less notable and more fleeting things than people.

<li>Well, as much as I like extracting meanings to extend applications of principles, in Wikipedia we have to watch out that things aren't deleted on a whim- otherwise who knows how far it can go.

<p>Hi! I think this entry should be merged into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> since this last entry considers racist ("scientific") theories. Leaving it as it is now is, in my opinion of course, a racist POV, as it may let believe that there is such a thing as "scientific racism". I am aware that the entry is not really racist, as it considers it as a pseudoscience. However, the title itself may lead in error - the proof of that is that I was sure, before reading it, that this was some entry written with racist bias. I would also like to add a last point: to my knowledge, "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">racialism</a>" is the name given to attempts to scientifically justify racism (see <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Andr%C3%A9_Taguieff_1f01.html" title="Pierre-André Taguieff">Pierre-André Taguieff</a>'s works on racism). So, I think we should considers these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>merge it into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> (which should at least include a resume of this, as to let readers of the racist entry use the hyperlink to "scientific racism")</li>
<li>merge it into <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racialism.html" title="Racialism">Racialism</a> (which, by the way, is really badly written now, claiming that "racialism" is distinguished from "racism" because it has some "political weight" or whatever - whereas it is a synonym of what you fellows are trying to define as "scientific racism")</li>
<li>if you really don't want to consider those merges, for reasons that I will try my best to understand, you really should change the title. Believe me: maybe for you it is not equivocal, but the simple fact that I read it like this is a probable sign that I won't be the only one. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapaz_13cf.html" title="User:Lapaz">Lapaz</a> 03:04, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Lapaz doesn't know what he or she is talking about and I imagine did not read the article. The term is a common one used both in historical discourse and academic discourse about race. And if one is not aware of it being a separate term, one could easily consult the books references (one of which features it as a primary part of the <i>title</i>), or any of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">over 66,000 Google hits</a> or over <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22scientific+racism%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">5,800 Google Books</a> hits. Not a neologism, but a specific "type" of racism, one which claims to be based on scientific facts (sometimes contrasted with "base" racism). The article itself is very NPOV: if one actually <i>read</i> the content it would see that it attributes all POVs, and even goes great lengths to discuss the controversies, discredited research, etc. The term is, frankly, pejorative: nobody <i>wants</i> to be called "scientic racism", as it implies the work is <i>not</i> actually "science" but actually <i>just</i> racism. The Google links above show pretty clearly that the term is used, in the same way we use it, by hundreds if not thousands of mainstream sources, the vast majority of which are anti-racist (Stephen J. Gould, PBS, hundreds of academic books). It is completely distinct from racialism (which Lapaz also doesn't seem to understand in a NPOV way), and is obviously a topic rich enough (an entire article's worth of content) to deserve being a separate article from "racism", though it of course should be mentioned in the latter (as it is). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:06, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Eugenics and scientific racism are related but <i>not</i> the same thing. Read the two articles and you will see this. Scientific racism pre-dates eugenics and also exists completely separately from eugenics; furthermore, eugenics is not always about race, either, nor is it necessarily "racist" (it is often classist, sexist, and many other -ists). "Scientific racism" refers to research which supposedly validates racist ideas; "eugenics" is a philosophy advocating the changing of a society's gene pool by means of selective breeding. Not the same thing at all, though they have intertwined histories (there was much scientific racism in the history of eugenics). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:30, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Claims radio airplay &amp; produced by claimed famous singer. Unfortunately I don't know the Malaysian music scene enough to be able to make any judgment on notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> nonnotable transport crankery. I mean, that is frikkin. Insane. I wouldn't ride the thing, and I'm glad I never heard of it up till now.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - Remember, the concept does have a site at <a href="http://www.tubularrail.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tubularrail.com" rel="nofollow">Tubular Rail</a> where one can actually find pictures. So, while it's in no way a near-future solution, or even a possible one, the fact that people have written about it may make it deserve its own article. The article, should, however, talk about solely as a concept (in fact, the website doesn't claim anything more). I think we should give it more thought before we delete it.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- All a fair point, but this is pretty far down there on the list of interesting crankiness.

<p>This is either a hoax or incredibly non-notable. Blackpoin gets only one hit on Google - this article. I also tried Jeeves and Yahoo. Nothing at all.

<li>Whoa whoa whoa, It isn't vanity or anything of the sort. This is simply to establish GAJ's history and ecetera as it's believed on some sites to be a symbol of video gamer rights. Try the link. GAJ is very populated. And...The reason you can't find any hits on it is because it's on an invisionfree server. It is also widely talked about on GameFAQS, at least on the boards it originated in.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Google won't bring up GameFAQs posts, which is the main reason it gets so low hits. People on the gamefaqs boards talk about it alot (I've found over 40 topics about GAJ on it since last month, but gamefaqs started deleting them for being off topic) Look, it's a symbol of freedom for all peoples, and that not all boards are like gamefaqs and full of corruption and trolls. It stands for something; it has moral value to the people who know what it is. It has a <b>STORY</b> behind it's creation, not like syndicated boards like gamefaqs. But alot of people on GameFaqs still don't know "what a gaj is" so I'm making this page just to educate people on it. It may not be a huge, famous board, but I think alot of people could learn from it. Just give it one chance.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being a stickler mod gets many people angry and does no good. It's not as if Wikipedia doesn't have room for this site. These guys seem to have a good, cause, and Snake is right: it has a personal story. I think it should stay here and perhaps be merged with the article "Jack Thompson" so as to educate Wikipedia users. -Saint Shade</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If You take into account popular web forums that don't show their posts on Google and the sort, you would have alot more than the said number of hits. Who said that everybody has to rely on Google? And besides, if this is in violation, I know of a few others that should be long gone, but are still here. Well, thats my two cents at least. ~Tim Kowalenko</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Ok. So if you guys don't like it, give a reason other than google. This article is more or less about fighting against Jack Thompson's ideals of banning video games. It nullifies the first amendment, and if you delete this, then whats the point of the bill of rights? Keep it. BTW, GAJ is barely starting out small, like every other site, so, if you had banned those articles about web-sites and other things of that sort, then you've basically eliminated a source on how to relate to todays' society.-mothman47</li>

<li>!!!KEEP! There isn't another group like this. The nit-picking because of the users' names is ridiculous. They offer a collective voice which differs from other forums. They're a great group of gamers aged 13 to 20-something, with the exception of a few older and one who is a gaming grandmother. They beg for more parental control and have always wanted to educate "soccer moms" and others who have misconceptions about violent video games. Great bunch, it would be a pity to delete this.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - yes, but I would opine that any band on the "Not So Quiet on the Western Front" compilation - a historic marker for California punk rock - merits an article related to the topic Punk Rock, as many influential regional punk bands, in the genre's DIY spirit, never did release any widely distributed records. NBJ was widely recognized within the California Central Valley as central to the new punk scene there, and was an influence on several bands that did break through, such as Capitol Punishment. It was not long after NBJ released "Dead Porker" on the Not So Quiet compilation that the lead singer died.

<p>This page, as seen below, was nominated for deletion in December, partly because the group is unnotable and partly because it read like an advertisment. The article has been recreated and speedy-deleted twice since then I believe, and yet still it's here again. I don't see how it's become more notable in a month, and it still reads like an ad to me. It does not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite good sources</a> justifying its place here and I consider it to be <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a>. I could be considered an inclusionist, but it appears to me that the majority of editors are not and so there is no justification for EF having a page of Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 13:11, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems to be nothing more than self-promotion by the group's creator. If EF is as successful as he seems to indicate then perhaps an article on it would be a worthwhile addition to Wikipedia, but I don't see it coming from this and as such, would recommend a deletion. It's very badly written and inconsistant in its presentation. Perhaps one day someone can make a better article on the subject but at the moment, it's just trash on the server. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayter_218b.html" title="User:Hayter">Hayter</a> 12:27, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article in question is an online fanzine, with nothing in the text to suggest that the fanzine has enough influence or renown to render it notable. Much of the text is dedicated to describing the forums of the fanzine, or to regailing the reader with somewhat puerile tales of the antics of the writers. The article is certainly long and in-depth, but this alone should not preclude it from being deleted. I think the authors of the article have failed to satisfactorily demonstrate why the fanzine is notable enough that it deserves an encyclopedia article (e.g. what is the circulation / readership of the fanzine?). <a href="../../../m/c/p/User%7EMcPhail_c66d.html" title="User:McPhail">McPhail</a> 13:18, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While I understand the original response to want to delete this posting, I must claim that the the subject of this entry is quite worthy of an entry. This house plays a significant part in the daily mythology and society of stuents of Porter College at UCSC and, therefore is deserving of a place on Wikipedia as community refenence. There is a significant difference between a housing cooperative and a frat house. More than this, what more reason to validate the existence of this entry than the fact that residents of the house are highly active in the Wikipedia community? While I was not the person who branched out the rest of the pages I propose that, if the entry is allowed to exist, it may be consolodated into one large entry instead of a handful of small nodes. -- Revelude 06:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Comment:</b> By the way, Expansion Fleet is trying to usher votes into this AfD page from their home page. See the message below:<br />

<blockquote>
<p>The article of Expansion Fleet on Wikipedia.org is currently under a hot debate to be deleted. Some "Deletionist" Admins of Wikipedia claim it is "non notable" because they personally don't know it, and attempt to delete it repeatingly at what obviously appears to be a personal attack on anything that doesn't float their boat.</p>
<p>Please help ups keep the article on Wikipedia, by voting "keep" at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Expansion_Fleet_%282nd_nomination%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Expansion_Fleet_%282nd_nomination%29" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>You can do so by going to the URL above, clicking "Edit this page" and then adding (at the bottom of the already posted text) the following line:</p>
<p>'''keep''' any comments here ~~~~</p>
<p>And click "save page" on the bottom.</p>
<p>This needs to be done ASAP if we are to crush the corrupt abuse of the Wikipedia policies by its admins.</p>

This article, simply by being here and through this discussion is, albeit slowly, giving the site exposure to outsiders.

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> - Boxcar Betty was a real person and marginally notable, but there is very little source material to be found to actually make an article. She is the subject of a song by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rovics_e61e.html" title="David Rovics">David Rovics</a>, but a Google search for her excluding his album ("Boxcar Betty" -rovics IWW) turns up one or two hits. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 16:25, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - article needs cleanup and some attempt at organizing the sources that do exist, but it should probably be kept. I'm not sure whether the article should be about the "amalgamated character" or the IWW organizer, but it should probably mention that there was not just one person named that. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Dillon_10d0.html" title="User:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 15:59, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Needs better sourcing. The hobo seems to exist <a href="http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/L.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/L.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> but is this the same person as the IWW organiser? One wouldn't expect much material on a hobo but there's a picture of her at hobos.com and the story of the cat suggests she lives in folklore. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 16:37, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There were actually several people, homeless, hobos, etc. during the depression who got the name Boxcar Betty. The best known was the one referenced in this article. It will be hard to find anything to verify it. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 16:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She does indeed live in folklore. Apart from already mentioned stuff, especially <a href="http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/L.html" class="external free" title="http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/L.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/L.html</a>, I've managed to find references on her in "<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Hill_c26e.html" title="Joe Hill">Joe Hill</a>" by Wallace Stegner, "Silent Dreams" by Dandi Daley MacKall and "Part of Our Time: Some Ruins and Monuments of the Thirties" by Murray Kempton (see Amazon). In order to make it more appropriate, I’ve put "legendary organizer" (rather than mythical, for she probably existed). Also, I added the part from <a href="http://www.thevalkyrie.com/stories/misc2/boxcar.txt" class="external free" title="http://www.thevalkyrie.com/stories/misc2/boxcar.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.thevalkyrie.com/stories/misc2/boxcar.txt</a> "her name itself has become synonomous with rollicking, rough and tumble adventure". I've also mentioned Reitman's "Sister of the Road" on Boxcar Bertha, who, apart from being a fictionalized amalgam, was a Wobbly (see <a href="http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/nudge/joe_murphy.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/nudge/joe_murphy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/nudge/joe_murphy.html</a> for instance), which points out to the interchangeability of the two names (at least in popular accounts such as Rovics's song).</li>
</ul>
<p>It's hard to find many references for an uneducated hobo (probably illiterate), she's primarily a part of oral storytelling.</p>
<p>As David Rovics mentions at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Backstage/1472/rovics.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Backstage/1472/rovics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Backstage/1472/rovics.html</a>: I feel like there is a hidden history in most of my songs; a history that probably less than 1% of American society is really familiar with (that is, those that read the alternative press). Very few people know about David Chain, or Judi Bari, or Boxcar Betty, or the many examples from labor history represented in "Glory and fame," or the fact that Ford built tanks for the nazis. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.35.70.213 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.35.70.213.html" title="User talk:82.35.70.213">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.35.70.213_962b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.35.70.213">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think existence in folklore, literature and music have already been verified, the question whether it was a real figure or a mix of various experiences (although it is highly probable that this person indeed existed) is secondary to its symbolic value, and is so characterised in the article itself (the prefix "legendary" and so on). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.35.70.213 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.35.70.213.html" title="User talk:82.35.70.213">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.35.70.213_962b.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.35.70.213">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although it should be reclassified as 'slang.' The google argument is sound, but I've heard the term used as slang, hence my position. Narphlan 05:31, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page was originally located under the title Democratic peace theory (Correlation is not causation).

He has then mvoed the article to this title to prove a point. Basicially, it as the bastard child of an ongoing battle between two editors who refuse to compromise with each other, and who the arbitration committee failed to deal with. <b>Delete</b> it and let them have their petty arguments elsewhere. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:26, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Move to User space</b> I believe the page contains Ultramarine's original arguments to advocate his PoV, which is that one particular class of peace theory is cpmpletely correct, and others are simply wrong. I have so tagged it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Clearly Irrelavant Article Noting that this is only a small sector of a huge city. Allowing this article would set a precedent that provoke articles talking about gated communities etc. Also let us note the fact that this "area" is a sub-divison of the city of Delhi, noting that Delhi Public School is infact a Private institution and has no affiliation with the city of Delhi. It is noted that the school is only in the City of Delhi. Also note that this University is in the city of delhi. The map confirms that R.K. Puram is only a residential complex in the city.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's difficult to work out from Google just how big an area is involved here. It does include a notable school <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi_Public_School_012d.html" title="Delhi Public School">Delhi_Public_School</a>, several other schools and <i>Shastri Market slum</i> so appears to be big. Also is marked on Delhi maps e.g.<a href="http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/delhi/roadcompanion/np_internationalairport.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/delhi/roadcompanion/np_internationalairport.htm" rel="nofollow">Road Distance Guide from Nehru Place To International Airport</a> OTOH I now suspect there's only a test centre of the University here. There's a map of sorts at <a href="http://ncrb.nic.in/MapNCRB.doc" class="external autonumber" title="http://ncrb.nic.in/MapNCRB.doc" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. Googling for the abbreviation "R. K. Puram" gives more hits than for the full name. I'd really like some input from someone who knows Delhi.

After recreation somebody put an AFD tag, but it pointed to a closed discussion. So I'm just fixing this.

<dd>Usually we don't want people to link to "Czech".

<li>As an industry watcher, the listing publicly that they are working on TS3 means that the game is definitely in early production even if EA has not released a press statement yet.

<p>Hoots Mon <i>is</i> a song by Bad Manners; on the other hand it is also a popular Scottish expression (so a redirect to Bad Manners is inappropriate).

<li>It was used in the Wine Gums advert about 15 years ago ("Hoots mon, there's a moose loose aboot this hoose"). The song is, however, not notable.

<p>Delete. I cannot find any evidence on the Internet that this person exists as stated. Furthermore, the claims that this person is a member of the National Academy of Sciences is demonstratively false, as no person with that name appears in the membership database <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir?sid=1011&amp;view=basic&amp;pg=srch" class="external text" title="http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir?sid=1011&amp;view=basic&amp;pg=srch" rel="nofollow">(1)</a>.

<p>There appear to be a large number of man hours spent developing the start of a comprehensive list of eyewitnesses. Some contributors seem to disagree with the summaries provided of the witnesses’ testimony. There certainly isn’t anything unusual about that.</p>
<p>What the contributor should do if he or she does not agree with the summary, is merely prepare a corrected one. Doing witness summaries are done every day. Its time consuming –but not technically beyond the ability of the average reader without paralegal training in summarizing testimony.</p>
<p>The answer is not to remove the work that has already been done, even if it is imperfect. Is someone suggesting that a comprehensive list of the JFK witnesses is not a good idea. With the constant stream of information coming out of the documents found under the JFK Records Act, this would be a great resource for researchers and students alike.</p>
<p>The references for the testimony needs supplied. This is an absolute requirement. Otherwise how can one check the summary.</p>

It doesn't appear to be a point of view fork. The number of witnesses is huge and cannot reasonably be included in the main article. This is is perfectly acceptable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sometimes, when an article gets long, a section of the article is made into its own article . . . "</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
This rule applies even if the subject is controversial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if the subject of the new article is controversial, this does not automatically make the new article a POV fork."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No signs of POV forking have been established, such as repeated attempts to place information in the main article and having it repeatedly rejected by consensus. all that this article has at its core is a long list of witnesses with summaries of their statements. The rule is, just because one doen't agree with the content one shouldn't delete it but debate it and do some work on the article. Put some work at least in the explanation on why it should be deleted if not the article itself. <a href="../../../r/p/j/User%7ERPJ_4c8b.html" title="User:RPJ">RPJ</a> 22:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC) <b>Bold text</b></p>

</pre>
<p>Well OK... Here's an example from a Dallas Deputy that pretty much sums up the value of the sound of the gunshots as a means to tell where the shots came from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Craig</li>
<li>OCCUPATION :Dallas Deputy Sheriff</li>
<li>LOCATION : Main &amp; Houston</li>
<li>SOURCE OF SHOTS : Could Not Tell</li>
<li>NUMBER OF SHOTS : 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DEPOSITION: April 1, 1964. 6H263</li>
</ul>
<p><i>It was hard to tell because-uh-they had an echo you know. There was actually two explosions with each one. There was the-uh-the shot and then the echo from it. So, it was hard to tell."</i></p>
<p>So...... Here is <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-3.html#films|" class="external text" title="http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-3.html#films|" rel="nofollow"><b>eye-witness</b> testimony</a>, given under oath, before the Warren Commision. I will point out in particular the statements of Howard L. Brennan and the young Amos Lee Euins. They <b>saw</b> Oswald shoot his rifle at the presidents limosine from the TSBD.</p>
<p>I'll conclude with this quote from the WCR:</p>
<p><i>The cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic experts and medical authorities demonstrated that the shots were fired from above and behind President Kennedy and Governor Connally, more particularly, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building.</i> <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 04:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The web site that is being criticized by "Mytwocents' has about the same percentage split between the witnesses as do the two researchers cited in the main JFK Assassination article (roughly 50-50).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Warren Report was heavily criticized by the HSCA for not reviewing the medical records, did not try to make reasoned analysis of why the witnesses heard gunshots from different directions, nor even inquire into a conspiracy by two shooters. The Commission started off with the FBI conclusion there was one shooter, and the objective of the Commission was to convince the public that there was only one shooter and no conspiracy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is no wonder that so very few people believe the Warren Commission's conclusions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The polls show only from 17% to 35% of the people believe the one shooter theory espoused by the Warren Commission.<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/937a1JFKAssassination.pdf" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></dd>

<dd>In 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board issued this statement in footnote 17:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Doubts about the Warren Commission's findings were not restricted to ordinary Americans. Well before 1978, President Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and four of the seven members of the Warren Commission all articulated, if sometimes off the record, some level of skepticism about the Commission's basic findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dd>Mytwocents should also realize that the fact that one shooter exists (even if known positively to be true) does not in any way preclude a second shooter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The official statements of well over 40 witnesses that shots came from some where else besides the Book Depository should be looked at rather than dismissing them because someone else states that he doesn't seem to know where the shots came from. Using that logic, many prosecutors would likely lose perfectly good cases. He has plenty of witnesses, but defense counsel trots out a couple of witnesses that testify "I couldn't really tell you what I saw and heard", and on that basis the defendant goes free. Does tha make any sense?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is the reason for assembling all of the witness statement, researcher can make up their own minds. For many years the Warren Commission kept much of its proceedings secret, and took its testimony in secret.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>The testimony of Deputy Craig cited by "Mytwocents" provides another good example why actual witness testimony is important; and the first step towards getting testimony all sorted out and analyzed is getting it summarized. This is an invaluable help. One should never stop at summary but it is a great place to start.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Deputy Roger Craig gave these statements:</p>
<p>On Nov 22, 1963 Roger Craig. was a Deputy Sheriff near the scene of the assassination . He was up looking for evidence near the railroad tracks right after the shooting. He talked to witnesses that saw two men together up on the sixth floor of the Book depository before the shooting and one had a rifle with a scope on it.</p>
<p>Then he was across the street from the grassy knoll about 15 minutes after the shooting and said “ I saw a light-colored station wagon, driving real slow, coming west on Elm Street from Houston. . . . And the driver was leaning to his right looking up the hill at [a] man running down.”</p>
<p>He said in a written statement the man was running “from the direction of the book depository, and jump into [the] station wagon driven by another man that drove away quickly.”</p>
<p>Deputy Craig testified: “I kept thinking about this subject that had run and got in the car. So, I called Captain Fritz' office and talked to one of his officers and--uh--told him what I had saw and give him a description of the man, asked him how it fit the man they had picked up as a suspect [Oswald]. And--uh--it was then they asked me to come up and look at him at Captain Fritz' office.”</p>
<p><br />
Then Deputy Craig said in a written statement, that “later that afternoon I went to the City Hall and identified the suspect they had in custody as being the same person I saw running down this hill and get into the station wagon and leave the scene.” Then, while Deputy Craig was there identifying the man, Captain Fritz then asked "What about this station wagon?" and the suspect interrupted him and said, "That station wagon belongs to Mrs. Paine"---I believe is what he said. "Don't try to tie her into this. She had nothing to do with it."</p>
<p>Captain Fritz then said “All we're trying to do is find out what happened, and this man saw you leave from the scene."</p>
<p>And the suspect again interrupted Captain Fritz and said, "I told you people I did.. Everybody will know who I am now."</p>
<p>Now for those who have read about Oswald know that Mrs. Paine is the very woman that Oswald’s wife was living with, and in whose garage Oswald allegedly stored his rifle.</p>
<p><br />
This information seems to have collided with a favorite theory of the Warren Commission that Oswald made his get-away after assassinating the president by taking a bus and have some evidence they claim to have rounded up to thatt effect. The Warren Commission did not want to find an accomplice. So they tried to shake the deputy’s story which seems to be a useful tactic “Have you discussed with Sheriff Decker the fact that when Oswald was picked up they found a bus transfer in his pocket? Mr. CRAIG - No; I knew--uh nothing about a bus transfer.”</p>
<p>Then he is asked again if he was sure of his identification and tried to shake him again but again the deputy stuck to his story.</p>
<p>Mr. BELIN - Do you feel, in your own mind, that the man you saw at Captain Fritz's office was the same man that you saw running towards the station wagon? Mr. CRAIG - Yes, I feel like it was. Mr. BELIN - Do you feel that you might have been influenced by the fact that you knew he was the suspect---subconsciously, or do you---- Mr. CRAIG - Well, it's---it's possible, but I still feel strongly that it was the same person.</p>
<p><br />
Now, at this point the reader must remember that the Warren Commission didn’t want any accomplice picking up Oswald when he was making a run for it. J. Edgar Hoover is on record wanting to convince the public that Oswald did this alone, and the Warren Commission’s objective was convince the public that there was no conspiracy. Hoover and a deputy attorney general drafted amemo to form the commission and said "The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large." It is still a mystery why this should have been an objective.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Conclusion</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is why the testimony of all the witnesses should be available, indexed, summarized and otherwise made available to the public to historians, and importantly to criminal prosecutors. There may be murderers still running around that need to be arrested, tried and convicted of killing the president. There is no statute of limitations on murder.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>. Once the list is generated, the corresponding entries could be of great use to the rest of the Wikipedia for the significance of a lodge name as to a particular geographical area. For example, the name of my OA lodge in Indiana is Jaccos Towne, given to us by the Wea people, and the totem would be the river otter. Prior to that, though, there were two other lodges that merged into Jaccos Towne with even more history attached to the area. Perhaps an explanation of a lodge at the main list entry would help matters. <a href="../../../k/c/9/User%7EKc9cqj_c586.html" title="User:Kc9cqj">KC9CQJ</a> 17:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If nobody thinks this info is notable or of use to anyone, then by all means it should not waste space. However, I am sure there are more than a handful of people from Illinois who have some sort of tie to the OA lodges and wish to expand this list. The end goal should be to have someone with knowledge of each lodge create sepearate articles, such that this list is a springboard to a vast amount of information.

<li><b>pet peeve</b>. I think its great you voted keep for the school. Of course I normally vote keep also. But, I, and I assume you, also check the school is real first. That typically involves a google, and finding at a bare minimum, the school's web site. When you do, could you please add it to the article. That way, the next person who comes to the AFD, doesn't have to repeat the same steps you already performed.

<li>Since you've said this a few times, I suggest you take a look at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Category%7EElementary_schools_in_the_United_States_d70c.html" title="Category:Elementary schools in the United States">Category:Elementary schools in the United States</a>, and subcats like <a href="../../../e/l/e/Category%7EElementary_schools_in_California_486c.html" title="Category:Elementary schools in California">Category:Elementary schools in California</a>. Also, take a browse through <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_2005_b29c.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive/2005</a>. You'll find that there is quite a few stand alone elementary school articles that survived an AFD (only a small fraction were merged). Merging may be appropriate for substubs, but it makes little sense for substantial articles regardless of grade level. But, you're still entitled to want to merge primaries and wish it was the standard. But, I don't know why you claim it is a standard. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:32, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm actually referring to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>, which, though it is by no means a "policy," suggests the possibility of being bold and merging "Short, uninformative school articles." That's my rationale for merging primary schools, though I may have worded it wrong. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 02:22, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In case we're talking about different things I'm talking only about <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html#Current_proposal_for_schools" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools#Current proposal for schools</a>, which is the results of the most recent discussions, which had majority, but non-consensus support. It says nothing about whether a school is primary or secondary, which seems to be your primary criteria. Instead it focusses mainly on whether there is sufficient content in the article. Where does it say primaries *specifically* should be merged in most cases? Also, please note that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html#Current_proposal_for_schools" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools#Current proposal for schools</a> is the most recent result of discussions of mergers, and other text on the page is somewhat older. But even the text you quoted doesn't specify primaries. What's the deal with primaries? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:42, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We are talking about different things. I'm just referring the fact that I support the merging of primary schools, per the merging suggestion in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. I know it doesn't differentiate between primary and secondary schools. Hence, you'll note that I said it was "<i>my</i> rationale for merging primary schools."</li>
<li>I suppose if you want a explanation of my error, I began using this inaccurate wording of ("standard") from similarly inaccurate votes in previous school AfDs. Voters, in the past, have suggested that the primary/secondary division may have been a "standard." In addition, for example, CalJW's keep vote below specifies that there's something unique in that this article is about a high school ("as with any high school"), as opposed to a school on another level. The discussion of schools is, obviously, far from my primary focus on Wikipedia, and I suppose I was simply inaccurate in the way I worded my own argument. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 04:53, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
