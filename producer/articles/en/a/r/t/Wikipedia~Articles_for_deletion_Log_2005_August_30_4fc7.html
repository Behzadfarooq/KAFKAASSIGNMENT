<li><b>Keep</b> or merge. Since when is that a metric, Quasi? We should throw out notable books because they sold poorly with the public recently? Will this be, to paraphrase Network, "the first known case of a book being removed from history for having low sales ratings?" Many notable books may not sell like hotcakes to the public in 2005. I spent about 2 minutes trying to think off the top of my head something that might be a good example (obviously dependent on what the top of my head looks like), and so far I've at least come up with "The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: Volume 1" and "Black Beauty" which are both in the 200ks, as well as Mrs. Lirriper by Charles Dickens which, by your metric, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1843911310/qid=1125373351/sr=1-201/ref=sr_1_201/102-8283018-9401730?v=glance&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1843911310/qid=1125373351/sr=1-201/ref=sr_1_201/102-8283018-9401730?v=glance&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">HALF</a> as important as the subject of this VfD since it weighs in at 1200k on the Amazon Cashometre. I understand the temptation to use arbitrary rankings, especially in these times of high information availability, rather than looking at the specific circumstances in each case, is very strong.

<li>It's a metric in this sense because it can be used to measure something. I found an edition of Black Beauty at about 25K; the fact that they have multiple editions should ring bells, as well as the fact they're still in print after a century. Instead of pointing at Black Beauty and asking why it has a page, why not point out why this is notable? --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 08:23, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up. Egyptian rope stretching is significant in the development of surveying, engineering, and mathematics.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article definitely needs work. It meanders from rope stretching to milestones.

Concentrate the article on the art of rope stretchers only. The Mille Passus stuff may be correct, but it has been written in such a confusing form that only someone who studies ancient measurements would be able to understand it. Please, Rktect, if you're reading any of this, could you not use the abbreviated form of ancient measurements, and please include their current day metric equivolent. Also, what is 3kr? You say it's some ancient god, but surely, they didn't give him a name beginning with a number did they? - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:04, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I believe that is an attempt to represent an IPA symbol in ASCII. I think that what is intended is ɜkr (<a href="../../../a/k/e/Aker.html" title="Aker">Aker</a>?). In the <i>Oxford Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology</i> (ISBN 02519096X) they show <i>ka</i> (life force) as kɜ and <i>ba</i> (soul) as bɜ and the goddess <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a> (Aset) as ɜst, as well as using the symbols ḥ, ḫ, ṭ, and ḏ, among others. (Hope people can see those unicode characters.) But the convention is to mention these forms of names once initially, and then use a more common form (like Isis) throughout. <a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> should indicate more clearly when such a form is being used. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 08:57, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The majority of the material in this article is totally irrelevant for the subject, and is a just a copy of other pages on VfD (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mille_passus&amp;oldid=22049335" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mille_passus&amp;oldid=22049335" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), exactly as stated by Drini, so the <b>speedy delete</b> criteria is fullfilled. The surveyors of ancient Egypt and other cultures played an important role, so the subject is definitely worthy of an article. In my opinion it would be best to start from scratch, but if some Wikipedian declares that they are willing to do the major rework and trimming necessary to fullfill Wikipedia criterias of quality, and prepare to take the burden of <i><b>keeping it that way</b></i>, then the article can be kept, probably after a rename. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 08:38, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> I am casting my vote to keep this page in its revised form. Having listened carefuly to your constructive criticism I have edited the page and removed some material.

This is not original research but represents research that goes back at least to Palladio and Viruvius. It is not a mispelling of PEZ. It is not a reposting of material covered elsewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I strongly disagree with the nominators general bias against elementary schools. Many are highly significant to a community, and are often a source of educational innovation. A reader, wishing to learn about the education system in a place, will do much better to read a few good school articles, than read the inhrently spotty and vague coverage of education done in typical town's article (if any coverage exists). However, I'm as opposed to mass stub creation, as I am to mass deletion. Nothing in *this* article demonstrates current or future value. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 09:13, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: The same arguement could be used to delete every article on every place. In general, an encyclopedia is a starting point of research, not an ending point. A traveler may read about a country they knew nothing about in an encyclopedia to get the basics, but they won't use it as an actual travel guide. Same deal with schools. They might research schools of a certain type in a certain region, but won't use an encyclopedia as a guide in their final school selection. We're not travel guide, or a school guide; but we can still have places and schools. You're comment about "relevant" sources could be used to delete literally every article in wikipedia because every one is *supposed* to be based on reliable verifiable external sources, which serious researches will look at directly. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 14:24, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

Almost all of <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Bonner_8bfa.html" title="User:Sean Bonner">User:Sean Bonner</a>'s contributions (under his name and IPs) appear to take the form of advocating himself, or his sites by inserting links to his name or externals to the blogs he runs. In the vast majority of cases editors have simply removed his additions without paying attention to the systematic nature of his changes. Because of the nature of interlinking blogs, I feel I am not qualified to judge the merit of this article (I can't gauge the site's popularity because its linkspammed all over the internet), but Sean's pattern of self promotion make me strongly suspect that this article is just more vanity material. <a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 02:19, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, first off, let me say that I'm a friend of Sean's and write for a Metroblogging site, just to be up front about it. I think that a good argument can be made that Sean hasn't added this for vanity reasons since he doesn't even have a page about himself on Wikipedia. I also think that various Metroblogging sites have become sources for up to the minute news during some disasters. The current devastation in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina and the two attacks on London's subway system are good examples. They are sites that are linked to and quoted from major publications and some of the biggest sites on the web. The page needs improvement, but it is defiantly Wikipedia worthy.--<a href="../../../g/m/h/User%7EGMHenninger_3c6c.html" title="User:GMHenninger">Grant</a> 19:14, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not "controversial". The term simply doesn't exist except in the troll's head. Harriet Tubman was an anti-slavery activist in the 19th century. Apparently the troll thinks naming two black queens after a black woman is funny, and that the name "tubman" itself is somehow funny. The troll has been vandalizing all over the encyclopedia, and this stupid article is just another bit of his childish vandalism. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:01, September 6, 2005 (UTC)

<p>The documentation of Nazi crimes is surely a worthy task. However, the question here is whether each individual concentration camp guard should have a Wikipedia page. There is an entire Category:Personnel of Nazi concentration camps, which is populated with bios of mostly non-notable female guards. (BTW, where are all the men?). One of those was deleted in early August at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Thea_Miesl_018a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Thea Miesl">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Thea Miesl</a>.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> This is a conprehensive online encyclopedia, why can't we be inclusive and have a broad spectrum of people. He might only be a candidate in your eyes but you don't live in Allentown and see the force he is having on local politics. Imagine if you just randomly erased political candidates names from here because you as the holy Gods of Wikipedia deem them unworthy. Benjamin Franklin never held a major elected office, maybe he is not worthy to be on here. Ralph Nader and Ross Perot were only third party candidates, maybe they shouldn't be included here.Shouldn't we accept all of God's creatures great and small. Who are we to judge someones entire life as unworthy of inclusion. I think this entire policy of notability is just plain facist and bordering on out right Big Brotherism. We are all people and no one is worthy or not worthy. We should have no policy of notibility and include everyone great and small. We are human beings, we are flesh, we suffer and die everyday and every single person is worthy. Who are you to judge someones worthiness, you spend most of your time editing an online encyclopedia for free, are you so superior. Let him be included, let everyone who has taken a breath on this green earth be included and let them stand amongst us all, naked and bare, human beings taking their place in this universe.

<li>I guess I just don't understand the notibility system here on Wikipedia. On the Allentown, PA page it has as a famous Allentownian the guy who does the voice of Master Shake on Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Now is that that much of an achievement to be included on Wikipedia, and yet a person who is seeking the Mayorship is a nobody. It also has the girl who played a bit part in Mean Girls. These people are very marginially famous yet get included. Where do you draw the line? What about doctors and firefighters, they are much more significant people in society then bit actors, would they be granted a page? Or does Wikipedia value the whims of pop culture more than the true heroes of society? I think this deletion policy is just too vague and since this is a very expandable online database, why not let everyone be included? Bodhi395

<li>Successful voice actors are notable. Not-yet-successful mayoral candidates are not. Losing at an election is not a notable accomplishment. Now, if you want to write an article about the major of Allentown, go for it. As far as I'm concerned, mayors are notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Mr. Molovinsky is certainly not notable outside Allentown, and as a third party candidate is of doubtful notability in it unless that notability can be documented. My own personal threshold for political notability is can he get 5,000 votes, but that's not a Wikipolicy. Unless something more notable than being a third-party candidate in a mayoral election in a medium-sized city (pop. 106,632) can be shown, he's not notable. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 05:53, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This appears to be a vanity article about a highschool newspaper and does not establish notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is the climax of the book, a matter of great interest to readers. Pointless merging it with the article on the book as a whole, as this description is already much longer than the description there for the entire book. It could not sensibly be merged without greatly extending the rest of the article on 'half blood prince'. Keeping it separate is consistent with the way topics have been 'farmed out' rather than having everything on that page. It is relevant to quite a few other pages. It belongs here as part of the set of articles on HP, not dumped on Wikibooks muggles guide (which is just disorganised stuff previously dumped from here for no very good reason.) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 02:48, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ooh, no votes at all, don't think I've ever seen that happen before. As for {{vfd}} vs. {{subst:vfd}}, I've yet to be given any argument for it and it's more typing, so I'm just not convinced. If you really want to dredge the matter up again, have a look at my comments in the argument on talk back when the <b>subst:</b> was first added to the instructions. I'll grant you, it would have prevented some of the collateral damage caused by the namechange war, but that damage and a lot more would have been prevented if people had thought of way to migrate from one name to the other without lots of breakage <i>before</i> fucking with the template.

<p>Some guy said it to me at a club night in Manchester a couple of years ago. The DJ was playing a different style of music to what was normally played there(he was playing house music at a breakbeat club night). The guy said something along the lines of "I can't believe what this guy's playing. He's off the f*****g Tomp!" When I asked him to explain what he was talking about he said "You know, off the Tompkinson", and then preceded to tell me that his mate read about this theory of a measurement of culture clash based on a comparison of how much of an outsider the priest from Ballykissangel was. He seemed surprised that I hadn't heard of it since he knew a lot of people who used it for all sorts of situations.<small><i>(This unsigned edit by 80.176.80.17)</i></small>80.176.80.17 15:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As per one of the earlier posts I recall reading an article on this issue in a magazine while I lived in Manchester. It was a few years ago, so my memory is a little hazy, but I think it the magazine was called 'sub' (or it was at least something extremely similar). I can't confirm that the whole entry is consistent with the original article (for example I don't recall muslim/wider environment refs) but i'm pretty sure it is at least consistent with the general thrust of the article (in terms of the drama/ comedy tradeoff w.r.t. ballykissangel). Rather than delete the whole entry, would it not be preferable, if necessary, to just tidy it up a little? 62.253.64.15 00:13, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems to be a slightly controversal theory but i do dimly remember hearing it being explained and then excitedly discussed a couple of years ago at a house party. On the surface it may seem a slightly frivilous way to measure the cultural impact of something but does indeed capture the imagination ( for the Ballykissangel generation at least). Maybe it's a theory confined to the north West but i have witnessed it being used in normal conversation so it deserves to stay as an insightful page on this website.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article clearly isn’t science and, as it isn’t masquerading as such, cannot be described as pseudoscience. And having been published in Sub Magazine in Manchester neither does it fall into the category of original research. Given the timescales does it even fall under the rationale of neologism? May be better described as logism?! The writing style is fine and so it is difficult to describe it as nonsense. And unverifyable!?! At worst this article could be described as non-notable and possibly vain but this is rather subjective and it seems a shame to delete a perfectly good article for being too provincial.82.17.24.13 11:40, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Keep</b>: Please dont delete this without even trying it. It has a few google hits because of two reasons&#160;: 1) Its started just a few weeks ago. 2)I dont have enough resource or marketing power to increase the google hits(because this is developed as an individual effort). Give this a chance.. the rankings will follow.. I have no objection in deleting the other page about me, but please dont delete this. The article was created in similar way of a similar service, where there was a link to the page of its creator. So I followed it. If that was wrong, please delete the other page(about me), but please leave this page. I humbly request you to try the service before concluding that there is nothing notable in this.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I completely respect the comments of all other members who all are more experienced with wiki process. But after reading through the wiki policies I came to know the following points. I hope those are applicable for this case also.
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html#Does_lack_of_fame_make_a_vanity_article.3F" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Lack of fame doesnot constitute Vanity</a></li>
<li>Lack of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> is not a criterion for deletion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I kindly request to consider these while taking a decision on this. --Jose sam 17:44, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree that it was rubbish, though two months is really much too short for any kind of organic growth--from experience I'd say that six months is a reasonable minimum. I removed the vanity stuff about the new headmistress and plonked in very brief summaries of what OFSTED and DFES have to say about the school. And the BBC league table for good measure. It's a very good, though not exceptionally good, secondary school.

If you, personally, don't like the idea that somebody might read about this school (as I have), you don't have to think about it.

This distinction is actually important. Elsewhere (incidentally at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html#Keep" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep</a> we have a definition: "'An encyclopedia is a written compendium of knowledge.' -- '...

<li>I strongly disagree with this. The article describes the school as one of two of its kind in Fleet, it relates the school's educational performance to the local area and to the country, and the standards of teaching to the inspections that are carried out by OFSTED. The article is also categorized as a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Category%7ESchools_in_Hampshire_d41b.html" title="Category:Schools in Hampshire">Hampshire school</a>. It is thus simply incorrect to state that the article provides "nothing to put the data into context". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:40, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is nothing but a directory entry. It's "one of two of its kind in Fleet", so you say, now in which regard is it different from the other? Why would anyone prefer to go to <i>this</i> school instead of the other? The entry doesn't provide for an "encyclopaedic", i.e. well-rounded education. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collis_P._Huntington_High_School_886f.html" title="Collis P. Huntington High School">Collis P.

<ul>
<li>The question "in which regard is it different from the other?" is easily answered. it's a completely different school. You seem to be arguing that an encyclopedia should server a pedagogic function--you ask how reading this article make someone better off (I presume this is intended to ask how does the reader learn an "improving" lesson). Well that isn't the function of an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia provides useful, verifiable information on a subject. This article does that. It doesn't set out to answer imponderable questions such as was Huntington High somehow better than Court Moor, or will the reader be "better off" for possessing knowledge--the reader who chooses to read the article can answer those questions himself if they're the kind of question that interest him. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:38, 3 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>An encyclopedia provides knowledge, not data, as in the quotation above. The entry reads as if it were taken from a directory of schools and thus is not up to scratch. In fact, it <i>is</i> mostly data from the OFSTED website. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 10:14, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A person reading the article by the time he gets to the bottom of the page will be aware that the academic and vocational performance of the school with respect to the local area and to the nation is rather good. It is true that is could also be described as data, but it is undeniably knowledge. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:37, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/e/WP%7EBEEFSTEW_1799.html" title="WP:BEEFSTEW">WP:BEEFSTEW</a> point H puts it down more succincly than I ever could. The OFSTED data is nothing <i>distinct</i>, nothing that sets it apart from other schools. Also see point I. It's disappointing if nothing can be said about a school <i>apart</i> from its OFSTED/DFES evaluation. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:14, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually that is one of the problems I have with BEEFSTEW. It's requirements are arbitrary and use words like "distinct" that tend to be interpreted in a non-intuitive manner by some who adhere to it. Schools are self-evidently distinct--they reside in different locations, they have different staff and students, they teach different ages, they teach different subjects and they provide different extra-curricular activities. Their academic performance is distinct and they have different connections to their respective communities. While you may be disappointed by a school article because it doesn't tell an improving moral lesson, or OFSTED figures bore you, I don't see this as a reason to delete an article. It's obvious to me, but not to you, that the OFSTED figures distinguish this school from the average. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:50, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We are discussing <i>articles on schools</i>, not schools themselves. (You are referring to "moral lessons", why is that?) <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:24, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article makes the distinctions of the school clear, in my opinion. If it didn't then we wouldn't be able to say whether the school was distinct from any other (indeed we wouldn't even be able to discuss its name, location, school system, curriculum or OFSTED figures because those in themselves are distinctive). I use the term "moral lessons" because it's the only way I can interpret your earlier use of the phrase "but how is anyone who has read <i>this</i> entry better off?" in the context of a school in which clearly a person who reads the article has absorbed some information about the school. It seemd to me that, since knowing that the school was considerably better than the run of English schools didn't seem to qualify as being "better off", you must be using some other meaning of the term, and so I plumped for the moral dimension. I did mention this conundrum at the time. Feel free to be more specific. I feel better off for knowing that the school is in Fleet, a town I know reasonably well, and is considered a good school. Since the information could be useful to me and was acquired as no cost to myself, I consider it excellent value. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:27, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Obviously if one of these schools has something exceptional to expand the 'knowledge' in wikipedia beyond the 'information' in the OFSTED database then it warrants it's own page. There is nothing in the current Court Moor School page that can be regarded as knowledge over information. If information is the priority for wikipedia then bus timetables etc. should be acceptable. Even stock prices that change on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Why is it better to link to schools that do not add to the information already in the OFSTED databases? This has the advantage of being vandal free and up to date. Note that the main reason would be for the information to be current. One might argue that the links will be vandalised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Silensor#Why_not_link_to_OFSTED.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Silensor#Why_not_link_to_OFSTED.3F" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. This is true but it is still preferable to having the actual information on a wiki page. If I vandalise a link it is clear since the link will not work. If I change a data point on the page from 15% to 25% it is not obviously vandalism and might even be considered a legitimate update. Once the Court Moor School page has more than OFSTED and DFES data on it's page then it will be worth keeping. For now I do not see the problem of having it associated only with the Fleet page. i.e. merge or redirect to that page. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 23:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous. There are five deletes, 2 keeps and 1 redirect. Usually, I would not delete with such a vote count, but after reading the comments presented here, I feel the need to use my discretion a bit. First, there is no consensus that there should <i>never</i> be an article on this, indeed some of the "delete"s say that a more neutral article without original research should be put in its place, so therefore I will not turn this this page into a redirect. Furthermore, one of the two "keep"s said "but not in this form" and so there appears to be a consensus that there are serious issues with the article, and I therefore feel that an outright "no consensus keep" result cannot be justified either. Based upon that, I will call the result of this debate as <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:27, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, this will seem a strange topic to delete, but here's the reason. It is too vaugue to write an article on this. The current one asserts that controversy is due to intolerance, but that's a POV, reductionist and partonizing (see my comments on article talkpage) - controversy can simply be honust and informed disagreements over truth claims. Religious controversy could include every type of informed (or uniformed) theological difference of opinion within, and between, religions - from 'what shall we sing in my church on sunday?' through 'is their a God/afterlife?' and 'shall we pray/teach evolution in school?' to 'who's going to hell?'. I wanted to redirect this somewhere - but any redirect is bound to be loaded - unless we redirect to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> itself. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 11:17, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to religion. I agree with the reasoning above. Any good article about this subject is bound to be either POV or original research. --<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomedae_bf2b.html" title="User:Lomedae">Lomedae</a> 12:38, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am tempted to classify this entry as nonsense: certainly POV. Examples provided aren't religious controversies, but are aspects of religion which the editor presumably has a personal beef with. If there was anything of interest I would suggest a merge to religion or specific religions as appropriate.

<li>I looked up the edit history: this thing started as a poorly worded dicdef, and I think the subsequent edits kind of hid that fact. The whole field is fraught with ambiguities. Large controversies may cover up personal animosities, just as personal animosities may be motivated by genuine disagreements on religions. The place this really needs to go to be NPOV is to an article in the realm of the anthropology of religion, but I don't know anyone who is writing that kind of analysis; if they are, we'd be up against some original research. So I'm voting for <b>Delete</b> in the hopes that if someone wants to start a new article (BTW, I am <i>not</i> volunteering), they could do so with a better starting point. --<a href="../../../k/j/p/User%7EKJPurscell_1583.html" title="User:KJPurscell">KJPurscell</a> 02:36, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, actually it's a lot more than that, it's probably the best tribute existing for the band New Order... and to say it's from "a few fans" isn't really what it was. I was just updating the New Order discography, wanted to add the tribute albums as well. This is a very serious album actually, sponsored by the band themselves... I think it was worth being included in wikipedia due to the "nature" of the project being very original. Sure isn't for commercial reasons, this album is out of print.

<li><b>The article still is an outrage and so are the many lying and hostile Wikipedia "contributers"</b>
<ul>
<li>I knew that this stupid article would result in lots of work for me, just because some people just can't leave me alone.

<dd>Barbara, you lived in Germany and now live in the US. By most people's definition of the term, you are an expatriate.

<p>now living in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was the president of the German branch of the Church of Scientology from August 3, 1983 until July 10, 1984. [1]. Schwarz is no longer active in the Church of Scientology (she states that she was "kicked out" in 1984).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I wrote I was kicked out by a non-scientological infiltrator, a friend of Tilman Hausherr with name of Brigitta Harrington. She was NO Scientologist. She left Scientology right after she kicked me illegally out. She is an enemy of Scientology. As is it was said, when an Al Queda guy kicks a Jew out of a Synagoge, is that Jew no member of the Jewish religion anymore? I posted over and over that the Church of Scientology asked me several times to come back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, what is to make of these many ARS postings that claim that I would work for the Org Special Unit or those that saw me entering the Church of Scientology in Salt Lake? For anybody's info: as soon I have more time, I will be back in the C of S, which only the non-scientologicial infiltrators will not appreciate. So, why is that not in the article? Despite this fact, Barbara still considers herself a Scientologist, if no longer officially a member of the Church.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That is not true, and bad grammar. I never resigned and I never was excommunicated, for heavens sake. I am also a lifetime member of the International Association for Scientologists. The number is 12182 038 0003 8519. Check with them and ask them also what they think if the biased Wikipedia article on L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Schwarz is also known as the current holder of the record for most requests filed by a single individual under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Prove that some reporters did not file more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Schwarz has submitted thousands of FOIA requests to the United States Government</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You should order the logs of all federal agencies and check how often my name appears on their FOIA logs from 1998 through 2001, the years in which I filed FOIA requests. I bet a Million Dollars with you that just a few hundreds FOIA requests of mine are recorded in those logs. If Wikipedia wants to publish an article about me, their contributors have to make real research and not just allow Scientology haters to put lies on their site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and followed these up with dozens of lawsuits against thousands of federal employees. Many of these attempt to substantiate her claims that she is the granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the daughter of Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, that she grew up on a secret submarine base on the Great Salt Lake, and that her husband Mark (aka Marty) Rathbun was wrongfully arrested in Madrid, Spain, in 1988 and taken to the United States, where he is secretly being held.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I posted over and over that I did not grow up in a secret submarine base but was kidnapped to Germany. Prove that I said I grew up in such a base.</li>
<li>As far as my law suits are concerned, they were about that the federal workers conducted no lawful searches to my FOIA requests.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Because the anti-Scientologists libeled me before I ever posted there. When I leave they become even worse with lies and forgeries. They are criminals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Her posts are sometimes defensive of the Church of Scientology,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I don't defend the Church of Scientology. I correct the lies about the religion Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard. Tilman's (who works for German secret service OPC) purpose is to portray me wrongfully as confused or mentally ill person. He doesn't know me, and that is his problem. His secret service has greatest interest in him and others spreading lies about me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but other times she insists that while the church's "technology" (scripture) works, the current hierarchy of the church is corrupt, due to infiltration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I never said that any hierarchy of the church is/was corrupt, but I indeed made the personal experience that the Scientology organizations are infiltrated by non-Scientologists. The German branch even filed a law suit against Tilman's secret service to make them pull their agents out, which they didn't.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other posts have recounted her travels during the 1980s and how she was arrested on various occasions, including for illegally entering the White House, and twice confined to a mental health hospital in the U.S. and once in Germany. [2] [3] [4] [5]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Arrested for "various occasions"? Tilman just want to make me look bad and cover up that German secret service are not just watching Scientologists illegally but also plotting against them and denying them their human rights. The U.S. Department of State mentions Germany every year in their Human Rights report because of the abuses against Scientology.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Germans are crazy, they still have their Nazi boots on, allowed Atta and his cell to plot Sept. 11 while they were and still are occupied to spy and plot against harmless Scientologists.</li>
<li>I never entered illegally in the White House. I never committed any crime, except having had no food for 14 days and taking nectarines worth five bucks with the intention to pay them back. All cases against me were indeed plotted. Read for yourself what happened to me in my 92 parts series, which is a draft only, but correct in details.</li>
<li>Why are the crimes by the German government against me concealed in the article? For the sake of arguments, let say for a moment that I am crazy. But how come the German government who started to constantly pull the rug out from underneath my feet, is not accused of having caused that? Tilman protects his fanatical government. I was lied to by with the German's co-conspiring police that I am needed as witness in Germany. At the border I was told that I was arrested, but they had no charges against me. I saw a judge who denied to me any contact to an attorney despite the German law says everybody arrested has a right to an attorney.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He told me that I am arrested because I tried to intimidate Klaus Karbe, an ex-official in Germany, in a phone conversation to call off an international event to introduce "deprogramming" to Europe. (Deprogramming is the cruel procedure of breaking somebody's belief with all kinds of criminal methods.) Read about the father of deprogramming here: <a href="http://www.parishioners.org/false_exp/patrick1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.parishioners.org/false_exp/patrick1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.parishioners.org/false_exp/patrick1.html</a> The German district attorney Juergen Keltsch made the charges up after my arrest, and German police transported me in deliberately too tight handcuffs for at least eight hours in a train through Germany. I was beaten by German police, and when I became upset they lied that I am crazy and stuffed me in a mental institution where I had to sit for eight months because they tried to "deprogram me" from Scientology because they wanted a former President to attack Scientology. The German psychiatrists from hell messed my kidneys up with who knows what was in those injections. My kidneys became hard and painful. Tilman's friend Ingo Heinemann was very much involved in that process, and this fanatical man even wanted to become my "guardian"! I was not allowed to talk to any attorney over many weeks, and the German government plotted behind my back with the judges, and they issued one degree after the other against me without that I had any chance to defend myself against it. What a "fine" country Tilman works for, and I did not just claim that the SEGNPMSS was involved but also the OPC for which Tilman Hausherr and his good friend Ursula Caberta works. The case against me was dismiss years later, I was wrongfully arrested for such a long time. And - two years later, I was kidnapped by three deprogrammers and badly hurt in an attempt to flee. Isn't that an irony? I protested against it, and the government kidnapped me from Copenhagen to penalize me for that, and then I become the victim of what I protested against! Furthermore why is nowhere in the article that a Police Officer and a U.S. Marshall broke my arm twice without provocation, during these "arrests" in Washington, that they took my $ 2000, threw me in the streets at night, etc? And when I protested that, they lied that I am crazy and need to see a psych. What a rotten world it is and what a lousy article that Wikipedia article about me is. Everything but how it really was. If Wikipedia wants to write an article about me then write a true one, and not a German OPC organized and approved article that sweeps all their organized crimes against me under the carpet.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Shovel</b> the article, is my vote. I am Barbara Schwarz. Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>is a piece of junk. I can't force anybody here to write a truthful and factual article about me, but I certainly can spread the word that Wikipedia allows gangs as Alt.Religion.Scientology (ARS)to defame and libel and portray people in false light on their website, people who delete any neutral and correct data, and I am tired to waste my time on this Mickey Mouse encyclopedia, founded by pornographer Jimbo Wales. Who believes the articles on Wikipedia has a major IQ problem. First of all, Wikipedia board and administrators should study the laws before they allow discrimination and libel on the Wikipedia webpage. When a local paper writes about a person, when that person posts on Usenet that does not make her to a public figure. You should clear the legal definition of it before. I am no public figure per legal definition. Tilman Hausherr, who wrote most of that article and controls it like a lunatic, is an enemy of the USA, wants to hurt the American tourism and wants to blame it on Scientology. He posted at least 24.000 hate messages on Usenet. He deletes any truthful information about himself and is supported by ARS gang members and dishonest Wikipedia administrators. Yes, I am a Scientologist and not Scientology threw me out, but one of Tilman's and the other extremists' friend, Birgitta Harrington a non-scientological infiltrator. You need to be "SP declared" in order to be not more considered a Scientologist. But lets say, all of Scientology would be in the hand of Tilman and the secret service he works for, and they would indeed lie that I am no Scientologist anymore: I still would be one per definition of L. Ron Hubbard who stated that a Scientologist is one who applies the technology of Scientology. Tilman, like the others, claims to be an expert on Scientology, and posted approx. 24000 hate articles against it on the net, but he and his friends are absolutely clueless. They are responsible for having written the L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology section, and that one sucks too. It is full of lies and false information. "Fine" encyclopedia is is! Also in this vote section, ARS anti-religious extremists lie and accuse me of what they are doing. I referred often to this website, which is on the net since several years and never was sued by this gang as the data provided is not false. <a href="http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/extremists/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/extremists/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.religiousfreedomwatch.org/extremists/index.html</a> See also how many documents are on that site, but as soon somebody provides a link to the documents on that site, the entry is overwritten. "Fine" neutrality it is. I don't libel anybody, I hate defamation and lies. I never wanted to post on Usenet, but I was defamed even before I posted. One day I had enough and just wanted to keep the records straight. The result: I was even more defamed and had not much other choice then to stay present and correct the lies about me. Most people who post here did not even read what I posted in the talk page. Their postings reveal that they are completely clueless. How can they make an informed decision when they are so biased that they don't even want to know the facts? I don't repeat what I wrote already in the talk page. Wikipedia and the gangs who post here are wasting my time and I will hold not just the individual posters but also Wikipedia legally responsible for webbing an article about me that portrays me wrongfully. Some of the information provided below is Garry Lynn Scarff. He is a forger and death threat maker, and you just have to google his name to find the details on him. He filed false complaints. I never. Google also William Charles Barwell to find what lying bastard he is. The there is the Desertphile poster, who is Dave Rice, who described himself as Prozac filled gay terrorist psycho, took GPS readings of Scientology orgs and called them target data. He suggested in a posting to kill members of the FBI and he and his brother put a plan on the web in which they revealed that they want to "deprogram" Scientologists by applying sexual abuse. His kook bother Frederic is the lunatic who put the "kook award" crap on the page. These are the few intoxicated kooks who voted (several times) to "award" me, but Wikipedia doesn't get it and degrades it's pages by allowing that kind of garbage in an article. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_thread/thread/54ef1b7f6b03bb0f/f36f44c3060f5731?lnk=st&amp;q=Frederic+rice%2Bdeprogramming&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#f36f44c3060f5731" class="external free" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_thread/thread/54ef1b7f6b03bb0f/f36f44c3060f5731?lnk=st&amp;q=Frederic+rice%2Bdeprogramming&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#f36f44c3060f5731" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_thread/thread/54ef1b7f6b03bb0f/f36f44c3060f5731?lnk=st&amp;q=Frederic+rice%2Bdeprogramming&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#f36f44c3060f5731</a> Frederic recently made the text on his plan on his website illegible, because I complained about it. Lily, who goes out of her way to describe me as "unimportant" to the world, is also wrong. E.g., I documented through my FOIA requests and law suits that the U.S. government is infiltrated by non-American forces and conspires against citizens. Wonder what her great accomplishments in saving the world are. I explained that the Tribune article is false. Why do you think reporter Chris Smith did not want to talk to the First Amendment Center reporter about it? Read below. Because he has a bad conscience as his article is full of lies and portrays me and my actions deliberately in a false light. <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=15428" class="external free" title="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=15428" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=15428</a> I posted already about the "credibility" of the Salt Lake Tribune. <a href="http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2003/feat_2003-05-08.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2003/feat_2003-05-08.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2003/feat_2003-05-08.cfm</a> <a href="http://www.slweekly.com//editorial/2004/city_2_2004-10-28.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.slweekly.com//editorial/2004/city_2_2004-10-28.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.slweekly.com//editorial/2004/city_2_2004-10-28.cfm</a> <a href="http://tv.ksl.com/index.php?nid=5&amp;sid=38041" class="external free" title="http://tv.ksl.com/index.php?nid=5&amp;sid=38041" rel="nofollow">http://tv.ksl.com/index.php?nid=5&amp;sid=38041</a> <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3077" class="external free" title="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3077" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3077</a> <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3036" class="external free" title="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3036" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3036</a> The state court judges who kicked my case out are corrupt. They ignored all laws on my side. It is a shame that such people sit on the bench. And do you know below statement of Professor Freedman? He is right, and not just federal judges but also state judges apply no or false legal standards as I can say out of my own bitter experience with both kind of courts. Abuses by courts are known to the nonprofit organization "A Matter of Justice" ("AMOJ") and they try to hold judges accountable for their corrupt actions. AMOJ_M...@yahoogroups.com posted following recently on the Internet: "Hofstra Law Professor Monroe Freedman said this recently to a conference of federal judges: 'Frankly, I have had more than enough of judicial opinions that bear no relationship whatsoever to the cases that have been filed and argued before the judges. I am talking about judicial opinions that falsify the facts of the cases that have been argued, judicial opinions that falsify the facts of cases that have been argued, judicial opinions that make disingenuous use of omission of material authorities, judicial opinion that cover up things with no publication and no citation-rules.' Afterwards, when Professor Freedman sat down, a judge sitting next to him turning to him and said: 'You don't know half of it.' (Suggesting even more serious implication than the alleged statement by Professor Freedman.) I explained what kind of records I requested from the government and had many of them. I don't owe the government any money. They fabricated $303.30 as they did not want to process FOIA requests. Even the Tribune reporter wrote to me that they are lazy and don't want to work. As many of what I write on Wikipedia is constantly deleted by the anti-religious ARS gang, I will mail this article to the Wikipedia Board, the Information Team, Usenet and several websites. I am sick and tired of criminal people lying about that I do what they do.

<li>If I would be no good PR for Scientology, Tilman would not lie that I am no Scientologist anymore. The entire article portrays me in a false light. I am nothing as he, his friends or the Tribune describes. The Tribune is known for unfair reporting. Some of their reporters sold lies about the Elizabeth Smart family to the National Enquirer for $ 20.000. Go to the talk page of my Wikipedia article and click on the links that I provided. Remember Jayson Blair from the New York Times? He fabricated just as Christopher Smith of the Tribune did. Wikipedia should not entertain articles that show people in a false light. Take it off or put one up that is truthfully. And don't use yellow journalism as your guide.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Very notable in the FOIA scene. Also notable in that she is a major player in the Alt.Relgion.Scientology scene, which is clearly a point of interest given that A.R.S. also has its own entry. She is a curious facet of our modern times, and many, many internet denizens know of her and refer to her, which would cause others to seek her out on Wikipedia. There is no good reason to delete this page; unless you are Scientology, or Barbara Schwarz. Databind() 20:04, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> as the article is not fair. Tilman wants her to look like a nut when she indeed is highly intelligent. As more you read of her as more you get that she really is just hated because she is speaking up against opponents of Scientology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Schwarz's detailed delusional fantasies are amazing. But her incredible efforts to prove them via massive abuse of the FOIA with numerous govenment agancies and massive numbers of lawsuits, all argued pro se and all lost, sets her far apart from mere net kooks. That alone would make her newsworthy. She is now actively posting in alt.religion.scientology and brought her hyperactivity with her, and became a willing conduit of Scientology misinformation, libel and harassment. Only the Saltlake, Utah library's cutting of hours allowed on a computer there slowed her down.</li>
</ul>
<p>She shows no signs of slowing down or going away on her own. Only lack of money and large debt to the US government over her FOIA bombings of hundreds of agencies keeps her from continuing her career as the most prolific kook of all time in regards to computerized abuse of the FOIA statutes. This bears watching, as does her penchant for lawsuits, slowed down only because of lack of money.<br />

<li><b>delete</b> Several reasons: She is of no importance for the world. She is not a celebrity. She is mainly defamed in that article and that is what bothers me the most. An article like this, where a common person is just ridiculed, defamed and fingerpointed (I tried to reveal the reasons and some background info on the discussion page, please watch out there) is not a good reputation for the encyclopedia of the Internet community. Barbara Schwarz is a very, very common name in german speaking countries. The google-test is not fullfilled. There are already 2 Barbara Schwarz in my city's phone book! <b>- - -</b> Her belief is very important for her, she identifies with it. She is a dedicated and convinced scientologist, but the article does not allow to add this important information about her. The article seems to be written by scientologists, who feel ashamed of a person posing like her, but want to abuse her to check out the possibilities of further abuse of wikipedia to harass, defame and discredit people. The article is neither neutral nor justifiable and of interest only for people, who find freaks entertaining. But since she for herself finds the article not correct, we all should respect that and forget about religion. Maybe she in fact is mentally insane, I do not know. If so - it is worse, what is done to her. I can not support that, although I understand, that she can be really entertaining. <b>- - -</b> Please, community, let us demonstrate, that we are honestly trying our best to respect individuals, no matter of which belief (I am a critic of scientology and she is a scientologist, I would fight with her about that, but I will fight for her dignitiy as a human being as well) and don't we become part of a world, where people are treated like Barbara Schwarz and nobody protests against that, but watches for entertainment. <b>- - -</b> If the article should be kept, I will fight for the addition of the information, that Barbara Schwarz is most of all famous for being a scientologist. <b>- - -</b> I really am concerned about the activities of scientologists on wikipedia and we all know, how dangerous this cult can become for critics or members, who want to leave it. It is authoritarian, manipulative, working with fear and destructive, and uses non civilised methods to hold their's own or suppress criticism. Don't we support that. Let us show them, that society does not allow or defend or support that behaviour, but protects individuals and that human dignity is untouchable. <b>- - -</b> Each of us could be the next being defamed and mocked on wikipedia. Each and every of us. A kind of justification is easily written or done ("kook award", mention in a newspaper article ...). That is IMO the reason, why this article has been written at all. <b>- - -</b> Let us show them, that we do not tolerate that!

<li><b>Keep</b>. Schwarz often makes false and libelous claims about other persons who disagree with her, which she insists are claims of fact. However, Schwarz cannot cite substantiating evidence to verify her claims.

This entry should be kept on file so that unaware persons are informed as to the nature of the likely credibility of any claims that Schwarz makes as statements of fact.

<li>I don't want to go in that Scientology matter. It is not my religion, but I saw that Tilman posted on alt.religion.scientology and called all people to vote here who defame Ms. Schwarz and who lie that she would libel. She is a kind poster who just hits back when she is defamed. She does not make false statements of facts, but such are done on her, even in this Wikipedia article. I saw that she refers to several websites which webbed legal documents about the people who post on alt.religion.scientology. The majority of people who were called to vote her are expressed enemies of Scientology and of her. You would find such enemies also on us Mormons and they would leave no good hair on us. The people on alt.religion.scientology are abusive and blame her on what they do. To me it seems that just about anybody but Ms. Schwarz is crazy here.

<li><b>SHOVEL THE ARTICLE SOME MORE</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Shovel the article some more. Dave Touretzky wrongfully claimed that I abused the FOIA system. He has no clue what my cases are about because he is so busy attacking and persecuting Scientology, study technology and drug rehabilitation. I requested from federal agencies records pertaining to myself, Marty Rathbun or Mark de Rothschild, L. Ron Hubbard, Church of Scientology or former President Dwight David Eisenhower. I requested searches in specific offices and records systems. Some agencies found records, some mailed me some with redacted information, some wrote they would have none, but rarely any agency provided sufficient information as to what kind of search they conducted or in what time period they searched. They also often misspelled names, which is odd, because when they don't get the names straight, how can they expect me to trust their information? I decided to request under FOIA their search records, the records that they generated during the search to see myself what they did. The Tribune reporter told me that he found that a smart move but he of course did not write that in his crappy article. Here is were the troubles with the feds started. Many agencies mailed me their records, and I saw that rarely anybody conducted adequate searches. I filed administrative appeals, which were not lawfully processed but the appeal authorities rather covered for the lower instances. Then I filed court cases and made the discovery that judges are not impartial but cover up lawless acts of federal workers. The letters that I received from federal employees, the affidavits that they filed are so suspicious, and their activities so un-American that I came to the conclusion that the U.S. government is filled with workers that serve another master than the USA.

If the FOIA officers would have done their jobs on my FOIA requests instead of being lazy or corrupt, someone could have raised the alarm as to what Bin Laden's Al Queda was up to. But an infiltrated and not really American government of course turns everything around and defames ME of all people as "FOIA terrorist". It is outrageous! It is as bad as calling Anne Frank a Nazi! And here some more information on Dave Touretzky who usually blames the wrong target. A guy like he of course webs that crabby Tribune article because he loves yellow journalism. Before he webbed that thing he had an awful dirty article about a former Miss, Kathy Johnson on his website. He also is obsessed with bomb instructions on his sites. He claims that the C of S uses me. Didn't Tilman Hausherr claim that I am no Scientologist? Now I am suddenly one again but this time working for the C of S? I don't work for the C of S, but I am a private Scientologist. The reason why I post on ARS is PERSONAL and not on order or request of the C of S. Below is what Dave Touretzky has on his despicable bomb instruction, porn and religious persecutor webpage about me: "Who is Barbara Schwarz (see article), and why is this former president of the Church of Scientology of Germany obsessed with me? Could it be because Scientology hates my Razor article?" There is no obsession on my part with the rat professor. And what is the crap about the Razor article? I find Touretzky's ways wrong, don't like that I received his harassing porn letter, don't like his bomb instructions, and that he goes after my websites and removes them with illegal methods from the net. He is obsessed with denying free speech to me. I don't harass, libel or defame the "critics" of Scientology. I never wrote intentionally any false information about anybody and nobody in the world can force me to do that. Most of the "critics" are fanatics who lie horrendously about L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology and me. I don't like these kind of abusers, so what I post about them is TRUE, and they don't like it. Dave Touretzky doesn't like that I post so I got a harassing porn letter with his name and address on the porn invoice, and it is the truth. I received that letter with the USPS, it still needs to be tested if Dave's DNA is in it but nothing that I posted about him or anybody else was or is untrue. In other words, that Dave Touretzky or others wrote that I libel or harass is libel and harassment of their parts, not of mine. Signed Barbara Schwarz</p>

<li>Again you are turning around the facts, Mike Gormez. Scientology is of course not clueless about her. She was the general manager of that cult in Germany. And the cult-PR wants to make us believe, that they have no clue about her? The truth is, that scientology <i>pretends</i> to be clueless about her.

<li>Where is that written, Mike Gormez, that Hubbard created a trademark? I mean, where did Hubbard himself state that? Did he once say: "I create a trademark!"? Where, when? If so, then it is not a religion? So the status of being a religion and the name of being a church has to be cancelled very, very quickly, I think.

<li><b>Keep</b> but revise substantially. Schwarz is a well known figure in legal circles due to her massive amount of litigation which is barely touched on in the article. This dates from long before her Usenet presence. She gets tons of Google hits and should expect to be in the public eye since she thrust herself into it. Her current doings on Usenet are of much less interest. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> 00:40, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and hold it right there, Phr. I made some research on her. I found out that she only posts because she was defamed on Usenet BEFORE she ever posted. Filing FOIA requests and legal cases does not mean that she thrust herself into the public eye. I found no website in which Barbara Schwarz tried to get attention. She can't be blamed for other people putting her on the web and the press chasing her. She raised a very good point herself. Is she a public figure per legal definition or does she deserve privacy?

<li>That is why the article clearly states, "Barbara says she is a Scientologist". Ms. Schwarz doesn't attend church services or any other services at the Church of Scientology and she admits she was booted out of the organization.

This is a non-sensical argument anyway. There is absolutely no confusion between myself and Barbara Schwarz. I am not a forger. Barbara is lying about that. The website she is referring to specifically stated that the Barbara Schwarz being discussed was not the same woman that posted on usenet and lived in Salt Lake. It was a completely different person and Barbara has been told this many times. I am not 11 years old. I'm over 30. Barbara and her stalker friend Patrick Michael Sullivan have "outed" me numerous times as various different people and they continue to harass and telephone these people (who they believe to be me) in real life and harass their aged parents. I'm far from retarded, as I am a Kansas Honor Scholar and I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from a major university. This is not the first time that Barbara has libeled me by calling me a criminal. I've asked her numerous times to call my county Sheriff and report my crimes and I gave Ms. Schwarz his phone number to do so. I also provided her with the phone number for the FBI after she claimed my crimes somehow were under federal jurisdiction. Barbara refuses to call the authorities to report the crimes she says I am committing.

<p>&gt; scientology passionately and eloquently.</p>
<p>I don't defend, Lily, I correct falsehoods about L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&gt; She posts sometimes critical</p>
<p>&gt; against the current hierarchy of the church, because she "made the</p>
<p>&gt; personal experience that the Scientology organizations are infiltrated</p>
<p>&gt; by non-Scientologists".[Barbara Schwarz on the discussion (talk-)page</p>
<p>&gt; of her article under "Moved from article"].</p>
<p><br />
&gt;Other posts have recounted</p>
<p><br />
&gt; her travels during the 1980s and how she was in legal trouble on</p>
<p>&gt; various occasions, including for entering the White House, and twice</p>
<p>&gt; confined to a mental health hospital in the U.S. and once in Germany.</p>
<p>&gt; [2] [3] [4] [5] According to Schwarz, these events were the result of a</p>
<p>&gt; conspiracy by a group called the "Still Existing German Nazi</p>
<p>&gt; Psychiatrists Mindcontroller Secret Service" (SEGNPMSS)." [6]</p>
<p><br />
I don't like that there is not in it what these agencies and psychs did to me, e.g. beating me up, breaking my arm twice, taking my money away, and the German crimes, that German District attorney kidnapped me from Copenhagen, made false charges up AFTER I was arrested, that I was beaten up by German police, that I was not allowed to an attorney while the German corrupt government issued one decree after the other against me to which I could not defend myself, that I was never crazy, and when I was, it is the fault of the German government and psychs who treated me as badly as the century Jew. It also needs to me mentioned that I was kidnapped to be deprogrammed later. I posted in the voting section of Wikipedia a long article with those details.</p>
<p>Tilman does not want the crimes of his government and friends in this article as he has to protect them. It is is order as OPC agent.</p>
<p><br />
Barbara Schwarz</p>
<p>&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------</p>
<p>&gt; Yet deletion of the complete article about Barbara Schwarz would still</p>
<p>&gt; be my preferred option. And Tilman please do not interrupt the article.</p>
<p>&gt; If you want to comment please do it in one block at the end. Lily</p>

<p>I have already added "member states" to the title. The EU did not compete at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and this is only such article for an entity which did not compete. The only reason to create this was to support the idea that it should do so, which is a propaganda aim which cannot be made neutral through the phrasing of the article. For non-propaganda purposes this article is of no more relevance than Countries beginning with the letter G at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and much less relevance than Europe at the 2004 Summer Olympics or Africa at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The simple listing of member states is not particularly useful and redundant with (presumably) many other articles. The interpretation required to reach the first bullet point of conclusions is fairly minimal, but relies on assumptions like each athlete still training in the same way, still being funded etc etc. The second bullet is pure speculation. Thus, all the non-repetitive material in the article is original research, and should go per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 22:05, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - For no more reason than I think it's quite interesting. Comparing it to a fictional article entitled Countries beginning with the letter G at the 2004 Summer Olympics is silly, IMO. if the Countries beginning with the letter G had a parliament and were politically related, I could see your point. Particularly if the head of the CBWTLG alliance made comments to do with a united team. I also don't believe the page supports the EU should enter a single team - I don't believe they should. And I, personally, would support a similar page to do with Africa at the Olympics. 2004 Summer Olympics medals count by International Organization states that as a united force the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Union_91e5.html" title="African Union">African Union</a> won 8 medals, and I believe an article about the African nations at the Olympics could expand that information. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 22:48, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
