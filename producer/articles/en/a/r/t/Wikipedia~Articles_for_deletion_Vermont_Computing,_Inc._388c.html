<li><b>Oppose</b>: Given the size of Vermont and the nature of its small towns, there is a lot of respect for organizations that are founded here and manage to do well. It's not usual for a technology company so small out of Vermont to have such a personal impact on the area and its clients. The article can be cleaned up, there is no question about that. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthemys_b22e.html" title="User:Arthemys">Arthemys</a> 22:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Although the AfD process isn't a vote, as such, it'll be helpful if people who want the article to be kept put <b>Keep</b> rather than <b>Oppose</b> in their posts. Avoids ambiguity, and that. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 22:14, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I see nothing at all notable about this company. It appears to be a typical strip-mall store and just doesn't seem notable to me. Also, the original article was written by one of the store managers which strikes me as, at best, self-serving. Vermont companies can do well on a nationwide level. If you don't believe me, ask Ben and Jerry. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 22:42, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to point out that this process appears to me as a matter of opinion now, versus actually going by rules and regulations. (See previous comment regarding "strip-mall") In my current position, I am not a store manager. My reason for creating the article was out of informational purposes, not advertisement. Time and energy for advertising is best spent elsewhere. Why post an advert somewhere where you don't expect revenue to be generated? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthemys_b22e.html" title="User:Arthemys">Arthemys</a> 23:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There are not really that many "rules and regulations" here, as it turns out. The guidelines that are recognized at the moment are listed at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. Can you help us understand how your business meets these guidelines? You may want to also read <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>, which talks about the problems which typically arise when an editor has a conflict of interest in the topic he is covering. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 23:46, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just to clarify, <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthemys_b22e.html" title="User:Arthemys">Arthemys</a>, the author of the article, claimed above that he isn't a store manager. Yet, his user page reads "Vermont Computing, Inc., Randolph, Vermont (July 2004 – Present) Store Manager &amp; Infrastructure Architect". I admit to being confused. As to why try to advertise here. It is already your second google hit. That's never a bad thing. And, as all businesspeople know, free advertising is the best advertising. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 01:41, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know -why- he says he's a manager in his wikipage, but from knowing him and knowing the company (I worked for it a year ago), he is not, and never was a manager.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Instead of attacking them, which I know you're not trying to do, but you're succeeding none the less, how about suggestions in the Discussion page on how to make the page better? If it helps I'll do it myself since I'm not a current employee and haven't been for some time. If you were from the parts of Vermont they service, you'd look at this "discussion" you all are holding with disdain.</dd>
<dd>I realize it needs to not violate the Corporate page, and that it currently is. If I were to go through and make it less... er... violatey (It's a word, I swear), can the AfD be reversed easily since it's not a vote?</dd>
<dd>I think they deserve a page and anything I can do to make sure they have one I'd like to attempt with the communities approval. They aren't quite "mom n' pop" as the next comment down says, far from it. Computer sales and repair are only what they do because they happen to have a retail store front, there's also a large consulting back end.</dd>
<dd>I also have a question. That is: Since you all want things to be cited and what-not, what can we do? I remember there being certificates of incorporation and community appreciation, but those are paper documents. Scanning them would violate the "personal research" clause. What then? Is Wikipedia really so locked-down by their own silly policies that you aren't "good enough" if you don't have web-news coverage to prove it? God forbid the state of Vermont appreciate something without forcing the whole world to know.

<li><b>One Last Comment</b> I think that what it boils down to in my opinion is that local notability does not equal notability on a wikipedia level. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is really the best guideline available. It's nothing personal. It says much good about a company to have two (one current and one former) employee trying to get it placed on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, it also says something about it's notability that you two are the only ones that are voting to keep it here. I wish both of you and the company the best. It may seem that we are being unhelpful. But we, at least I, have no good advice on how to turn a non-notable company into a notable one. It is not so much that the article is written like an advertisement (which it is) as it is that the company just doesn't seem to be notable. Unless there is some evidence of notability that hasn't been presented yet, my vote would still stand.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaner1_0920.html" title="User:Beaner1">Beaner1</a> 04:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
