<p>Certainly a valid topic, but shouldn't we wait until this is settled? Wikipedia is not a news source. Many things can happen to prevent her from actually becoming the Duchess of Cornwall.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article has no value at all. There's no point in having an article on various Duchesses of Cornwall, they were already Princesses of Wales! The history of the title should be on a page called "Duke of Cornwall", not this one! The info in this article should be, and is, in the article on Prince Charles, so deleting this article will not eliminate info. And on 8 April, this can redirect to what should then be the newly moved article "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall", <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 13:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not an independent title; and its history is already in <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>. The factoid in the article is already in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camilla_Parker_Bowles_fbd3.html" title="Camilla Parker Bowles">Camilla Parker Bowles</a>, where it belongs. When they marry, we can all argue about the appropriate title for the article about her.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Historically valid article, although it needs to be expanded to discuss the history of the title. (And I don't consider Duke of Cornwall and Duchess of Cornwall to be the same thing, any moreso than Prince of Wales and Princess of Wales, and both title has its historical figures). I think this article should also explain why Camilla is receiving this title instead of Princess of Wales. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:41, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Because allowing her to become Queen would, righly or wrongly, damage the monarchy as it would be unacceptable to many people in Britain.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I said above, this is not an independent title. The Duke of Cornwall is always the eldest son of the British monarch; it is not a hereditary title. Duchess of Cornwall is a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtesy_title.html" title="Courtesy title">courtesy title</a> only ever given to the wife of the Duke of Cornwall. The eldest daughter of the sovereign and heir to the throne is not the Duchess of Cornwall. There is already discussion of the complications related to Camilla Bowles title if she marries Prince Charles -- in both the articles on her and on the prince. There is no need for an article on a courtesy title. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:18, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

The history of the title is already covered in <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Category%7EDukedoms_d1ef.html" title="Category:Dukedoms">Category:Dukedoms</a> shows that the format Wikipedia has adopted is to have articles about Dukedoms in the masculine form, covering both the Dukes and the Duchesses. Are there other articles like this one? Why should this standard be broken now? And many things can happen until the date of the wedding, she is not Duchess now. I am sorry, but I am completely lost on this one, and I would like to understand better the arguments of people who are voting "keep". <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 21:35, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is for the general public, not academics who are already away of all the semantic finesses. Relevant information should be made available in the most convenient possible way providing that the article does not break any policies. The background to the new use of this title is more accessible in a specific article than in an article which also covers many other issues. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 15:11, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your reply. I don't understand what you mean when you said "semantic finesses". Do you mean to say that Wikipedia users might not be aware that "Duchess" is the feminine of "Duke"? I find it hard to believe, but if that is so, how about a redirect to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>? The story of the title is already there. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">Prince</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress.html" title="Empress">Empress</a> redirects to <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">Emperor</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchess.html" title="Duchess">Duchess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">Duke</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countess.html" title="Countess">Countess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a> etc. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Category%7EDukedoms_d1ef.html" title="Category:Dukedoms">Category:Dukedoms</a> shows that this has been the standard, and I believe this is more pratical than having a fork for every feminine form of the title. This would be like having an article for <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a> and another for <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actress.html" title="Actress">actress</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 23:24, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your comment is even more apropos given the special characteristics of the title Duke of Cornwall. There is never a Duchess of Cornwall in her own right. Duchess of Cornwall is a <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_%28manner_of_address%29.html" title="Style (manner of address)">style</a>, a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtesy_title.html" title="Courtesy title">courtesy title</a>, not an actual title. Indeed, until the Camilla Bowles situation developed it has generally been a secondary courtesy title, since the wife of the heir to the throne is entitled to use the style Princess of Wales, which is a higher title. We have several articles already explaining British peerage and titles, courtesy titles, styles, etc. We also have a couple of articles which include the same material as in this article covering the Camilla Parker Bowles situation. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:20, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>BM, I guess I missed something in this discussion. People just come here and vote based on an argument which I contested on the first few minutes of the VfD vote: that the history of the title is already covered in <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>. It seems people are giving their opinion without even bothering to read what others have to say on this topic. Am I being ignored for violating some Wikipedia policy or guideline?

As the actual Dukedom of Cornwall can not be held by a woman in her own right (or any man who is not the heir to the British throne for that matter) it would seem very inconsistent to keep this as a seperate article from the Duke of Cornwall article. I would support keeping it as an article on "Regan, Duchess of Cornwall" or as a disambiguation page with links to "Camilla Parker-Bowles", Duke of Cornwall" and "Regan, Duchess of Cornwall" but as a stand alone article about Mrs. Parker-Bowles it doesn't make much sense.

<p><b>STRONG keep</b>There is a seperate article for 'Princess of Wales' which is no more than a courtesy title of the wife of the Prince of Wales (which by the way, Camilla will be, whether she is styled so or not). If you delete this article I STRONGLY SUGGEST you delete the article on the courtesy title 'Princess of Wales' as there is already a 'Prince of Wales' article.--<a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">jcuk</a></p>

<p>"Keep". It should, however, be expanded. The style of "Duchess of Cornwall" has had usage in the 20th century. After the accession of Edward VII to the throne on the death of Queen Victoria, his son, Prince George, the Duke of York, was not immediately created Prince of Wales. There is some thought that Queen Alexandra was a driving force behind it because she did not want someone else known as the Princess of Wales given her long connection with the title. Prince George and Princess May were, therefore, known as TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York until he was created Prince of Wales late in 1901. User:GaryR 12:07, 14 Feb 2005 (EST)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, given that, from April, a senior member of the royal family will hold this as their main title in use, it is appropiate for it to be an article. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 21:43, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It just occured to me that naming an article 'Duke of wherever' is invalid anyhow, unless that title has been held by just one person. If all the 'Duke of...' articles were renamed 'Duchy of....' you could have a history of the Duchy (which most of the 'Duke of' articles seem to be anyhow) plus internal links to individual Dukes AND Duchesses of wherever.</li>
