<li><b>Comment</b>- That search is not entirely valid, because it doesn't count hits that spell the title differently, like "Space: Glory Through Conquest." A more flexible search turns up <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Space+%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Space+%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">over 9,000</a> hits. That may still be an undercount, because the article says the game is "commonly referred to simply as <i>Space</i>." Another search (which probably is an overcount) which tries to capture references to the company and the game <i>without</i> the "Conquest Through Glory" phrase, gets <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=space+%22coldfire+studios%22+OR+coldfirestudios+-%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=space+%22coldfire+studios%22+OR+coldfirestudios+-%22Glory+Through+Conquest%22" rel="nofollow">55,000</a> hits. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 22:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak oppose</b> - OK, that search with 55,000 hits was apparently mostly coming from Coldfire's own site; taking them out leaves less than 1,400 hits. On the other hand, taking the site out of the search that got 9,000 hits actually increases the count to 12,000! Obviously, Google's way of counting has some quirks. Nevertheless, I'm going to oppose. The article has been around over two years before someone questioned its notability. "Major" events or fads that were "all the rage" can suddently become obscure, so I'm reluctant to take current judgment over that of editors at the time. (Just recently, I had to de-PROD <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fucked_Company_d598.html" title="Fucked Company">Fucked Company</a>, which then got put up for AfD!) Alexa rankings are a moving target, sites that once had a day of "glory" can fall, making it appear as if they were never notable. This makes me hesitate before throwing out all the work that has been done on the article. At the very least, I'd like to see some of the content <b>merged</b> with the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldfire_Studios_22ea.html" title="Coldfire Studios">Coldfire Studios</a> article if it's deleted. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:10, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Worthwhile article</b>- This is my first comment, dunno if I'm supposed to do it this way, but whatever. Space was at one time a very popular online game with thousands of unique players. While it has since lost some players, it still has a dedicated core of 2 or 3 hundred players, along with a steady flow of new players. I don't see how this article is hurting anyone by remaining on here. The article was only meant as a way for people unfamiliar with the game be able to find some quick knowledge about the game before they dive in--User:Splat! - dedicated Space player for 5+ years 02:33, 11 August 2006 (Entered by User:72.230.7.122)</li>
<li><b>STRONG OPPOSE:</b> If Wikipedia is not a game directory, then I guess the multiple categories of games should be marked for deletion, as well. There are 50+ games listed in the category "Massively Multi-Player Online Games," and that is only one category. Additionally, this COMMUNITY of people is close. The Space: Glory Through Conquest folks have surpassed the national, ethnic, and religious boundaries to form a wonderful subculture. The "Game" is a living socio-cultural artifact, and has brought people from all over the world closer in bonds of friendship (and sometimes enmity, but it is a parody of war, afterall), and thus remains an important facet of hundreds of people's daily lives. Those who are members of this special Community find it disheartening at times to be separated from it. The players are passionate about the game, each other, and their community. Newcomers are welcomed heartily, and friendly people are willing to help them transition easily into the Space culture. -User:Mistress of Mayhem, Game Admninistrator and Community member/player for almost 4 years. 06:30, 11 August 2006 (UTC) (entered by 71.193.227.97 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.193.227.97_8db5.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.193.227.97">contribs</a>))</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article claims it to have won two awards, which is one of the conditions for passing WP:SOFTWARE. I would advise players, however, to review the notability guidelines, as simply being a great game, while great, doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia. In this case, I think it does pass the line though, if the article is cleaned to conform to article guidelines (namely being an article rather than a guide)-<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 06:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Why delete a valid article?</b>- Especially when so many other games are listed here as well. Space is a great social experiment as well as an online game and deserves credit for that as much as anything else. We are not a gun catalogue and yet I see countless articles detailing the finer points of many weapons. We are not an aviation handbook and yet I see many articles on aviation. We are not a tv guide and yet I see many articles on tv shows some even with future air dates. What we are is an online encyclopedia listing many, many interesting articles and to a gamer an article about a game can be very interesting. Or does Akradecki have an issue with gamers reading articles about things they are interested in? I bet he has no problem with articles that he is interested in being posted on here. The simple fact is, if you have no interest in the article you do not have to read it. Leave that to those of us who are interested, and leave the article here for those of us who are interested in it. Why alienate the gaming community by removing our articles? Is what we have to say not as valid as what you have to say? --User:Gypsy2976 Space player for 5 years and gamer for many more. 06:44, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Awards are mentioned on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> though, wich seem more relevant (it is played entierly over the web after all, not distributed as a software package). Though I guess that depends on on wether or not you consider a "game of the month" award from Multiplayer Online Games Directory to be a "well known independent award" or not. Note that while the game is currently "past it's prime" it was fairly big 3-4 years ago (as far as browser based games go), here is a snapshot of the forums back in 2001<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802064924/forums.darkent.com/space/phpforums/" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802064924/forums.darkent.com/space/phpforums/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> snowing a great deal of activity even then, note that the forums have been wiped clean 4-5 times so you need to use the web archive to find most of it now. Just saying that with huge commercial graphical MMPOG's taking over these days, current trafic rating should be taken with a grain of salt when judging the notability of a browser based game that's been around for a good 5 years. IMHO anyway, though my bias should be obvious from a look at the article's history (in hindsight I do agree that is is probably wirtten a bit too much like a game guide though), my recomendation would be to <b>keep</b> it. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 11:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
