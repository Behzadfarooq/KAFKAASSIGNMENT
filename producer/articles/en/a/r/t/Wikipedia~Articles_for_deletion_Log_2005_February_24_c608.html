<li><b>Hilarious</b> -- what I've read of it, at least. Alas, it should be <b>deleted</b> or <b>merged</b>. It occurred to me that, as a diversion, perhaps there could be a <b>separate feature/article on Wiki</b> in the <b>six degrees of separation</b> mode, where members could <b>randomly post Wiki links for two seemingly utterly unrelated articles and invite other members to establish a connection between the two</b> within a set number of Wiki links, utilizing info contained in the articles (or not) -- a good way to impel some of us who may find ourselves stuck in content ruts around the site; an interesting/different way to be stimulated intellectually to see new connections; have a little fun; learn a lot; maybe occasion the beefing up of old articles; and, perhaps, spark interest in creating completely new articles on related subject matter. Yeah, yeah. I know this isn't the subject at hand, but I didn't know where else to offer this up.

There is no point in a mobile lab for "weed renegades", unless you really want to hang harvested plants upside-down in a trailer for a week and risk the odor drawing law-enforcement attention.

<p>Very shortly after I created the page, people objected to it on the talk page, saying that such a list will always be incomplete, and could be the size of a phonebook. There are enormous lists of technical words in all kinds of fields that are derived from greek roots. I defended the page's right to exist by saying that if <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Latin_origin_e236.html" title="List of English words of Latin origin">List of English words of Latin origin</a> is worth keeping, then this one is too. If that one should be deleted, I would even support that argument, but then this one must be deleted as well. Well, today the list of Latin words was deleted with some very convincing arguments and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_English_words_of_Latin_origin_3191.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of English words of Latin origin"><b>almost unanimous support</b></a>, and so I think this one has to go too.

<li><b>Retain</b> -Rex Gentium All that hard work for the enlightenment of my fellow human beings for nothing? The percentage of Greek-origin words in English being less than that of Latin, the list as it stands is relatively small. In my opinion, this list covers the main, known words that are derived from Greek and henceforth will only grow minutely. In my own contributions to this article, I purposely avoided the countless neologisms and "coined" Greek words that can overexpand and bloat an article, adding instead established or even everyday words whose origin in Greek is unexpected. To do away with this article would be a foolish act that would rob many of an expansion of their knowledge.
<ul>
<li>Hard work indeed. The list includes many contributions. But it is nothing more than an alphabetical listing of words by etymology, one which would be tens of thousands of words long, if complete. We simply have no space for such things. It would be better represented by a automagically generated list in Wiktionary, which should include a category by etymology. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 11:55, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If this is a list of 'main' Greek words as Rex says (or as the list states, 'some' words), then what is the criterium for a Greek word to be on that list? That sounds rather arbitrary. Words of Greek origin make up some 15% of the English language, so a full list would be too large. An arbitrarily smaller list is not particularly encyclopedic. As such, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:13, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Rename it Greek loans in the English language and expand the introduction to the list (which is already an article in its own right), but limit the actual list to a few significant examples of each type of loan. The general topic is appropriate for an article irrespective of whether it is realistic or proper to have an entire list of such words. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:54, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not ludicrous. The similar article List of English Words of Latin origin was deleted last week after consensual vote on the VfD list. It is reasonable to suggest that the same reasoning would apply to this list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:40, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You might try Wiktionary, which was designed to be a collection of words, their definitions, etymologies, and lists thereof. Wikipedia was designed to have encyclopedic articles, which this simply is not. It is a list of words whose only notoriety is etymology. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 11:45, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Amnesiate,</b> for the good reasons given for "List of English words of Latin origin." Adding technical features to Wiktionary to enable database searches for words with specified etymologies would be a valuable thing to do. Hand-maintaining incomplete lists of words constituting a sixth of the English language is not. I'm not sure whether we have an article on <i>medical</i> Greek and Latin <i>roots</i>--building blocks used for construction of medical terminology. There are textbooks on such things, and there are only a few hundreds of such roots that are commonly used. <i>That</i> would be a reasonable article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:51, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Retain but prune drastically</b> A complete list of English words with Greek roots is ridiculous -- such functionality should be one way you can slice-and-dice a dictionary. It is especially ridiculous that neologisms such as "photography" and "sphygmomanometer" appear in this list -- words which never existed in Greek -- until they were borrowed back into Modern Greek. It is the neologisms (mostly medical and scientific coinages) that give us silly numbers like 25% (or whatever) of English. On the other hand, words like "olive", "bishop", and "scene" are not obviously Greek and have an interesting history, which should be discussed. The straight borrowings like "orchestra" and "drama" are perhaps less interesting. The discussion of spelling and plurals is also useful. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:34, 24 Feb 05 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even without the neologisms. Anything truly notable as being a loan word, per Macrakis' comment above, might be noted in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Ελληνικά</a> article. Also, there seems to be enough flexibility in Wiktionary to allow such categories to be created, and this topic would certainly be far more appropriate therein. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a><sup><a href="../../../h/y/p/User_talk%7EHyperzonk_d4a7.html" title="User talk:Hyperzonk">talk</a></sup> 17:35, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Agreed about renaming</b> I agree that the name "List" is inappropriate. I suppose the information about coinages, about spelling, etc. could go in the Greek Language article. What's more, most of it is not specific to English, since all the other European languages have pretty much the same stock of Greek-based neologisms and even mostly the same stock of Greek borrowings (everything from olive to moussaka appears in all the major European languages). But does it belong in the Greek language article itself?--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:37, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

To my knowledge, this is one of the only lists out on the net of words from Greek origin, and it needs to be somewhere, if not here. If Wiktionary can make a compiled list like this, then cool. But if not, I think it should stay. I personally think it's a shame we lost the Latin one... there are 34 others under the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_etymologies.html" title="Lists of etymologies">Lists of etymologies</a> too... I do not believe they should just simply disappear. Obviously, with such a compilation, they have relevency. This list itself has proved quite helpful to me personally, and not because it was just "interesting to know" or anything. If they must disappear from Wikipedia... then maybe Wiktionary (or whatever is appropriate) can carry this list, if that is possible? - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 08:45, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Modified article</b>. I've cleaned this article up, entirely removing the list of words (which you probably saw the tail end of, going by the date on your comment). The article has now had that drastic pruning.</li>
<li>I think that, with one exception, we all agree that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Any article that is a list of words is unencyclopaedic. (By which I <i>don't</i> mean non-notable.) Any article with "list of words" <i>in its title</i>, moreover, is going to be a dicdef-magnet. And indeed this, and all of the other List of English words of X origin articles listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_English_words_of_international_origin_4134.html" title="Lists of English words of international origin">Lists of English words of international origin</a>, <i>have become</i> nothing more than dicdef-magnets, as their editing histories over the past few months show only too plainly. I've applied the same procedure that I applied to this article to some of those other articles. Look how short they have become! Look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Scots_origin_ee5e.html" title="List of English words of Scots origin">List of English words of Scots origin</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Polish_origin_f81c.html" title="List of English words of Polish origin">List of English words of Polish origin</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Hindi_origin_c77c.html" title="List of English words of Hindi origin">List of English words of Hindi origin</a>, for examples. Without the mini-dictionaries, <i>there was practically nothing left in the articles</i>. (However, I think that there <i>is</i> something that could be written about <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_of_Scots_origin_e9ce.html" title="Words of Scots origin">words of Scots origin</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_of_Polish_origin_1b52.html" title="Words of Polish origin">words of Polish origin</a>, and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Words_of_Hindi_origin_439f.html" title="Words of Hindi origin">words of Hindi origin</a> — decribing how words from these languages came to be loaned into other languages, what classes of words are loaned, the distinctive features that give away such words, and the like — and that these articles are the beginnings of such.)</li>
<li>I think that the best way forward is to
<ol>
<li><b>Rename</b> this article to Words of Greek origin and realign the article to be about, as per <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanwords</a> from Greek into <i>all</i> languages.</li>
<li>Apply the same to all of the other List of English words of X origin articles.</li>
<li>Lose <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_English_words_of_international_origin_4134.html" title="Lists of English words of international origin">Lists of English words of international origin</a> entirely, for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>The tree is simply rooted in the wrong place. This whole article series is predicated on the idea of words <i>being loaned to</i> English. In other words, it is seen as a sub-topic of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>. But as <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> points out, many of these loanwords are loaned to multiple languages. The far better way to look at this series is as being about the languages that the words were loaned <i>from</i>. This article and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Turkish_origin_ed82.html" title="List of English words of Turkish origin">List of English words of Turkish origin</a> are prime examples of articles just begging for the Anglo-centrism to be removed.</li>
<li>It's a list of lists. Even without the above consideration, there's no need for a list of lists. There's almost never a need for a list of lists. An article like that should be a <i>category</i> of lists.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I also recommend a long hard look at:
<ul>
<li>Nahuatl dictionary, a Nahuatl-English translation <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">dictionary</a> sitting quietly in Wikipedia</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dacian_words_5fcf.html" title="List of Dacian words">List of Dacian words</a>, a Romanian-English translation <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">dictionary</a> sitting quietly in Wikipedia (entirely duplicating <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Dacian_derivations" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Category:Dacian_derivations">Wiktionary:Category:Dacian derivations</a>, where the effort <i>should</i> be directed)
<ul>
<li>Actually, this is <i>not</i> a Romanian-English dictionary, but rather a list of words (with English glosses) from an ancient language named <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dacian_language.html" title="Dacian language">Dacian</a>, a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substratum.html" title="Substratum">substrate language</a> of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_language.html" title="Romanian language">Romanian</a>. That said, it <i>still</i> doesn't belong in the Wikipedia, but rather in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Dacian_derivations" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Category:Dacian_derivations">Wiktionary:Category:Dacian derivations</a>.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 12:32, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, looking at the article and finding the vast bulk of it being a long list of entries like:
<ul>
<li><i>baban</i> - "big, plump"</li>
<li><i>baci</i> - "shepherd"</li>
<li><i>bagă</i> - "to put in, to stick in"</li>
<li><i>băiat</i> - "boy"</li>
<li><i>beregată</i> - "throat"</li>
<li><i>brânză</i> - "cheese"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have to say that whatever it may really be, it's doing a fair old job of disguising itself as a Romanian-English translation <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">dictionary</a> (with a one-paragraph preface). ☺ It even has its talk page divided into sections for the individual words.</li>

<p>PLEASE READ FIRST:</p>
<p>Wikipaedia decision maker. Jason Frost was a Sunshine Bandmember withMajor label, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, as well as an important part of rock n roll history in Olympia-Seattle area, who continues to create music for his devoted fans like myself. You can check here, as well as the many, many, links thoughout this page on his newspaper articles, press, artist pages, and movie film database on major film, etc. He is notable. Android79 has done nothing but angered me and played games and muddied up this page.</p>
<p>A search for "jason frost kc &amp; sunshine band" turned up folowwing results: MTV listings: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml</a></p>
<p>(The star next to his name means he is notable to MTV!!!)</p>
<p>Wikipaedia requires for a band or artist personality to be listed he must have been a member of a notable band, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, had hits like "get down tonight" and others. His being a memebr of this band makes him notable, even though I find this the least notable of his accomplishments. I vote to KEEP! - Timk</p>
<p>He did not fill in, he was member of band, that was my mistake from earlier post when I said filled in. He was touring performer.</p>
<p>(again apologize for the muddled up page which follows, in between are some good links for verification)</p>
<p>GO AHEAD AND KEEP DELETING ON YOUR DELETENG SPREE ANDROID79, WIKIPAEDIA AUTHORS WILL SOON FIND THAT YOU ARE JUST DELETING ON RANDOM SPREE WITH NO BASIS - SEE ANDROIDS PROFILE, they have contributed nothing to wikipaedia except to go around voting to delete stuff, many have contributed over years in building and writing!</p>

<p>VOTE TO DISREGARD: See below, even after providing facts, Android79 will not back down or change mind, obviously personal, also read androids profile, makes a habit of actively seeking bands and artsist to delete. Sounds fishy to me. Like they are just looking and itching to delete the hard work many of have contributed over many years on an artist or band they find notable. I don't think I will be using wikipaedia anymore because of stuff like this. I actually came on here 2nite and was going to add some newer updates and stuff to one of my favorite artists pages- but I change my mind after this. Not worth the ffort when people can just delete on a whim everyones efforts and contributions. <i>(Note: This unsigned comment is by User:Tim k, who inserted it between <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">User:Megan1967</a>'s vote and her signature)</i> <small><i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">User:Android79</a> pasted name here; trying to lay cliam that I was changing people vites, which was not true.

<p>Also he began and started out renting warehouse space formerly rented by nirvana and was roomates and shared practice space and lived with John Wozniak of Marcy Playground in heart of the grunge scene in Washington state, also was promoter in NW Washington innovating new type shows like phunky phat 95, and has gone on to do national charity tours such as ROCK FOR CHRISTMAS rock4xmas.com which brings gifts and money to homeless and those less fortunate each year.</p>

<p>Also he began and started out practicing with John Wozniak of Marcy Playground (jamming in same warehouse space formerly as Nirvana with his band Blue Moon splitting the unit with Marcy Playground to jam---they also shared a giutarist). He was also promoter in NW innovating new type shows like phunky phat 95 bringing hip hop and alternative music together and he has gone on to do national charity tours such as rock4xmas.com working with some pretty notable celebrities like members from Anthrax, WASP, Great White, Quiet Riot, Badfinger, Blue Oyster Cult and others. They bring gifts and money to homeless and those less fortunate each year.</p>

<p>I have provided more notable info and links than you could provide discredits---as I said and YOU deleted and VANDALIZED MY post. I said being on major film credits with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks and a member of KC &amp; SUNSHINE BAND, also in film, is pretty frickin notable if you ask me...also every other thing and link abotu this artist is notable. I have followed this artist for years. I coudl go on and on... but why try...its obvious that wikipaedia is no longer aplace to find juicy tidbits and obscure info...its becoming ruined by people likeyou deleteing information that took others years to compile and post here on what they obviously found to be notable. - Tim k</p>

<li>Please, read the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>. They're not hard and fast rules, but Frost comes nowhere near meeting any of them. I doubt whether a role as what basically amounts to an extra in a single movie really counts for much, either. Also, if I deleted all or part of your posts, it was inadvertent, as we were editing this page concurrently. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 05:16, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your original argument has been refuted</p>
<p>Non-notable,</p>
<p>I have given links to websites, press, newspapers, charity sites with bands and concerts he has worked to promote. Also if not being a part of the initial grunge movement and playing and hanging with all those bands in the early grunge days in independantg rock scene is not notable or interesting WTF? Also I provided major film and verifiable proof that he went on to be part of KC &amp; SUNSHINE band- wikipaedia rules says if you are memebr of major band through major label even for short time than you satisfy listign requirement. I personally find this as his least notable accomplishment, but that alone suffices and satisfies wikipaedia placement.</p>
<p><br />
vanity,</p>
<p>I am sure if you check the articles on frost and his bands, and otehr stuff probably had multiple authors as I have witness the articles here on him change over the years -- he has had listign long time. Are you smoking peyote?</p>

<p>I am the user that deleted Vfd tags. I apologize, I am new here. There was some confusion about Vfd tags being deleted after 5 days. I thought anyone could delete after 5 days, although discussion still continues in here on vfd pages. It is recommended vfd deletion rule pages add specifically who is authorized to do this as it was unclear -- hence the accidental deletion. It was only done out of respect for the artists concerned. Please research and confirm updates on Artists profile. All information can be verified either through Publisher or ASCAP. <small><i>This unsigned comment is from User:66.32.171.2.</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:57, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Well, given that the VfD notice itself says "don't delete me," and that the VfD policy page is pretty clear on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#When_the_Lag_Time_runs_out" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">what happens after the 5 days are up</a>, I really don't understand the confusion. Feel free to leave a comment over at the policy page, though. Anyway... Google for "Statue Records" and one of the first hits is whether or not the label is a scam. Indeed, the Love Junkies appear to have released a record on this label of undetermined notability and reputation, but even so, the subject still does not meet the letter or the spirit of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:51, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> needs some expansion, but she's very notable. A boadcast pioneer in her region. There's a documentary about her (<i>The Legend of Cousin Tuny</i>), appeared on a 1967 telethon with Leonard Nimoy, host of many large telethons for 5 different decades now, subject of a recent published book (<i>Cuz</i>), very well known (regionally, not locally!) where her name is almost a household word. Perhaps not an international superstar, but a notable figure with a decades-long career is certainly above the bar. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:19, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I nominated <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitsville_U.K._94b4.html" title="Hitsville U.K.">Hitsville U.K.</a> a while ago, and it seems it's getting deleted. This article is basically the same, the only different being that in terms of noteworthy songs, The Magnificant Seven starts to approach the level of notability that songs must have to warrant inclusion, while the other did not. I've basically decided that for me this is a bit on the wrong side of the line, and in its current form its nothing anyway. I suppose I'd vote to keep if someone wrote a good article here, bit I'm not even convinced that's possible. Joe Strummer was one of the most incoherent people, both in speaking and writing, and trying to say something substantial about this song would involve much speculation, and would still likely say little. There are many Clash songs that deserve articles rather than this one. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:35, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this page. Wikipedia <i>is</i> an almanac. It won't "date" any more than any other article which requires updating because I will be updating it, and others can easily do so. It is a totally different thing from the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_World_Golf_Rankings_e64b.html" title="Official World Golf Rankings">Official World Golf Rankings</a>. It is <i>not</i> arbitary to select different numbers of events for differnt lists because the are more tour events than <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majors.html" title="Majors">majors</a> and a player can play more events in a career than in a season. The numbers are in each case designed to show which are the really distinguished players. All of the criteria of inclusion of tourmaments are official and all of this information can be confirmed from the official sites of the leading golf tours. There is no subjectivity involved whatsoever. This information is fundamental for the comparison of the career achievements of professional golfers and cannot be better represented in any other form. I consider these lists to be absolutely fundamental to Wikipedia's coverage of professional golf. They list the most widely used objective criteria for assessing golfers' achievements, and provide a context for the claims made about golfer's level of distinction in their individual articles, which are often difficult to assess unless you have a very good knowledge of the sport. The World Rankings (I wrote that article too by the way) shift every week and are actually more subjective and controversial. They also only go back to 1986, so they are completely useless for assessing most of the greats of the game.</li>
<li>I suspect that <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>'s involvement here is intended as revenge for my exposure of him as a practioner of "extreme deletion" a so-called "sport" in which points are awarded for getting legitimate articles deleted - see the link on his user page unless he has removed it now to protect his credibility.

<li>An ad hominem doesn't substantiate anything. You didn't bother to check what I've been doing the past weeks, which is categorizing <i>every</i> article on Dead End Pages. You didn't bother to check your private mailbox here, where I explained that. You didn't bother to double-check my user page before accusing me of changing it, since I didn't change it. And you didn't bother to check the obvious markings on both the Extreme Deletion page and my user page indicating that neither is in any way serious. You should read up on Civility, Wikiquette and Good Faith before making wild allegations like these. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 19:06, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I knew what you were doing and I don't think it is a good use of time. You have noted yourself that the votes for deletion page is overburdened. I don't think your approach is beneficial. The dead end pages system is obselete imo because it ignores the category system. I did read your message. I don't accept that a disclaimer makes the ridiculous joke you signed up for legitimate.

<li>No, you didn't understand what I wrote. The Dead End Pages is <i>very</i> relevant, since most of them are valid pages that aren't categorized yet. Hence, I categorize them, and that is a useful activity. The VfD system is more burdened than it used to, and that is unfortunate, but it isn't <i>over</i>burdened as of yet, and anyway that is no reason to stop cleanup.

<li>Firstly, I registered on Feb. 15th, not the 21st. I admit that still makes me relatively new, but I have been studying the vdf pages <i>and</i> the deletion policy. The fact that there are people agreeing with me means I can't be wholly off-base. Secondly, as far as the article goes, I'm not saying this information is not useful, just that it would probably fit better in some other form. We could probably make an infinite number of lists about what golfers won which tournaments. Who chooses the criteria for the lists? I think this info would be better represented either a) appended to the relevant golfer's articles or b) by having one article devoted to all such lists. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 20:55, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The information can and should be mentioned in the relevant articles, but that only performs part of the function. It does not provide any context to assess the significace of the players win taly against that of other players. Having the information the site makes it easier to add these details to individual articles. I have already started to add the appropriate links. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 22:56, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why can't it perform the rest of the function, as you say? Why can't we provide context in the relevent articles? Can we not say "John Doe has won 26 PGA tournaments, the 6th largest number of wins for one person" in his article? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 00:03, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course there should be statements like that, but not instead of the table. It is more cumbersome to keep up to date. Are you offering to do it for every player for the next forty years or so like I am planning to update the table? It wouldn't show relative numbers or the names of the comparable players for comparison unless there was a whole paragraph in each case - is the table in a less digestible form. And the only way to keep such statements up to date, is to keep the table up to date, which clearly demonstrates how useful it is. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 08:16, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why have one article? This information relates to different tours, each of which have there own section. I will be adding the articles to each section, if I have not already done so in all cases.

<li>Are you able to give any reasons for your opinion? What basis can it have apart from a conviction that Wikipedia should not cover golf? But Wikpedia does cover sport in detail - tens of thousands of articles probably. If one is interested in professional golf these articles are among the most useful in Wikipedia - far more useful than most of the individual profiles. It should be noted that the voting has been appended to the least important article, but the result is supposed to apply to all of them. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 17:45, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, you yourself tend not to give any reasons for your votes other than personal attacks. Anyway, yes, Wikipedia should cover golf, but it's not particularly useful to make four separate lists of people who have won an arbitrary number of tournaments. Particularly since there's an official ranking already on the site. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 19:06, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

They did not exist until 1986. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicklaus_bf8c.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a> is nobody in the eyes of the rankings. Full historical records of old rankings are not even included on the official site. The oldest year end table is for 2001. Tournament wins are OVERWHELMINGLY the criteria on which golfers' careers are judged by posperity. There is not the slightest intention on the part of the operators of the official rankings that they should replace the role of tournament wins. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 23:12, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. These articles seem to have somewhat arbitrary levels set — why not, say, 17 wins? (Yes, I am aware that base-10 counting is quite common.) As <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> notes above, there is an officially established ranking system. If the consensus is that there should also be a list by number of Champions Tour wins, then there should simply be a list of <i>all</i> winners, not only winners that have cleared some <i>arbitrary</i> bar, in my opinion. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a><sup><a href="../../../h/y/p/User_talk%7EHyperzonk_d4a7.html" title="User talk:Hyperzonk">talk</a></sup> 18:05, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>If you want to extend the lists down to one win you are welcome to do so. I do not have infinite time.

There is still a separate place for records in a reference work. In any sporting reference book, you are likely to find a mixture of text based and tabular content. Why should Wikipedia be different?

<li>Megan is a hyper-deletionist of sports articles despite demonstrating no knowledge of sport. Like Giano, her deletion vote may be motivated by past conflicts with me (in his case there is little doubt of this, ever since I corrected some clear factual errors of his, which led him to engage in personal abuse, he had been tracking my user page, looking for opportunities to attack me). No one would be voting to delete this information if it was in the main articles for the tours, but it is much more useful in this context because links can be provided from the indiviual articles directly to the relevant information. Links to the main articles, such as <a href="../../../p/g/a/PGA_Tour_c4c8.html" title="PGA Tour">PGA Tour</a> would be much less clear, especially as I continue to expand those articles. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 08:16, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would prefer if it was <b>rename</b>d as "Golfers with most Champions Tour wins" and started at 5, 10 or 20. However I think that the other lists such as <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_PGA_Tour_wins_in_a_year_6b0c.html" title="Most PGA Tour wins in a year">Most PGA Tour wins in a year</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_golfers_with_most_major_title_wins.html" title="List of golfers with most major title wins">List of golfers with most major title wins</a> are worth <b>keep</b>ing as it is useful information. Perhaps it might be best to standardise the start at 5 though, then as the list grows longer and those with only 5 become less notable then move start to 10 then 20 etc. However, if it's all or nothing I'd prefer to keep all of them. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 11:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Realised I should probably say why I think they should be kept. <b>Firstly</b>, IMO these list are not the same as the official rankings. Rankings look at a certain point in time whereas these lists allow comparisions between golfers who were playing at different time. <b>Secondly</b>, they certainly aren't meaningless, they might be meaningless to certain people in the same way that an article about the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians_60f9.html" title="International Congress of Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a> is meaningless to me but I recognise that for those with interest in the subject they do have meaning. <b>Thirdly</b>, on the idea of them being arbitrary, Wincoote has answered the questions about put to him about the cut-offs being arbitrary (except for the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golfers_with_20_Champions_Tour_wins_32e3.html" title="Golfers with 20 Champions Tour wins">Golfers with 20 Champions Tour wins</a>), anyone is welcome to expand the other articles to include all players who have won each tournament. <b>Fourthly</b>, while the facts can and probably are being incorporated into the golfers biographies, the purpose of these articles is to have a focal point where golfers can be compared. As someone who doesn't know much about golf I wouldn't know which golfer has won the most PGA tournaments and I would have to go searching loads of biographies to find that out. As for there being seperate articles, well they are separate tournaments that people may look up seperately. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 11:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Also if we are standardising then it might be best to rename <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_golfers_with_most_major_title_wins.html" title="List of golfers with most major title wins">List of golfers with most major title wins</a> to "Golfers with most major titles wins" particularly because I would like to see little bit at the top about what the major titles are. I know it's at the top of the table but I think it worth having a little explanation at the top as all the articles are accessible in Category:Golf Records, separate from the tournaments and someone like me who doesn't know much about golf would like to know why those tournaments are major and others aren't, do more people play in them? -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 11:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a good point, but I still say <b>delete</b>. However, I should qualify that, as a golf fanatic, when I wrote "meaningless" I meant "meaningless" in the context of this article standing alone. This table and the other articles need to be incorporated where they are relevant. The titles are neither "user friendly" or likely to typed in by anyone seeking information. If they are just here so they can be referred to from other pages then they may as well be there in the first place. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 12:00, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, I see your point and I agree the titles are not user-friendly. I think there need to be standardisation in the titles. IMO "Golfers with (the?) most PGA Tour wins" is a good title b/c it is that's the kind of thing that one might stick in google or any search engine if you wanted to know. The others should be called "Golfers with (the?) most PGA Tour wins in one year", "Golfers with most major title wins", "Golfers with (the?) most Champions Tour wins" and so forth. I also think that they need to be expanded. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:39, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>On combining I suppose it's a style issue, I <i>wouldn't</i> agree that they should be combined with the individual tour / tournament pages just because I think it makes those articles messy. To me, who as I mentioned knows v. little about golf, I would go to the PGA tour page to find out what it is, but I'm not necessarily be interested in who has the most wins. I would favour creating a seperate articles for the things like the list of leading money winners by year as well. If you look at the <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair.html#Routes" title="Ryanair">Routes</a> section in the <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair.html" title="Ryanair">Ryanair</a> article, which btw is a featured article, you'll see there is a link for a seperate page for the destinations. It makes the Ryanair page easier to read, if you stuck a big list in there it would interrupt the flow of the article. I suppose it's not an issue if the parent article is quite short but I think that the golf tour articles can be expanded further - like the <a href="../../../p/g/a/PGA_TOUR_c307.html" title="PGA TOUR">PGA TOUR</a> article already has been - and separating these types of things saves clean-up later. Anyway, that's just my opinion and there is a certain presumption on my part that the tour / tournament articles can be expanded to the point where this becomes an issue and that the lists will be regularly updated. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 13:34, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps it would be a good idea if Windcoote is keen to retain these tables, he amalgamated them into ONE large article entitled "Golfing statistics" or "Golfing records" or something similar, where they could all be lumped together; that way the index box at the top of the page would make each table and section readily available. But as small scrappy little pages of one table or so each with little or no explanatory information <b>delete</b> is the only option <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 13:52, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see your point but I think that combining all these articles will just give you one entirely messy page. I think your idea would work if what there is right now was all there was ever going to be, but keeping them separate gives them room to expand beyond what they currently are. Having them in Category:Golf Records allows them to all be accessed in the handy manner you describe, though maybe it should be changed to Golf statistics as these lists aren't actually records and the official rankings definitely aren't. Anyway I think we've had our say now (or at least I've said enough&#160;;-)), it's really up to others now to decide what is best. -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 15:13, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is no minimum size for a Wikipedia article, and there are tens of thousands which are shorter than these articles (especially the other three larger ones - the debate has been cunningly attached to the smallest article). The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champions_Tour_696b.html" title="Champions Tour">Champions Tour</a> list is the shortest because the Champions Tour is much younger than the PGA Tour or the majors. It is intended to include players with a similar level of achievement to the other lists. I have written dozens of golf articles recently, on tours, tournaments, and individual players. I am rapidly boosting the number of links between them. The value of having separate list is illustrated by, for example, the link in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Norman_3d5b.html" title="Greg Norman">Greg Norman</a> which goes directly to the one list out of the four which is relevant to him (Golfers with most PGA tour wins), <i>and not to the other three</i> which aren't. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 17:07, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have added players with four and three majors to the majors list, and will get down to one on this list eventually, though not on the others. I have also moved it to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golfers_with_most_major_title_wins.html" title="Golfers with most major title wins">Golfers with most major title wins</a> as requested by <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a>, expanded the introduction to the list, and added a link to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majors.html" title="Majors">majors</a>, which hadn't been written when I did the list (the article start dates are 31 Jan and 15 Feb). <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 17:07, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What is arbitary about it? Do you just mean this list or all of them. They are not all of quite the same nature (and once again it is inappropriate that the discussion has been appended to the articles which is clearly the least significant of the four). There is a great lack of detail in the negative votes. I should have mentioned before that the level of 20 wins on the <a href="../../../p/g/a/PGA_Tour_c4c8.html" title="PGA Tour">PGA Tour</a> actually has huge and <i>official</i> significance. It confers <i>life membership</i> of the tour, which means that a player no longer has to finish in the top 125 on the money list to retain his tour card. There may be a similar rule for the Champions Tour. I will go and look it up. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 17:31, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't find a full statement of eligibility criteria for Champions Tour events, but by inference from the profiles of Champions Tour members on the official site, the eqivalent status is "Top 30 on the all time money list" which would be much harder to maintain as many of the lines of such a table would change every week, rather than a maximum of one. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 17:40, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Windcoote there is an immense amount of detail and helpful suggestions in the negative vote, why don't you stop repeating yourself and read them <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 17:44, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have acted on two helpful suggestions, neither of which came from either of you. This vote appears to be the only one on this page in which Giano has participated. Whatever one thinks of this article, it is not credible to suggest that it is more deserving of deletion than <i>all</i> of the others. Giano's involvement here is clearly based on a personal vendetta rather than a concern for the well-being of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Both Olav and Kjell Aukrust are notable Norwegians (Olav especially, since he was important in the development of the Nynorsk language)--&gt; this is a notable family. It happens to be a long-established one that we actually know the back-history of (I know the stuff about farms seems really boring, but Norwegian dialects actually varied on a farm-to-farm level; Nynorsk was an attempt to standardise these dialects by giving emphasis to the "uncorrupted" rural versions over the Danish-influenced urban ones). My suggestion is that this should be renamed as "Aukrust Family" with "Aukrust" set as a redirect, and the text edited so it reads less like a geneology - i.e. giving more emphasis on the family members who are well-known and giving the backhistory later. I will also "dump" the information in this article into the talk pages for Olav and Kjell in case it is deleted. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VivaEmilyDavies</a> 22:47, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The existence of a real programming language that is written as l33tspeak is somewhat notable. 193.167.132.66 12:35, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As the author of the article and the language, I (somewhat predictably) vote <b>keep</b>. The article is about the language, not the author, and I didn't write it for money or personal glory - I just thought people would be interested. There's a pretty good selection of obscure esoteric languages with little real-world use already described on Wikipedia, for people who happen to be interested in such things. In my humble opinion l33t's unusual syntax makes it as notable as any other esoteric language. There have been people other than myself writing interpreters and programs for l33t, which to me implies that there is some interest in it. I won't be offended if the page gets deleted, but I felt it was a valid contribution to Wikipedia.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 4 clear "delete" votes and 7 "keep" votes. However, 4 of the "keep" votes have to be thrown out as either mis-votes or anonymous users. That leaves a majority to delete, but not the overwhelming concensus necessary to carry out the deletion. The decision defaults to "keep".</p>
<p>However, I also note that several users commented on the low quality and possible bias of the article. I concur with that assessment and will mark it for clean-up.

<li>Keep - Wouldn't it be in breach of your policy of neutralism to delete it? Grounds for believing the woman's middle name is Thoms are 1) John Cairns' remembering she was at pains to correct his assumption she meant Thomson, her mother's maiden name, when it was Thoms, a different name from the other side of her family; &amp; 2) Family Records has it as Thoms. Either source might be mistaken but each corroborates the other &amp; reinforces the probability Thoms is correct. Either source for the Wikipedia entry is better than that cited for the middle name given in the DNB entry, her brother. That entry cites no public record source. For Wikipedia to drop its entry would be to endorse as true what, on the balance of probabilities, is false. That would be iniquitous of Wikipedia. Is my view that your deletion would be in breach of your policy correct, or not, in your view? Deletion would not only be POV but erroneous POV. Further, your entry backs up statements by quotations from the subject's letters, validating them. (Archivist)

The result of the debate was ambiguous. While the clear concensus is to delete the article, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnevell_594b.html" title="User:Marnevell">Marnevell</a> made significant improvements to it at the last minute. My personal vote would still have been to delete because I don't think the subject quite meets the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. I also note that none of the other voters returned to the discussion to change their votes subsequent to <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnevell_594b.html" title="User:Marnevell">Marnevell</a>'s changes.</p>

The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> but with qualifications. The general recommendation is that this should become a redirect to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Edutainment.html" title="Edutainment">edutainment</a>, an article which is currently much smaller than this one. And while I agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">user:TheoClarke</a> that edutainment can be considered a neologism, it is far better known and in much wider use than this hyphenated phrase. However, that is properly a decision to be dealt with on the respective Talk pages. I will mark this with a "merge" recommendation and trust that future editor/readers will sort out the best long-term answer. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:52, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. (1) Local politicians aren't inherently notable, and there is no evidence of notability provided in the article; (2) It is marginally more than a sub-stub. It is most likely that a person arriving at this article will already know that Beavers was a Chicago alderman, and be exasperated with Wikipedia for wasting his time.

I tend to agree that a redlink will be more likely to result in a quality article than starting from the current content. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:06, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any call for 'category:blues groups of European origin'? And if so, what's so special about European blues as compared to, say, African blues (if any)?

<li>Interesting.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Well-written article on a subject of great interest to a substantial number of people. Another demonstration that the 'Google test' may be great at providing evidence for a <i>keep</i> vote, but it is absolutely useless as substantiation for a <i>delete</i> vote. The reason is simple: Many encyclopedic subjects are not well-represented on the web. And while it's easy to check when Google gives a false positive by providing unrelated hits, there is no easy way of checking these false negatives. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:47, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you trying to tell me that the google test is flawed here because Pokemon characters are not well represented on the web? A search for "pokemon" and "character" gets 533 thousand hits.

<li>Comment: Nope, I'm trying to tell you that <i>this</i> character <i>may</i> not be well represented, but that's <b>not</b> why I claim the Google test has limits, nor do I claim that the Google test is <i>flawed</i>.

<ul>
<li>I think the google test can be misused both ways, depending on the subject. The subject matter is key, and is often overlooked by those who think it's all in the numbers. It's easy for many unencyclopedic things to get a substantial number of google hits, through self promotion, having names in common, as well as various things that exist <i>only</i> on the internet, hence displaying <i>all</i> references to a subject, rather than what is generally thought to be a mere sample from which one can extrapolate. Likewise many subjects are not well represented on the internet, mostly things that predated the internet and have not seen widespread discussion since its advent. Holding, say, minor historic figues of antiquity to the same significant google results as, say, porn stars, is ridiculous. The google test has its limits. Severe ones. And one must keep in mind not only the number of hits, but what the hits actually are. I've come across many pages that had no apparent mention of the subject I was searching for, and this must be taken into account. I will say this, however: something that turns up 0 google hits is very unlikely to be notable enough for an encyclopedia, and, is somewhat unlikely to exist. Of course, they may be exceptions to this too. My point is false positives and false negatives are both common, and anyone who thinks <i>any</i> Pokemon character is underrepresented on the web is delusional.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Having contributed this article (which I recognize certainly needs development), I feel compelled to defend it. There is such a creature as a 'tax protestor,' a term which is used by the IRS, by courts, and by tax professors and practitioners. W/respect to the POV, it is frankly very hard to write about people who think that the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteenth_Amendment_f014.html" title="Sixteenth Amendment">Sixteenth Amendment</a> is invalid because <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> was technically not a state until 1953, or that the word 'income' could not conceivably include wages, without sounding judgmental. Indeed, some tax protestors have become quite legendary for taking multiple appeals to the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> on various theories (and invariably getting shot down). I borrowed the section (with permission of the author, as noted) because it was succinct, and I saw no point in reinventing the wheel. In any event, I contend that the topic, however set forth, is certainly encylopedic.--[[User:BD2412/deletion debates|BD2412] 02:39, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>'If tax protestor' is a US legal term as opposed to 'tax protester' as a general term for a person in any country not paying their taxes and whatnot, I think there should be separate articles for the two.</li>
<li>I think the quoted material should not be there unless it is impossible to provide a NPOV explanation of the legal term, as the author's opinion expressed in the quote doesn't seem to add any insight into the factual content and may cause unnecessary offence to some people. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquidwina_7da9.html" title="User:Squidwina">Squidwina</a> 10:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page needs to be extensively reworked.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's start with the aspects of this topic that are the least controversial: when the phrase first appeared in print; to whom, by name, it referred; how it has expanded over time; whether or not it is a legal term, and if so, where defined; a list of specific people who self-identify as "tax protestors"</li>
<li>A list of the specific arguments, with citations to court cases for those that have been tested - this is where the article will become huge, particularly if both sides of every argument are included</li>
<li>The phrase "disagree with the tax laws" is ambiguous: does it mean someone who wants the law to be changed, or someone who disagrees with someone else about what the law is?</li>
<li>Is it possible to draw a distinct line between "such a creature" and people who are confused by the tax code and have genuine doubts and unanswered questions? In other words, is "tax protestor" a distinct population?</li>
<li>Reference to "Holocaust deniers" is too far afield and merely shows the author's bias. (No one self-identifies as a Holocaust denier, it is entirely a slur-word.) It might be appropriate in a page about the psychology of people who question mainstream beliefs about points of law and history, but there the topic should be fully explored.</li>
<li>It is easy for a schooled lawyer to ridicule the rest of us, but tell me this: if the personal income tax is an excise (as the corporate income tax is), and if an excise is a tax imposed on the happening of an event, then what's the event?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In any event, I think we are beyond arguing whether this article should exist, and into arguing what it should say. I will note that there is no legal distinction between the '-er' or '-or' spellings; I've seen them used about equally in legal texts/documents, and I'll self-correct to the more common usage. I would clarify that 'tax protesters,' as the IRS defines the term, do not want to change the law b/c they believe the law as written has no effect. It is hard to draw a line between the stubborn and the merely confused, as the term applies to the belief, not the reason for it. Also, sorry if I seemed to be ridiculing anyone, that was not my intent - I'm really not a 'schooled lawyer' yet - I'm still just a law student until May. --[[User:BD2412/deletion debates|BD2412] 18:42, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I believe the term "tax protestor" first applied to people who signed 1040's "under protest" (to reserve their right to disclaim the signature in case it turned out they weren't required by law to sign). Parenthetically, when Form SS-5 (Application for Social Security Number) came out in 1937, many people signed it "under protest" according to the New York Times. The people listed in the first paragraph wouldn't have been called tax protestors, they would have been called rebels, revolutionaries or traitors.</li>
<li>I believe the "movement" started around the 1950's, with Arthur Porth and a few others. See <a href="http://www.anti-irs.com/newsletters/1997/oct97.html" class="external free" title="http://www.anti-irs.com/newsletters/1997/oct97.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-irs.com/newsletters/1997/oct97.html</a></li>
<li>What would be proper primary source materials? The court cites and IRS publications you referred to? What else?</li>
<li>They tend to call themselves the "freedom movement," "patriot movement" or "tax honesty movement."</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 9 clear "delete" votes, 3 clear "keep" votes and 3 clear "merge" votes. The opinion of the nominator is, in this case, ambigous. While there is a clear majority to delete, there is not the overwhelming concensus necessary to carry out deletion.

I live there.&#160;:-) I have edited the page to say that it is a developed area versus a planned development, although I think the original author meant "planned development" not in the sense of future planning, but in the sense of there is a master plan for the whole development, like "planned community". It is a familiar name to anyone in the DFW Metroplex. I would agree with Avriette that it might need to be behind a disambiguation page. I will attempt to find some more useful info to add as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>, quite notable. "Planned" in the sense of having been centrally planned, rather than having grown organically (quite unusual for Texas, I might add). Includes HQs of quite a few corporations. <b>Most of the delete votes seem to be based on miscomprehension of the sense of the word "planned" here.</b> -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:51, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Change vote to <b>Keep</b> given the rewrite and my misunderstanding of the word "planned." Sorry for that, but I didn't have much to go on!&#160;:o) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:39, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>,I am kind of new to Wikipedia, however my uncle was one of the people behind the Las Colinas development when he worked for Faison back in the 60-70's, I would like to update the info on this page. I feel that Las Colinas was a huge failure becuase of the economic situation of the time, yet it was a tremendous idea as well. Please remember too that #1 I live in the zip code of Las Colinas (75039) and Exxon is headquartered here as well [unsigned comment from User:BigHonky ]
<ul>
<li>Go for it! Just remember to maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_tutorial_6edc.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV tutorial">NPOV</a> when writing. If Las Colinas is regarded as a failure by many (and you can cite the sources to back it up), then it probably belongs in the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 03:07, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous. While there was a majority decision to delete the current version, there was a promise to improve the article which influenced subsequent votes. I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one a <b>keep for now</b> and mark it with a "cleanup" tag. If not substantially improved in a reasonable amount of time, it may become appropriate to renominate the article for deletion.

Of course, if the title is mispelled, I will move it to a proper name later when I can login from my normal comp.
