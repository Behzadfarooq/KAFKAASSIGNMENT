<li><b>Comment</b> - Well, the H.P. Lovecraft universe has no fictional military forces, nor does Flatland, The Space Triolgy, Cordwainer Smith's work, King Kong used the very real US Air Force, Blade Runner or Minotry Report movies mention no militaries, Berstein Bears, various Newpaper Comics, the list goes on and on with fictional universes WITHOUT fictional militaries. The list is maintainable, and the pagehistory has shown that various editors have worked very hard to see that each army is verified and categorized properly. I may also note that this list is also quite helpful in catching anyone who makes vanity material and easier to track down other vanity material on wikipedia and elete it. --Eldarone 04:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The fact that a couple of fictional universes don't have fictional military organizations speaks only to differences in author creativity, nothing else.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Slipperly Slope Fallacy. There is a difference between keeping what militaries exist and what an general ate for lunch in the history books.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Fictional Military Organizations is perfectly relevant to the many science fiction universes, books, RPG's, etc.Etc.

<ul>
<li>Lists that are so broad that they cannot ever be comprehensive are generally "idiosyncratic non-topics", per the deletion policy. This is just a bunch of things that are all foo, which is an idiosyncratic non-topic. There's no possibility for overview, because there's nothing you can say about all (or even most) of these things besides the fact that they're fictional military organizations. This illustrates no trend or topic, and there cannot ever be an accompanying article nor can this list ever be even half-way comprehensive. No article on Wikipedia is ever properly complete, but proper articles can be comprehensive. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:34, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per A Man In Black. Is the list entertaining? Not particularly for me, but I'm sure it is for some, but that's not really material to this discussion. Is the list maintainable? It's certainly not the worst offended I've seen, but, as has been said, it has very little chance of becoming comprehensive. Is the list useful? Not unless you already have prior knowledge of the subject, and if you have said knowledge, the list pretty much fails to augment it. That leads me to believe it's unencyclopaedic and better off gone.

<li><b>Delete</b> - one of the cruftiest lists I've ever seen. The definition of 'military organizations' is ludicrously broad - essentially meaning 'any fictional group who have engaged in, or are prepared for, organised violence'.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Starfleet, the A-Team and Nod are still miliary forces. Starfleet was used in the Dominion Wars as the armed forces of the Federation, The A-Team are by diffintion mercenaries: soldiers hired for various actions, and he Brotherhood of Nod is still organized as a military force, although terroist as well.

<li><b>Delete:</b> In my opinion, a good list should have some sort of specific cross-referencing use, IE: An index. Or, a good list can give interesting information on its topics, IE: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_United_States_Presidents_64c0.html" title="List of fictional United States Presidents">List of fictional United States Presidents</a>. A good list also has a narrow scope and sticks to it, in this article, the scope is too broad, such as to include government-sponsored militaries, and mercenary corporations which, in some cases, aren't even "military", IE: The A-Team. Not exactly listcruft, but, not exactly useful either. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 19:21, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b> - The A-Team is still a mercenary force, a group that gets paid for military activities. The list only includes, and only, military forces. Throughout history there have been many different types of militaries groups, from small Freelancers to Rome's Voleenteer armies to Warrior caste to paramilitary forces. There is such a board variety of fighting forces in real life as well --Eldarone 20:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> While I recognize the A-Team as a mercenary force, I do not recognize them as military and I do not recognize them as an organization and therefore discount their inclusion in the list, and by extension, discount the rationale, scope, and viability of the list. <a href="../../../j/j/j/User%7EJJJJust_79de.html" title="User:JJJJust">JJJJust</a> 23:34, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The A-Team is still a mercenary company, dispite it's small size. It's like saying a Mom and Pop store isn't a bussiness because they don't have 20 stores. Size dosn't matter. If you have a problem with The A-Team being on the list, then go the discussion page and debate it. --Eldarone 02:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's symptomic of this list's problems. What can you say that applies to both Starfleet and the A-Team? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:45, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course not, the A-team is a small Mercenary force that's sort of like a special ops team for hire. Eventually, the A-Team does become part of a larger military agency in the last season. Starfleet is the Military and exploration arm of the United Federation of Planets built more along the lines of traditional military forces. Starfleet is chartered by the Federation, overseen by polticians, and is diffinately a much largeer organization. But both Starfleet and the A-Team are still trained, professional military forces, regardless of size or wither they get paid or not. What exactly is the problem though? I don't quite understand what the problem is. Do you have a problem with Mercs being classsifed as Military? --Eldarone 04:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's no topic, just a shared attribute.

<li>Yes there is a topic for this list: "Fictional" as in non real, "Military Organization" is the term chosen becaused there is a variety of Military forces, from regular Armed Forces, to Rebels, Mercenaries, Militia, and even culturaly based warriors. Nothing to say as a group? All these are fictional Military forces. That is the topic.

<li>Again, this is such a broad list that it isn't a topic, just a list of things that have a single shared attribute, like a "List of blue things" or "List of three-word phases."

<li>It's not a broad list. Every single unit on that list is a Military Force, by diffition (from Dictionary.com):military- adj 1: of or relating to the study of the principles of warfare. All these orgziation have to deal with WARFARE, they are Fictional, must be a group, and they have to be from a notable source. They do not share a single artbute, they all share several attributes. --Eldarone 04:54, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not all of these organizations deal with warfare (I see several exceptions, mostly untested defense groups, mercenaries, and terrorist groups), and nothing in the introduction implies that this is true. All these things seem to have in common is one shared attribute: they're fictional military groups. Just like "things that are blue" and "people with red hair", there's no topic, just a shared attribute. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:04, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful list for authors who wish to create new fictional military organizations. A "cheat sheet" of sorts. Silly but handy. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 01:55, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as the list is useful in crosschecking with existing military units, fictional or real, as well as links to related articles in science fiction, fantasy, military fiction, and literature. The list is also maintainable, as the editors of the page have removed and recategorized hundreds of unrelated, misplaced, or non-existant links and entries over the past 2 years of the articles. I do believe there will now be a much tighter hand on submission to this article, with the addition of small descriptions for each category instead of links to articles related to the category. --<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungFreud_9a6b.html" title="User:YoungFreud">YoungFreud</a> 23:02, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
