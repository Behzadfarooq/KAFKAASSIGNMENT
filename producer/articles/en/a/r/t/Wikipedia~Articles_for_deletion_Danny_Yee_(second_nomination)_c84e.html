<li><b>Speedy delete</b> as recreation of deleted content. Note that in the previous AfD debate, there were no "keep" recommendations; all participants said either to userfy or to delete. Those participants included <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Yee_8144.html" title="User:Danny Yee">User:Danny Yee</a> himself who preferred to delete the content as he didn't want it on his user page. In fact, his user page states that the article <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Yee_bcaa.html" title="Danny Yee">Danny Yee</a> is not particularly useful. Since the article's claim to notability for the subject is as an online book reviewer, I don't think he meets any <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria to such a degree that he ought to have an article about him even against his will. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:32, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Bad faith nomination by editor (Kmaguir1) who does not care about subject, but is simply nominating out of unrelated edit conflict with article creator. • Apart from that, however, the "Google test" gives 155k hits for Yee, whose reviews are <i>widely</i> quoted, referenced and syndicated. Relatedly, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Danny+Yee%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Danny+Yee%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google scholar</a> shows a rather substantial 365 mentions. The "author test" mentions readership of &gt;5000: according to Yee's statements (see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Talk%7EDanny_Yee_cd06.html" title="Talk:Danny Yee">Talk:Danny Yee</a>), he has gotten over a million hits on his reviews over the years—even if Yee's characterization of server logs isn't exactly accurate, the 5000 threshold is easy exceeded by two orders of magnitude. FWIW, Google groups shows 4260; and Alexa shows his homepage at 64,061. I also find it notable that his reviews have been slashdot frontpage stories repeatedly. • The prior AfD (over a year ago) was based on different, and inadequate, article contents that in fact failed to assert notability. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 20:10, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Can I vote? He's not notable, he was judged to be so, by Metropolitan90's argument, he should be gone as it is--he doesn't meet any WP:BIO criteria--he's a simple online book reviewer. That's not notable. If I publish book reviews on the net, do I become notable? Ridiculous. -<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:06, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure you can "vote". Although on Wikipedia the decision is not by the number of votes; it is by the merit of the argument. But a “vote” might have weight, I suspect some Admins understandably count votes when closing out the process. Regardless, craft your argument thoughtfully and it will have its day in "court".
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> states clearly that it is not policy. But whether this article meets the emerging continuously emerging consensus on what is notable is still essentially the subject to debate—this debate (Wikipolicy is evanescent and virtual).</p>
<p>And yes, if you publish enough on the net, even if you publish nowhere else, it is possible you can become notable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 21:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>— Notability is always such an interesting debate. Regardless of the allegation of bad faith nomination the question is, does Danny Yee meet a reasonable standard for notability. With 683,000 Google hits I'm willing to accept him, even if he's done little else—he's internet notable. If we get rid of all folks and topics this borderline, Wikipedia will have a lot fewer entries. I've only "voted" against a couple of notabilities today; I seem to like them all. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a> 21:20, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that you can be notable and just be on the net, like a <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Berardinelli_aeac.html" title="James Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a>, but it's very rare, and you have to be notable in an area that itself is notable--like Berardinelli, he's a movie reviewer. Billions of people have seen the movies he's reviewed, and he has a sufficient number and sufficient mention in non-internet sources to be considered notable. But Danny Yee? I think not. You'd have to say that the things his reviews are about are as popular as movies, the huge category of movies, or somewhere close and I think that that is not in evidence, from LotLE or from anyone else. -<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 21:47, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The 155k is the right count: probably the larger number forgets the quotes around the name, i.e. both "danny"s and "yee"s... but still: how can 155K genuine hits be NN?! It's definitely not linkspam inflation, but genuine references. We argue on AfD's over whether a few hundred hits reaches notability... not whether over a hundred thousand hits does! <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 22:37, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All this citation is doing is showing to the world how non-notable he really is. Not of this stuff is even remotely encyclopedic. The picture is gratuitous. He's not notable, and he hasn't become so since the last determination he wasn't.

<dd>While I don't fine that much of an issue with keeping the article, I completely the picture is gratuitous especially in proportion to his notability.

Not to clutter Ben's page, but I think it's worth looking at the list. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 17:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry but comparing the notability of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Yee_bcaa.html" title="Danny Yee">Danny Yee</a>, as much am I like his book reviews, to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Berners-Lee_4c85.html" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (the inventer of the web!), <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> (mega-star philosopher!), <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Wilczek_ec5d.html" title="Frank Wilczek">Frank Wilczek</a> (nobel prizing winner - physics) is simply ridiculous. Although the others are more in line, but I notice that at least one of them is up for deletion. I think that LotLE is pushing the article towards vanity, but to be honest, it is pretty harmless either way -- its just Wikipedia. This is my last comment on the issue. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 17:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The one up for deletion was nominated by Kmaguir1, and has only received one "delete" vote (guess whose). Obviously yes, you name the most famous three from my list above; look at the other ten too. There was actually a discussion recently on <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>'s talk page, specifically about how desirable more subject pictures would be (no one disagreed, it was just a question of finding GFDL images). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 18:02, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Give it a rest, Kmaguir1: I <i>created</i> the Yee article long before you joined WP, so I hardly think my belief in his notability has anything to do with you. Moreover, I had heard of Yee, and read his reviews, long before <i>I</i> joined WP: I think I first heard of him in 1993-4 (before the WWW existed, probably), when his reviews were widely syndicated and discussed on Usenet. Yee has certainly "seen print" in terms of being mentioned in many books and newspapers; but in the last decade or more, a lot of publication <i>is</i> electronic-only. Not that it really matters, but Yee has repeatedly received book offers for collections of his reviews, but has declined to do that (if I were him, I think I'd have accepted; but I'm not him). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If Vsion deletes per Shazbot85, and Shazbot85 has retracted his delete vote, that seems to entail Vsion retracting his/her delete vote as well, barring an explicit comment.

<dd>This is a misunderstanding, Anthony. Although I'm pleased Vsion decided to revisit his/her vote, using a reason of "per So-and-so" doesn't pledge a vote or loyalty. It just means: "I vote this way for the same reasons enunciated by So-and-so". Just because one person changes their mind doesn't mean that everyone who was convinced by their original explanation must do so. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:15, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
