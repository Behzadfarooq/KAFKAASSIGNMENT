<li><b>Comment</b> I'll agree that YouTube as a primary source should be questioned. In response to that, I've added the director's website as an external link -- it also hosts the video (and at much higher quality than YouTube, I might add). However, using YouTube viewership as a gauge of notability should be fair play. If 2 million views is not some indication of notability, then I don't know what is. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicago_god_e952.html" title="User:Chicago god">Chicago god</a> 08:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Two million views is an indication of <i>popularity</i>, not notability. There are many temporarily popular things that are not notable in any way. This is a perfect example, along with scads of other Internet fads. In a month, no one will know nor care about this thing. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">-- <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShinmawa_8829.html" title="User:Shinmawa">ShinmaWa</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/h/i/User_talk%7EShinmawa_fb4c.html" title="User talk:Shinmawa">talk</a>)</sup></font> 18:55, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> you can "vote" all you want, but this isn't a vote. We're looking for arguments and discussion and (we hope) some form of concensus. And in this particular case, we're looking for <i>multiple</i>, <i>independent</i>, reliable sources. The directors website is hardly independent, and as a directly interested party, its reliability may be questionable as well. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:06, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have removed speedy delete tag. There is an assertion of notability and a discussion to be had here. For now, I think we still need reliable third party sources. As the director is not a third party but the creator, his website doesn't count. Chicago god might want to copy it across to his talk page until there are sources such as newspaper articles or reviews online that verify its importance. For now, Google News has nothing on it and Google News Archive has lonelygirl but nothing on this. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:39, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The only argument I've heard so far for keeping this article is that it has 2 million hits on YouTube. Big woop. There are <i><b>many</b></i> videos on YouTube that have way more hits, and they don't have articles. Why? Because, as said over and over again on here, no verifiable, independent, reliable sourses to back them up. A buttload of hits just means <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> is popular!

<li><b>Comment</b> There are fewer than 250 videos on YouTube that have more views than "Kiwi!" does. I guess that's what you mean by <i><b>many</b></i>.

<dd>Okay, <i>why</i> is this deserving of an article? Here's a tip, take a look at <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Hugs_Campaign_90c0.html" title="Free Hugs Campaign">Free Hugs Campaign</a>, an article about YouTube video that actually <i>is</i> notable. See how many assertions of notablity, and how many sources cited?

<dd>Thanks for the tip. I'll gladly compare. Thirteen days after <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Hugs_Campaign_90c0.html" title="Free Hugs Campaign">Free Hugs Campaign</a> became an article, it still had exactly one source cited (YouTube). One source after nearly two weeks. <a href="../../../k/i/w/Kiwi%21.html" title="Kiwi!">Kiwi!</a> has 6 sources in 2 days. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicago_god_e952.html" title="User:Chicago god">Chicago god</a> 04:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Right now there aren't any valid third party sources mentioned so it doesn't establish notability. However, to people interested in keeping the article...

<li><b>Keep.</b> YouTube is notable. And this ranked #1 all-time in important categories. I suspect that YouTube and its succesors are becoming a valid medium for publishing of animation.
