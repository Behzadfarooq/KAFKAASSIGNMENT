<li><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">User:AllyUnion</a>'s bot will have to be updated, and might get confused. We'll see what it does tonight.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussions of specific VfDs?</span></h2>
<p>Hey fellow VFD/Oldsters,</p>
<p>I don't know if there is a place to discuss these things, but what do you think about <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Mi_%C3%9Altimo_Adi%C3%B3s_fbbd.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mi Último Adiós">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mi Último Adiós</a>? A lot of the votes are for Transwiki to WikiSource, but during the VfD, it seems people have added other material so the article now is about the poem, but also includes the poem itself. Is it possible to <i>Keep</i> the article but move the poem to WikiSource? Or perhaps you have other suggestions (or will solve this VfD for me). Thanks, --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:00, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a judgment call for the deciding admin and is exactly why they are supposed to exercise discretion and, at times, to ignore the result that would come of strict vote-counting. Your proposed solution is entirely acceptable and is the reason that the closers are supposed to evaluate the comments and their order in context of the changes to the article during and since the discussion period. If you think it might be controversial, though, just skip that one for now. I hope to have some time this weekend to help work off the backlog. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 19:59, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suppressing closed discussions</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> just showed me how to suppress the display of discussions which have already been closed (that is, those which have the blue box behind them).</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are still using the monobook style (the default), edit your <a href="../../../m/y/p/Special%7EMypage_monobook.css_d911.html" title="Special:Mypage/monobook.css">monobook.css</a> page.
<ul>
<li>If you are using the classic style, edit <a href="../../../m/y/p/Special%7EMypage_standard.css_8edd.html" title="Special:Mypage/standard.css">standard.css</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type <tt>.vfd { display:none; }</tt> into the page and save it.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Unintended consequences:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><s>This might also suppress the VfD header on articles which have been nominated for deletion (if the nomination box also uses "class=vfd"). It will still be visible in edit-mode but will not show in the regular view.</s> (This has not been a problem in any of the recent versions of VfD/AFD tag.)</li>
<li>This will suppress the entire discussion even when you want to find it. For example,
<ul>
<li>when the article is renominated and you want to evaluate what was said in the prior discussion</li>
<li>when the article is kept and you want to follow through the link on the Talk page</li>
<li>when searching for the old nomination to see if a recreated article is eligible for speedy</li>
<li>if/when someone inappropriately marks a discussion as "closed" while it's still on the main VfD page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>A few discussions which were closed over a week ago will not be suppressed because we were using "id=vfd" instead of "class=vfd" in the closing header.</s> (Again, this has not been a problem recently.)</li>

<dd>Updated. By the way, you can temporarily undo this option simply switching to another skin in your preferences.

<dd>Another option, which I suggested below, and which requires no work from users, would be to have a bot perodically move closed discussions to the bottom of the page. So far I did not get any feedback on this, whether positive or negative, so I would wonder what people think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 08:35, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New subpage proposal: "Complex discussions"</span></h2>
<p>There are two categories of unresolved vfd discussions: those that no admin has got around to, and those that no admin has managed to decide one way or the other. The second category keeps us from deleting date pages from this page, and wastes time while admins go through some long pages to search for the unresolved ones, and each of us decide we can't resolve them, for whatever reason. Could we maybe list that category on a separate page? That is, if a few admins go through a day's vfd, and all of them decide not to deal with a particular discussion, we can put it on that page, and when a particularly bold/thick-skinned/drunk admin comes by, maybe they can tackle one or two of the "complex discussion" sets. I did one (<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a>) and I'm already getting flak for it, not willing to do more for another day or two.

<p>for VfD discussions that day. All the discussions there are closed by one admin or another. The way I learned this is by going down on this very long page screenful after screenful and carefully examining all the entries for the characteristic color background of a closed discussion. And my question is: is this how things are done? Or is there a quicker way of figuring out if all the VfD discussions for a day are closed? Thanks. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 03:11, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't found an automated way of doing this, no. Although I scroll down at speed now, and just keep my eye on the left hand edge of the 'editable' area and watch for breaks in the double-line that should be there for a closed debate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 03:27, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wonder if it is useful to count the open discussions</span></h2>
<p>I wrote a small and silly perl script to post on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Old</a> the number of open discussions left for each day which need to be closed by an admin. If their number is less than 10, links to the actual discussions are provided. See the link for the example (uploaded by my <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">bot</a>).</p>
<p>I wonder if this could be considered useful. If yes, I could run such a bot periodically, say every hour or two. Of course no matter what interval one chooses for updating this, the information will be obsolete if some discussions are closed in the meantime. But still, I wonder if there are any comments on the use of a thing like that or not.

<dd>Personally, I think that's great! We already have that middle section of the page, but that has to be populated by hand and sometimes, I'm sure, debates don't go there before a date gets archived. It too is often (at least) hours out of date and can be tedious to populate anyway. Although with the human version those debates can be removed, it really wouldn't seem like much of a problem to click a link, see it closed, and carry on by. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 04:24, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Very good point. From what I see, your bot adds a new line each day, of the form:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_14_2d47.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 August 14">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Log/2005 August 14</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>My bot can obviously confuse your bot. However, I would think though that it would not be that hard to modify your bot; it would just need to be aware that such a line has some other content after a whitepspace. The big question is whether it is worth it. And that's what this discussion is about. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 16:20, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not implement this so far because of the comment:</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;!-- Please note that the deletion process has changed considerably over time--please make sure you are familiar with the current Wikipedia:Deletion process NOTICE: Before removing a VFD day subpage, please make sure you review ALL of the discussions of that day and ensure the closed discussion is accurate. --&gt; in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Old_499a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a>.

<p>At present we eyeball the day log to check that there are no open discussions. Yes, it's tedious and probably not as reliable as script-based records, but it's probably good to have redundancy--both methods. So removing the fully closed day logs from the list of old VfD day logs would probably not be desirable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>? I just meant from the list of "debates older than 5 days". At present, someone cleans that up periodically and moves the done days to the archive. I was just wondering if the bots removed the bullet points for done-days. I don't mean deleting the subpages or anythgin. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 20:19, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's the same list Tony is talking about. Right now, we do a final check on the list by hand to confirm that all the debates really were closed. Then it's a trivial two edits (one cut-and-paste) to move the bullet from the /Old page to the Archived debates page. A script for those two edits doesn't seem worth the trouble. The other way to interpret your suggestion is that the bot will determine that all the debates were closed. I'm not sure I trust a bot to do that properly. A manual review still seems preferable. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 13:19, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I saw the same thing. I have no idea what is going on. If my script had a bug giving incorrect results, it would at least give the same (wrong) result if run twice in a row. My best guess is that the servers are playing tricks with us. Maybe they are out of sink and one server serves an older page while another one a newer page.

<dd>When the number of open discussion is rather low, say around 10, it would be instructive to actually count how many discussions are open and compare with what the bot gives.

<dd>I am the last refresh to the main page. It counts 52 open on August 26 (it was being fooled in part by a missing {{{vb}}}).

<p>Hi Splash. I figured out what happened. If you look at the source of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_26_e4a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26</a> you will see a mixture of "Votes for deletion", "Articles for deletion" and "Pages for deletion". Now, normally only one of these must be present. I knew that because of the recent mess we have both "Votes" and "Articles". Seeing in addition "Pages" on top of everything was a complete surprise. I will fix my script tomorrow. And let us hope that people will settle on one of the three versions eventually. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 04:23, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fixed now. I counted by hand that at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_26_e4a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26</a> now there are exactly 29 open discussions. By the way, now my script also give the number of closed discussions and the total number of discussions. They are counted independently. If the total does not equal the sum of open and closed, and if the total is not the same as in the table of contents of a given page (for example, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_August_26_e4a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 August 26</a>) then there is a problem. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 17:15, 3 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Excellent! I think the changeover to Articles for Deletion is nearly complete now, but there're going to be a few days when the rapid changing back-and-forth betwee A, P and V will be in effect at /Old. The open/closed/total thing is handy: but at the moment it only appears on the bot-progress page rather than on the project page. Is this deliberate?

<dd>OK, I now put the same thing in the project page. Note that my script still gets confused if a section is duplicate, as the one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_28&amp;diff=22494725&amp;oldid=22319355" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2005_August_28&amp;diff=22494725&amp;oldid=22319355" rel="nofollow">I removed</a>. My script does not count the duplicate section twice, so then in the TOC one may have one more discussion than as counted by the script. This is because Wikipedia uses a different syntax for duplicate section. If this turns out to be a problem in the future, I will deal with it. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 20:57, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mathbot is wrong sometimes. Do we know why? It kept telling me there was one open September 11th debate, and pointed me to a closed debate. I refreshed the page cache, ran it again a couple of times, and then it told me there were <b>two</b> open discussions, and pointed me to two closed ones! This is still better than having to do it manually, but if we could figure out what's confusing the poor mathbot it would make our lives a little easier. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 11:09, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, mathbot will not add add back links removed from this page, it works only with existing links.

<dd>ABCD, you are very right. My bot needs the text "boiler plate afd..." to declare a discussion closed. This one shows up with {subst:at} but not with simply {at}. I can patch up my bot to look at {at} too, but these days I don't have a reliable internet connection, so I don't know when I will get to it. In the meantime, one should use {subst:at} instead of {at}, which is the best practice anyway. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 10:32, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ABCD's goodies</span></h2>
<p>Many of you know I guess that <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCD_d6a3.html" title="User:ABCD">ABCD</a> has a lot of javascript code in his <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCD_monobook.js_596a.html" title="User:ABCD/monobook.js">User:ABCD/monobook.js</a> which does a lot of things for you when closing AFD discussions. The situation being that closing AFD is more and more of work, I would guess that every bit of automation would help.</p>
<p>I always (well, almost) dreamed of having somebody automatically insert the "{subst:at} and {subst:ab} for me when closing an afd discussion, and I stripped ABCD's code to the very bare minimum allowing it to do that. In case you never used ABCD's goodies and were too intimidated by all that javascript, maybe you could try my stripped down <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_monobook.js_3164.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov/monobook.js">User:Oleg Alexandrov/monobook.js</a>. It should do no more than adding a tab to the top/very right part of the edit window, which when pushed upon would insert the above strings. That tab would become visible only when in edit mode closing an afd discussion. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 21:44, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sorting the daily afd lists</span></h2>
<p>Curently, articles nominamed for deletion are listed by day; for example, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_October_3_9edf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 3">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 3</a>. The entries in such a list are not sorted in any particular manner, rather they show up in the order articles were nominated for deletion as the day goes by.</p>
<p>After 5 days, as we know, each such list is moved to AFD/old. I wonder if, at this stange, it would be useful to have several sections in the daily list. I would think of four sections. First section, listing articles which more likely will end up being deleted, second section articles for which the consensus is not that clear, third section with articles which more likely will be kept, and lastly, the fourth section being afd discussions which are already closed. I would think that such a split into sections would save some time to people closing discussions.</p>
<p>I could run a bot to update this list say hourly, and after all discussions for a day are closed, I could restore the original format of the list. I wonder if there are any comments on this. Thanks. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 12:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would prefer not to. It implies (quite strongly) prejudging the outcome of the debate before human intervention, based purely on the numbers. Although it might often get it right, it would provide another stick to beat admins over the head with if they close a debate counter to the section in which it might appear. I would, however, appreciate alphabetizing the list, so that when I go through it to find some particular debate or to remove some for relisting it's quicker. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 15:53, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>When an admin gets hit over the head because it went the against the wishes of a bot, truly the age of machines has arrived. :) I was thinking of puting in the "most likely keep" section articles for which more than 50% of the votes are keep, and in the "most likely delete" section articles for which more than 80%-90% of the votes are delete. Everything else would go in the "no clear consensus" section. But I see your point.</dd>
<dd>Alphabetizing would be easy enough to implement. How about also separating the closed discussions from the ones still open? <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 01:04, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Done with alphabetizing, see for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_October_11_24d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 11">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 11</a>. I will run this bot everyday shortly after AllyUnion's bot adds a new entry to afd/old. I still look forward to feedback about my proposal about separating the open discussions from the closed discussions, and more views on splitting open discussions in sections depending on how likely they are to close with a certain outcome. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 04:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I got a message from AllyUnion on my talk page asking to not alphabetize the AFD lists, as it changes the order in which the articles were nominated for deletion for a given day. That's a good point. Wonder what people think. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 20:52, 24 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once the day is closed, I don't see any relevance to the order in which they were nominated. Having them alphabetcal makes some things fractionally easier, so we might as well do it. Does it interfere with some other bot actions, or something? The time of nomination is (should) still be available from the timestamps if they're needed for something specific. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:25, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
