<li>Both of the above rationales are entirely subjective, and have no basis in policy.

<li>"Unencyclopedic" is certainly a basis in policy for deleting an article out of an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> is definitely a basis in policy. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Unencyclopaedic" merely asserts that you believe that there is a basis in policy, without saying what that basis actually is. It is not a basis in policy itself. And <b>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" is not an indiscriminate criterion for deletion</b>. Please read what the policy actually says. It is quite specific. It is not a catch-all excuse for things that you personally think to be "trivial" and "worthless". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, you know, I'm trying to find a nice way to say "this article is a pile of shit" and "trivia" is the best I've come up with. If there is not a specific document here that says "articles in an encyclopedia should be encyclopedic" then perhaps there should be, but to my mind it kinda goes without saying that an encyclopedia article should be encyclopedic and if it's not encyclopedic it has no place here. As for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, I've read it, thanks. "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia" seems like a pretty clear endorsement that things that aren't suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia should be deleted. So to sum up, this article is a pile of shit that doesn't belong in an encyclopedia...in other words, a list of presidents arranged by order of height is unencyclopedic, trivial and indiscriminate. If having the heights of presidents outside of their own articles is by some stretch of the imagination a worthwhile topic, then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heights_of_United_States_presidential_candidates_fb65.html" title="List of heights of United States presidential candidates">List of heights of United States presidential candidates</a> does it much better by actually including the heights of the presidents and their opponents and sourcing the information and the discussion of the "the taller guy wins" meme. Which not only makes this article useless shit but <i>redundant</i> useless shit. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:03, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your argument is entirely circular, and without any foundation in policy. According to your argument, the article doesn't belong because it is "unencyclopaedic", but your only definition of "unencyclopaedic" is "I personally think that it's a pile of shit that doesn't belong here.". Wikipedia doesn't employ that as a deletion criterion, for obvious reasons. The correct definition of "unencyclopaedic" is "not in accordance with all of our content policies". You have failed to reference a single one that supports the deletion of this article. (Whereas, in contrast, it can be shown that the content is both verifiable and not original research.) You've quoted one sentence that isn't by itself a reason for deletion, since the very next sentence, which you didn't quote, explains that the actual policy is the list that follows. Once again: Please read what the policy actually says. It is quite specific. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If this article was ever to be completed, a lot of information would be duplicated, and keeping both articles together would also eliminate the existing problem we have now; namely, each article has slightly different heights for some presidents. It should also be noted that 'Homework Help' is not a reliable source for presidential information (it says so on its homepage).--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas"><font color="blue">Nydas</font></a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk)</sup></font></a> 14:34, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unencyclopedic trivia. If kept, this would set a precedent for all List of &lt;X&gt; by &lt;physical attributes&gt;, X could be celebrities, sportsmen, serial killers, etc. Height is relevant for basketball players, high-jump athletics, etc., but not for most occupations.

<ul>
<li>Rubbish. "If article X then article Y." is a flawed argument, for obvious reasons, and deleting a verifiable, not original research, article X solely because it might "set a precedent" for article Y is an ill-founded idea. Articles don't set precedents for other articles. Our content and article policies determine what we include. This is an encyclopaedia, not a court. That <i>this</i> list is verifiable and not original research does <i>not</i> imply that "all Lists of &lt;X&gt; by &lt;physical attributes&gt;, X" are verifiable and not original research. Each individual such list must be treated on its merits and with regard to what sources are available and how they treat the subject. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree that this is an indiscriminate collection of information. I disagree with Uncle G, who implies that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">list of examples</a> of what is an indiscriminate collection of information is exhaustive.

<li>comment -- Ordinarily I would say this is silly, but given the various discussions that always erupt around election time about how height is a statistically significant factor in voter preference, it might be arguably useful. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 21:11, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Which is why <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_heights_of_United_States_presidential_candidates_fb65.html" title="List of heights of United States presidential candidates">List of heights of United States presidential candidates</a> is the superior article, since it discusses not only the heights of the winners but the heights of their opponents <i>and</i> the "taller equals winner" idea. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
