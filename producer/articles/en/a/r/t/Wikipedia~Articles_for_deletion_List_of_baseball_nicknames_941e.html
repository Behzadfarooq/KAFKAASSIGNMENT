<li><b>Keep</b> not inherently original research, I've certainly seen/read a lot of these nicknames used in legitimate publications. There's no requirement that every claim on Wikipedia be backed up with an inline citation or we delete the article... some of these are just obvious, like "The Tribe" for <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> "The Bronx Bombers" for the Yankees. Useful and interesting lists for sports fans.

<li>Yes, there is a requirement on Wikipedia for citations. See <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Also, I strongly disagree that "sports fans might like it" is a reason for keeping these articles.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 01:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is not a requirement that every line in an article have an inline citation this very minute. Never has been, never will be. It needs to be reasonably shown that sources do <b>exist</b>, that's the thing. If you think the Cleveland Indians have never been called "The Tribe" in print, for example, you obviously know very little about baseball <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=%22Cleveland+Indians%22+tribe&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=%22Cleveland+Indians%22+tribe&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 01:46, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a requirement for citations if the content might be considered dubious. Regardless, the article also has numerous POV issues, as it doesn't clarify how much a nickname has to be used in order for its inclusion into the list.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 03:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Luckily, there's an easy solution for that, we can just say "notable nicknames" and then follow the guidelines per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">WP:NOTABLE</a> on any that are controversial.

<li>'The article also has numerous POV issues, not just clean up ones. For example, how many times does a nickname have to be used in order for it to be considered an official nickname? Five times?

<ul>
<li>POV issues aern't a reason to delete, either. If you can turn on the radio/TV coverage of a baseball game and the announcers are using the nicknames without need for explanation (Big Red Machine, Tribe, Bronx Bombers, etc.) that's a pretty established nickname. There's no reason to suspect the article couldn't cover such information reliably. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Though I admit that not all POV issues are a reason to delete, <i>inherently</i> POV issues—such as in this case—are. Also, the article doesn't establish <i>how many times</i> must a nickname be used by TV/radio announcers in order for it to be considered an official nickname. After all, there are countless people in mainstream media who have made up <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a> to describe teams, and Wikipedia is certaintly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INFO" title="WP:NOT">not the place to indiscriminately record all of them</a>. --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 03:35, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm just talking about turning on a random radio/tv broadcast. There are certain nicknames recognizable to baseball fans. Maybe this is something you actually have to follow sports to understand, I dunno. But there's a difference between established nicknames and the silly stuff sports columnists make up as filler and is forgotten quickly. It's not really an inherent POV issue, it just involves needing to improve the article. Everything you've said boils down to a need to improve the article, not a reason to delete it. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:38, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But the thing is, since it's entirely subjective, there's no way for us to determine how popular a neologism needs to be in order for it to be considered an actual nickname instead of, as you put it, "silly stuff sports columnists make up". As such, by all means these lists <i>are</i> inherently POV.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 04:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps I was unclear. Having an <i>article</i> of a list of nicknames is unencyclopaedic and trivial. Incorporating those nicknames into articles is useful (when referenced) -- we just don't need a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminant and unverified list</a>. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 18:14, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As seen below, parts of the lists are already verified. As for indiscriminant, is there some other way that you would classify or list baseball teams besides the 32 MLB teams which would make it more discriminant? It seems that <i>indiscriminant</i> is too often used as <i>anything that I think is useless</i> in AFD discussions. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, it's very <i>relevant</i> information. Sports journalists constantly refer to teams and players by their nicknames. Also, for people who keep saying "indiscriminate" I gently encourage you to actually look up the meaning of the word "indiscriminate" in a dictionary. These lists are not it. These lists pass <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>, for 1) information and 2) navigation. The lists are easily verifiable and also notable as these nicknames are in constant use in sports journalism.

<li>These articles are a lyrics database? They're travel guides? That's the only kind of things the page you've mentioned says are not to be included... and the articles in question clearly aren't any of those 8 things.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've been going through the baseball article and adding references. There are about 20 now. I have to get back to real life, but I want to say, these nicknames are <i>incredibly</i> common. It's almost hard to find references because, for example, "Los Angeles" "Halos" returns over <b>1,000,000</b> hits on google, almost all of which are about the baseball team. Some of these nicknames even have books written about them -- about the actual nickname. There's an entire book about why the Dodgers are called the Boys of Summer. Also, I'm finding tons of non-trivial references such as "<a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/baseball/nicknames/010612.html" class="external text" title="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/baseball/nicknames/010612.html" rel="nofollow">ESPN's List of Best Baseball Nicknames of All Time</a>." As I do further research in this topic -- I'm not even interested in sports -- it's instantly obvious that sports nicknames are an integral part of sports culture and I'm changing my original vote to strong keep, and if not for the handful of delete votes, I'd change to speedy. These are blatantly valid lists. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 20:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
