<li><b>Keep.</b> If you people are going to continue using the useless and easily exploitable Alexa site to measure popularity, I'll never cease to question the competence of the Webcomics Wikipedia Staff. Also remember the comic is weekly and its statistics won't be as high as comics that update every single day. The comic has been online almost 4 years and has built up one of the larger archives compared to most weekly comics. Despite what Alexa tells you, GD is hardly an unknown, and even runs one of the most popular Oekaki sites online. He is more hard-working and knowledgable than most of the artists that are considered "noteable" on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 23:50, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Proposal B is totally out of order. What sort of notability is there here? Are we saying Wikipedia is a place where every comic which has been around for over 100 strips gains an article? What about bar room bands who have been around for a while. What about bloggers with 500 posts? Longevity as people seem to claim here, is not an instant claim to fame. Has this strip been mentioned anywhere outside the webcomic community? Has it received critical feedback and reviews from other respected journals/publications/magazines? Proposal B, just claims that if a webcomic exists, then it warrants an article. And people are agreeing? People have been attacking me from nominating webcomics, because of a personal dislike? This is totally incorrect, I was just pretty shocked when I saw the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> article at the amount of cruft that had been let in, which would have been deleted if it were any other category. Alexa is not definitive, that is easy to see, but to have a rank of over 1 million is pretty poor. Any reasonably popular webcomic would have a ranking a lot higher. With non webcomic websites, anything over 1 million would be deleted. How is this webcomic more notable than Fleetwood Back, a <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleetwood_Mac_e8b5.html" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> tribute band, who play local venues in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough.html" title="Scarborough">Scarborough</a>? It's time we changed the webcomic guidelines in line with other Wikipedia guidelines. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 16:44, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hahnchen, just because you haven't heard of GD or Our Home Planet in whatever little retarded circle of webcomics YOU pay attention to doesn't mean they're unimportant. And I find it really hard to believe that your opinion of Our Home Planet has nothing to do with this nomination. If Proposal B is going to be ignored from now on, throw Proposal A out to, for being completely USELESS. You're not getting the picture here. Alexa is not even a REMOTELY good source to measure website readership. Seeing you obsessively stick to it, despite a great number of people telling you why you shouldn't, makes you look like an ignorant little brat. INCIDENTALLY, GD recently changed its domain name to one <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=ourhomeplanet.net" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=ourhomeplanet.net" rel="nofollow">Alexa isn't even tracking yet,</a> which would make whatever number you're seeing even more wildly innacurate than normal. But since you seem to be ignoring every argument against you, it doesn't matter. The webcomic listing won't be fixed until it represents your narrow view of what's important.<br /></li>
<li>Come to think of it, what webcomics DO you read, Hahnchen? If your answer is "just Penny Arcade and Ctrl-Alt-Del", please do us all a favor and get out. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 00:42, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hi SuperHappy, I at least read a bunch of webcomics, including some of yours. That doesn't mean I think it's the purpose of this encyclopedia to list every webcomic in existence. We're trying to discuss the inclusion criteria on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> and come to some consensus, but swearing at someone who's trying to maintain some uniform standard of notability for <i>all</i> wikipedia articles (not just webcomics) isn't going to help. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 01:50, 10 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Haha... Fine, fine... swears have been edited. But let it be known that Hahnchen clearly knows nothing about webcomics, and seeing him beng allowed to assert so much authority on them is puzzling, to say the least. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperHappy_29db.html" title="User:SuperHappy">SuperHappy</a> 03:30, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think I understand why this debate is so divisive, and I'm trying to work to resolve it. I've written you a note about it on your talk page, SuperHappy. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 03:47, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Wow Superhappy, thanks for the character assassination. What does it matter what I read, what I eat and what I like? You have asserted no mention of notability anywhere in your arguments, apart from the size of its archive, and that GD is a hardworking guy. You've got the argument the wrong way round, I do not read Our Home Planet, but that is NOT the reason I nominated it. There are so many bands that I have never heard of or never listened to, and yet if theres a verifiable assertion of notability, I would not delete it. What the argument should be, is "Just because you're a fan of the comic, is that the reason it should be kept?" - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 14:40, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
