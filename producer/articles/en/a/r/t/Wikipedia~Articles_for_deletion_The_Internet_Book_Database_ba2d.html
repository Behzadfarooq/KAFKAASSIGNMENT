<li>The original Internet Book Database article (as you can see from that discussion) was written when the site was beta testing and has come a long way since then. The reason I vote for keep is that this is a significant effort for the book community unlike the earlier efforts mentioned above and does deserve mention in the Wikipedia. The site has nearly a 1000 inlinks from external sources(according to yahoo siteexplorer) and that is IMO a good achievement for a site whose domain was registered in Feb. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavenhelllord_de3a.html" title="User:Heavenhelllord">Heavenhelllord</a> 16:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not have a provision for "growing quickly". We get many, many articles whose authors argue that a subject is growing toward notability. The only question is whether the site <i>has achieved</i> notability. They may (or may not) be on their way there, but that's not the same thing as being there. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 16:18, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree, then. Alexa rank of 641K doesn't meet my standards of "large and significant", unless you want to argue we should create articles for the 640,000 websites more popular than this one. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just think that this website is notable because it has a larger collection of books and authors than other popular online book related websites. There are no book related websites that offer such a large listing of both fiction and non-fiction of all genres. There are no other sites that I know of that offer a combination book database/social networking aspect. There are other features unique to ibookdb such as finding other versions of books. The site is notable for it's content and usefulness to the book community. The forums are just a small part of everything that makes this site notable.<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavenhelllord_de3a.html" title="User:Heavenhelllord">Heavenhelllord</a> 19:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

By the way, I have nothing against these pages and wouldn't mind them sticking around if there's some justification, but the issue came up here: <a href="../../../b/o/o/Talk%7EBook_f1cc.html#The_Internet_Book_Database.3F" title="Talk:Book">Talk:Book#The_Internet_Book_Database.3F</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 19:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm the owner of the Internet Book Database so I will refrain from taking sides. However, this is fair - Delete one, delete them all. I did like the proposal to create one page about all the databases however.

<dd>Oh, come on guys. I <b>did not say a thing</b> about deleting the ibookdb.net article, all I was against is having a link to that article from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">Book</a> page because <b>that link</b> seemed pretty arbitrary to me, not the article itself. I personally think everything under moon can be and should be described in Wikipedia -- if nobody links to it, and nobody searches for it then what's the harm? A couple of bytes on hard-disk somewhere? <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaltsev_10cb.html" title="User:Amaltsev">Amaltsev</a> 20:12, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a blogging site. However since we now have so many contenders for a book database how about linking to a list of book databases from the Book article <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavenhelllord_de3a.html" title="User:Heavenhelllord">Heavenhelllord</a> 20:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That would be a reasonable compromise I think, useful to actual readers of Wikipedia. I can probably dig through my notes and add some more databases there if needed.

<li>I don't particularly agree with some of the stuff on notability here (e.g. - Alexa Rankings). There needs to be some overhaul of WP:WEB. I can undersand Wikipedia doesn't need an article on every website out there but the WP:WEB criteria are not exactly perfect and there are thousands of completely useless articles on Wikipedia, including some on sites that have no place here but somehow deleting these book database articles has taken priority. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeavenhelllord_de3a.html" title="User:Heavenhelllord">Heavenhelllord</a> 21:06, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> Although I said I didn't want to comment originally I'm in favour of keeping all for 4 reasons 1) Iblist has over 65 000 articles or equivelent on books, authors, and series making it more notable than some foreign language wikipedia sites but without any financial backing. 2) Once editor status is granted Iblist and IBDof are fully editable and are effectively wikis. 3) <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Pellegrino_7d19.html" title="Charles Pellegrino">Charles Pellegrino</a>, <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._E._Modesitt_c3c2.html" title="L.

<li><b>Merge</b>: I've started a merge into <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliographic_database.html" title="Bibliographic database">Bibliographic database</a>, and put merge tags into the articles, and one more.
