<p>Searching Google for the terms listed as "notable" for the gameplay does not result in any hits. Neither does the card game creator given by the article. Neither does the game's name itself.

<li><b>Keep Article</b> I can also verify that max-cards does exist and is infact a real game, I have played it regulalry with friends and although there aren't any sources on the article, i still think it should be kept as it is a less-well known game and being on wikipedia should give it a chance to become as big a game as whist or solitaire <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.152.127.69 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.152.127.69.html" title="User talk:82.152.127.69">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.152.127.69_69ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.152.127.69">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 82.152.127.6 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.152.127.69_69ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.152.127.69">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep Article</b> I too have played this game, but have not been able to find any sources to its origin or rules. However, i agree that if it is played by anybody, it should be on wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep Article</b> What a surprise I found when I logged onto wikipedia and found an old game from my childhood. Max Cards or as I knew it, Maximus Cards, was a huge craze at my secondary school. I too agree that if it is played or ever has been played by a significant amount of people, it should be on wikipedia. Although there are no written rules the basic principle is the same as the game I used to play.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I have played a good game of Max Cards many a time, although I was taught it under the name "Min cards" (obviously someone had a sense of humour!)I have never seen a rule book for Max Cards, but I am sure that, as demonstrated above, many people are aware of it's existence. I think it is time for Wikipedia to accept that concrete proof is not needed to confirm something that many people acknowledge exists, and is based on word of mouth. I would also like to make it clear that no card game I have ever played has equalled the skill and emotion involved in Max Cards. KEEP THIS ARTICLE!!! KEEP THE PAST ALIVE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS!!!

<li><b>Do not delete</b> i have used wikipedia regulalry for looking up things and researching areas, after reading some of the comments above about there not being any sources.

<li><b>Keep Article</b> People have rightly said that this has no verifiable sources, and that a google search draws a blank - but that does not mean that it doesn't exist! I have seen this played at a friends house, at the suggestion of someone who had played it at uni. The article matches pretty well with what I remember, this is the first time I have actually seen a complete set of rules (I have found variations but these are closer to standard solitaire than Max Cards). I appreciate that this wouldn't get into the Encylopaedia Britannica, but since Wikipedia prides itself on being user-edited, there is no reason to delete an article about a 'cult' card game which is causing no harm - and has finally let me understand why my friend kept shouting Full Levens at me!

<li><b>keep article</b> I have played this game (but called quick draw) in the past, it was a minor craze in my form at one point, it definitely is a real game i can assure you. I think just because it doesnt have any sources doesnt mean it should get automatic deletion, surely? So it might not be played by many people, but it obviously does exist, I've played it myself!! Who knows, perhaps more people might start playing it if the rules, etc, are left on here for other people to see. It really is a brilliant game, much less monotonous than many other card games I have played.
