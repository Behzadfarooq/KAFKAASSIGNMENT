<p>Note: This is not nonsense. I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the phrase, "Brick Monster" is used in the same way as this article discusses it. While some might consider the post to be stupid, publication must start somewhere. This is why I co-authored the article. If you do not believe that people actually discuss the brick monster, listen to this: over 120 UNC students on the popular website facebook.com believe in the brick monster, according to enrollment in the "groups" section of the page. This, of course, is a minimum number of students, because this is the number of people who clearly know there are groups for people who believe what they do. There could also be other people out there that do believe, but do not know that they are part of a larger group of people. Thank you, Matthew, Co-Author and UNC-Chapel Hill Student<small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 152.23.192.126 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_152.23.192.126_9b28.html" title="Special:Contributions/152.23.192.126">contribs</a>) 22:31, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment (again)</b>, Facebook has tons of usergroups with hundreds of members. Joining one doesn't mean that they all believe in the same thing; it is like myspace where some people join just for the fun of it or to have a zillion group listings on your profile. While I consider this article to be nonsense, there is always the avenue of trying to include "popular" (yes, this is probably POV dangerous) facebook groups on the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> article. My 5 cents. <a href="../../../j/a/w/User%7EJawz_e830.html" title="User:Jawz">Jawz</a> 04:49, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>just because Facebook has a popular group doesn't mean the article is notable for its own article on Wiki.</p>
<p>You are correct. A Facebook comment or group may not be justification for the article, but in the same right, Wiki has an article about the Flying Spagetti Monster. Belief in "pastafarianism" has no basis in reality. Does it make it wrong for the author of that article to have posted it. How about Christianity? The religion has basis in fact, in the sense that we know a man existed and was executed by Roman guards. Other than that, there is more faith in it than there is fact. Should we then delete all references to Christianity? How about other religions. When you start drawing lines, they better be concrete and for good reason. I challenge you to find many differences between a belief in a "Brick Monster" and any mainstream religion's belief in a G-d or pantheon of gods. <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 52.23.192.126 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_52.23.192.126_dd12.html" title="Special:Contributions/52.23.192.126">contribs</a>) 23:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Thank you for restoring the comments that were deleted. The original AfD Discussion was not deleted by either myself or my co-author, Nidiron. I understand the concern that this page is not valid, but the concern seems based in illogical thought patterns. If people can put articles about religions, spoof religions (i.e. Flying Spagetti Monsterism), or general beliefs, this article should be allowed on precedent. Looking into the situation further, the article clearly states that there are multiple theories behind the idea of the Brick Monster, and one of these ideas is that it is not real. If you have suggestions about changing the entry, I would be happy to take any advice you might be willing to give, discuss it with my co-author, and correct any basic problems. It falls into the "legend or myth" idea, I suppose. I would gladly make comment at the beginning. This would allow people to look up what a "Brick Monster" is, but it would let them know that the actual existance of such a creature is actually under debate. --Mneidich 07:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
